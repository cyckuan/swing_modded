<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A large number of Tajik
refugees will begin returning home from Turkmenistan next week,
the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in Dushanbe, capital of Turkmenistan, after
a meeting of the Tajik government, the Tajik National
Reconciliation Commission and the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The International Organization for Migration has registered
2,500 Tajik refugees who would like to return home, the National
Reconciliation Commission spokesman Yusuf Khakimov said.

other member nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of Tajik refugees from Afghanistan has been

<HEADLINE> France Denounces Israeli Law on Census in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- France on Thursday backed a plan
by Palestinians to make a census of the Arab population in East
Jerusalem and denounced an Israeli move to block the census.
</P>
<P>
The French position, made clear by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret, was in response to a law adopted by the
Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to ban the population count.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that a law of circumstance voted in haste by the
Knesset to ban these operations is a new unilateral gesture
intending to impose a fait accompli," said Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem in
the 1967 Middle East War has never been recognized by the world
community.
</P>
<P>
"The status of East Jerusalem will be fixed in terms of the
peace process. It is demanded of all sides not to do anything
which could jeopardize the existing status quo," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the planned census, "It is a good thing," the
spokeswoman said. "It is useful and legitimate to know the reality
of the demography of the Palestinian population in the territory."
</P>
<P>
The Knesset voted 23 for and 11 against in a rarely used
limited procedure on Wednesday to adopt the law banning the census
by Palestinians, at the demand of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to "preserve the Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
It took place at the same time when thousands of Palestinian
agents began a nationwide census, the first of its kind in 30
years.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNFICYP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for another period
of six months until June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan said the
situation in Cyprus was calmer than in the preceding six months,
but the overall situation continued to be marked by tension.
</P>
<P>
He said he had appealed to both sides, as well as to Greece and
Turkey, to refrain form actions that could raise tension and
negative effect on efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said it was disappointing that after more than one
year of intensive discussion, the package of reciprocal measures
proposed by UNFICYP to reduce tension along the ceasefire lines
had still not been put in place, despite the Security Council's
repeated calls that the two sides should accept it without delay
or preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the presence of UNFICYP on the island remained
indispensable in order to maintain the ceasefire between the two
sides, which was a prerequisite for achieving the settlement of
the Cyprus question sought by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when troops
from Turkey occupies the north of the island in response to coup
in Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Pick Up Slightly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales in
November rose a lackluster 0.2 percent despite healthy growth at
clothing shops and furniture stores, the Commerce Department said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The disappointing monthly gains, to a seasonally adjusted 213.8
billion U.S. dollars, followed drops of 0.2 percent in October and
0.3 percent in September, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released today, the Labor Department said
new applications for unemployment benefits fell 13,000 to 311,000
last week after increasing by 20,000 during the last week of
November. Both figures were in the range economists say shows
strong demand for labor.
</P>
<P>
The lowest unemployment rate in 24 years has retained claims
low, and income gains outpacing inflation have supported retail
sales this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the retail sales in November were not quite as dismal
as portrayed in recent months from August to October. Besides,
November's sales were up 3.8 percent as compared with a year
earlier,.
</P>
<P>
But it was noticed that consumer spending has been shifting
recently from retail goods toward services such as travel because
ebbing demand for expensive appliances and electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Clothing and accessory stores reported an impressive
performance in November, with sales rising 1.2 percent. Furniture
and home furnishings sold well, too. Their sales jumped 1.3
percent. Both were the biggest increases in five months.
</P>
<P>
However, department store sales inched only 0.1 percent higher
and auto dealers' receipts increased just 0.2 percent after
sizable drops during the two previous months.
</P>
<P>
Sales of building materials, hardware and garden supplies fell
0.8 percent. Sales also declined at gas stations and restaurants
and bars.
</P>
<P>
Retail spending is regarded as a barometer of the country's
economic vigor. The U.S. consumers buy roughly two-thirds of the
nation's economic output and retail sales represents about half of
that.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Clear-cut Muslim Attitude Towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has called on the Muslim leaders to adopt a practical and
clear-cut attitude towards Israeli and the U.S. policies of
"tyranny oppression, exploitation and usurpation in the world."
</P>
<P>
This came in a message sent by the Iraqi president to the
on-going eighth summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference
here.
</P>
<P>
"Those (leaders) who represent the conscience of their peoples
should have such an attitude, which should be in deeds, not in
words," Saddam said in his message available to the summit today.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the use of such meetings would remain a mere
reminding for those who forget that we are an Islamic nation, but
we are in fact far from Islam," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saddam himself did not show up at the summit and the Iraqi
delegation is led by Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> Labor Meeting Calls For Protection of Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Representatives to a regional
meeting of the International Labor Organization today urged the
organization to make a strong response to minimize the adverse
effects of the current financial crisis in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In a document entitled "Conclusions" adopted here today at the
end of the three-day 12th ILO Asian regional meeting, participants
called on the organization to take immediate steps on training and
redeployment of displaced workers and protection of women,
migrants and other groups which may be especially adversely
affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including government ministers and officials,
employer and worker representatives from Asian countries and
regions, stressed that employment should be promoted through sound
enterprise development strategies, investment in human resources
and a business environment which is conducive to sustained
enterprise competitiveness in a rapidly-changing global economy.
</P>
<P>
The document said that despite economic progress, two-thirds of
the world's poor live in Asia. While some countries in the region
have experienced a prolonged period of exceptionally high economic
growth resulting in the reduction of the poverty, strong
employment growth and increased real wages, serious unemployment
and underemployment problems afflict many Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The document said, "poverty alleviation remains a major
challenge for many Asian countries. Unemployment and low returns
to labor lead to poverty. The Asian experience suggests that the
pace of poverty alleviation depends on the employment-intensity of
growth. Macroeconomic policies therefore need to ensure that
growth generates employment. National anti-poverty strategies,
established in consultation with the social partners, should be an
important feature of overall economic policies."
</P>
<P>
It said labor migration is currently associated with a number
of undesirable features such as clandestine and illegal migration,
unsatisfactory conditions of work and lack of protection for
migrant workers. Policies are needed in both sending and receiving
countries to deal effectively with regulation of labor flows and
protection of the rights of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
The document also called on protection of the rights of women
and children.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Tightens Control Over Budget Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday signed a decree to ensure stable budget spending and cut
the debts of budget-financed organizations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin signed the document at the Barvikha sanatorium near
Moscow, where he was receiving treatment on his acute respiratory
illness, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decree would be submitted to the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, for approval before March 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the administrative measure, an unspecified number of
federal organizations would close down and their administrators
would be responsible for sticking to spending limits.
</P>
<P>
The money thus saved would be used to fulfill the government's
obligations, but the decree did not say where the money would go.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government would suggest cutting back on the
number of federal officials entitled to use communications and
transport means funded with tax-payer's money.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's latest move to tighten the belt on budget funding was
believed to be prompted by the International Monetary Fund's (IMF)
decision to suspend releasing big loans to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, based in Washington, the United States, cited Russia's
inefficiency in tax collection and the federal government's wage
arrears as two of its reasons for the decision.

<P>
NEW YORK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- American companies are
finding ways to speed up the clearance of medical bills. The
chip-embeded electronic card is one way to it.
</P>
<P>
The initiative by several technology companies -- including
MCI and Digital Equipment -- offers what is called "smart card,"
which looks like a credit card.
</P>
<P>
Insurers and managed care companies would give enrollees a
card containing their coverage information. The technology
consortium would lease computers and software to doctors,
hospitals and other health providers, according to a report of
the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
Payment processing would start with a swipe of the card in a
doctor's office. Patients would see what their insurance will pay
before leaving.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the 3.7 billion medical bills issued each
year in the country are already processed electronically. Even so,
it said, insurers take an average of a month to pay. About 30
percent of claims must be refiled or reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The new service would not be available until March or April,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Raise VAT to Bail Out Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament passed a
law Thursday to raise Germany's value added tax (VAT) to 16
percent from the current level of 15 percent in order to finance
the country's pension system.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, pension contributions would have to increase to 21
percent of gross wages from the current level of 20.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move could help prevent the cost of doing business in
Germany from running further higher for companies, which suffer
huge pension payment bill as the German population ages.
</P>
<P>
But the VAT increase has drawn protests from the German
retailers, who termed it as the "poison for consumption", killing
their hope for the coming year after five years of recession.
</P>
<P>
The VAT rise will take effect on April 1, 1998. It is noted
that however, the reduced VAT rate of seven percent for food and
essentials will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good result," Norbert Bluem, the minister for social
affairs, thus commented the deal reached during overnight talks
between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right government and the
leftist opposition Social Democrats (SPD).
</P>
<P>
The SPD is capable of vetoing much of the government's domestic
legislation with the majority they enjoy in the upper house of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government and the SPD also agreed to slow down
liberalization of the German postal service.
</P>
<P>
Under an amended bill on post office privatization endorsed
today, the state-run post office will keep its monopoly on
delivery of letters weighing up to 200 grams and on mass mailings
in which individual letters weigh up to 50 grams for another five
years.
</P>
<P>
A regulatory agency will be set up to consider whether the post
office monopoly should be extended beyond the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the private firms will not be allowed to transport
mails, if their employees do not enjoy the full German social
welfare package.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Postal Customers Federation criticized the bill as
harming competition.

<HEADLINE> China Investigates Printing Paper Anti-Dumping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China has officially decided
to investigate the illegal dumping of foreign printing papers
from the United States, Canada and the Republic of Korea on the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The case, reportedly the first China has filed concerning the
dumping of foreign exports on the Chinese market, is designed to
use legal means to protect the rights and interests of relevant
domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement released today by the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), the investigation
will be carried out by the MOFTEC and the General Administration
of Customs in accordance with the regulations of the
People's Republic of China governing anti-dumping.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission, in cooperation with
relevant State Council departments, will investigate the extent
of damage the dumping of the imported prining papers have caused
on the domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping investigation involves printing papers
carrying specifications of 45 grams, 46 grams and 48.8 grams per
square meter and widths of 781 mm, 787 mm, 762 mm and 1562 mm. The
said papers carry the tariff number 48010000.
</P>
<P>
A MOFTEC spokesman said that China's anti-dumping
investigation will be carried out in strict accordance with
international standards.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Trade Organization has sanctioned
anti-dumping investigations and prosecutions as a legal means for
preventing unfair competition resulting from the dumping of
imports.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said China has adopted the following three
principles for conducting the investigation:
</P>
<P>
-- protecting the order of foreign trade and business and
opposing unfair trading activities in line with China's foreign
trade laws and regulations governing anti-dumping and
anti-subsidies;
</P>
<P>
-- preventing domestic industrial sectors from sustaining
damage resulting from the dumping of foreign products, and
protecting their legitimate rights and interests by using foreign
legislations and practices; and
</P>
<P>
-- adjudicating the case according to the facts and laws.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that China will levy taxes in line with
anti-dumping and anti-subsidies regulations if the final results
of the investigation prove that the foreign printing paper was
illegally dumped and has caused damage to the Chinese domestic
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The MOFTEC and the State Economic and Trade Commission will offer
proposals according to the outcome of the anti-dumping
investigation. The anti-dumping tax will be determined by the State
Council and executed by the General Administration of Customs.

<HEADLINE> Financial Sector's Contribution to UK Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) - The economic contribution of the
UK financial sector has increased over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1996, output of the financial sector increased
by 43 percent (3.6 percent per year), nearly double the overall
23 percent growth in the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
The sector makes an increasingly important contribution to the
UK economy accounting for 7 percent of GDP, Jeremy Seddon,
Director-General of British Invisibles (BI) told foreign
correspondents based here today.
</P>
<P>
Net overseas earnings of the the sector reached a record 22.7
billion pounds (36.32 billion US dollars) in 1996, 2 billion
pounds (3.2 billion US dollars) higher than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Seddon said, the reduction in the current account deficit to
435 million pounds (696 million US dollars) in 1996 was more than
accounted for by an increase of 4.3 billion pounds (6.88 billion
US dollars) to 12.2 billion pounds (19.52 billion US dollars) in
the surplus on invisibles.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector encompasses banking, insurance and fund
management, venture capital, pension funds, unit and investment
trusts and derivatives.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results, Duncan McKenzie, BI's Economic
Adviser said: "Financial services are increasingly important to
both the UK and world economy, and the UK is well positioned to
build on its present strengths."

<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Most European and US
multinational companies with business in Asia still maintain their
faith in the region after the recent currency turmoil there, the
Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey of 35 large multinationals by Renaissance
Technomic, a US management consultants, the newspaper said that 79
percent were not planning to change their strategy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The survey of companies operating in Asia found that only about
15 percent felt significantly worse off because of the regional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 percent foresaw stronger sales next year and the same
proportion expected increased rates of return. A small group felt
themselves in a stronger position post-crisis.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers with local factories felt the devalued currencies
offered opportunities to integrate their operations further
through the buyout of dealers or the purchase of greater stakes in
joint venture partners.
</P>
<P>
Exporters expected that the devalued currencies would lead to
increased shipments, offsetting tighter margins.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Ends "Good" Meeting with Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said he had a good meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
at the Downing Street early this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the historic talks in Blair's residence, Adams
told reporters: "We had a good meeting because we engaged. I think
we faced up to the difficulties. In many ways the engagement can be
described as a moment in history."
</P>
<P>
He also said he looked forward to "a new relationship based on
ties of friendship" between him and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, a reward to Sinn Fein for IRA's ceasefire in July,
was the first between a British prime minister and a Northern
Ireland Republican movement leader over the past 76 years.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), the largest nationalist paramilitary organization in
Northern Ireland, which has been fighting to end the British rule
of the divided province over the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
Before having the meeting with Blair, Adams said this morning
his goals at the meeting were to achieve a lasting peace in
Northern Ireland and a commitment from Blair that he would coax
pro-British Protestant Unionists towards a deal for the province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has draw widespread criticism from Northern
Ireland's pro-British Protestant community, which fear the
government might agree to a united Ireland and an end of British
rule of Northern Ireland.

TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Islamic leaders from across
the world ended their eighth summit here today after adopting a
final declaration pledging to promote Islamic solidarity and
condemning Israel's occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The leaders prolonged their meeting to debate the five-page,
strongly-worded Tehran Declaration, and decide the venue for
their next meeting, at the end of the three-day summit Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by delegates from 54 members of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), including more than
30 heads of state, vice presidents, crown princes and prime
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian and
other Arab territories including Al-Qods (Jerusalem), the Syrian
Golan Heights and South Lebanon, the declaration called for the
liberation of all occupied lands and restoration of Palestinian
rights to self-determination and to an independent and sovereign
state with Jerusalem as its capital.

<P>
It condemned the Israel's expansionist policies and practices
-- like the establishment and expansion of Jewish settlements, and

city of Jerusalem.

The Islamic leaders demanded Israel desist from state
terrorism, join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and put all
its nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency
safeguards in order to make the Middle East a region free of
nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The declaration pledged full support for inter-Afghan dialog,
formation of a broad-based government, and activities to stop the
bloodshed and to establish lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
It strikes a distinction between terrorism and people's right
to fight against foreign occupation for
self-determination. Efforts should be intensified to combat
terrorism in all its forms, it said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders expressed solidarity with the Muslims of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and called for rejection of the aggression of Armenia
against Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
They called for safeguarding the Islamic values and principles,
the revival of Islamic civilization, and its peaceful conexistence
with other civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders emphasized that the goal of establishment of
Islamic common market constitutes a significant step towards
strengthening Islamic solidarity and enhancing the share of
Islamic world in global trade.
</P>
<P>
The declaration deemed "null and void" the U.S. D'Amato Law,
which blocks companies to do business with Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also decided that the next Islamic summit will be
held in Doha, capital of Qatar in the year 2000, according to
official sources. Iran will be the president of the Islamic body
for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the summit approved all the 142 resolutions
drafted by their senior officials and endorsed at the foreign
ministers' meeting days ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 leaders delivered speeches at the three-day summit
with the theme of "dignity, dialog and participation". It is the

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli PM Supports Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's former prime minister
Shimon Peres said here today that the Palestinians should have an
independent state, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Both the Jews and the Palestinians should have their own
independent states, and this will prevent clashes between the two
sides, Peres told reporters after a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Israeli people support peace (with the
Palestinians)," and what they are divided over is "the price they
have to pay for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the promise made by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to realize peace at the lowest cost has proven
wrong.
</P>
<P>
Peres arrived here this morning for a lightning visit, during
which he discussed with Mubarak chances for the success of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt as a key player in bringing Palestinian and
Israeli viewpoints closer has always offered fresh ideas on
advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres, now a Knesset (parliament) member from the opposition
Labor Party, said the need for peace inside Israel is very clear
and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat has
done a lot in this respect.

<HEADLINE> African Refugees Decrease in Last Three Years, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The African refugee
problem has been eased in the last two or three years,said the
visiting United Nations Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees
Sergio Vierira said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the UNHCR regional liaison
office here this evening, De Mello, who is also U.N.
Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, said the number
of African refugees have decreased in recent years due to
repatiation plans in Mozambique and Zaire as well as the
repatriation of 2.3 million Rwandese refugees in 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
Vierira disclosed that the UNHCR is operating in Liberia for the
repatriation of Liberian refugees which started in December 1997.
100,000 Burundi refugees will be repatriated soon and Sahel
refugees will be repatriated in 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, at the same time there remain very seriously
refugee problems in Somalia, Sudan, Sierra Leone and Angola. The
refugee problem in Angola has not been solved because of the
delay of implementation of the agreement of Lusaka, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the refugees situation in Ethiopia, De Mello said over
100,000 Ethiopians who took refuge in neighbouring countries have
returned home over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the repatriation of some 20,000 Ethiopian
refugees in neighbouring Sudan will be completed in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is home to close 350,000 Somali and Sudanese
refugees, he said, adding that efforts are underway to repatriate
these refugees to their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
De Mello arrived here Tuesday. He has discussed with senior
Ethiopian government officials, and officials from the
Organizaiton of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) on refugee and humanitarian
issues in Aafrica.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics issued by the UNHCR, at the January 1,
1997, Africa has 4,341,000 refugees and 2,058,000 internal
displaced people. The largest refugee producing African countries

LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth bid
an emotional farewell to the Royal Yacht Britannia during a
ceremony at Portsmouth port in southern England today.
</P>
<P>
She appeared close to tears as the yacht's Royal Marines band
marked the official end of 44 years' service. Earlier the queen
toured the vessel accompanied by 13 other members of the Royal
family.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the ship's crew, she said: "It is with sadness
that we must now say goodbye to Britannia. We can all reflect with
pride and gratitude upon this great ship." The 6,000-ton ship has
ferried her all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Several members of the royal family wore naval uniforms for the
decommissioning ceremony, including the queen's husband Prince
Philip, her sons Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, and her
daughter Princess Anne. The Royal Marines band beat the retreat
playing "Rule Britannia".
</P>
<P>
The elegant Britannia has sailed more than one million sea
miles, the equivalent of more than 40 times round the world. Its
last major voyage was to Hong Kong at the end of June when Britain
transferred the sovereignty of Hong Kong back to China.

called upon those Islamic states which have embarked on the
establishment of relations with Israel to reconsider their stance

<P>
This came in a written statement distributed today in the

political and national rights under the umbrella of just and
comprehensive peace on the basis of international legitimacy and
in line with the pledges and agreements approved in Madrid, Oslo
and Washington, he added.
</P>
<P>
"But the process has been stalled on all tracks as a result of
intransigence of the present Israeli government, completely
avoiding or abandoning its vowed commitments, and, instead,
proceeding to build settlements in the occupied Arab territories,
particularly in holy Jerusalem," said the king.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the OIC should adopt a decisive and
appropriate stance to challenge such intransigence obstructing the
activation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the international community to shoulder its
responsibility in siding against any measure that jeopardizes the
legitimate Arab and Islamic rights.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the economic dimension of Islamic solidarity,
King Hassan II said the OIC ought to give vital attention to the
economic dimension as an integral part of the organization's
efforts to create a mechanism that will prompt openness among
Islamic countries commercially and economically.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that such openness will always be one of the
strongest factors that prompt actual contacts and rapprochement,
and will create common interest among the OIC states, especially
in the existing global climate where economic blocs and
globalization are increasingly growing.

<HEADLINE> Germany Backs Gradual EU Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany made clear Thursday that
it supports the European Commission design for a gradual
enlargement of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In a government statement made one day before the EU
enlargement summit in Luxembourg, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
stressed the planned EU expansion should proceed "step by step" to
avoid putting too much strain on the Union.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has proposed to start entry talks with
the five East European countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, and Slovenia, as well as with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The six other applicants: Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania,
Slovakia and Turkey, have been regarded not yet politically and
economically ready for admission talks.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel meanwhile stressed the expansion process should not lead
to new rifts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The signal from Luxembourg must be: All eleven candidates...
have a clear perspective of admission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also reiterated Bonn's position against including Turkey
in the first-wave membership negotiations, saying it has not yet
met the prerequisite for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Germany supports Turkey joining EU later, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Educational Program Receives Extra Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament and
education ministers from the 15 EU countries have agreed to grant
a complementary 70 million ECUs (about 85 million U.S. dollars) to
Socrates, the EU's action program in the field of education.
</P>
<P>
The grant, which was approved Wednesday, will cover 1998 and
1999, the two years Socrates has left to run, the European
Commission, the EU's executive body, said in a press release
issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said the decision followed the agreement the
ministers and the European Parliament reached on November 27
regarding the overall EU budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It's a real Christmas present for all the schools and
universities, students, pupils and teachers who have worked so
hard to strengthen the European dimension in the education systems
of the 18 countries taking part in the program," said Ms. Edith
Cresson, EU commissioner for research, education and youth.
</P>
<P>
She added that education and training constituted a sector
which should receive priority attention "as a key instrument for
the future of the Union."
</P>
<P>
But she also said that the extra funding only amounted to an
increase of 20 percent per year compared with the current
situation. "It is by no means a luxury," said the commissioner,
adding that the total budget available was far from meeting
demand for participation in Socrates.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Socrates provided support for no less than 100,000
students, allowing them to spend time studying abroad in the EU,
and for nearly 10,000 schools participating in European
educational projects.
</P>
<P>
The Socrates also provided for some 40,000 young people
undertaking exchanges to improve language skills in the EU in the
year of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Abidjan to Host First ECOWAS Tourism Fair Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has decided to hold its first tourism and
leisure fair next April in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the 42nd session of the ECOWAS
Council of Ministers meeting that ended on Wednesday night in
Abuja, the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided that the promotion of inter-regional
tourism would not only attract foreign exchange, but also hasten
regional integration, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that the second ECOWAS trade fair
would be hosted by Ghana in 1999, for which the ministers
approved a fund of 74,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministers ended their meeting with a call on member
countries to ratify the protocol on community levy before the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The levy was agreed upon during the 19th ECOWAS summit of
heads of state in July 1996, as a solution to the community's
serious financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was expected to go into force early this year but
so far only Burkina Faso, Guinea and Togo have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged member countries to include the levy in
their 1998 budget, as was provided by the 20th ECOWAS summit of
heads of state in Abuja last August.
</P>
<P>
The ministers approved the establishment of a court of justice
which aggrieved member countries and citizens who feel their
rights have violated could resort to.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to revive the Committee of ECOWAS
Ambassadors so that the ambassadors can play a role in
facilitating contact with respective countries.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Denounces Israel's Ban on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
voiced deep resentment over the newly-adopted Israeli Knesset
(parliament) bill preventing the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) from carrying out a census of Palestinian nationals in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Such a decision is illegal and invalid as Arab Jerusalem has
been occupied by Israel since 1967," AL Spokesman Talaat Hammad
was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the League's full support for the Palestinian people
and the PNA in all the measures, including the census, adopted on
the way towards the establishment of a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
After a long-time debate, the Israeli parliament at midnight
Wednesday adopted a bill blocking Palestinian census-takers from
operating in Jerusalem, arguing that the Palestinians'
unprecedented move would undermine Israel's claim to the disputed
city which it captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israel also fears that a reliable census would give the
Palestinians an edge in future negotiations on the status of the
city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have suggested that the census be conducted in
East Jerusalem which they claim as a future capital. An estimated
180,000 Palestinians live there.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said today it will carry out the census as planned, but
only through fax contacts in view of Israel's ban on such a move.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Astonished at Jordan's Ouster of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said today that it is
astonished that Jordan has decided to expel Iraqi diplomats in
retaliation for its execution of four Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, a spokesman of Iraqi Foreign Ministry
said each country has its own jurisdiction, and that Jordan has
the knowledge through previous Iraqi memorandums that organized
smuggling from and to Iraq is a crime, of which the punishment is
execution according to Iraqi law.
</P>
<P>
He said that crimes of smuggling and economic sabotage are
great dangers to Iraq under the oil embargo imposed by the United
Nations in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq executed four Jordanians Monday on charge of smuggling car
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Wednesday issued a statement to condemn Iraq's execution
of four students, and demanded seven Iraqi diplomats leave the
kingdom within a week.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that the four Jordanians had been
assisted by their accomplices both in Iraq and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He identified the four executed as vehicle drivers, all above 30
years old, and members of an organized gang, rather than innocent
young students as Jordan said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that the Iraqi people cherish
deep love for the Jordanian people and appreciate their genuine
Arab positions towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Iraq's hopes that Jordan will show understandings
to Iraq in dealing with the issue and not allow it to be exploited
to jeopardize the deep-rooted, honest and useful bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Taxi Drivers Stage Massive Protest in Tel Aviv </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of taxi drivers of
Tel Aviv today staged a demonstration to protest the government's
plans to lower prices for taxi permits, causing massive traffic
jams in the city, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the demonstrating drivers blocked major
intersections of the city with their cars for several hours and
caused severe traffic disruptions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Transportation Ministry decided early this month to
lower prices for taxi permit from 60,000 U.S. dollars to 56,000
dollars. Moreover, the sum for the permits is to be reduced
annually by five percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials said that the change is intended to meet
the growing demand for taxis and ease the plight of passengers,
who often waste a great deal of time waiting for a taxi.
</P>
<P>
But Avraham Farid, chairman of the Association of Taxi
Drivers, contended that the change could result in doubling the
number of taxis on the road and would ruin the industry.
</P>
<P>
Farid said that if the demonstrations, which had been held in
Jerusalem Wednesday and will be held in Haifa Friday, have no
effect, the drivers would consider other measures, including a
taxi strike, next week.

the donor community in response to its call made in December last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here by the Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia, the donor

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliament Denounces Iraq's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's House of
Representatives today issued a statement, strongly denouncing and
deploring the Monday execution of four Jordanian students by Iraq
on charge of smuggling car spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after the Jordanian government
ordered the expulsion of seven Iraqi diplomats Wednesday in
retaliation of the execution and made efforts to prevent Iraq from
executing the fifth Jordanian.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced the execution as "inhuman and unjust,"
insisting that it constitutes "a flagrant violation" of
international legitimacy and human rights, official Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
The execution also contradicted with the principles of good
neighborliness and brotherly ties, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
All the 80 members of the newly-elected House of
Representatives feel bewildered with the execution as it came at
a time when Jordan is making effort for the lifting of the United
Nations sanctions on Iraq, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani Wednesday summoned Iraqi
Ambassador Nouri Elwayess, telling him that seven of the
embassy's staff members should leave Amman in a week and urging
him to save the fifth Jordanian to be executed by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan has recalled its charge d'affaires in
Baghdad Adel Sweidan back home for consultation. Other Jordanian
officials said that the government will adopt more actions later
at proper times.
</P>
<P>
Previous statements released by the government and the Senate
said it is an "unjust" decision to execute the Jordanians on
charge of smuggling auto spare parts worth only 620 Jordanian
dinars (878 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statements insisted that the Jordanians should only be
punished with fine or prison term even if the charge is proved to
be true.
</P>
<P>
Semi-official Jordan Times today quoted an unnamed senior
government official as saying that the executed four were seized
in January 1996, released on bail in March this year, then called
back for trial in April and sentenced to death in September.
</P>
<P>
Car parts and many other goods are in short supply in Iraq,
which has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 100 Jordanian prisoners serving their
sentences in jails across Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
1990-91 Gulf Crisis. But after that, bilateral ties suffered a
setback as Jordan distanced itself away from Iraq to end
international alienation.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties have been picking up in recent years as Iraq
began to provide the kingdom with more oil at discount prices and
kept increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a main supplier of humanitarian goods for Baghdad
under the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal.

<HEADLINE> Clan Clashes Renewed in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- After a day of calmness,
the Somali capital of Mogadishu was today once again caught in
bitter clashes between the country's two rival groups.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which is still going on in north Mogadishu,
started in the densely populated area known as Manobolyo where
according to eyewitnesses widespread looting also occurred.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said the worst affected area is the main
Manobolyo market where several stores, shops and kiosks were
looted by angry militiamen. The eyewitnesses also said there has
been quite a number of civilian deaths in the market, but no
exact figure was available at this early stage of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Also, the residence of Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the north
Mogadishu faction, has been under attack by one of the fighting
groups.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's security men belonging to one of the two rival
sides tried to defend the house in their last efforts. Ali
Mahdi's house seem to be isolated from all sides by rival
militiamen who blocked all roads leading to the house.
</P>
<P>
Houses belonging to well known and wealthy people have been
attacked and looted during the first stage of fighting early in
the afternoon and the militiamen also killed some of the
occupants, according to the eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the residence of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh
Mujhidin, north Mogadishu's former religious leader, was also
attacked in an attempt to reduce the pressure on Ali Mahdi's
residence.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of deaths were reported in north Mogadishu while
several vehicles including a land cruiser hired by the European
Union office in Mogadishu were looted. All streets in north
Mogadishu are now deserted with road blocks everywhere, except
some freelance looters who are busy collecting their booties in
the deserted business areas.
</P>
<P>
The fighting started at a time when a negotiation was
undergoing between the two groups who were fighting only a day
earlier in north Mogadishu, resulting in seven people killed.
</P>
<P>
Report said today's fighting broke out when four militiamen
kidnapped and shot dead one of the rival militiamen in Manobolyo
area, which angered the other side.
</P>
<P>
The clashes will further deteriorate the already poor security
situation in north Mogadishu, which has caused the evacuation of
several international aid agencies from the Somali capital.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Civil Servants Hold Strike for Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish civil servants staged
a nationwide strike today against insufficient wages, the Anatolia
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that about half a million people took part in
the strike, which paralyzed urban traffic, closed schools and shut
markets and offices.
</P>
<P>
Some protest rallies were held in the major cities, but no
serious clashes have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants claimed that their wages are not enough to
support their families due to the high living expenses.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent decision by the government, civil
servants' wages will be increased by 30 percent in the first half
of next year when the annual inflation rate is estimated at 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government, however, argues that rises of wages
would further stimulate the soaring inflation, making the
country's financial situation more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Today's strike was organized by the Confederation of Civil
Servants' Unions, which groups 1.8 million members throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The protesters said that they want to negotiate with the
government on the wage issue.
</P>
<P>
Most of the strikers will resume their work Friday but
railroad workers will stop their protest Saturday, organizers
said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Concerned Over Demobilized Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- SADC today expressed concern
over the increasing number of demobilized soldiers in the region,
saying they could become a source of instability if they are not
quickly integrated into society.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Kaire Mbuende, executive secretary of the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), when he briefed the
press here following a one-day SADC and European Union (EU) joint
committee meeting for senior officials, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said a number of ex-war combatants could easily resort
to criminal activities for their livelihood if nothing is done to
integrate them into society.
</P>
<P>
A large number of soldiers in southern Africa have been
demobilized after the member states won independence in the 1980s
and peace process began in the past few years in some countries
that has long been beset by civil wars.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC will undertake an assessment to determine the
requirement of member states, especially Angola, Mozambique,
Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende called for external support in financial terms because
the amount of resources required for the program is beyond the
reach of the 14 member states.
</P>
<P>
During the news briefing, Mbuende lamented that there has been
a drop in the amount of aid flow to SADC with more emphasis being
placed on trade investment by the donor community.
</P>
<P>
He also urged EU to use its political influence to lobby for
debt reduction so that the region can concentrate its resources
on economic development.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Promises Food Relief to Needy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government today
promised to provide food relief for those facing food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Vice president Christon Tembo said the government will ensure
that all the 32 districts currently in need of food are catered
for and that no one dies of hunger.
</P>
<P>
Addressing farmers on Kanakantapa resettlement scheme in
Chongwe district near Lusaka, Tembo challenged the farmers to
diversify and produce enough food for their families as well as
the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
Food security in the country will only be achieved if farmers
grow enough to serve the nation apart from their own consumption,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Such resettlement schemes are the only hope for the workers
who will lose their jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
More people are likely to lose their jobs as the country
enters the 21st century and they will need some places to settle
down and earn a living, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, a local official said the poor roads in
the area have adversely affected farming in the area.
</P>
<P>
The roads are so bad, he said, that motorists who can
transport their produce to the market shun the place.

<P>
ANKARA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops
killed 17 rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in
recent operations in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a statement issued by the Emergency Rule
Regional Governor's Office as saying that these militants were
wiped out in the provinces of Bingol, Batman and Siirt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two rebels surrendered to the authorities during
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's F-4, F-5 jets and Cobra armed helicopters bombed
several routes used by the PKK rebels for fleeing to Iran late
Wednesday, killing a number of militants, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have discovered some new PKK camps in the
triangle area between Turkey, Iran and Iraq, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old war for the

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Huge Rise in Info Services Trade: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
total international transactions in communication, computer and
information services rose by nearly 160 percent to almost 26
billion ECUs (some 30 billion U.S. dollars) from 1985 to 1995, it
was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been playing a key role in the burgeoning world
information society during the decade, said a report Thursday from
Eurostat, the EU's statistical office based in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Development of computer and information services made a major
contribution to such an increase. The rise in this domain during
the decade was 352 percent to approximately 13.2 billion ECUs
(some 15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Communication services were up 78 percent over the decade.
Eurostat noted that the growth might be substantially greater than
suggested by transactions in current prices, adding that the
average cost of international calls for an EU residential user
fell by 30 percent between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the 15 EU member nations represented 48 percent
of their total international transactions in communications and 54
percent in computer and information services.
</P>
<P>
The United States accounted for one fifth of the EU's trade in
communications and more than one quarter in computer and
information services.
</P>
<P>
"The technological boom in telecommunications...and development
of computer equipment have increased the accessibility of
international networks, thus creating greater opportunities for
international trade in computer and information services,"
Eurostat said in the report.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Welcomes Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today welcomed the Kyoto Protocol on climate change,
saying it was a sound foundation for a global cooperative
strategy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the spokesman's office, Annan said the
Kyoto conference on climate change had taken a major step towards
the objective of limiting growth in greenhouse gas emission.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the developed countries has set an overall
target to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases by more than
five percent below 1990 levels by early next century, which would
represent a major shift in the trend of emission and showed true
political leadership by the largest industrial economies.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the Kyoto Protocol in climate change
provided opportunities for partnership between government and the
private sector, notably in transferring finance and technology for
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed this was a sound foundation for a global
cooperative strategy which would bring together governments, civil
society and the business community in a joint effort to protect a
common environmental resource.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments now to move expeditiously in ratifying and
implementing this historic agreement.

<HEADLINE> Strict Observation of Sanctions on S. Leone Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- As the peace process in Sierra
Leone is in deadlock, ministers of west African states urged the
international community to ensure strict observation of the
sanctions and embargo imposed on Freetown's military regime.
</P>
<P>
It has become necessary to pursue the measure in view of the
failure of the regime to abide by the peace plan it entered last
October with the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), said the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who just ended the 42nd session of the ECOWAS
council of ministers Wednesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja,
noted that the regime led by Major Johnny Koroma had begun to
make new demands after signing the peace plan, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord, the Koroma-led regime will hand over
power to ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in April next year
and all combatants in the country will be disarmed, demobilized
and reintegrated between December 1 and 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers said, the implementation of the accord
had become problematic because Koroma was against disarming his
troops.
</P>
<P>
"He is demanding the immediate release of Foday Sankoh, who is
supposed to be released six months after the implementation of
the accord," they reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is the leader of the former rebel group Revolutionary
United Front, which has fought successive governments in Sierra
Leone and allied with Koroma's troops shortly after the May 25
coup.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted there must be misunderstanding between
ECOWAS and Koroma and that agreed negotiation would have to take
place at the highest level later to resolve the misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
A series of negotiations have been held between ECOWAS
delegates and those of the Koroma-led regime since the signing of
the peace accord in Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The talks, however, failed to find modalities agreed upon by
both sides for the implementation of the Conakry peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The military regime is under economic sanctions and embargo of
arms and petroleum products imposed by ECOWAS and the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Gene Causing Allergies Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A mutant gene that could
make people more susceptible to allergies has been tracked down by
researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
Experts said this finding, published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine, will be able to identify highly susceptible
people by looking for this gene and use it to tailor new
therapies.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long noticed that allergies run in families,
and they believe that many genes, perhaps a dozen or more, are
involved in this common condition.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said their discovery implicates a gene that
controls a single step in th inflammatory process that leads to
asthma.
</P>
<P>
They said if you have this mutation, you are 10 times more
likely to be allergic.
</P>
<P>
Allergies begin when the body mistakes proteins from cat
dander, dust mites,cockroaches and other allergy producers for
dangerous invaders. A crucial step in the chain reaction that
follows is production of an antibody called IgE that causes
allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
The gene that is mutated in some asthma victims contains the
building instruction for receptor for a chemical called
interleukin 4. This protein helps regulate the body's production
of IgE.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today released two
Jordanian prisoners of war (POW) captured along with Iraqis
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that the
Jordanian POWs Khalid Ali Awazi, 38, and Nadir Hassan Shahab, 45,
were taken captive by Iranian forces during the Fath-ul-Mobin
operations in Dezful in southwest Iran in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The two Jordanians was freed after Iranian supreme leader Ali
Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami respectively met
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
In the meetings, Khamenei stressed the need for unity and
solidarity in the Islamic world while Khatami said that it was
impossible to make compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, Arab mercenaries also
joined the Iraqi army to fight against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran released most of the POWs of Arab countries after the Gulf
War in 1991, but it was reported that Tehran still is keeping
several hundreds of POWs, most of them Iraqis.

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge 1 Billion US Dollars Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Concluding a two-day
meeting here this afternoon, Tanzania's donors pledged some 1
billion U.S. Dollars aid to help the country meet its development
needs for the next year.
</P>
<P>
James Adams, the World Bank country director for Tanzania and
Uganda, told a press conference that participants agreed to
commit a total of some 1 billion U.S. Dollars to help meet
Tanzania's development needs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that donors would follow up closely
Tanzania's strategies in fighting corruption to ensure the
government funds are properly used.
</P>
<P>
Adams described as "a success" the Consultative Group Meeting
(CGM) for Tanzania which was attended by delegates from more than
30 countries in Europe, America and Asia as well as the
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Several delegates showed their willingness to answer
Tanzania's appeal for setting up a fund to assist in reducing its
multilateral debt amounting to about half of its external debt of
8.1 billion U.S. Dollars by the end of October, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Finance Minister Daniel Yona said at the joint press
conference at the Sheraton Hotel that his government was
committed to economy privatization but was at times seemingly
slow because the exercise has to be carried out carefully and
transparently.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting covered many issues, ranging from inflation,
corruption, privatization and debt to budget," he said. "The
donors seems to understand us better now."
</P>
<P>
Yona said that Tanzania would try to keep a balance between
development speed and governance transparency, explaining that
privatization means easing the government's burden in financing
some state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Some critics question us on speed, while others demand
transparency. We are trying to have both," he added.
</P>
<P>
CGM is a forum at which major donor countries and multilateral
institutions collectively meet, usually in Paris, individual
developing countries to review the donor-funded projects and
agree on future terms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first donors' meeting ever held in Dar es Salaam
as a show of their confidence in the economic growth of the poor
East African nation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has scored good marks on macro-economic performance
with inflation rate declining to 15.8 percent this October from
25.1 percent in January of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting Wednesday, Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa said Tanzania's debt was at a level that was both
unbearable and unsustainable, appealing for more debt relief and
setting up a multilateral debt fund.
</P>
<P>
"We currently spend on a per capita basis five times more
money to service only a part of our external debt than we can
afford for health and education combined," he said.
</P>
<P>
The donors are scheduled to meet Tanzania's representatives
from the business community and non-governmental organizations
before ending their three-day activities.

<HEADLINE> First Portuguese Dictionary Launched for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Africa's first Portuguese
dictionary for primary school students was launched here today to
facilitate children in Portuguese-speaking countries to grasp the
self-teaching ability.
</P>
<P>
Fatima Beatriz, Angola's coordinator for the trial edition of
the dictionary, said today on the launching ceremony that this is
the first time for Africa's Portuguese-speaking countries to
utilize a unified dictionary in primary education.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary will help unifying education in Portuguese
language and bringing about a standardization in education, she
added.
</P>
<P>
In the five Portuguese-speaking countries which include
Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and
Principe, many primary and secondary school students cannot use
dictionaries, because they are beyond their level, and this has
seriously affected education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coordinator noted, the existing Portuguese
dictionaries are too advanced for primary education. She
believed that the new dictionary would help nurture kids'
interest in learning through dictionaries at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
The 288-page trial dictionary compiled by Aldomio Gomes, a
Portuguese professor and linguist, has included words for daily
use. Before the launch, the edition has been used in some primary
schools in Luanda and were well received by both teachers and
students.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Turkey of Provocative Flights over Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday accused Turkey of provocative flight over the northern
Aegean Sea, saying it could raise tensions between Turkey and
Greece, the two NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
"Military activity of this kind undermines confidence and
needlessly exacerbates tensions between our two NATO allies,"
State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters. "We call
on Turkey to stop such actions."
</P>
<P>
Foley was referring to Turkish air movements over the northern
Aegean near the Greek city of Thessalonki. The flights were
confirmed by NATO radar data.
</P>
<P>
According to Ankara, the Turkish planes were on routine
exercises and there were no penetration of Greek airspace by the
flights. And it said 10 Greek warplanes intercepted Turkish
aircraft in international airspace of the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
But Athens said its warplanes intercepted the Turkish jets
because they violated Greek airspace.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States was hopeful that a new command
structure for the Aegean will be able to prevent such
occurrences once it is in place.
</P>
<P>
The United States began an new initiative earlier this year
to try to resolve tensions between Turkey and Greece, as the
tensions have created instability in a key region ad have a
corrosive effect on NATO.

WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
removed 11,000 of the 14,000 mines on the border with Cuba,
announced the Pentagon today.
</P>
<P>
"The removal is going carefully, but well," Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said. There were at one point 14,000 mines on the
U.S. side of the border between the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station
and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that 11,000 of those mines have been removed from
the U.S. side, leaving 3,000 more to remove," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The removal is conducted pursuant to a presidential directive
issued in 1996 and the goal is to have them out by 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we will exceed that goal and get them out
sometime in the second half of 1998, calendar year 1998," Bacon
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that while the anti-personnel landmines are
being picked up, there will remain in the mine field anti-tank
landmines to protect the naval base from action by the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
"Our mine field on the American side has been fenced in and
clearly designated a mine field in both English and Spanish,"
Bacon added.

<HEADLINE> EU Threatens Legal Action Against Open Skies Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
be forced to take legal action again against EU members making
bilateral "open skies" aviation deals with the United States, a
top EU official said today.
</P>
<P>
Neil Kinnock, EU commissioner in charge of transport,
reportedly made the remark to EU transport ministers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would have to renew court action against EU
member states making such bilateral deals after the transport
ministers said they were not ready to give the EU's executive, the
European Commission, a wider mandate to negotiate an EU-U.S. deal
to liberalize aviation traffic.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive has been urging EU member countries to extend
its powers to negotiate with Washington to include the issues of
market access and traffic rights -- the right to fly to and inside
another country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The Commission added that Washington would not take interest in
a deal which did not include these issues.
</P>
<P>
A British diplomat was quoted by Reuters as saying that Britain
was not ready to decide on this matter before June 1998 at the
earliest. Britain will take over the EU's rotating presidency in
January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is feared among some EU transport ministers that EU-level
talks are likely to hinder their bilateral negotiations with the
U.S. since some EU members might seek more restrictive deals.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight EU countries, including Germany and the Nordic
states, have already signed such deals while there are ongoing
talks with four others -- Britain, France, Italy and Spain.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition National
Development Party (NDP) leader Raila Odinga has ruled out the
possibility of fielding one opposition presidential candidate for
the December 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
After presenting his nomination papers to vie for Langata
parliamentary seat Tuesday, Raila disclosed that despite
consultative meetings with opposition presidential candidates,
agreement had not been reached over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Consultations were held late last month among leaders in the
opposition parties to field one presidential candidate against
the incumbent President Daniel arap Moi, presidential candidate
for the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU).
</P>
<P>
One day after presenting their nomination papers, opposition
presidential candidates Charity Ngilu for Social Democratic Party
and Kijana Wamalwa for Ford-Kenya were reported to meet on
December 4 in renewed efforts to field a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
These were the latest efforts made by opposition parties in
this east African country as a strategy to win the forthcoming
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The efforts to field a sole candidate against President Moi
was made as early as before the first multi-party elections in
1992.
</P>
<P>
But, the idea was not realized as the leaders of the then
mainstream opposition parties all felt strong enough to win the
elections.
</P>
<P>
As Moi was sworn in after winning the elections, there had
also been several attempts to unite the opposition leaders, but
neither materialized.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, opposition parties in the country have
further divided during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Take the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) as
example. Soon after its founding, Ford gave birth to Ford-Kenya
and Ford Asili.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the opposition Ford has become grand parent
to Kenya National Congress (KNC) and Ford-People whose mother
party is Ford-Asili, and National Development Party of Kenya
(NDP) whose mother party is Ford-Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The repeated division of the original Ford indicated a tribal
inclination with Ford-Kenya and Ford-Asili being dominated by
Luyia tribe, NDP by Luo tribe, and Ford-People by Kikuyu tribe.
</P>
<P>
The current defections of the out-going opposition members of
parliament and their supporters are not a result of principles
but a way to get parliamentary seats through tribal backing.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 28 registered opposition parties in
Kenya and almost every province in the country has a political
party whose leader and the presidential candidate comes from the
majority tribe.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago when the clamor for political pluralism was
at its climax, Moi predicted that sooner or later Kenya would be
characterized by ethnic-based political parties.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the ethnic divisions are the root
for the split in the opposition parties and tribalism has killed
their unity.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, communities in Kenya today believe that the
prime duty of a head of state is to feather his own nest or to
benefit his own tribe, and elections are meant to decide which
tribe will fete first.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Imenti MP Kiraitu Murungi said in his book "Ethnicity
and Multi-Partyism in Kenya" that the Luos voted for a Luo
presidential candidate in 1992 because such a candidate was the
best placed to allocate national economic resources to Luos.
</P>
<P>
The Kikuyus voted for a Kikuyu presidential candidate for the
same reason, he added.
</P>
<P>
So, opposition presidential candidates and their ethnic-based
parties are vigorously searching for presidency and would not
surrender the opportunity for presidency to others.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, outgoing Lakipia West MP Dickson Kimani from
opposition Democratic Party of Kenya (DP) said recently, "Greed
for power among various opposition presidential candidates is
driving the entire opposition to the brink of death and nothing
much will be achieved by the end of the General Election."

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Seeking Compromise on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
Friday morning focused on issues of building a unified economic
system, so as find a compromise before moving on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
Officials were set to reach a deal on which the 15 EU member
countries should be allowed to join a proposed Euro council to
oversee the coming Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The composition of the Euro council, mandated to discuss policy
issues under the EMU, became the main subject of discussion for
the EU leaders and finance ministers meeting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
They were expected to reach a compromise between EU members
likely to launch the EMU in January 1999 and those who intend to
stay out at that time -- Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece.
</P>
<P>
However, the four EMU "outs" still want to be associated with
the new system as closely as possible, as they do not want to be
left out in making the EU's future economic and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said Thursday they were optimistic that a compromise
might be found to make both parties happy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be strange if a compromise was not found on this
issue," Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said early Friday.
</P>
<P>
His optimism was also shared by some other EU ministers,
including Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinistoe and French
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
Paris has been leading a drive for the so-called "Euro-x"
council, with the "x" to be filled in when the number of EMU
countries is finalized.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the EU summit, all EU members were optimistic
about finding a solution for non-EMU countries to associate
themselves with the Euro-x council.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Present Albright Principles on Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu hopes to present U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright principles on the final settlement with the
Palestinians when they meet next week, a senior aide said today.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told Israel Radio that the
cabinet will discuss these principles on the further redeployment
in the West Bank and the final-status talks at Sunday's weekly
cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet is expected to meet for the second time
before Netanyahu travels to Paris to meet with Albright, so
that Netanyahu could convey to Albright the principles on the
second redeployment in the West Bank and the permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
Before the cabinet debate on the final map, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon took a flight today over the West Bank to inspect
what areas should remain under Israeli control in the final
settlement to meet its security needs.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the ministerial panel in charge of drawing the
final map on the redeployments and permanent talks held its fourth
meeting, but still failed to produce an agreement due to inner
split over Israel's security needs. The committee is headed by
Netanyahu and includes Mordechai, Sharon and Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Albright hopes to learn about the specific percentage rather
than only principles, and she has made it clear that Israel
must make a concrete and more credible decision on the second
pullback.
</P>
<P>
Both Mordechai and Sharon denied an Israel Radio report
Thursday that the government is to approve handing over 13
percent of the West Bank in the second redeployment. The report
said the map was drawn up by Mordechai and Sharon through secret
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Levy issued an urgent call to the government Thursday to
produce an agreement on the final map before the
Netanyahu-Albright meeting. He warned that failure to do so
would anger the Americans, harming the friendship with the
United States and leading to further international isolation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is growing impatient with Israel's
handling of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, especially the
delays in the first two of three-phase further redeployments in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
While the Israeli government is striving to produce a final
map, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk, who retired
as U.S. Ambassador to Israel earlier this year, is scheduled to
arrive in Israel today. Indyk is expected to prod Israeli
cabinet to come up soon with a final agreement on further
redeployment and final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Indyk will also explore ways of breaking the protracted
deadlock in the peace talks between Israel and Syria. After his
visits to Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, he is to
visit Syria and Jordan before joining Albright in her meeting
with Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Raises Bank Rate to 4.50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada raised its
bank rate by 50 basis points Friday to 4.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
The raise immediately boosted the sagging Canadian dollar to
0.7075 U.S. dollars, which fell to 0.6998 U.S. dollars on
Thursday, the lowest in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
"Volatility in international financial markets, tied to events in
Asia, has continued to affect Canadian markets," the bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"This action by the Bank is designed to contribute to more
settled domestic markets in which investors can focus more
confidently on the strong fundamentals favoring non-inflationary
growth in the Canadian economy," it said.
</P>
<P>
Friday's move was the fourth hike this year by Canada's central
bank. It last raised interest rates by 25 basis points on November
25.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been reluctant to raise interest rates, fearing that
higher rates would stall Canada's economy growth.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the sagging Canadian dollar finally forced it to take the
difficult action.

OTTAWA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's commercial banks
announced Friday the increase of prime lending rate to 6.0 percent
from 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rates will be effective Monday, the banks said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce took the lead in raising its
prime rate after the Bank of Canada jerked its bank rate by 50 basis
points to 4.50 percent Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The move was followed immediately by the Royal Bank, Scotiabank,
the Bank of Montreal, Toronto Dominian Bank and other commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank raised its bank rate after the Canadian dollar
hit a 11-year low at Thursday's markets.
</P>
<P>
The raise immediately boosted the sagging Canadian dollar to
0.7075 U.S. dollars today, which closed at 70.08 U.S. cents on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's rate increase was the fourth hike this year by

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's real gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 1.0 percent in the third quarter of this year,
Statistics Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was 4.0 percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth came on the strength of domestic and foreign
demand, the federal statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter, consumer spending and business investment in
plant and equipment continued to drive final domestic demand, which
was up 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canada's exports picked up by 2.4 percent, and imports
jumped by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This brought its balance of trade on goods and services to 3.8
billion dollars (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the third quarter,
down from 9.9 billion dollars in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Seeking Compromise on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
Friday morning focused on issues of building a unified economic
system, so as find a compromise before moving on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
Officials were set to reach a deal on which the 15 EU member
countries should be allowed to join a proposed Euro council to
oversee the coming Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The composition of the Euro council, mandated to discuss policy
issues under the EMU, became the main subject of discussion for
the EU leaders and finance ministers meeting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
They were expected to reach a compromise between EU members
likely to launch the EMU in January 1999 and those who intend to
stay out at that time -- Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece.
</P>
<P>
However, the four EMU "outs" still want to be associated with
the new system as closely as possible, as they do not want to be
left out in making the EU's future economic and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said Thursday they were optimistic that a compromise
might be found to make both parties happy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be strange if a compromise was not found on this
issue," Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said early Friday.
</P>
<P>
His optimism was also shared by some other EU ministers,
including Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinistoe and French
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
Paris has been leading a drive for the so-called "Euro-x"
council, with the "x" to be filled in when the number of EMU
countries is finalized.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the EU summit, all EU members were optimistic
about finding a solution for non-EMU countries to associate
themselves with the Euro-x council.

<HEADLINE> France Begins Trial of Terrorist Carlos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- An Assize Court here began on
Friday the trial of Carlos, or Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the alleged
murderer of some 20 people and a symbol of international terrorism
in 1970s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
Though the 48-year-old Venezuelan is charged with five attacks
in France, the trial is focused on the killing of two French
secret agents and their Lebanese informer on June 27, 1975, in his
dormitory in the Latin district of Paris.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Carlos would face 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Led by the Lebanese Michel Moukharbal, the agents with the
Direction of Territorial Security Raymond Dous and Jean Donatini,
as well as a police officer Jean Herranz, had come to arrest the
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Carlos was accused of opening fire, killing three and seriously
wounding the police officer, before fled.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, however, he was abducted by French agents from Sudan
and has been imprisoned in the Fresne Prison of Paris ever since.
</P>
<P>
In June 1992, a French court sentenced, in his absence, life
imprisonment for the triple murder.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Confident of Peso Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
expressed confidence that the Philippines can withstand the
fallout of the latest currency crisis that hit South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso dipped to a new record low of 37.3 pesos to
the U.S. dollar at the close of trading today after piercing
through a new psychological level of 36 pesos to one dollar
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The peso has so far lost more than 41 percent in its value
against the dollar since its floating in July this year.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos said the behavior of the peso can be traced to the
collapse of the Korean won which has depreciated by as much as 102
percent against the dollar since January this year.
</P>
<P>
The behavior of the foreign currency market is a daily thing
and one must not be apprehensive about what is happening outside.
We are affected but we have the chance to recover, he said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other Southeast Asian currencies, Ramos said the
performance of the peso this month is better due to the sound
economical fundamentals of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is about to graduate from the supervision of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at a time when other "tiger"
economies in the region like South Korea and Thailand have
re-entered into the IMF fold, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects EU Invitation to Weekend Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has turned down the
invitation for its top government official to dine with European
Union (EU) leaders at the weekend in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's frustrated move, sources here said Friday, was due to
the EU's reluctance to include Ankara in its initial blueprint for
enlargement, somehow on political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister, was
quoted by BBC World Service as saying that Turkey would not be
invited to a new European Conference of all other 11 EU applicants.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said Turkey would have to improve its human rights
record, relations with neighboring Greece and readiness to allow
EU entry negotiations with Cyprus to go ahead in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Turkey "is on the way to being a member, but we do have some
problems with the human rights situation," he told BBC.
</P>
<P>
However, EU Commissioner Han van den Broek said it was
"premature" to draw political conclusions from Ankara's refusal to
attend the dinner, which he described as "lack of a political
appetite."
</P>
<P>
Some EU members worried that a frustrated Turkey might push
Ankara into the arms of radical Islam while some others said that
it was simply a diplomatic move.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a disaster, but it's a missed chance. I'm not very
happy about that," Belgian Prime Minister Erik Derycke said.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg summit is expected to reach agreement on
starting entry talks early next year with the five-plus-one
configuration recommended by the European Commission in July --
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The other five applicants -- Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia,
Lithuania and Slovakia -- are considered less qualified for EU
membership. They are likely to be involved in a "screening"
process launched by the EU to keep them going for further
political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are expected at the summit to discuss EU
enlargement, a single European currency system, the Structural
Funds, agricultural and institutional reforms, and issues which
they have long been engaged with.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency baht today
sank to a new low, closing at 45.65 to the U.S. dollar, according
to local TV Channel 7.
</P>
<P>
The baht has lost 77 percent of its value against the dollar
since the baht was floated on July 2.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the baht dropped to 43.60 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai today held the tumbling South
Korean won responsible for the plunge of the baht to an all-time
low.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
the baht had further fallen because of the huge demand by Thai
companies to buy dollars to repay their debts before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Dealers predicted that the baht could decline further next week
if the Korean won continues to tumble.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Urged to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) countries
and the United States should take a lead in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister
Simon Khaya Moyo said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the appeal when addressing journalists in
Harare soon after his return from the third conference of parties
to the climate change in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said since the convention came into force in 1994, little
progress had been made towards implementation of commitments by
developed countries towards the reduction of emissions of
greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said some countries were "ridiculously" proposing the same
targets to be accomplished between year 2008 and 2012.
</P>
<P>
"If we are serious in resolving the issue of climate change,
we need to come up with more responsible and realistic targets,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A protocol which was finally adopted by the conference calls
for a 5.2 percentage reduction of emissions from developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Specifically the EU will reduce its emissions by eight
percent, the U.S. by seven percent, and Japan by six percent of
the 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are exempted from the new commitments to
the mitigation of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said there was need for differentiation of
responsibilities so that while developed countries should
concentrate on reduction, limitation and mitigation measures,
developing countries needed to focus on sustained economic growth
and adaptation measures.
</P>
<P>
He said developed countries should assist in the
implementation of the convention through the transfer of
environmentally sound technologies and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe still needed to develop a national plan on
greenhouse gas abatement, limitation and adaptation measures.
</P>
<P>
"We will therefore need assistance in terms of capacity
building and financial resources in order to achieve this goal,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk to Pardon Deposed Prince: Sam Rainsy </HEADLINE>

<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk agreed on Friday to pardon exiled First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh if the latter was convicted by a court, former
finance minister Sam Rainsy said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here viewed it as a move, on the king's part, to
eliminate a major hurdle to Ranariddh's return for general
elections scheduled for May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, president of the Khmer Nation Party, told the press
after meeting the king that the monarch would pardon his son even
if there was no such request from the prince himself or from
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
However, the prince said he was not guilty at all and would not
sit in court.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was ousted in July by Hun Sen, who accused the prince
of illegally importing weapons and colluding with the outlawed
Khmer Rouge and insisted he be tried by court.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the prince would have to be pardoned by his
75-year-old father to join the elections.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Leads Omega PGA Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Choi Kyung-ju
made the most of the early morning's calm conditions to fire his
second successive five-under-par 65 to take the lead after the
second round of the 500,000 U.S. dollars Omega PGA Championship
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old, number one at the South Korean PGA Tour for
the past two years, leads on 10 under par by five strokes from
Hong Kong's Dominique Boulet, Myanmar's Zaw Moe, Scotland's Kenny
Walker, Singapore's Dino Kwek and Lu Wen-teh from Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
In what is the final strokeplay event of the 1997 Omega Tour,
Choi started the day a stroke behind first round leader and close
friend Park No-seok but took charge by firing seven birdies and
two bogies.
</P>
<P>
Park, who represented South Korea with Choi at this year's
Alfred Dunhill Cup and World Cup, fell off the pace with a
two-over-par 72 to lie at four under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Choi's round, in chilly weather which saw winds strengthen in
the afternoon, was highlighted by a brilliant front nine of
four-under-par 31 with birdies on one, two, seven and nine.
</P>
<P>
"I was really concentrating," said Choi, who trained as a
powerlifter as a teenager. "I was unlucky with some bad lies but
I played very well. On the greens I felt like I could hole
anything,"
</P>
<P>
The South Korean continued to charge up the leaderboard with
birdies on 10, 11 and 14 before the wheels came off with
disappointing dropped shots on 15 and 18, both par fives.
</P>
<P>
"My poor finish reminded me of the Dubai Creek Open last year.
Everything was going well and then suddenly things started to go
very wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do anything to stop the dropped shots," he added.
</P>
<P>
Choi, leader by three strokes after three rounds in the Dubai
tournament, struggled on the final day finishing tied fourth.
</P>
<P>
Choi is hungry for a maiden win on the Omega Tour having
enjoyed an outstanding season in South Korea, with three victories
 in the space of five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Boulet moved into contention after carding a
one-under-par 69, while Moe, winner of this year's Singapore Open,
Lu, Walker and Kwek returned 69,71,67 and 69 respectively.
</P>
<P>
American Mike Cunning put his Omega Order of Merit title
chances in jeopardy after missing the cut for the first time in
the Omega Tour's three years history.
</P>
<P>
Cunning, leader of the Omega Order of Merit fired a
four-over-par 74 to finish on four-over-par 69 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the players who could catch him winning the title, Canadian
Jim Rutledge is the best placed. Rutledge is two under for the
tournament after carding a two-under-par 68.
</P>
<P>
And among others were India's Jeev Milhka Singh, two over for
the tournament, and Americans Ted Purdy and Gerry Norquist, both
one under.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Fijian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
expressed his hope that Fiji will properly address various issues
affecting the Sino-Fijian ties so as to ensure that bilateral
relations proceed in a stable manner.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a meeting here with visiting Fijian
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Berenado Vunibobo.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that Fiji is an important nation in the South-Pacific
Region and said the Chinese government attaches great importance
to its ties with that country.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Fijian relations have been good as a whole and the two
countries have conducted frequent contacts since they established
diplomatic ties, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the broad prospects for the further development
of the Sino-Fujian ties so long as the two sides strictly abide by
the principles set forth in the communique on the establishment of
bilateral diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Vunibobo told Li that the Fijian government highly values its
ties with China and appreciates China for its aid, which he said
has played a positive role in his nation's construction.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese living in Fiji have made contributions to that
country's social and economic development, according to Vunibobo.
</P>
<P>
Vunibobo emphasized that the Fijian government adheres to the
"one China" policy and regards it as an important foundation of
the Sino-Fijian ties. Fiji will neither establish diplomatic ties,
nor engage itself in official contacts with Taiwan, said
Vunibobo.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Military Junta Expresses Baffled Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETWON, December 12 (Xinhua)-- The Sierra Leonean military
government said Friday it is "baffled" over Thursday's
bombardment by a Nigerian Alfa jet on the village of Benduma in
the east in which 10 people were killed and another 18 seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
According to Director of Defence Information John Milton, the
victims were all civilians including children.
</P>
<P>
" We don't know why the Nigerians picked on that target as the
village is inhabited by subsistence farmers who have nothing to
do with any political crisis," Milton said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no independent confirmation of the attack but a
Nigerian officer in the ECOMOG (west African peace keeping force)
base in Freetown said he is "surprised" over the charge, but as
far as we know no hostility has been ordered against Sierra Leone
during this period."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Secretary General in the military government,Abdul
Sesay told a press conference that the ECOMOG was planning an
invasion on the Sierra Leonean capital with a 460 million dollar
support from a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
He said ECOMOG has already acquired 18 amphibious vehicles to
be used in the operation which has the approval of deposed
president Tejan Kabbah. Kabbah is now in Iran attending the
Islamic summit.

<HEADLINE> Issue of Human Rights Gains Momentum in Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
said today that "the issue of human and peoples' rights has
gained momentum" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here when opening the conference of
ministers of justice and attorneys general on the establishment
of an African court on human and peoples' rights.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of African ministers of justice organized by
the OAU "is a clear demonstration of the fact that the issue of
human and peoples' rights has gained momentum" in the poor
continent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the issue of human and peoples' rights "is
not a luxury, neither is it a fashion which is imported from
outside Africa", adding that "the struggle of African people for
freedom and dignity was basically a struggle for human and
peoples' rights."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Human rights need to be observed, promoted,
respected and protected so as to ensure that the energies, the
intelligence and the talents of the peoples can be released and
channeled towards productive activities in an atmosphere devoid
of physical and moral threat."
</P>
<P>
After recalling the efforts aimed at promoting human rights in
the continent, Salim said the two-day ministerial meeting
will consider a draft protocol on the establishment of an African
court on human and peoples' rights.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the court will clearly have far-reaching
positive implications for the respect of human and peoples'
rights in our continent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The draft protocol will be discussed at this ministerial
meeting and submitted to the coming meeting of the OAU Council of
Ministers expected to hold at the beginning of 1998 in Luanda, a
special session devoted to the human rights situation in Africa.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Arms Inspector Arrives In Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms Inspector
Richard Butler arrived in Baghdad Friday morning on his first
visit to Iraq since the last month's crisis between Iraq and the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction will hold talks
with a number of Iraqi officials on the development of relations
between Iraq and the commission, the Iraqi News Agency reported
without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Butler's visit is aimed at convincing the
Iraqi leadership to allow the U.N. inspection teams to enter and
search presidential palaces, an issue considered by Iraq as
jeopardizing its sovereignty and violating its national security.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Butler's talks with Iraqi officials
will be sensitive and crucial to both Iraq and the commission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has voiced it supports the commission
and its executive chairman in carrying out their mission of
destroying Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors' work in Iraq has lasted about three weeks
since they were allowed to return and resume work in Baghdad late
last month.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, Baghdad threatened to expel U.S. inspectors
working with the UNSCOM on charges of spying and hindering the
lifting of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions against Iraq, setting
off the Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can
only be lifted when the weapons inspectors verify that Iraq is
free of weapons of mass destruction.

here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Now the home side have only the DPR Koreans, whom they hammered
3-1 in the group competitions, standing between them and an
unprecedented six-straight-time Asian champions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day's other semifinal, DPR Korea nipped Japan
1-0 to make the final and clinch one of the three Asian berths for
Women's World Cup Soccer Championship in the United States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A far superior Chinese team wasted no time in meaning business
to their pushover opponents as they went 1-0 ahead when the game
was only two minutes old and doubled their lead three minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
They had the ball in the net four more times before the
interval and Headcoach Ma Yuanan rang the change at the second
half to rest up veteran players.
</P>
<P>
The lone moment Chinese Taipei threatened in this lopsided
match came after 65 minutes as striker Lin Chi Yi hit the left
post on a rare counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
China closed their brilliant scoring show with an incredible
zero angle goal in the 85th by 30-year-old striker Liu Ailing, who
came on target for four times in the match.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Gen. Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, met today
with Admiral Joseph Prueher, commander-in-chief of the US Pacific
Command.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the Sino-US relations have grown in recent
years, despite various twists and turns in the process.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US cooperation has been expanded and has great
potentials, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang Zemin's successful state visit to
the United States has not only laid a solid foundation for the two
nations to forge a constructive strategic partnership oriented to
the 21st century, but also created new opportunities for the
further development of bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that properly handling the subtle Taiwan
issue in accordance with the principles of the three Sino-US joint
communiques will promote the further development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should practice mutual respect and conduct dialog
on an equal footing, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to the relation between the
Chinese and US armies and is fully prepared to boost its
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that military leaders of the two armies will
maintain regular exchanges of visit and dialog so as to deepen
mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between the two armed forces will have a bright
future so long as the two sides respect each other and engage in
sincere cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation of Prueher's efforts for the
development of the relations between the two nations and their
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said Prueher's visit will help promote the further
development of bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
Prueher said Jiang Zemin's recent visit to the US has opened
broad prospects for the Sino-US relations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said the relationship between the two armed forces is an
extremely important aspect of bilateral relations, and expressed
the hope that the two armed forces will expand contacts and mutual
understanding in order to promote the constructive and balanced
development of bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed great appreciation of China's achievements in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Taiwan issue, Prueher said the US side fully
understands that it is directly related to China's sovereignty. He
stressed that the US should handle the issue in a careful and
responsible manner.
</P>
<P>
Kui Fulin, deputy chief of General Staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, Luo Bin, director of the Foreign Affairs
Bureau of the National Defense Ministry, and US Ambassador to

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Press Japan for Balanced Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will press Japan for a more balanced trade
when their leaders meet in Kuala Lumpur next week, a Philippine
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the nine ASEAN member countries will discuss
trade relations with Japan after their own informal summit to be
held in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on December 14-16,
Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino told reporters.
</P>
<P>
After the informal summit, ASEAN leaders will hold collective
and individual meetings with the heads of state of Japan, China
and South Korea, he said.
</P>
<P>
Severino said ASEAN leaders are expected to explore with
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto measures to balance and
improve their bilateral trade with Tokyo through the reduction of
Japan's trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Severino, however, declined to specify details on the ASEAN
approach to the issue, saying ASEAN leaders have yet to approve
and finalize the package they will present to Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Severino will take over as ASEAN secretary-general on January
1.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Shares End Week's Trading Nearly 8 percent Lower (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong shares ended the
week's volatile trading nearly 8 percent lower compared with the
previous week, dragged down by the deepened regional financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index shed 912.94 points or 7.92 percent in
the five trading sessions, with heavy losses recorded in the three
sessions from Tuesday through to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hong Kong shares rose 195.34 points, or 1.69
percent, to end at 11,722.94, building on the previous week's gain
of 1,008.68 points or close to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the shares dropped for the first time in four
sessions as profit-taking and weakness in the region made a dent
in the local market. The Hang Seng Index fell 232.28 points, or
1.98 percent, to 11,490.66.
</P>
<P>
Things were getting worse on Wednesday as higher interbank
rates and plunging currencies in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and
Indonesia drove the market further lower. The index plunged 468.25
points or 4.07 percent to finish at the intra-day low of 11,022.41.
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the two days' losses came a much steeper drop
on Thursday, when the market recorded the largest single-day loss
since the crash on October 28.
</P>
<P>
As the ROK financial crisis deepened, interbank rates shot
higher, and fears of another attack on the Hong Kong dollar
rippled through the market, the blue-chip index dived 602.19
points, or 5.46 percent, to finish at 10,420.22.
</P>
<P>
All the regional markets were thrown into chaos that
day: Japan's Nikkei-225 Index dropped 2.6 percent, Bangkok's
shares plunged 4.9 percent, Jakarta stock prices were down by
4.77 percent, the Philippine lead index fell by 4.93 percent, and
Malaysian shares collapsed 7.41 percent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Iran Talks Hailed as Big Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that his talks with Iranian officials in Tehran
were "extremely fruitful" in building understanding between the
two countries which are free of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
"The talks I held with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and
other senior state officials were extremely fruitful," said
Moussa, who returned today from Tehran after leading his country's
delegation to the just-concluded 8th Islamic Summit.
</P>
<P>
They gave a hand in understanding the stances and policies
adopted by the two parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters upon his arrival, Moussa said Egypt's
participation in the summit and his contact with Iranian officials
"could help create a proper atmosphere for bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
"Tehran summit and discussions held on the sidelines in
addition to resolutions and statements released will certainly
help in creating a new atmosphere and perhaps a new
understanding," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called on the former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and reviewed Cairo-Tehran ties on Monday, on the
sidelines of the biggest event Iran has hosted since the Iranian
Islamic Revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted him as saying that Khatami and Rafsanjani
lauded the Egyptian role in the region and expressed their respect
of the Egyptian vision.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who is the first Egyptian foreign minister to visit
Tehran since the revolution, told reporters that he will present a
detailed report to President Hosni Mubarak on the outcome of the
summit and his contacts and meetings with a number of Islamic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Cairo broke off their diplomatic ties after Egypt
signed the David Camp Accord with Israel in 1979, but relations
have warmed up in recent years, particularly in the fields of
economic and scientific cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati visited
Cairo last May to invite Mubarak to attend the Islamic summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
Asian jitters swept onward to New York and London, weakening
the trading in the leading Western markets.
</P>
<P>
But, following heavy losses for three days in a row, Hong Kong
equity market reversed the downturn today to rise 194.44 points,
or 1.87 percent, to close at the day's high of 10,614.66.
</P>
<P>
Steady money market rates and bargain-hunting pushed the
recovery, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's remarks that the government
will continue to defend the peg also helped the market, they said.
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower this morning due to an overnight loss
on Wall Street, with the Hang Seng Index falling 294.12 points to
10,126.10 in the first 15 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
At the midday break, however, the index regained all its lost
ground to end 43.95 points, or 0.42 percent, higher.
</P>
<P>
Traders said a drop in money market rates lifted
sentiment. Hong Kong's three-month interbank rate edged down to
10.5 percent today from over 11 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a regular meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks
this afternoon, Chairman Chris Langley told reporters that the
association decided to leave deposit interest rates unchanged, in
the belief that the relatively high interbank rates in the local
money market are "a short-term phenomenon".
</P>
<P>
However, sentiment remained cautious due to continued falls in
the ROK's won and weakness in other regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the 10,000 point psychological support level was
holding very firm and might set the stage for a further rebound in
the index next week.
</P>
<P>
The market was oversold badly this week, said Sassoon
Securities sales manager Simon Tam, who expected a turnaround in
the coming week.
</P>
<P>
He said sentiment might continue to improve next week, with
interbank rates hopefully stabilizing at current levels.

<HEADLINE> America's 2nd Fast-food Chain Bites on 1st With French Fries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Burger King, America's
No. 2 fast-food chain, has rolled out an improved kind of french
fries to bite on the market share of McDonald's, the No. 1.
</P>
<P>
The new slivers of potato fried in hot oil are thicker, crisper
and stay hotter longer, or long enough to survive the four-block
walk to the office without going cold and limp, Burger King claims.
</P>
<P>
The challenge over the single product is believed to be based
on the perception, among analysts, that french fries are a major
factor in McDonald's dominant position in the fast-food industry.
</P>
<P>
The key to the new french fries, available from this week with
a massive marketing campaign, is a secret batter, says the
Miami-based challenger, as compared with McDonald's secret sauce.
</P>
<P>
Newly cut potatoes are sprayed with a potato-based coating
before being frozen and shipped to the restaurants, 8,700 of them
in 56 countries, where they are cooked and served.
</P>
<P>
Although the process costs more, says the company with 9
billion U.S. dollars sales last year, the prices are not going to
rise as increased business should cover the increased cost.
</P>
<P>
There are 30,000 fast-food restaurants in the United
States, competing for the 100 billion dollars market sector.
</P>
<P>
As the largest chain of the kind, in and outside the United
States, McDonald's has 21,000 restaurants in more than 100
countries, with a total sales of 31.8 billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> India Opposes U.S. Restrictions on Its Carpet Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua)-- India has said that any
effort by the United States to put restrictions on its carpet
export on social grounds will constitute violation of the World
Trade Organization(WTO)'s rules, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
quoted a senior official as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
The WTO regulations do not permit any blanket ban on imports,
the official said, adding that a resolution passed at a recent
ministerial conference in Singapore holds that social clauses will
not be linked with trade restrictions or imports coming from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute between India and the United States was
prompted by a new U.S. law which bans imports of hand-knitted
carpets from India, Nepal and Pakistan that are without the label
of Rugmark as required by the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. importers insisted on using the Rugmark label of their own
after reports said that Indian carpets had been made by using
child laborers.
</P>
<P>
India was not happy with the U.S. rejection of the Kaleen label
of its carpets, which was introduced by the Indian carpet
industry.
</P>
<P>
Social clauses are violative of WTO's guidelines, the official
said, attempts at making compulsory product labeling impose trade
barriers in the guise of social concerns.

<HEADLINE> Nauru, France Resume Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Nauru and France today
resumed diplomatic ties, which was severed two years ago by Nauru
in a protest over France's nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Nauru's President Kinza Clodumar,
who said it marked a new era in relations between the two
countries, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
France said it had permanently ended nuclear testing in the
South Pacific early last year after conducting a series of tests
that led to its expulsion from the South Pacific Forum and the
imposition of diplomatic, trade and military sanctions across the
region.
</P>
<P>
Since then, France has been gradually rebuilding ties in the
region, and has won support from the island nations for its strong
stand against greenhouse gases.

"Transnational crimes respect no borders and the ASEAN
countries recognize the need for bilateral cooperation to combat
these illicit activities," Barbers said.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said there is also the growing need for a clear and
effective regional modality to combat these forms of crimes,
especially on information change and policy coordination.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Expects Good Results From Sino-American Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
here today that his recent visit to the United States has yielded
important results and the world welcomes the improvement of the
Sino-American relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks while meeting with Admiral Joseph
Prueher, Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Command.
</P>
<P>
This proves once again that a healthy and stable Sino-American
relationship is not only in the interest of the Chinese and
Americans, but is also the wish of the people around the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's visit to China is planned for next year, he
said, adding that he believes the exchange of visits by the heads
of state of China and the United States will push Sino-American
relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that relations between the Chinese and American armed
forces are an important part of Sino-American relations, and have
developed positively over the past year. He praised
Adm. Prueher for his efforts at promoting the development of
relations between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"We take a positive attitude toward the development of
Sino-American military relations and hope these relations will
grow in a more practical and steady manner," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Prueher told Jiang that during his visit he had useful
discussions with Chinese military leaders on strengthening
relations between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang's visit to the United States had been
successful and that the bilateral relations established by Jiang
and Clinton ensure the continued development of US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Prueher reiterated Jiang's words that China and the
United States need to increase mutual understanding before they
build mutual trust. The two countries are now working for this
goal, Prueher added.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Gen. Fu Quanyou, chief of general
staff of the PLA, Lieut. Gen. Kui Fulin, deputy chief of PLA

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Open More Sectors to Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will further open its
service, cultural and educational service sectors to overseas
investment, according to Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin.
</P>
<P>
In an address to today's opening session of the Eighth
Municipal Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), Jia, who
also serves as secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee,
said Beijing must open more sectors to the outside world and
enhance its competitiveness in order to become a modernized
international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that Beijing needs a comprehensive plan to attract
foreign investment for a number of key projects at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
He noted that transnational corporations with high-level
management are expected to invest in Beijing, the Chinese capital,
and added that they are welcomed to establish regional
headquarters or subsidiary corporations.
</P>
<P>
Jia noted that Beijing would open more channels and adopt
additional means to issue securities and bonds overseas in order
to attract more foreign funds and loans.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has actually used overseas funds of some 9.41 billion
U.S. dollars over the past five years, with 138 of the world's 500
largest transnational corporations operating in the city,
according to Jia.
</P>
<P>
Jia called for the city to further perfect laws and policies
related to foreign investment and taxation, while improving its
work efficiency and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Jia's report also listed a number of key sectors open to
foreign investment, including the new high technology, service,
modern agriculture, pillar industries, private housing and
infrastructure construction. In the report, he also paid great
attention to the development of economic and technological
development zones.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had approved 13,327 foreign-funded enterprises by the
end of November this year, with total contracted investments
standing at 21.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has also established 300-odd enterprises in more than
20 foreign countries and regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting today with Takuhiko Tsuruta, president of Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, and his party, urged the Japanese to draw a lesson from
history for the sustained and healthy development of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China and Japan are separated only by a narrow strip
of water and have had friendly exchanges for more than 2,000 years
that have helped promote their economic and cultural development
and have contributed to the progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the war of aggression waged by Japanese
militarists in modern times resulted in a disaster for the Chinese
and suffering for the Japanese, he said, but past experiences, if
not forgotten, can be a guide for the future.
</P>
<P>
For the past 25 years, since the normalization of Sino-Japanese
relations, Jiang said, China has witnessed the continuous growth
of bilateral relations and increasing exchanges and co-operation,
thanks to the two sides' efforts under the principles of the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty for
Peace and Friendship.

<P>
"We have long set forth the expression "Sino-Japanese
friendship from generation to generation," he said, and for the
fundamental interest of the two peoples and and for the noble
cause of advancing global peace and development, the two sides
should make a concerted effort to develop good neighborly
relations oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Good political relations between the two sides are conducive to
the smooth development of economic ties and trade, and they should
try to establish constructive, long-term and stable economic
co-operation, while making long-term plans for shifting from
quantity to quality in economic and trade co-operation. The two
governments should give policy guidance to economic ties and
two-way trade by exploring new channels and co-operating in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that the main trend in Sino-Japanese
economic co-operation is good and the potential great, and that as
long as the two countries proceed in a mood of friendship, handle
matters properly, and make full use of their respective
advantages, bilateral economic ties and trade will see new
progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang discussed China's basic policies for Southeast Asia, and
said that the development of long-term good neighborly relations
with Southeast Asia is an important component part of China's
foreign policy. China wants to join ASEAN countries in
establishing neighborly trust and co-operative relations oriented
toward the 21st century, with a view toward maintaining regional
peace, stability, and development, and promoting regional economic
and technological co-operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should gradually resolve their individual
differences through equal and friendly consultation, and they
should seek a common ground while allowing some differences that
cannot be resolved for the time being to remain so that they do
not have a negative effect on the overall development of
good-neighborly relations.

<P>
About China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Jiang said that China has met the essential requirements for
membership and that without China's participation, the WTO's trade
system is incomplete. China is a developing nation, he said, and
only when this is recognized can there be a balance between rights
and obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been some progress in negotiations and
bilateral talks and that China and some trade partners have
reached agreements. He added that he hopes all parties involved
can be far-sighted and make China one of the WTO members at an
early date because it would be beneficial to all.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the outcome of the negotiations, he went on to
say, the reforms and opening-up and modernization drive will
continue, as will China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He also described China's policies for state-owned enterprises
and the economic development of central and western parts of the
country, and said that the reform of state-owned firms is the
focus of economic restructuring. "We are striving to revitalize
them by setting up a modern enterprise system, combining reforms,
restructuring, and reshuffling with a tightening up of management,
a strategic restructuring, encouraging mergers, regulating
bankruptcies, increasing efficiency by reducing employment, and
beginning a re-employment project for laid-off workers."
</P>
<P>
"Our goals are to bring most large and medium-sized
money-losing state-owned enterprises out of difficulties by the
end of this century and to create a new situation for reforming
and developing these firms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the reforms and opening-up began, Jiang said, coastal
parts of eastern China have had swift development but that
development in the western part of the country is also
increasing. However, it still lags far behind, he said, noting
that the country is doing everything possible to solve this
problem.
</P>
<P>
The relevant measures include: giving more state assistance to
the central and western parts of China, giving priority to their
infrastructure and exploration of resources, gradually using a
regulated finance-transfer payment system, encouraging more
domestic and overseas investment in these areas, further
developing various forms of co-operation between central and
western and rather more-developed eastern coastal parts of China,
Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the gap between the central, western and eastern
parts of China can be narrowed, he said.

institutional aspects in the "global process" of enlargement. But
Germany wants the summit to only focus on the issue of
enlargement.

</P>
<P>
The premier went on to say that a good momentum of development

<HEADLINE> India Develops Diagnostic Kit for HIV Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua)-- India's biochemists at the
Delhi University have developed a simple two-minute test for
simultaneous detection of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) that
causes AIDS, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The test requires just a drop of blood, a glass slide and a
special cocktail reagent which they have developed. The result can
be seen with naked eyes and no instruments are needed. If the
addition of the reagent caused clumping of the blood, the sample
is positive for HIV, otherwise it is negative.
</P>
<P>
A cocktail of relevant fusion protein are used in the reagent
to detect HIV strains. The reagent has been evaluated in
commercially available blood samples and also in a large number of
samples taken from Indian patients.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Foreign Exchange Reserves Hit New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Latest estimates show that
Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars, Bangladesh's national weekend newspaper Holiday
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserves were falling
drastically, raising doubts over the government's ability to face
any sudden external shock, the newspaper warned.
</P>
<P>
"This is an alarming sign," the newspaper quoted one senior
banker as saying.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign exchange reserves is equivalent to only
two months' import bill, the newspaper said, adding that ideally,
the country needs reserves enough for meeting at least four
months' import payments.
</P>
<P>
This drastic fall in the foreign exchange reserves was
attributable to the recent payment of a substantial amount to the
Asian Clearing Union, Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Even reserves at the level of 1.6 billion dollars, as
Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria had said last week,
were not "comfortable" for an economy like Bangladesh, said an
economist working for the Bangladesh Institute of Development
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Another senior banker working at a national commercial bank
said the central bank officials had been asked to chalk out some
immediate steps in this regard, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Cancels Plan to Attend ASEAN Informal Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto,
on the advice of his doctors, has canceled his plan to attend next
week's informal ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The president has instructed Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to
represent him at the informal summit, to be held on December 15
and 16, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also gave up his plan to visit the grave of his late
wife, Tien Soeharto, in Solo, East Java Province, on Saturday
since his doctors advised him not to take a long trip, Moerdiono
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president had also decided not to make a trip to
Tehran, Iran, to attend the summit meeting of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference from December 9 to 11. Doctors had advised
him to take a full 10-day rest.
</P>
<P>
The president needs to further restore his health despite the
fact that he has fully recovered from his overseas trip from
November 18 to 29 which took him to Namibia, South Africa, Canada
and Saudi Arabia, said Moerdiono, who together with Alatas visited
the presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
"If the president makes another long trip, it could take a
longer time for him to restore his health," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Alatas said that during the informal ASEAN
summit, the nine members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will meet with three of their dialogue partners --
China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said he will deliver a message from Soeharto on the
cancellation of his participation in the informal summit to
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Moerdiono said Soeharto had decided to attend the
ASEAN meeting amid rumors that the president was seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
The rumors had pushed the value of the Indonesian rupiah to a
record low of 4,600 against the U.S. dollar, about 90 percent
lower than at the beginning of this year. The currency
strengthened Thursday after the announcement of Soeharto's
decision to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the summit will discuss the monetary
crisis in Southeast Asia and how to face the 21st century in East
Asia and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Explosion Kills 7 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
feared to have been roasted to death when fire caused by the
explosion of a tanker engulfed no fewer than eight houses
Thursday night in the capital city of Ogun State, western
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Also burnt beyond redemption were two trailer tankers, one
tipper lorry and a taxi cab, while an estimated 15 persons were
severely injured, the Daily Champion reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted eye-witnesses as saying that the inferno
started at about 7:30 Thursday evening when a petrol tanker
ascending a sloppy hill suddenly lost gravity and its tank tipped
against a nearby house by the road.
</P>
<P>
A resultant explosion ignited fire sparks which, one after
another, almost completely razed down no fewer than eight houses,
including two-story buildings.
</P>
<P>
As incident occurred on the hill top, the sight of the flames
was visibly growing in almost every part of Abeokuta, an ancient
city about 100 km to the Nigeria-Benin border.
</P>
<P>
The fire was still raging as of 10:00 Thursday night and the
efforts of the state fire service firemen, who arrived at the
scene early enough with their engines, seemed to make little
success, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Official accounts of casualties and victims are yet to be
known.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Fall Before Stabilizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices dipped this week
before stabilizing at the last sales for the year, the Australian
Council of Wool Exporters said today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator dropped 10 Australian cents (6.6
U.S. cents) to close at 698 cents (462 U.S. cents) a kilogram
clean while the western indicator slid 9 Australian cents (6 U.S.
cents) from the last Fremantle sale a fortnight ago to finish at
644 Australian cents (427 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
About 132,030 bales were offered, with a pass-in rate of 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The market fell initially early in the week but stabilized on
the final day with the easing of the Australian dollar against the
U.S. dollar," the council said in its weekly wool market review.
</P>
<P>
"Generally prices were lower in the fine and medium wools due
to uncertain demand from European buyers, and the Asian economic
crisis continues to have an effect on the market."
</P>
<P>
China's snapping up of coarser wool kept prices for these
micron categories firm.
</P>
<P>
Sales will resume on January 5 in Melbourne and Fremantle with
about 74,900 bales rostered for sale.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly wool report, Wesfarmers Dalgety said the
stabilization suggested that prices should hold about this level
when the market re-opens.
</P>
<P>
Other factors expected to support prices include the continued
weakness of the Australian dollar, Chinese demand for medium to
broad wools and smaller quantities for sale in January.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore when the market resumes in January, prices are
expected to open at similar levels to this week," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"However the outlook beyond this is dependent on the extent of
the impact of the Asian economic crisis," it said.

<HEADLINE> Project Brings Greater Hope To Chinese Children And Their Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- School-age children are not
the only beneficiaries of Project Hope, China's largest charitable
organization for education, as their families became better-off as
well.
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Hu Xiaolin resumed her studies at the Jinzhai
Hope Primary School in east China's Anhui Province. The school,
which was built in May, 1990 with Project Hope funds, was the
first in China.
</P>
<P>
Then, Hu started to teach her parents some planting techniques
she learned at school three years ago, and they started planting
Chinese cabbage, cucumbers, and green peppers in
plastic-film-covered sheds. The money earned from the vegetables
helped increase their income, and they moved out of their old
thatched cottage and into a two-story brick house this spring.
</P>
<P>
The project not only helps poor school-age children go to
school, but turns primary schools into sources of information
about agronomy and technology, according to Xu Yongguang,
secretary general of the China Youth Development Foundation
(CYDF), which began Project Hope eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
CYDF got Hope primary schools to add vocational education to
their basic curriculum when it found out that most rural students
return to their village to farm instead of going on to college,
after they receive a nine-year education. This is particularly
true in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Jinzhai, students from 47 Hope primary schools
in the county have added two books to their school bags: one
applies to local conditions and local needs, the other is about
planting techniques.
</P>
<P>
The two special textbooks, which were compiled by local
education department, discuss silkworm breeding, white mulberry
planting, raising gastrodia elata, a type of traditional Chinese
medicine, cultivating the Chinese chestnut, and processing tea.
</P>
<P>
And, at the Quxian Hope Primary School in nearby Zhejiang
Province, students even get to practice what they learn, on the
school's farm by planting trees and flowers, raising pigs, and
processing feed.
</P>
<P>
CYDF offers training courses in agronomy and technology at its
teachers' training center. It also plans to allocate special funds
for a group of Hope primary schools for vocational education.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, Project Hope has helped 1.5 million
dropouts return to school and has built more than 6,000 primary
schools, with nearly one billion yuan (approximately 120 million
US dollars) in donations from China and overseas.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets With Mongolian NDP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee's Political Bureau, said here today that
the Chinese and Mongolian peoples have a tradition of friendly
feelings towards each other.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks while meeting with a Mongolian National
Democratic Party delegation led by its vice-president Bat-uul,
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government have always placed great
importance on the good-neighborly relations with Mongolia, and
have respected the social system and the road of development
chosen by the Mongolian people in accordance with their own
circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he is glad that the Mongolian NDP has sent a delegation
here to officially establish friendly relations with the CPC. "We
are ready to set up and develop friendly relations with the
Mongolian party in line with the four principles of acting
independently, full equality, mutual respect and non-interference
in each other's internal affairs and further promote the
good-neighborly Sino-Mongolia ties in a comprehensive, stable and
healthy way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bat-uul said that his party is pleased to see that bilateral
co-operation in the economic, trade, scientific, and cultural
sectors has continued to increase in recent years, and that
Mongolia appreciates China's achievements in the reforms and
opening-up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party is willing to develop friendly
co-operative ties with the CPC to further enhance relations between
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian delegation arrived in China on December 8. They
are here as guest of the CPC. On December 9, they held talks with
Dai Bingguo, director of the International Department of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also visit Hefei and Shanghai cities.

<HEADLINE> Feature: French Wine Dealer in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Alain Ponzard came to Hong
Kong six months before the handover to look after the regional
office of SOPEXA, a French semi-governmental agency to promote the
country's wines and food around the world.
</P>
<P>
Now more than five months after the handover, Ponzard said that
the biggest change that drew his attention after July 1 was on
the mailbox -- the British royal crown was replaced by a humming
bird logo of the Special Administrative Region's Postal Department.
</P>
<P>
Business, as usual, means more and more work to do, said the
Frenchman. On the heel of a Medoc wine tasting seminar last month
for professionals, the managing director of SOPEXA's Hong Kong
Office is now busy with a six-week French Wine Festival which
targets men in the street.
</P>
<P>
His cozy office is filled with bundles of pamphlets featuring
three high-heeled glasses of wines on the cover -- for publicity
use at the on-going festival.
</P>
<P>
The small brochure introduces to beginners the basic knowledge
of wines from France, ranging from the classification to
characteristics of French wines, from wine-brewing regions in
France to how to see, smell, taste, and store wines.
</P>
<P>
Wine, more than anything else, is immediately associated with
France, said the little book's opening sentence. That's the
competitive edge for Ponzard to promote French wine in Hong Kong
and other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that more and more people in Hong Kong and in Asia have
found favorites with wines as they come to believe that drinking
wines is healthy and fashionable.
</P>
<P>
Fast economic growth in Asia has also made it possible for the
increasingly affluent population to afford a variety of wines,
either cheap Vins de Table for a dozen HK dollars (1.5 U.S.
dollars) or an expensive bottle of Appellations d'Origine
Controlee (AOC) for more than 10,000 HK dollars (1,280 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ponzard couldn't help getting excited when talking about French
wine, which is on the top of his marketing list in Asia. "Unlike
the saturated European market, Asia is booming with great
potential," said the Frenchman. "The market is growing so fast
that there are a lot of opportunities to seize and a lot of things
to do."
</P>
<P>
The French wine is dominating in the Hong Kong market, where
two out of three bottles of still wine were imported from France
in the first six months of this year. Though a considerable amount
of the imported wine is for re-export to other places of Asia, the
local consumption has surged into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The amount of wine consumed by Hong Kong people, measured by
duty-paid imports of wine, surged by 22 percent from the previous
year to reach 5.88 million liters in 1996. The momentum continued
into the first half of this year, when local consumption rose
sharply by 90 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite the remarkable increase, Ponzard said that less than
one liter of wine is consumed per head per year in Hong Kong, far
below the world average consumption of eight liters per person
per year.
</P>
<P>
"The discrepancy indicates vast potential for growth," he said.
"But we must work hard to keep the leading position because of the
keen competition." Other wine-brewing countries the United States
and Australia, Italy, Chile and Spain, all made a foray into Hong
Kong, which plays a pivotal role in the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Ponzard said the biggest difficulty now he has encountered is
that he cannot understand Cantonese, the Chinese dialect used by
over 90 percent of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
"I'm now learning Cantonese," he said. "And I hope I could
communicate smoothly with my clients someday to know what they
like or don't like."
</P>
<P>
His two daughters, one two and the other five, are also
learning Cantonese. Ponzard moved his four-member family from
Paris to Hong Kong as he took the current post.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman fell in love with the Chinese culture nine years
ago when he traveled to China for the first time. "That's why I
was happy when a job in Hong Kong is available to me," he said.
The Chinese language is imaginative in this Frenchman's mind. For
instance, he said, in Chinese movie is called "electric shadow".
</P>
<P>
"I want my daughters to go to school in Hong Kong," said
Ponzard, who believed that the experience in Asia could help
broaden their vision.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Herbalists Advised to Adhere to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan herbalists and
healers are advised to adhere their professional ethics, The
Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Batte Salongo, the publicity secretary of the National
Council of Traditional Healers and Herbalists Association
(NACOTHA), urged the herbalists and traditional healers to stop
diagnosing diseases by spirit.
</P>
<P>
The spirit-guided herbs have caused many deaths, he told
NACOTHA practitioners in central Mubende district.
</P>
<P>
NACOTHA will revoke its certificate to those practitioners who
failed to fulfill its by-laws, Batte warned.
</P>
<P>
Traditional medicine enjoys high popularity among local
residents, especially among women and in rural areas. But
spirit-guided herbs are tarnishing its merit, Batte noted.
</P>
<P>
Some herbalists impose high fee from patients, local residents
here said. Batte advised herbalists to launch income-generating
industries such as goat and poultry raising for his families,
avoiding exorbitant fees for patients.

<HEADLINE> Macao Bank Enters World Top 1,000 List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Tai Fung Bank, a leading local
bank, has entered the world top 1,000 list to become the
only locally-funded bank in Macao for the entry.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the bank, which moved into its new
headquarters building today, said the monthly magazine "The
Banker" gave the bank 986th place in terms of strength.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Macao-based bank ranked 956th in terms of
dimensions, 261st in terms of consolidation, 134th in terms of
capital profit returns and 117th in terms of property profit
returns.
</P>
<P>
First established in 1941 as a money exchange shop by the then
well-known local businessman Ho In and others, Tai Fung Bank was
registered as the first local-capital bank in 1972.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Bank of China joined in, holding half of the
bank's shares. The registered capital was raised to 160 million
patacas (about 20 million U.S. dollars at the 1984 exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
After the capital injection from the Bank of China, Tai Fung Bank
has grown into the largest local-capital bank in Macao, with its
total assets reaching 16.05 billion patacas (about 2.03 billion
dollars), 10 times those in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The bank has established commission relationship with more
than 300 banks around the world and also has a representative
office in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province.

make higher education in Sri Lanka and overseas available to
selected candidates from public servants and their children.
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, public servants and their children can
apply for higher education in Sri Lankan or overseas universities,
the Presidential Secretariat said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A special selection panel will assess the applicants'

<HEADLINE> Tanzania: No More Corporal Punishment for Pupils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's 1979
National Corporal Punishment Regulations should be repealed and
an alternative punishment mechanism to primary school pupils
should be introduced.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by participants at a workshop which ended in
Dar es Salaam Thursday, The Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the workshop on Corporal Punishment in Primary
Schools said there has been a grave misuse of the regulation
which has affected pupils physically and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
The regulation no longer serves its intended purpose to
discipline pupils, the participants said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of educating and making pupils learn from their
mistakes, the regulation is widely used to hurt them.
</P>
<P>
Studies indicate that children are most commonly beaten for
infractions such as coming late to school, answering incorrectly
in the classroom, making noises or not wearing uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Many other children have been punished for their parents'
failure to pay school fees or make donations. At times, children
are beaten for no reason at all, the workshop was told.
</P>
<P>
The practices are not only against the spirit of the
regulation, but also violate children's rights, the participants
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education and Culture must take immediate
measures to curb the malpractices, the participants appealed.
</P>
<P>
Pending the revocation of the 1979 regulation, the
participants said, efforts should be made to arouse public
awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
They suggested the government should issue a booklet to all
schools explaining the harmful effects of rampant corporal
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar was organized by Kuleana Center for
Children Rights in collaboration with the Save the Children's
Fund.
</P>
<P>
It draws participants from the Ministry of Education and
Culture, the Ministry of Community Development, Women and
Children Affairs, non-governmental organizations, embassies,
educational institutes and religious leaders.

The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair sat down at the Cabinet

offered him a "choice of history" -- violence and despair or peace
and progress.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel's Real Estate Prices Drop Sharply in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's housing prices
declined by five to 15 percent during the last 12 months, local
newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli industry sources as saying that the
sharpest decline was felt in luxury homes selling for 2 million to
2.5 million U.S. dollars along the coastal plain, which lost 15
percent of their value. In some cases their market value fell by
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
While prices of larger homes fell sharply, the prices of
two-bedroom apartments remained almost unchanged. The market for
these flats is relatively stable as the demand for small
apartments remains high.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the decline in housing prices is
mainly attributed to the steady decline in immigration and to the
general slowing-down of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The influx of new immigrants in the early 1990s is widely seen
as the main engine behind the overall sharp rise in housing prices
in this decade.
</P>
<P>
Another factor impacting the market is the decline in the
number of housing starts, which dropped 18 percent in the first
nine months of the year. If this decline continues, a shortage may
be felt in the market within a year, experts believe.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that many contractors are postponing
new projects and some have even returned land to the Israel
Lands Administration.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that while it is hard to predict when
the market will recover, the general estimate is that if the
overall economy starts accelerating in the second half of
1998, it will generate increased demand for homes, which in
turn will result in higher property prices.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Hails Sino-New Zealand Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua)-- There exist broad prospects
for the development of economic cooperation and trade between
China and New Zealand on the basis of equality and mutual benefit
as the two economies are complementary with each other, a Chinese
leader said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, said at a
meeting with Michael Hardie Boys, governor-general of New Zealand,
that although the two countries are different in social system and
ideology, there is no conflict of fundamental interests between
them.
</P>
<P>
Boys said that in the past 25 years, New Zealand have paid more
 attention to China, a great country with a long history. The New
Zealand people admire the significant achievements the Chinese
people have made and would like to learn a lot from the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that through people-to-people contacts
and cooperation in international organizations, the relations
between the two countries would be further advanced.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's domestic situation, Li said recent years
have witnessed great progress in various sectors of China, which
the Chinese people are pleased to see and satisfied with and the
international community has valued highly.
</P>
<P>
Historical experiences have proved however that it is
imperative to be sober-minded when tremendous fruits are yielded
and development is smooth, Li said, adding that a big gap still
remains between China and developed countries as far as the level
of economic development and science and technology is concerned.
</P>
<P>
"So, we must have a thorough understanding of the
contradictions and difficulties and tell our people the truth,"
Li said. "Only in this way can people get a full picture of the
situation and be prepared for overcoming various difficulties."
</P>
<P>
China has a long way to go to catch up with developed
countries, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here yesterday, is on a four-day official
goodwill visit to New Zealand at the invitation of the New
Zealand government.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese leader today
expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of Sino-New
Zealand ties and hoped that the two sides would make concerted
efforts to further push forward such relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Don McKinnon, New Zealand minister of
foreign affairs and trade, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, said China always attaches great importance to the
advancement of the ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li praised McKinnon as an old friend of China, who has
supported the development of Sino-New Zealand friendly ties for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said the frequent high-level meetings between the two
countries will play an important role in maintaining and
developing the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Although New Zealand has got a new prime minister recently, the
 country's foreign policy of friendship and cooperation with China
will not change, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the exchange of visits by top
leaders of the two countries would consolidate bilateral
cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, culture and
education.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The U.S. company United Parcel Service (UPS), the
world's largest courier firm with 22 billion U.S. dollars in
annual revenues, has set up office in Lebanon, local newspaper the
Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the launch of the Lebanon operations, UPS' Lebanese
customers will be able to have their packages and documents
delivered to over 200 countries and territories worldwide through
the company's services, said Roger Saade, general manager for UPS
Lebanon, at a press conference in Beirut on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The operations were officially launched on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Damian Bond, Middle East managing director for UPS, said the
lifting of U.S. restrictions against U.S. business activities in
Lebanon last July has made it possible for UPS to open direct
operations here.
</P>
<P>
Due to the restrictions, he said, UPS is the last of the big
express shipping companies to come to Beirut, but the company has
been involved in inbound business here through its partner firm
United Courier for several years, with annual growth rates of 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
He added that shipments out of Beirut will be routed through
Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, or London, and for the time being
the firm will use commercial carriers like the Middle East or
Emirates airlines for its Beirut traffic.
</P>
<P>
DHL and Amman-based Aramex currently dominate the Lebanese
market with the presence of the US-based Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese industrial exports reached around 26 million
U.S. dollars during November, compared with approximately 24
million dollars in October, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Saudi Arabia led the list of countries
importing Lebanese industrial goods, followed by Syria, France,
Jordan, Egypt, Russia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The International Fund for Agricultural Development
has decided to earmark 70 million U.S. dollars to finance three
agricultural development projects in Syria, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
These projects are located in the southern, northern and
coastal areas with the aim of promoting the living conditions of
rural youths and women, reclamation of land, and offering of
agricultural loans.
</P>
<P>
The fund is also examining an important Syrian project, the
cost of which exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars for the development
of desert and pasture lands in eight Syrian governorates. It will
be jointly financed by the fund, the Arab social development fund
as well as the Syrian government.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's housing prices declined by five to 15
percent during the last 12 months, local newspaper The Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli industry sources as saying that the
sharpest decline was felt in luxury homes selling for 2 million to
2.5 million U.S. dollars along the coastal plain, which lost 15
percent of their value. In some cases their market value fell by
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
While prices of larger homes fell sharply, the prices of
two-bedroom apartments remained almost unchanged. The market for
these flats is relatively stable as the demand for small
apartments remains high.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the decline in housing prices is
mainly attributed to the steady decline in immigration and to the
general slowing-down of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The influx of new immigrants in the early 1990s is widely seen
as the main engine behind the overall sharp rise in housing prices
in this decade.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Firms Doing Business With Iran: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran, which regards Israel
as an enemy, has been purchasing medical and hi-tech equipment
through subsidiaries of Israeli companies in Europe over the last
two years, according to a report of today's Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli industry sources as saying that the
equipment has been ordered by Iranian officials from Israeli
companies, such as Salad, a trading company which was established
to conduct trade with Iranian companies in fields ranging from
farming to communications.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that business circles close to Israel's trade
with Iran estimate the annual volume at a nine-digit figure in
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ilan Traitle, director-general of the Israel-based Medent
company, said that "the Iranians are interested in everything
that you can offer them."
</P>
<P>
Traitle said Medent trades with Iran through a third country,
which he would not name. He said that contacts with Iran were
launched during last June's Akema trade show in Frankfurt of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials are probing the possibility of
settling Israel's debt worth 1 billion U.S. dollars owned to Iran
in oil dealings decades ago, by having Russian companies pay the
debt. Israel would in turn buy Russian natural gas and invest in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Iran has quietly agreed to arbitration on the issue with the
help of Germany. Israeli officials, particularly National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, hope that an agreement with
Teheran could lead to the Islamic republic moderating its stance
toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Israel Radio reported that a group of 16
Israeli agriculture experts secretly visited Iran and met with its
deputy agriculture minister. Their visit reportedly came following
Iranian approaches to European subsidiaries of Israeli companies
in search of irrigation equipment and spare parts for tractors and
combines imported from Israel in the 1970s.

<P>
TOKYO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices continued
falling Friday with the key Nikkei index ending below the 16,000
mark for the first time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 145.85 points or 0.91 percent
from Thursday's close to 15,904.30 as traders were weighed down by
lingering pessimism over the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, sank 16.90 points or 1.39 percent to
1,198.84.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 970 million
shares, up from Thursday's 422.09 million shares with Hokkaido
Takushoku Bank as the leader.
</P>
<P>
On the third consecutive day decline, the Nikkei index closed
below the 16,000 line for the first time since November 25,
underlining the weakness of the market fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that Thursday's basic agreement in the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to support the financial system with 10
trillion yen (about 76.9 billion U.S. dollars) in public funds was
insufficient to spark buying.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year low of the Korean stock market hit steelmakers and
chemical firms hard, causing the Nikkei to momentarily lose more
than 300 points, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,329 issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers by 778 to 361, with 142 issues unchanged.

</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government of the 15 EU member countries and
Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission (EC), are
also expected to discuss EU's institutional reform and
agricultural policy among other things.
</P>
<P>
The 15 members need to find a consensus on whether to start
entry talks with all the 11 EU applicants or accept the
five-plus-one configuration recommended by the EC, the EU's
executive body, in July.
</P>
<P>
The five-plus-one configuration is made up by Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus, candidates the
EU considers to be advanced in political and economic terms. The
other five "pre-ins" are Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are expected to discuss if they need to set up a
European Conference to group the 11 candidates and Turkey, which
is also applying for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers failed in their last attempt Monday in
Brussels to find a compromise on the issue. The EC proposed to
start talks first with five-plus-one while Sweden and Denmark

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) will launch a project in China that will promote
the use of new technologies to help reduce the use of
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in the country's solvent sector,
a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government recently donated one million U.S. dollars
to UNDP for this project.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. official, the project will demonstrate
ODS-free cleaning technologies, and establish a sustainable
technology transfer mechanism that would allow China to
disseminate and apply these technologies in the use of cleaning
solvents.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the project, about 200 people including trainers,
government officials and managers of enterprises will have been
trained for the adoption of new technologies. Also, at least three
demonstration sites for cost-effective and appropriate ozone-free
and process/resource efficient technologies will have been set up
in Shanghai, the official said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 tons of ozone-depleting substances are used
annually in solvents used in China. The UNDP hopes that the
project will have a positive impact on both the global and
national environment.
</P>
<P>
Sweden will provide the funds to UNDP through the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency to support the
implementation and monitoring of the project. The project will be
carried out by China's National Environmental Protection Agency.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Inject $500m in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has planned to inject
over 500 billion shillings (some 500 million U.S. Dollars) into
telecommunications industries, The New Vision quoted a minister
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The sum will be spent in the next five years, said John
Nasasira, the Minister of Works, Transport and Communications.
</P>
<P>
The reward for the investment will be the improvement of
teledensity from 400 people now to 50 a line, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the second National Program for Information
Analysts (Napia) workshop earlier this week, the minister said
the main problem faced with by the country now is lack of enough
qualified specialists.
</P>
<P>
The high technology industries are the thrust of the
sustainable development his government is searching for, the
minister added. The thrust is most likely information, he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
But the service of qualified information specialists is
unaffordable due to the high training fees causing high salaries,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is characterized by a warm response from people
involved in telecommunications industry in the country, said
Norah Mulira, the sponsorer of the workshop and the acting
director of the Institute of Computer Science in Makerere
University. Many participants of the workshop are managers,
system developers, system designers, programmers and other
professionals. The attendants of the last year's workshop were
only trainers.
</P>
<P>
Developing information industry is an opportunity for a
developing country to catch up with the developed ones, Mulira
told the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Toll Increases to 29 in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The cholera toll in Nairobi
over the past 10 days rose to 29 with 15 more deaths reported
between last Saturday and yesterday, according to a Daily Nation
report today.
</P>
<P>
Jonah Kitheka, Executive Director of the Provide International
Center, said that the center was taking care of 20 cholera
patients in two tents pitched in the compound while scores lay
unattended in their homes.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the situation is deteriorating day after day,
and with the water shortage, the disease is spreading rapidly."
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper said that the cholera outbreak came at a
time of an acute water shortage in the capital city and its
environs with almost all residential estates being affected by
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Kirui, Nairobi medical officer of health said that
with the onset of the current rain season, the city council had
foreseen an outbreak of cholera and had set up a special
committee to formulate control measures.
</P>
<P>
The committee had gone round the city and isolated a few cases
which council hospitals were handled until the nurses' strike
started 14 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Kitheka noted that they were finding it hard to cope with the
swelling number of victims since desperate cases could not be
referring to the Kenyatta National Hospital owing to the on-going
nurses' strike.

<HEADLINE> China Kicks Off Anti-Dumping Investigation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wednesday announced an
investigation into the dumping of foreign newsprint on the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made it clear by this action that it
will not allow overseas companies to dump commodities in China and
will resort to legal means to oppose the practice.
</P>
<P>
Information from the State Commission of Economy and Trade
indicates that some imported foreign commodities have seriously
damaged such Chinese industrial sectors as steel, oil, sugar,
machine tools, program-controlled switchboards, plywood, glass,
wool, color film and newsprint.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign commodities were dumped at low prices to occupy
the Chinese market, an official said, causing serious damages to
some of China's industries.
</P>
<P>
China's newsprint industry has suffered the most from the
dumping of foreign commodities. Foreign newsprint is sold for 350
U.S. dollars per ton in China this year, but the international
market price for newsprint is 550 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that if the situation continues, China's newsprint
producers will completely collapse and be replaced by foreign
commodities.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 10, several newsprint enterprises from Jilin,
Guangdong, Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces formally asked MOFTEC to
investigate dumping by firms in the United States, Canada and
the Republic of Korea (ROK).

<HEADLINE> China Kicks Off Anti-Dumping Investigation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A MOFTEC spokesman said that anti-dumping is a legal way to
combat unequal competition and to protect domestic industries. The
anti-dumping agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO) also
encourages legal remedies.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the European Union carried out anti-dumping
investigations into China's exports of soluble saccharin.
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries have raised 280 anti-dumping cases over
China-made commodities for export, involving tens of billions
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some overseas companies in recent years, with the intention of
capturing the Chinese market, have dumped their products at very
low prices causing losses of tens of billions RMB yuan. Such
dumping has forced Chinese enterprises to lay off workers, caused
major setbacks for new emerging industries and driven many factories
to the edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC will begin dealing with anti-dumping applications from
domestic enterprises this year. Investigations will be conducted
of imported commodities that have entered the Chinese market at
lower-than-normal prices which resulted in real damages to
domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
As China's opening-up drive expands, China's domestic market
will be opened wider to the outside world, said the MOFTEC
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It has become more and more important that industrial
companies in China should study hard, master, and eventually learn
to use the anti-dumping weapon to avoid damages caused by the
dumping of foreign commodities on the Chinese market," said the
MOFTEC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese companies to resist unfair competition from
foreign commodities, and to protect the legitimate rights of
domestic industries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Pilots in Training in Turkey: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli pilots of fighter
jets have carried out 120 sorties in Turkey this year, many of
them practice for long-range missions, a newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post quoted a senior defense
official as saying that Israeli CH-53 transport helicopters have
also recorded over 120 sorties in the past year, since Israeli
airspace is limited.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Israeli helicopter pilots have become
familiar with the Turkish terrain. This helped them respond
quickly to a Turkish request last July to put out a fire at the
country's main munitions plant.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey singed a defense cooperation agreement in
early 1996, which allows pilots from both countries to train in
each other's countries. Israeli pilots have very restricted
airspace for training because of the small size of their own
country.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Turkish pilots are about to enhance their flight
training with advanced Israeli simulators and technology.
</P>
<P>
Israel's long-range flight training is mainly aimed at
launching cross-border air attacks against targets of enemy
countries that pose threats to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
The military cooperation has come under increasing criticism
by Muslim countries. On Wednesday, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel withdrew from the eighth Islamic summit held in Iran's
capital Teheran to avoid facing additional criticism of Turkey's
ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Demirel defended Turkey's military accord with Israel, saying
the agreement is bilateral and does not pose a threat to any
third country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint military maneuver among Israel, Turkey and
the United States is to be held January 5. Turkey said the aim of
the exercises is to develop joint training for sea-air search and
rescue operations among the three nations' fleets.
</P>
<P>
In another move to boost the bilateral military cooperation,
the semi-annual strategic talks between Turkey and Israel are to
be held in Turkish capital Ankara on December 22.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the third since the 1996 military alliance was
formed, are aimed at furthering an evaluation of joint threats,
such as ballistic missile threats from Iran and Syria, and
responses to them as well as numerous defense industry issues, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, exchange of visits by military leaders has also
intensified between Turkey and Israel. Earlier this month, Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai visited Ankara to discuss
boosting military ties, as well as Israel's supply of weapons to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, Turkish Defense Ministry Undersecretary Tuncer
Kilinc is to visit Israel to discuss details of the agreement of
modernizing Turkey's F-4 fighters by Israel. And Turkish Land
Forces Commander Huseyin Kivrikoglu is also to visit Israel in
January.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker Following Asia Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
half a U.S. cent weaker today, weighed down by falls in the
exchange rates of some of its counterparts in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended here at 66.31 U.S. cents, down from
66.70 previously. But it was up from a new four-year low of 66.10
during the local session.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is focusing on what is happening to our northern
neighbors," particularly the currencies of South Korea and
Indonesia, said National Australia Bank foreign exchange trading
manager Mike Eastaway.
</P>
<P>
"No one is taking any notice whatsoever of the local
fundamentals here. The economy is in reasonably good shape,
really."
</P>
<P>
Eastaway said investors were concerned about the impact of the
Asian currency crisis on Australia's trade balance, which is seen
likely to widen further into deficit during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the immediate outlook for the currency is for it
to edge down below 66 U.S. cents, possibly to as low as 65.80, in
weekend offshore dealings.
</P>
<P>
In Asia today, equities markets in Singapore, the Philippines
and Malaysia were all weaker on worries about the ongoing
financial crisis in the region and its effect on future economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended here at 86.21
Japanese yen, from 86.21 previously and at 1.1696 from 1.1900
against the Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Traffic Accidents Down in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of Japanese killed in
traffic accidents was slightly down this year, with the death toll
reaching the 9,000 mark nine days later than last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Policy Agency (NPA) said in a report today that
the number of traffic accident deaths stood at 9,006 as of
Thursday, down from 9,320 at the same point last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan's traffic accident deaths only record the number of
people who die within 24 hours of an accident.
</P>
<P>
The NPA is hopeful that the toll could stay below the 10,000
mark for the second consecutive year this year. The toll fell
below 10,000 for the first time in nine years last year.
</P>
<P>
Hokkaido in northern Japan has the highest number of traffic
accident deaths with 575, while Tottori and Kochi prefectures,
both in western Japan, have recorded the least traffic accident
deaths with 64 each, the NPA said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China and Kazakhstan have made
great strides this year in oil-production cooperation, Kuanysh
Sultanov, ambassador of the Republic of Kazakhstan, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan expects to export 100,000 tons of crude oil to China
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for energy has been fueled by rapid economic
growth, while Kazakhstan is rich in oil reserves. The combination
offers significant opportunities for bilateral cooperation,
Sultanov said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan invited bids for two oil development projects this
year. China National Petroleum and Gas Corporation was the winning
bidder on both projects.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement involving 9.5 billion U.S. dollars
and signed by both governments, the two countries will build a
3,000-kilometer oil pipeline between the western part of
Kazakhstan and Karamay in Xinjiang in northwest China. Scheduled
for completion in 2005, the pipeline will transport 20 million
tons of oil from Kazakhstan to China annually.

<HEADLINE> Public Welcome Zambia's Inter-Party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Public opinion
welcomed the preliminary meeting held here Tuesday and Wednesday
to map out an agenda for the planned inter-party dialog to settle
the contentious issues like constitution, according to Zambia
Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Renowned political commentator Elias Mpondela was quoted as
saying that "I think dialog is always important in resolving
contentious issues. All those people there are Zambians and they
have the capacity to resolve their own issues."
</P>
<P>
He urged everybody to be genuine and said the interests must
be national.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized genuineness and unity of purpose as the two
necessary points for the dialog to be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be the mirror of democracy and not the center of
conflict. Maturity must be reflected in the way we resolve
conflicts and so I call on all parties to be serious with
national interests so that the outcome of the talks can reflect
the Zambian culture of peace," Mpondela said.
</P>
<P>
Harriet Chombela, a secretary of a firm, believed the
inter-party talks will help resolve the contentious issues
because they will provide an opportunity for all the parties to
bring out their views.
</P>
<P>
"I think they should go ahead. It is better so that they
listen to each other's views" she said.
</P>
<P>
Chileshe Kamona, also a firm secretary, said the talks are
necessary to avoid finger pointing in future, but they should
have included independent parliament members to be truly
representative.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the agenda, I think it is necessary to have the
inter-party talks so that no body will be blamed in future," he
said.

For Mwando Maswabi, the inter-party talks are a good idea but
he is not sure about the genuineness of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should have lifted the state of
emergency and freed those in detention to provide a conducive
environment for meaningful inter-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Singoyi, a firm accountant, said the inter-party talks
are necessary but the bottom line should be national interests.

<HEADLINE> Half Of Shanghai Families Own Their Own Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- One and a half million
families in urban Shanghai, or about a half of the city's total
households, own their own flats, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
As individual incomes increase and housing becomes more
commercial, more urbanites are able to buy their own home.
</P>
<P>
Some 650,000 households have bought their government-subsidized
flats since 1994, when Shanghai started to sell
government-subsidized apartments, and more than 800,000 families
have purchased free-market flats.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that more local residents will buy their own
houses with the new housing system, sources say. Since the
beginning of the year, real estate developers in Shanghai have
tried various methods to attract more people to buy free-market
flats, and banks have been offering favorable loans that are
long-term and lower interest.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, China Construction Bank's Shanghai
Branch issued 3.4 billion yuan in housing loans, exceeding last
year's. As housing reforms increase and the cost of rent versus
the cost of buying changes, it will force more residents to buy
their own flats.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to increase its per capita living space to more
than 10 sq.m. during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), and the
city government has started a comfortable housing project which is
aimed at providing housing for with low or moderate-income
families.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Remove Sentry Posts: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said today that the Greek Cypriot side had made it clear
it would not remove its sentry posts along the cease-fire line in
a way leaving residential areas unprotected.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Luxembourg to attend a European Union
(EU) summit meeting, Clerides made the remarks when commenting on
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report on the renewal of the
mandate of the Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.N. Security Council Wednesday, the
U.N. chief expressed disappointment that measures to reduce
tension along the Green Line in Cyprus had not been implemented,
and urged the Cypriot government to accept a package of
U.N. proposals agreed to by the Turkish forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has proposed to the Greek Cypriot National Guard and
the Turkish forces to extend unmanning of army posts along the
demarcation line, to remove loaded weapons and define a code of
conduct.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Greek Cypriot side had made some suggestions
on U.N. proposals on the issue, but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
"What the Turks have said was that if we were to accept the
U.N. proposals, they would also accept them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north in 1974 when Turkey invaded
the country and took the northern third of island.
</P>
<P>
A 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across Cyprus separates the
island into two parts. A 1,200 strong U.N. peace-keeping force is
patrolling along the buffer zone, which was set up in 1964 when
conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities broke
out.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg summit, scheduled for Saturday, will be attended
by members of the European Council, European Commission and
associated countries.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clerides said that the EU summit was expected to
reiterate that membership negotiations with Cyprus would begin in
April 1998.

the concluding of the summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference. He is believed to avoid being criticized by Islamic

by Iraq and Syria, indirectedly accusing Ankara of establishing
close military relationship with Israel.

agreements in 1996 in training of armed forces and defense
industry.

GUANGZHOU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The city of Guangzhou, in
south China's Guangdong Province, expects to solve the housing
problem of people whose average per capita living space is less
than 5 sq.m. by offering another 4,000 apartments for sale.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the city's 11-year drive to ease the housing
shortage, which meant moving some 26,000 households to new homes.
Since 1986 its initial goal was to solve the housing problem for
those whose average capita living space was less than 2 sq.m., and
the number gradually rose to 5 sq.m.
</P>
<P>
In that time, the Guangzhou city government has built five
large-scale residential areas and buildings that were sold at cost
to some 26,000 households, involving 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the remaining 3,269 households with
housing problems will be given a choice of 4,000 apartments.
</P>
<P>
Starting next year, the city will give priority to a
"comfortable housing project", which will provide houses for low
and medium-income families, the municipal sources said.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Questions Existence of Northwest China Lake Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has ruled
out the possibility that there is an animal the size of a boat in
a lake in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Local ethnic minorities have had legends for years about a
mysterious creature in Khanas Lake in the Altay Mountains of
northwestern China, which frequently attacked cattles and people,
and a group of university teachers and students who took a photo
of the animal recently support other reports that say it could be
a kind of "red fish" the size of a 10-meter boat.
</P>
<P>
However, Gao Ailiu, of the Xinjiang Aquatic Science Research
Institute, says that there's never been a red fish as big as a
boat in the region, and explains, "The water of Khanas Lake is
quite cold and there is not enough food to support any animal
weighing over one hundred kilograms."
</P>
<P>
The lake monster has been previously described as a vertebrate
weighing more than a ton, but, "Several research teams, including
one from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have studied the lake,
but didn't find any such animal," Gao says. He points out that the
monster might be the result of refracted light or an inverted
image in the water. Another possibility is that people thought
that thousands of red fish that gathered to lay eggs were one
fish, when seen from far away.
</P>
<P>
China's most famous lake monster has been one said to be living
in Tianchi Lake in the Changbai Mountains near the border with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. People say that it is a
Chinese version of the Loch Ness monster, but many scientists are
skeptical about it.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Technology has become a
major factor in Guangdong's economic development and is expected
to help the southern Chinese province catch up with other
economies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Government sources say that some 40 percent of the province's
economic production is now from high-tech industries, including
computers, electronics, new materials, and bio-technology.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is one of China's most prosperous provinces, whose
production accounts for ten percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
The province has attracted people from prestigious universities
like Beijing University and Qinghua University to open research
institutes and companies.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, more than 100,000 scientists and
technicians have left northern China for Guangdong, where they can

<HEADLINE> Open Mind Helpful in Finding New Jobs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese laid-off workers
should open their minds to new opportunities for jobs, said a
story in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
After the initial shock and worry, some Shanghai women who were
laid off as textile workers found new opportunities as airline
flight attendants and shop assistants.
</P>
<P>
Other laid-off workers have taken part-time jobs, replacing
those rural women who sought employment in the cities. As they
open their minds, they widen their job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, more than 800,000 laid-off workers in Shanghai have
found jobs, the story said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xianghua, a laid-off factory worker in Chongqing, created
a private electronics business in 1993. With his thriving business
combining investment, industrial production and scientific
research, Yang recently merged with his former employer.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 25 percent of non-public business runners
come from blue-collar families, 22 percent are former enterprise
officials and 12 percent are technicians. They have found success
in their new jobs, the story said.
</P>
<P>
The country's underdeveloped service sector provides jobs in
such fields as nursing, domestic work and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
An employment fair, organized by Chongqing's trade unions and
concerned agencies, planned to invite applications from laid-off
workers for 3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although nearly 10,000 applicants came to the fair, only 600
signed contracts.

<P>
Many workers laid off from state-owned enterprises were
reluctant to take jobs with non-public businesses, accounting for
the most of those at the employment fair.
</P>
<P>
A large luxury guest house in Hangzhou in east China's coastal
Zhejiang Province planned to employ workers from those laid
off. Only about 30 jobless people applied.
</P>
<P>
The country created 11.7 million new jobs in 1996, with 4.4
percent in state-owned enterprises, 23.7 percent with collectives
and nearly 72 percent with private businesses.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent survey shows that 72 percent of those laid
off would first choose state-run enterprises for
re-employment. The state industrial enterprises now have surplus
labor of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has
formulated the principle of keeping public ownership in a dominant
position and having diverse economic sectors develop alongside.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue adjusting and improving the ownership
structure so as to further release and develop production.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the laid-off workers should change their minds and choose
jobs which are most suitable to themselves, the story said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Majority of Shanghai Couples Content with Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Lastest survey in Shanghai
shows that two-thirds of 800 married couples surveyed are content
with their marriages, while nearly one-third of them thought it
just so-so.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 94.5 percent of men and 94.4 percent of
women chose their own partners. Those who sought parental opinions
did so voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The couples, who met each other by chance accounted for 45.6
percent of the total, while the rest used matchmakers, according
to today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Most of these surveyed still pursue the criteria they set for
choosing a partner before getting married. Their criteria included
health, age, character and habits, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Only a few said they would pick job titles and income as
criteria rather than family background and political status if
they chose again.
</P>
<P>
Though only 36.8 percent of males and 29 percent of females say
they married for love, about 90 percent of the males and 83
percent of the females said they were quite satisfied with their
partners after marriage.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Using Fly Ash to Build Expressway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has used 11 million tons of fly ash to construct 72
kilometers of roadbed on the Shijiazhuang-Anyang Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will be part of the Beijing-Shenzhen
Expressway. At present, construction of the Hebei section is
nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, all the fly ash discharged during
past decades in the electricity generation process of thermal
power plants in three cities in Hebei Province -- Shijiazhuang,
Xingtai and Handan -- have been depleted for the roadbed.
</P>
<P>
Local departments have spent an additional 100 million yuan on
the construction of roadbed with fly ash, creating one billion
yuan of economic returns by saving 773 hectares of land from
destruction and by reducing fly ash storage areas by 266.7
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power generation is prevalent in Hebei Province. The
accumulation of fly ash not only has caused serious environmental
problems, but also has occupied large areas of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1993 the Hebei Provincial Bureau of
Communications, with the full support of relevant state
departments, started using fly ash to build roadbeds for the
Beijing-Shijiazhuang and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan expressways.

<HEADLINE> Eighth Beijing Party Congress Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Beijing Municipal
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The current congress, attended by 700 delegates, will summarize
the work since the Seventh Congress five years ago and establish
plans for the capital city's development in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The week-long congress will elect a new leadership for the
Beijing Municipal Party Committee. The congress convenes every
five years.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of the 12 million local residents are CPC
members.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee,
delivered a speech at the congress, on behalf of the Seventh
Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jia said Beijing's economy sustained increases in the past five
years. By the end of 1997, the capital's gross domestic product
(GDP) is expected to exceed 180 billion yuan (about 21.6 billion
U.S. dollars) at an average annual rate of more than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the output of the industrial, agricultural and service
sectors will account for 4.7 percent, 41.5 percent and 53.8
percent of the total GDP, respectively. The service sector is
expected to develop rapidly and become a major driving force for
local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jia also recalled the great changes Beijing has made in the
past five years in economic reform, urban infrastructure,
opening-up, improving local people's living standard, promotion of
cultural and ethical progress, creating a democratic legal system
and building the Party.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jia stressed further improvement in Beijing's
role as a national political and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
He said while serving the work and life of the local residents,
the capital's various undertakings must serve the work of the
Party, government and army departments, serve the development of
the country's science and technology, education, and cultural
causes, and increase exchanges with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Jia said, Beijing citizens will live a fairly
comfortable life by the year 2000, and a socialist market economic
system will initially take shape in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the capital's economic strength, social
development and local people's living standard will reach the
level of developed capitals around the world, Jia said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Slides to New Historical Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency, the
peso, fell by 4 percent to a new record low of 37.36 pesos to the
U.S. dollar today, triggering a suspension of trading beyond that
level for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said heavy demand for dollars in the wake of a sharp
plunge in the South Korean currency, the won. pushed the peso down
while the Philippines' Central Bank stopped intervention to make
the peso competitive against other Southeast Asian currencies
which are also faltering.
</P>
<P>
The drop "does not mean that our economy is not good,"
President Fidel Ramos said, adding, "One must not be apprehensive
about what is happening outside. We are affected but we are bound
to recover."
</P>
<P>
The Bankers Association of the Philippines said the peso
reached the third and final volatility band set by the country's
central bank during this morning's trading session.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a further sharp fall of the peso, the central bank
decided that the peso must not trade above or below 4 percent of
Thursday's weighted average of 35.687 pesos per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso has devaluated by some 41 percent from 26.4 pesos a
dollar in July to the current level in the financial storm
sweeping much of Asia.

<HEADLINE> Decline in Number of Job-Related Illnesses in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of job-related
illnesses in China has declined in recent years, according to a
recent international health symposium in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China has improved monitoring in the workplace and adopted more
regulations, Liang Youxin, a professor at Shanghai Medical
Sciences University and director of a World Health Organization
(WHO) occupational health center in Shanghai, told the symposium.
</P>
<P>
"China should not ignore health and worker safety during a
period of economic development," said Liang, pointing out that
Chinese records describe occupational hazards and preventive
measures some 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The country has started academic institutes and an occupational
health and service network since the mid 1950s, he said, and most
state-funded enterprises have provided emergency medical treatment
for about 40 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, lung diseases account for more than two-thirds of
all job-related illnesses in China, which include chemical
poisoning and skin ailments.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was attended by more than 200 specialists from
the Shanghai Medical Sciences University, and Harvard University
and the Liberty Mutual Group of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Shippers Want Tanzania Export Levies Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The dredging of the
entrance channel to the Dar es Salaam Harbor will be a waste of
money if the Tanzanian government maintains huge levies on
exports, a shipping official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General of the Tanzanian Shippers' Council
(TSC), Ulimbakisya Kamola, said in Dar es Salaam Thursday that
"exports should be encouraged instead of being discouraged."
</P>
<P>
The 13.8 billion shillings (about 22 million US dollars)
project, undertaken by the Tanzanian Harbors Authority and being
executed by a Dutch company Ham, involves the widening of
entrance of the Dar es Salaam harbor to accommodate bigger
vessels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a preparatory meeting for the eighth TSC
annual general meeting slated for next Tuesday, Kamola said
exports such as coffee are subjected to too many levies and
taxes, according to a report by "The Guardian" today.
</P>
<P>
"The coffee buyer pays levies to the regional, district and
village authorities, while purchasing the crop from the farmers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On top of these charges, he said, the government has imposed
export fee of two percent and a stamp duty of 1.2 percent of
export proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Kamola said pre-shipment inspection companies are also paid
1.2 percent as tax assessment and inspection fees.
</P>
<P>
"These payments are unnecessary costs to the shippers," he
said, appealing to the government to readjust rates of the levies
imposed on shippers.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should realize that the captive cargo
in landlocked Zambia and Malawi now have alternative routes to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, competition is stiff," he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The TSC annual meeting, will attract Customs Department and the
National Shipping Agencies Company, banks, railway operators, road
haulers, shipping inspection companies, the Dar es Salaam Handling
Company and clearing and forwarding agents.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Repays Huge Foreign Loans Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced today that his government has
repaid 12 billion ringgit (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars) of its
foreign loans ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
If they had not been repaid when the country was enjoying a
good economy, the loans could have reached 25 billion ringgit
(about 6.7 billion U.S. dollars) to 30 billion ringgit (about 8.1
billion dollars) in the wake of the present economic slowdown and
depreciating ringgit, Anwar told reporters after a function in
Subang Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also the country's finance minister, urged the
private sector to heed the federal government's decisions to cut
expenditure by at least 18 percent next year besides an immediate
10 percent across-the-board cutback in both operating and
development expenditures and 8 percent in selected spending.
</P>
<P>
As announced by Anwar earlier, the government's measures to
strengthen economic stability and restore investor confidence also
include a pay cut of 10 percent for ministers and deputy ministers
and 3 percent for officers in super-scale C and above.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the private sector to trim excessive salaries
paid to professionals and management executives and reminded the
private sector to be prudent in their investments.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that next year the government may see its earnings
affected due to slower growth in corporate income with the economy
forecast to grow at 4 to 5 percent compared to 8 percent during
the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of an anticipated reduction in government
earnings, it would be much better to cut expenditure early.
"Because had we overspent, the country has to be in debt. When we
are in debt... the country would be burdened and so will our
future generation."
</P>
<P>
The minister said it is time to make the necessary adjustments
and take precautionary measures to overcome the economic and
financial turbulence affecting the region.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for continuously increasing the
national savings rate, now at 39 percent, as investments stand at
43 to 44 percent, thus creating a gap.
</P>
<P>
The savings-investment gap has been covered by foreign debts
and this has put the country at a disadvantageous position, he
said, adding, "We must have the ability to utilize local fund."

BEIHAI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Coastal areas in southwest
China's Guangxi Province are expected to catch up with other
coastal provinces and cities in infrastructure construction by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the province has invested more than 17 billion yuan
(2.12 billion U.S. dollars) in infrastructure construction in
three coastal cities -- Beihai, Qinzhou and Fangchenggang.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the three cities, which encompass 20,299 square
kilometers with a population of four million, has developed slowly
in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nanning-Kunming railway now connects the three
cities with other areas of the Southwest and provides the impetus
for their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province, with its 1,595
kilometers of coastline, has built three large ports and 76 docks
with an annual handling capacity of 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen airlines now link the province with other major
cities of the country, which improves trade conditions.
</P>
<P>
While completing the Qinzhou-Litang railway and the extension
of the Beihai airport, the province also has been busy
constructing the Nanning-Fangchenggang and Qinzhou-Beihai
expressways.

result of recent economic changes. At one point, 30 percent of
Liaoning's 10 million industrial workers were jobless.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the provincial government offered jobs for 168,000
jobless people and the number rose to 400,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, however, the province needs to
provide new jobs for another two million people, so emphasis will
be placed on finding 800,000 jobs in large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
The province has 926 large and medium-sized enterprises,
accounting for one tenth of China's total.
</P>
<P>
To provide more help for laid-off workers, trade unions across
the province have set up 628 training centers where they can
receive vocational training before looking for new work.
</P>
<P>
Government departments, trade unions, and women's federations
in 14 cities have also formed special groups to co-ordinate job
placement, and 290 job agencies have been established in the
province in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Bonded Zone Exerting Strong Influence on Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bonded Zone of Tianjin,
the leading industrial center in north China, has become an
import-export distribution center with a sphere of influence
covering Beijing, Tianjin, the Bohai Sea Rim and the central and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Between January and November, goods held at the bonded zone's
customs office were valued at 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, a 64
percent rise over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the bonded zone attributed the growth to improved
services.
</P>
<P>
Simplified procedures have helped lower enterprises' foreign
trade costs. The area's efficiency has improved because 95 percent
of the businesses engaged in foreign trade and processing have
been connected with the customs office's computer network.
</P>
<P>
The bonded zone also has emphasized exports. It is now the only
bonded zone in northern and northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The zone offers favorable policies to imports and exports from
the central and western regions, which are rich in natural
resources but lack funding and are dependent on the port for their
foreign trade.

<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese automakers have been
more successful in coordinating sales and production in the past
year, which has had an impact on imports.
</P>
<P>
China's auto market has been growing steadily, according to a
recent national auto industry meeting here.
</P>

Statistics show that in the first nine months of this year 1.17
million automobiles were produced in China and 1.14 million were
sold, up 6.9 percent and 8.2 percent from the same period last
year, respectively.
</P>

out, and 350,500 were sold in the first three quarters, an
increase of 25.6 percent and 27.2 percent respectively over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar have
agreed to demarcate their common boundary by dividing it into 10
sectors, according to the Nation newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
When a joint survey team is unable to determine where to locate
boundary pillars in an area of a sector, they will move to the
next area so as not to delay the demarcation process, the
newspaper quotes Thai Foreign Minister Surrin Pitsuwan as saying
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Myanmar used different maps based on different
treaties in their negotiations on the 2,400 kilometer-long border,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the new survey method was an outcome of a
Thai-Myanmar boundary meeting in August. Surrin did not say when
the survey is expected to be completed.

KUNMING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Xishuangbanna Dai
Autonomous Prefecture of southwest China's Yunan Province has
initiated a ban on hunting to protect wild animals living in
Xishuangbanna, China's biggest tropical rain forest.

The area bordering on Myanmar and Laos earned its reputation as
"a kingdom of wildlife" for 427 species of birds, 67 species of
animals and 1,437 kinds of insects. Some 99 endangered species
represented there are put under state protection.
</P>
<P>
To protect the wild animals, the local government has taken
active measures to prohibit poaching, selling, peddling and
processing of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The hunting ban went into effect in November.

<P>
Xishuangbanna wildlife officials and local public security
agents have punished poachers according to the law, and
confiscated all weapons taken into the forest.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Xishuangbanna now has one-fourth of the country's
mammal species and one third of the bird species.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Italian lower house approved
by a wide margin Thursday a bill to allow the male descendants of
the House of Savoy to return to Italy. The bill must now go before
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The house vote, by secret ballot, was 276-204. The ruling
center-left Olive Tree coalition was not united behind the return
of the Savoys. Those declaring themselves against the bill were
the Communist Refoundation, the Republicans and the United
Communists. The center-right Freedom Front was in favor of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
The government bill has been significantly modified by the
Constitutional Affairs Committee. Even after the Senate votes on
it, at least another three months will go by before any
constitutional changes can be made on the basis of deliberations
in the two houses.
</P>
<P>
Male offspring of the House of Savoy are banned from Italy, but
on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Italian Republic
last year, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro indicated it was time to
review the ban.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Concerned Over Problem in New F-18E/F Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of
Defense said on Thursday that its leaders are concerned over a wing
problem in the new F-18E/F Navy fighter built by Boeing Co. and
consultations among the top leaders are held on the program.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is expected to deliver 780 of the carrier-based attack
jets to the Navy over the next 10 to 15 years at a cost of up to
80 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But reports revealed that the "Super Hornet" strike fighter
being tested by the Navy and Boeing has shown a wing problem that
may cause it to bank unexpectedly during certain maneuvers at just
below the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon said today that
Secretary of Defense William Cohen concerned about the problem.
"He wants to find out how serious the problem is. And he wants to
find out what can be done to fix it," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen had discussed the problem with Navy Secretary John
Dalton, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jay Johnson and
Under-Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler, the top acquisition
and technology official at the Pentagon, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft is designed to bridge the gap between current
aging U.S. carrier-based attack jets, including older-model F-18s,
and the expected eventual emergence of a U.S. "Joint Strike
Fighter" that could be shared by the Air Force, Navy and Marine
Corps, it was reported.

the American environment in the last 25 or 30 years, somebody has
predicted that it would wreck the economy."
</P>
<P>
Countering his opponents, Clinton said, the air and water are
cleaner, the food supply is safer and there are fewer toxic waste
sites than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The president's appeal came just hours after delegates from 150
nations, meeting in Japan, approved a pact to control
heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the accord as environmentally strong and
economically sound. But Republican critics in Congress denounced
it and predicted it would never be ratified by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> New Breed of Beef Cattle Developed in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai researchers said they had
developed a new breed of beef cattle, which can grow to three
times the size of native animals.
</P>
<P>
A fully grown bull of the new breed can weigh up to 1,000 kg,
as against 200 kg of an average native ox, according to
researchers at the Beef Research and Development Center of
Kasetsart University.
</P>
<P>
The new breed, named "Kamphaengsaen" after the name of the
university's campus, is a cross between local and imported breeds,
with 25 percent native, 25 percent brahman and 50 percent
Charolais.
</P>
<P>
The cross-breed cattle can produce much more meat and maintain
the local breed's resistance to disease and resilience to the hot
humid climate.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that new breed animals are best
slaughtered and consumed at about 500 kg as the meat then tastes
better.
</P>
<P>
The new breed became a hit with ranchers on Thursday when a
five-year-old bull of the new breed weighing 750 kg was on display
at a national agricultural products fair.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved a
66.7 million U.S. dollar loan to Guatemala Thursday to help
improve the rural road system and strengthen the country's road
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to improve rural road systems in Guatemala's
zones of extreme poverty which include the provinces of
Heuhuetenango, Quiche, Totonicapan, San Marcos and Alta and Baja
Verapaz.
</P>
<P>
These departments contain about 30 percent of the country's
land areas and about 33 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
The project will upgrade about 260 kilometers of road links
strategically located on main trade corridors, namely the
Pan-American Highway link between Mexico and Guatemala City, and
in areas with considerable agricultural development potential,
such as San Marcos and Heuhuetenango.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is about 136.5 million dollars. In
addition to a World Bank loan, the balance will be financed by the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Government of Guatemala
with 49.8 million dollars and 20 million dollars
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Countries to Face Food Shortages Due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A near-record number of countries
will face food shortages because of crop damage caused by El Nino,
a report of food crops and shortage released by the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said today.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is expected to wreak havoc in 1998, and its impact has
forced the FAO to add five Central American countries and several
African and Asian nations to its food problem list.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total number of countries with food shortages
to 37. Because of the situation, FAO and World Food Program
directors have approved a 9.4 million U.S. dollar emergency
operation to provide six months of emergency food assistance to
323,000 people in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Panama, the five Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
The weather phenomenon El Nino has damaged cash crops in the
Andes, caused drought in northeastern Brazil and provoked heavy
rains in eastern Africa and some parts of Asia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros was indicted Thursday on 18 felony counts
of conspiracy, obstructing justice and making false statements to
the FBI about payments to a former mistress.
</P>
<P>
He was indicted along with three other people including the
former mistress Linda Jones by Independent Counsel David M.
Barrett in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Barrett alleged that Cisneros made false statements to FBI
agents during a background investigation when he was nominated to
the Cabinet post in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros resigned in November 1996 and is now president of
Univision, a Los Angeles-based Spanish television network.
</P>
<P>
The indictment makes Cisneros the second Clinton Cabinet
secretary to be indicted. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy
was charged in August in a 39-count indictment for accepting
illegal gifts and lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Cisneros, who is married, paid
Linda Jones more than 250,000 U.S. dollars from 1990 through 1993,
and that he conspired with her and the other defendants to mislead
investigators about the payments before and after he became the
secretary.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Government Fails to Pay Back Wages in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government is
unlikely to make the mammoth wage and pension payments that are in
arrears by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko pledged to solve the
problem when he assumed the reins of government in July.
</P>
<P>
With only 20 days left in 1997, the total wage and pension
backlog in Ukraine has reached 6.2 billion hryvnas (about 3.2
billion U.S. dollars), one fifth of the 1997 budget revenues,
according to statistics from the National Bank of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Not only the living standards of ordinary Ukrainians are
affected by the huge debt, but also the political clout of
President Leonid Kuchma and the government as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Political opponents of Kuchma, including leftist forces that
dominate the present parliament, have referred to the wage delays
as evidence that his economic policies are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma admitted that not making overdue wage and pension
payments would give the Communist Party a boost in the March 1998
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"They have a base -- the pensioners who now receive small
pensions," the president said when speaking to students in the
Zaporozhya region last week. "Pensioners will vote for Communists
because now they live worse than before."

<HEADLINE> Walesa Likely to Run in Next Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Poland's former President Lech
Walesa is like to stage a political comeback in the presidential
election due in the fall of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Press Agency (PPA) reported that Walesa told the
press Wednesday he would not rule out the possibility of running
for president in the future.
</P>
<P>
Walesa has suggested that Poland adopt a presidential
mechanism, but he did not elaborate on the idea. The mechanism, he
said, would be discussed among his party's members and if the
people agree, he would run for office.
</P>
<P>
Walesa returned to his former work unit at the Gdansk Shipyard
and resumed his position as an electrician after he failed in his
bid for re-election for president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, work as an electrician, but was engaged in
political activities. When asked if he would run for president
again on his return to Gdansk, he never gave a definite answer
until recently.
</P>
<P>
He did not think Marian Krzaklewski, the Solidarity Election
Action's (AWS) present chairman, would become his competitor,
Walesa said, because Krzaklewski did not make any new proposals on
presidential goals or mechanisms for the country. Therefore,
Krzaklewski still had a lot to do in order to be a strong
competitor, the PPA reported.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, Krzaklewski, who reorganized
the once scattered Solidarity Trade Union and won the
parliamentary election and formed the new cabinet this fall, has
been eyeing the office of president for a long time. Because of
this, he declined the offer to become prime minister. It was
also Krzaklewski that first proposed the Solidarity Trade Union's
next goal, which was to make Aleksander Kwasniewski, the leader of
the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, finish his
presidency before it expires.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he made the choice, Walesa said the goal of the
party founded at his proposal was to avoid a monopoly by the
middle-right wing on the Polish political stage.
</P>
<P>
He said he was afraid the Communist Party would return to power
some day and dissolve the parliament, or the present parliament
expires and the AWS becomes exhausted and loses the opportunity
presented by the election.
</P>
<P>
"I have helped the Solidarity Election Action, I am helping it
and I still will in the future," Walesa said, "but I don't agree
with it because it mixes the tasks of the trade unions with the
ruling of the government, and it will not listen to an old
colleague."
</P>
<P>
Walesa promised he would do everything possible in order to
prevent the communists from resuming power in 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Globalization Brings Opportunities, Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- History has never
before witnessed a financial crisis the likes of which is
occurring in Southeast Asia now that has had such an impact on
Wall Street, the financial center of the world.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the crisis is an expression of "globalization" in
the financial field. Economic globalization, which is
exemplified by transnational exchanges of commodities, services
and capital, is ushering a new world into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
With the economy playing an increasingly important role in
international relations after the Cold War, the pace of economic
globalization is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries have a growing interest in globalization
because it offers them favorable conditions to realize more
efficient business operations, more appropriate resources
distribution and higher profits. It will also stimulate growth
through expansion of external demand.
</P>
<P>
Globalization can also help developing countries attract more
funds and technologies and to assist in converging their economies
with the international market stream. Therefore, globalization is
also bringing opportunities to many countries.
</P>
<P>
Transnational Corporations (TNCs) stand in the forefront of
globalization. According to United Nations' statistics, the
number of parent firms and their affiliates have surpassed 45,000
and 280,000 respectively. The affiliates' assets have totaled more
than 8.4 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Competition is a prominent feature of the TNCs. In 1996 and
1997, voluminous mergers and acquisitions took place in aviation,
telecommunications, banking and insurance industries in a war to
broaden marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
Expanding at a more rapid pace than global trade, foreign
direct investment (FDI) has played a major role in the
globalization process. The volume of FDI has soared from 166
billion U.S. dollars in the 1980s to 350 billion dollars in 1996 when
global FDI reached a record 3.2 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
FDI used to be an activity of the developed nations, but there
has been a new trend for an increase of FDI into developing
countries, which absorbed one third of global FDI inflow in 1996,
the latest figures show.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of world trade is an important
opportunity for the world community. In the first six years of the
1990s, the growth of world trade was three times that of the world
economy. Every country is taking measures for trade and technology
liberalization in order to bring competition into their production
areas.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congressman Convicted of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A city trial judge today
convicted a Philippine congressman of two counts of rape he
allegedly committed against an 11-year-old girl in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Judge Roberto Diokno of the Makati City Regional Trial Court in
Metro Manila said House Representative Romeo Jalosjos was found
guilty of two counts of statutory rape and six counts of acts of
lasciviousness.
</P>
<P>
Judge Diokno, who said the verdict was based on evidence proven
by the prosecution, sentenced Jalosjos to life imprisonment and
ordered him to pay the victim 220,000 pesos (6,300 U.S. dollars)
in moral damages.
</P>
<P>
The judge said his decision could still be contested on appeal
to the higher court by the defense. Meanwhile, he said Jalosjos
was acquitted of four other counts of acts of lasciviousness and
all other charges filed against him earlier.
</P>
<P>
Jalosjos said in the courtroom that he was innocent of the
charges filed by the girl.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Globalization Brings Opportunities, Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The promotion of free trade by developed nations, especially in
the high-tech products and services trade, has added motive force
and served as media to globalization.
</P>
<P>
After succeeding in the signing of agreements on
telecommunications and information technology trade in the World
Trade Organization (WTO), the U.S. has been making efforts to
include more high-tech products into the agreements and to have
more signatories.
</P>
<P>
The developed nations have been asking WTO members to open up
markets for banking, insurance and securities industries.
</P>
<P>
One reason for developed countries to attach importance to
high-tech trade is its role in enhancing productivity and
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., home to one fourth of the world's output,
high-tech industry has become a leading manufacturing sector in
terms of its contribution to the growth of domestic products,
employment and exports.
</P>
<P>
But the opportunities are not evenly shared. One of the topics
that developing countries often talk about in the current session
of the U.N. General Assembly is the negative impact of
globalization on their own countries.
</P>
<P>
Developed nations have become more active in penetrating into
developing countries' financial markets, while the movement of
short-term speculative funds has caused great impact on a host of
countries' markets, such as in the case of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Because of their relatively low levels of economic and
technical base and lack of competitiveness, most of the developing
countries can not compete for the short or mid-term benefits of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The least developed nations are prone to marginalization due to
heavy debt burden and aid reduction, and to a widening gap between
them and the wealthier nations.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are urging their developed partners to get
rid of protectionist and unilateralist practices, to de-link
economic ties with human rights records and market openness, to
stop interfering in other nations' internal affairs through
economic sanctions, and to accord developing countries early
admission to WTO.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have also called on developed countries to
take concrete steps to improve external conditions of developing
countries and to nurture a "win-win" structure on the basis of
mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Pension System Needs Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's pension system will go
bankrupt if it continues to rely on contributions from only 9
million workers to support 14-million retirees, a Western expert
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
David Snelbecker, an economic adviser from the Harvard
Institute for International Development (HIID), said Ukraine's
"pay-as-you-go" model for supporting retirees, in which each
worker theoretically pays taxes to support the current group of
pensioners, is plagued with problems.
</P>
<P>
"Many workers do not report their true wages and thus pay no
taxes to pension funds," Snelbecker said.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of overdue pension payments to retired persons
has reached 1.4 billion hryvnas (about 740 million U.S. dollars)
by now. The average pension in June was 52 hryvnas (about 25
dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
The problem will only worsen as Ukraine's retired population
increases, Snelbecker said. According to HIID estimates, over the
next 30 years the ratio of workers to retired citizens will fall
from 3:1 to 2:1.
</P>
<P>
"Only substantial changes will resolve problems that afflict
the system," he said, adding that Ukraine should adopt a fully
funded pension system employing individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
Under such a model, each worker would make mandatory payments
into an account that would provide for his or her own
retirement. This would give workers with an incentive to
participate in the process as well as offering long-term economic
benefits by increasing Ukrainians' savings.
</P>
<P>
Though the problem is urgent enough that it could affect the
outcome of the March 1998 parliamentary elections, Ukrainian
officials consider it is too early to reform the system.
</P>
<P>
"The best time to start reforming is after parliamentary
elections because right now the parliament cares more about their
seats than the reforms," said First Deputy Labor and Social Policy
Minister Svitlana Vegera.

<HEADLINE> Drought Death Toll Rises To 657 In Indonesia's Irian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 657 people have died
of diseases linked to the prolonged drought in Indonesia's
easternmost province of Irian Jaya, and food shortages still
threaten 150,000 people there, the Antara News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of Irian Jaya's disaster task force, Sam Leimena,
said on Thursday that 554 people had died in the districts of
Jayawijaya, Merauke and Puncakjaya.
</P>
<P>
A joint team of the Indonesian Red Cross and the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said last month that another 103
people had died of drought-related afflictions since October in
Mimika district.
</P>
<P>
The drought that began in May has wiped out local yam crops on
which many of Irian Jaya's tribes are highly dependent.
</P>
<P>
Wells have dried up, prompting local people to drink
contaminated water, which has led to outbreaks of cholera. Fires
have destroyed plants from which many tribes make their clothes.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of National Development planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said on Thursday that the government had spent 200
billion rupiah (46 million U.S. dollars) on relief operations to
drought-hit Irian Jaya.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Creating New Economic Situation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, carried an editorial today hailing the Central
Economic Conference held by the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Blazing a new trail for reform, opening
up and economic development," said that the conference is of
great importance for making new achievements in reform, opening up
and the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The conference summarized the country's economic performance
this year and has set the guiding principles, overall requirements
and key points for economic development in the coming year, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in making progress amid stability for its
economic development and continuing an appropriately rapid growth,
with price increase rate falling lower and major economic targets
basically meeting the projected aims of the national
macro-economic adjustments, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China has made progress in promoting market-oriented
activities, scored positive and new changes in economic structural
adjustments, considerably expanded its foreign economic and
technological exchanges, and further consolidated and developed
the positive start of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
What is especially worth noting is that China has basically
escaped from a supply shortage situation in the past year, and
formed a buyers' market for major means of production and consumer
goods, indicating a historic shift of strategic significance, the
paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the whole Party and the people should remain
sober-minded because some outstanding contradictions and problems
in national economic operations still exist.
</P>
<P>
The main contradictions and problems are: a number of
state-owned and township enterprises are running in the red; the
ranks of laid-off workers are rising and some workers face
employment difficulties; redundant construction remains
commonplace; and the fragile foundation of agriculture has not
completely changed yet.
</P>
<P>
1998 will be the first year for tasks established at the CPC's
15th National Congress. China will continue to promote a
fundamental shift in its economic restructuring and growth,
reinforce the status of agriculture as an economic base, speed up
the reform of the state-owned sector, step up efforts to
restructure the economy, improve macro-economic controls, open
wider to the outside world in a bid to maintain economic
development and achieve comprehensive social progress, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Of the six major tasks for next year's economic work, the
conference gave top priority to reforming state
enterprises. Localities have been urged to implement every target
adopted at the conference.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Creating New Economic Situation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial called on the Chinese people to have an all-round
and correct understanding of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can the people correctly understand and
implement all policy decisions adopted by the CPC Central
Committee on economic development, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We should maintain the policy of seeking progress on the basis
of steady development, which was put forward in accordance with
historical experience and the reality of China's economic
growth," it added.
</P>
<P>
In maintaining steady development, the editorial said, "We
shall continue to practice a tight monetary control policy, curb
inflation, strengthen agricultural development, prevent and solve
financial risks and do a good job in social security so as to
maintain a stable macro-economic and social environment."
</P>
<P>
Making progress means a breakthrough in the reforms of
state-owned enterprises, financial systems, economic structures
and in the solution of major social problems. Meanwhile, the
overall quality of the national economy and efficiency should be
improved substantially, it added.
</P>
<P>
On this major premise, the country will seek a relatively rapid
development. Stability and progress should complement and promote
each other. Stability is the basis while progress is the purpose,
the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Balancing reform, development and stability, we should take
care of the daily life of ordinary people and solve their
difficulties, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels should carry forward the fine
work style of hard struggle, clean-and-honest government and
maintenance of close ties with the masses, it said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Japan Implementing Afforestation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Japan are jointly
implementing a "friendship afforestation project" to establish a
community forest in Myanmar's Mandalay division, the New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project is sponsored by the Japan International Forestry
Promotion and Cooperation Center (JIFPCC), a Japanese
non-governmental organization, with the support of some Japanese
corporations and in cooperation with Myanmar's Ministry of
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the project is to set up a community forest in the
central zone of the Nyaung O area covering 450 hectares of land,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the area will be afforested with 10
different kinds of trees including Eucalyptus, Tamaka and Magyi.
</P>
<P>
The forest would contribute to the local environment, which
would in turn help conserve the global environment at large and
enhance the friendship between Myanmar and Japan, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the JIFPCC, a series of friendship afforestation
projects between Japan and other countries has been initiated
since 1995. The first such project was with Malaysia in that
year, the second with Indonesia in 1996 and the third with Myanmar
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Dominance Over Diving Shaken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China faces an uphill battle
to defend its reputation as the world top diving power in the
Eighth World Swimming Championships in January, a Chinese swimming
official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"China is no longer as strong as before since three-time
women's Olympic gold medalist Fu Mingxia has retired and Olympic
springboard champion Xiong Ni is well past his prime," said Guo
Qinglong, vice chairman of the Chinese Swimming Association.
</P>
<P>
The world championships, which will be held for January 8-18 in
Perth, Australia, will be Xiong's last outing before he calls it
quits. Xiong said he wanted to wrap up his career with a world
title but the difficulty was enormous.
</P>
<P>
Guo predicted the Chinese divers would meet strong challenges
from Russia, Canada, the United States, Germany and Mexico,
tipping Russian Dimitry Sautin as the top threat to the Chinese
men.
</P>
<P>
Saudin won the men's platform title in the Atlanta Olympics in
absence of defending champion Sun Shuwei of China, who has been
sidelined with injuries and will sit out the Perth championships.
</P>
<P>
In the annual World Cup last September, Saudin once again ruled
the roost in the platform event, edging Chinese youngster Xu Hao
out of the top two.
</P>
<P>
China bagged six gold medals in the World Cup but none of them
was Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
"The World Cup sounded an alarm to the Chinese divers," Guo
said.
</P>
<P>
The Perth-bound Chinese diving team is comprised of 10 men
divers and as many women. Xiong Ni and Yu Zhuocheng, springboard
runner-up in the Atlanta Games, and Wang Rui, heir apparent to Fu
Mingxia and two-time National Games champion in platform, are the
brightest stars on the squad.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Stocks Fall As Rupiah Stabilizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange plunged 4.8 percent Thursday from persistent
regional weaknesses, while the Indonesian currency rupiah
stabilized to close at the 4,400 level against the U.S. dollar,
stock brokers and dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's composite index, the main gauge for local share
prices, again dropped below the 400-point level Thursday, losing
19.829 points to close at 396.108.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which opened at 4,405/30 against the greenback in
the spot market, weakened to 4,535 on Thursday morning as the
South Korean won fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah then strengthened in the afternoon as Singapore
operators continued to unload their dollar holdings. The rupiah
closed at 4,405.
</P>
<P>
A local stock analyst attributed the drastic fall in local
stock prices to the suspension of 16 securities houses by the
Capital Market Supervision Agency and the lack of support from
state-owned securities firms.
</P>
<P>
"But I agree with the assumption that the regional factors are
much more dominant than the domestic ones. Unless the won settles
down, we will continue to be vulnerable," the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the rupiah would remain fragile until the
end of this year as more and more companies would enter the
currency market to buy dollars to pay back their offshore maturing
debts.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah also was seen as very susceptible to various rumors,
especially those regarding President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was knocked down to an all-time low of 4,600 on
Tuesday due to unfounded rumors that Soeharto was seriously ill.
It improved a bit Wednesday following news of Soeharto's expected
trip to Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by about 80 percent against
the U.S. dollar this year.

<HEADLINE> China Outlines Plan to Explore Oil Fields in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Two separate oil fields in the
central part of the Bohai Sea will be explored simultaneously, and
the oil obtained will be piped inland through the port of Tangshan
in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently drafted plan, the two oil fields --
Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oil Field and Nanbao 35-2 Oil Field -- will
produce four million tons of crude oil a year when operational.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao oil field, with 170 million tons of verified geological
oil reserves, is 100 kilometers east of Tanggu in Tianjin.
The field was discovered by China Offshore Oil Corporation's Bohai
Company in June of 1995. Eleven wells have been drilled in the oil
field.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao, discovered recently by the Bohai Company, lies 20
kilometers south of Tangshan. Four test wells have been drilled
and geological reserves of 70 million tons have been
identified. Nanbao's reserves have been estimated at 110 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The distance between the two oil fields is just 20 kilometers,
making it possible for their joint development in a
70-square-kilometer oil-bearing area in the central Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the plan, seven standard platforms will be
erected in the two oil fields; two pipelines will be laid at the
seabed to transport oil inland; and terminals will be built in
Jingtang Port. Requisition of 650 meters of coastline will be made
for building oil transport berths. The entire construction will
cost 7.29 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Qinhuangdao field is expected to begin production in 2003
and Nanbao one year later. By 2004, the two fields should be able
to produce four million tons of oil a year, according to local
sources.

<HEADLINE> Looking for Ways To Keep China's Yellow River From Drying Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong Province has
been trying hard to find ways to solve its problem with the Yellow
River, which is drying up.
</P>
<P>
The province has sent researchers to Yellow River areas and has
discussed ways to solve its problem with experts.
</P>
<P>
Yellow River, China's second longest, is a major source of
water for Shandong, where 25 counties and cities depend on it for
drinking and irrigating 1.867 million hectares of farmland, and
for industrial use in some cities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the problem has gotten more serious. This
year, the river has been dry for more than 200 days, causing
problems for agriculture, industry, people, and livestock along
both banks of the river.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the present chaotic system is in drastic need
of reform and needs more unified leadership, planning, and
administration of water resource use, and the price of water needs
to be raised to increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Experts are also asking for quick implementation of the water
diversion plan to move water from the Yangtze River to the Yellow
River to help solve the water shortage problem.

<HEADLINE> China Computerizes Grain Transactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A trading system has been
hooked up nationwide to initiate electronic processing of China's
grain transactions.
</P>
<P>
The network was set up by the China Chamber of Grain
Transactions, China Grain Trading Corp. (CGTC) and Xinhua Guoxin
Science and Trade Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
China is now the world's largest grain producer and also the
biggest grain importer. "The country attached equal importance to
grain production and circulation, both vital factors to ensure the
country's economic growth," said Shen Siyi, general manager of
CGTC.
</P>
<P>
"The newly founded network thoroughly changed the traditional
grain transaction method, thus meeting the requirements of huge
grain transaction volumes in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Already connected to the Internet, the system timely displays
in Chinese the ever-changing information on grain prices in both
domestic and international markets. Also found in the network's
database are China's grain policy and other market analyses
released by the Chinese State Grain Reserve Administration.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of the network, sellers can deal with buyers by
keying in data on prices and amounts in the standard contract
provided by the system.
</P>
<P>
Up to 300 major enterprises nationwide who are engaged in grain
production, storage, processing and trade have become registered
members of the network.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada's commercial banks
raised mortgage rates by as much as 0.35 percentage point Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank, the country's biggest, increased short-term and
long-term mortgage rates between a fifth and more than a third of a
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
It was quickly followed by other commercial banks. The new
rates will come into effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
The banks said they raised the mortgage rates as a result of an
increase in their cost of borrowing money on the bond market.
</P>
<P>
To Canadian consumers, the increased rates mean they will have
to pay more if they borrow to buy houses and big-ticket items.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimmers Can Hardly Peak in Perth Worlds, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimmers can hardly
peak again in January's World Swimming Championships after their
shining performance in the National Games last October.
</P>
<P>
"They can hardly peak again in just three months," said Yuan
Jiawei, general secretary of the Chinese Swimming Association.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect them to put up very good results in the world
championships," added Yuan, who came short of saying how many gold
medals the Chinese aimed for in the quadrennial event to be held
for January 8-18 in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Two world records and 10 world best times for the year were
produced in the pool at the Eighth Chinese National Games in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, 16, swam a new world record clocking of 4:34.79 in
the women's 400m individual medley and Wu Yanyan, 19, broke the
world mark of the women's 200m individual medley in 2:09.72.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Weimin, vice minister of the Chinese Physical Culture and
Sports Commission, later slapped at the near-sightedness of
provincial sports officials, who urged their athletes to peak in
the national events instead of encouraging them to reserve the
best for big meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese athletes should compete in their best in international
and world events instead of concentrating on internal strife," the
vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese world championships delegation included eight men
and 16 women swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chengji, who finished fourth in both men's 50m freestyle
and 100m butterfly in the Atlanta Olympic Games, tops the men's
squad, while the women's team is led by Olympic champion Le Jingyi
and world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan.

CHANGSHA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A chain of stores known as
"Adam" or "Eve", which market safe sex and provide consultations
related to practicing safe sex, have opened in a number of
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Recent resports indicate that a dozen stores have opened in
Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The owner of five chain stores in the city noted that business
has been somewhat slow due to the fact that many safe sex products
are too expensive for common citizens. Nonetheless, he expressed
great confidence in the potential for future profitability.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the vast majority of consumers of
sex care products are educated people and professionals, including
doctors, lawyers and engineers.
</P>
<P>
Sexual research associations have been established in a number
of areas, with sex care radio programs gaining great popularity
amongst listeners.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Development Zones Boosted in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan
Province has made great strides in the construction of development
zones to boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
As an inland province, Hunan needs to pay close attention to
the construction of development zones to shorten the economic gap
with coastal areas, said a provincial official.
</P>
<P>
The province has established 60 development zones since 1988,
including two state-grade zones and 29 province-grade zones.
</P>
<P>
While providing preferential policies on taxes, loans and land,
the province has invested more than 13 billion yuan (1.62 billion
U.S. dollars) in infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
More than 890 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises and
wholly overseas-funded companies have been built in these
development zones with a foreign investment of 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, the development zones absorbed more than 300
million U.S. dollars in foreign funds, accounting for 45 percent
of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Also important for the development zones are efficient systems
of law, accounting, finance and insurance, said a governmental
official.

highest sales this year, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) announced today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Denktash Should Be Pressured to Face Reality: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis today urged Turkish Cypriot political
organizations to pressure north Cyprus leader Rauf Denktash to
face reality in order to help settle the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference entitled "The Cyprus Problem: Prospect
of Solution" in Athens today, Kranidiotis said that Denktash was
seeking to perpetuate the Cyprus problem by maintaining
intransigence in talks with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
He accused Denktash of using the Turkish Cypriot community as a
"vehicle" to further Turkish designs, particularly its efforts to
come closer to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis appealed to Turkish Cypriot political groups to
exert pressure on Denktash in order to force him to "tone down"
his intransigence and "see reality."
</P>
<P>
As for the prospect of Cyprus' accession to the European Union,
he stressed that this provides the greatest ever opportunity since
1974 for the settlement of the political problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish Cypriot community could participate in
the accession negotiations only as part of the Cyprus Republic
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island after a pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two communities of the island have since this
year held three rounds of direct talks in order to resolve their
differences, but no real progress has been made so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Latin American exports are
expected to shoot up by 12.4 percent in 1997, according to
preliminary estimates to be published soon by the Integration and
Regional Programs Department of the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB).
</P>
<P>
The increase in trade for the Western Hemisphere, as well as
for the total of subregional trade groups, is also expected to be
in the double digits, surpassing the rate of trade growth for the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Total trade in the hemisphere is expected to be around 1.2
trillion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall exports of the Western Hemisphere are expected to
increase by 10 percent this year. Similar increases are also
expected for exports of the three major subregional trade
agreements, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
will be 10.1 percent, Mercosur 9.8 percent and the Andean
Community 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the Group of Three which consists of Colombia,
Mexico and Venezuela are expected to grow by 14.2 percent, and by
the Central American Common Market 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates show that countries are continuing to
deepen their trade ties among the members of the same subregional
integration agreement. All the subregional integration agreements
are increasing their intrasubregional trade at a greater rate than
total trade.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Poverty Reduction in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 20 million U.S. dollar equivalent credit to Georgia as
the social investment fund to help reduce poverty and foster
development of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to support the poor among the Georgian
population by improving their access to basic social and economic
services through the rehabilitation of the existing
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It will also mobilize public and private resources for
small-scale investments or "microprojects" in approximately 400
communities. Based on results of the project's pilot phase, water
supply, irrigation, roads and school microprojects are expected to
be the most common type of investment.
</P>
<P>
The credit, which has a maturity of 35 years, including a
10-year grace period, will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Bank in 1992 and the IDA in 1993, the World
Bank/IDA commitments to Georgia total some 366 million dollars for
14 projects.

NEW YORK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against

Asian currencies fell sharply overnight as the South Korean
government tried to assure investors that the country would abide
by the terms of a 57 billion U.S. dollar International Monetary
Fund bailout.
</P>
<P>
But the doubts of traders sent the dollar 8.7 percent higher
against the Korean won and took 5.6 percent off the country's key
stock market measure. Other major stock markets in Asia also
continue to turn down.
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at 129.75 yen, up from 129.28 yen
Wednesday. But the dollar fell against the German mark, trading at

<HEADLINE> Reno Offers to Answer More Campaign Finance Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno today offered to answer more campaign finance questions from
a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, but remained
reluctant to provide an edited version of a dissenting memo from
the FBI director.
</P>
<P>
Reno told her weekly news conference that she wanted to do
everything she can to "honor the oversight function (of Congress),
while at the same time making sure that nothing is done that would
impair or undercut my responsibility for conducting a full and
vigorous investigation."
</P>
<P>
Reno and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh refused during hearings
Tuesday and Wednesday to comply with a subpoena from the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee for Freeh's November 25
memo recommending Reno seek appointment of an independent counsel
to investigate fund-raising phone calls, which she rejected.
</P>
<P>
Some Congressional Republicans threatened to hold her and Freeh
in contempt.
</P>
<P>
Reno said she had advised the panel that "after the hearing,
we'd sit down and see what we could work out." She said her staff
was in touch with the committee.
</P>
<P>
She said she remained determined "to make sure that people feel
that they can fully and frankly discuss issues with me without it
becoming public and appearing in congressional committees. It's
not the way to conduct an investigation."

<HEADLINE> US Plane Lands Itself After Pilot Blacks Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A Kansas small plane
automatically flew out of gas and landed safely in a field after
the pilot blacked out while flying his plane because of gas
poisoning, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Rob Frayser, 47, was apparently overcome by carbon monoxide
from a leaking exhaust system after flying about 161 kilometers
from his home in Hoisington in central Kansas to Missouri
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Because the plane was set on an auto-pilot flying, it continued
flying for 560 kilometers more until the fuel ran out, then
glided down to a near perfect landing in a snow-covered Missouri
hay field.
</P>
<P>
The plane skidded about 150 meters without the wings ever
touching the ground, then crashed into a row of trees at the end
of the field.
</P>
<P>
"I woke up totally disoriented and didn't know if I was in the
air or on the ground or what," he said. He said the first reaction
he did was to switch the fuel tanks, lower the gear and add power,
but nothing seemed to help.
</P>
<P>
"Finally I saw the trees around me, so I opened the door and
got out," he said.
</P>
<P>
He walked away with only a broken arm, cuts and bruises and was
back at work Tuesday at the Hoisington Medical Center, where he
practices osteopathic medicine.
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jim Silliman
said, "If it hadn't run out of gas when it did, he would have died
from the carbon monoxide."
</P>
<P>
Silliman said the snow probably helped the landing. "Everything
went in his favor. All the little things added up," he said. "He's
more than lucky."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Faces Another EU Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has suffered another
setback in its efforts to join the European Union (EU), it was
learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean Claude Juncker, who is
hosting the EU summit beginning tomorrow, said Turkey would not
join a new conference which would group all countries pursuing EU
membership, according to BBC World Service.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said that all other applicants to the Union would be
told they could start entry talks early next year, but he said
that Turkey had to wait.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister explained that Turkey had to fulfil certain
obligations in the first place, including an improvement in its
human right record, good neighborly relationship with Greece and a
readiness to allow EU entry negotiations with Cyprus to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, recommended
in July that entry talks be started first early next year with
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus,
applicants considered advanced in political and economic terms.
</P>
<P>
But some EU member countries insist that the EU should begin
talks at the same time with the other five applicants -- Bulgaria,
Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia.

<HEADLINE> China to Receive Environmental Textbooks from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China will receive
environmental education textbooks from a U.S. non-governmental
organization called Global Communications for Conservation (GCC).
</P>
<P>
This is stipulated by an agreement signed here today between
GCC and China's State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC).
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the first American textbooks to be
translated and distributed to schools and teachers in China will be
the Environmental Action Series, such as energy conservation,
habitat and biodiversity and waste reduction.
</P>
<P>
Texts, geared for both college students and elementary
school-aged children, will be translated while environmental
education programs for government official will also be developed.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first instance of such cooperation between China
and the U.S. private sector and we are pleased to be launching such
an historic joint venture," said Chairman of GCC Laura Utley.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the signing of the agreement was Vice Minister of
SSTC Deng Nan who received 1997 Safari Planet Earth Award from GCC
last night.
</P>
<P>
The program is important to China's sustainable development,
and it proves that there are many fields that China and the United
States can cooperate in, said Deng Nan.
</P>
<P>
Since the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, China has
taken steps to educate the public on the benefits of conservation
and sustainability, the responsibility towards the environment,
the accountability to the future generations and the need for
cooperative global action, Deng Nan added.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based GCC was established in 1989 to initiate
conservation and environmental education programs in the U.S. and
elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> US Airports to Be Too Crowed Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. airports will be
too crowded and the skies will be more dangerous in the next
century if no dramatic measures are taken, warned a government
commission in a study released today.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by the National Civil Aviation Review
Commission warned of a "looming disaster" of aviation gridlock
that could set in soon after the year 2000 and damage the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have packed terminals, packed planes, packed skies and
constant delays," said the commission chairman, Norman Mineta.
</P>
<P>
Without effective measures, the study warned, the number of
major crashes in the United States will nearly double by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"Like old bridges and crowded highways, congested airports and
airways supported by outdated equipment can be less safe," the
commission said. "A system straining at the seams of capacity is
one that is also straining to be safe."
</P>
<P>
The 21-member panel urged the Congress and the White House to
make reforms on the management of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).
</P>
<P>
The commission, which consists of representatives from
different parts of the aviation industry and independent public
members, proposed the FAA improve the air-traffic control system
and airports to accommodate the rising air traffic early next
century.
</P>
<P>
The panel suggested air-traffic control costs be funded through
user fees paid by the airlines and others, and federal spending on
airport improvements be increased by 300 million U.S. dollars a
year over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended the FAA and the aviation
industry develop a "comprehensive" strategy to improve flight
safety.

<HEADLINE> US Hints Possible Arrest of Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
hinted that the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia may arrest
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
"We, the United States... do not rule out any options," said
State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Karadzic should turn himself in to the
international tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman also urged the Bosnian Serb government
to turn Karadzic over to the tribunal for a trial, claiming the
governments "where these indicted war criminals reside are
committed, obligated" to do so.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led force in Bosnian is due to pull out of Bosnia in
June next year and a smaller force will follow up.
</P>
<P>
"SFOR has a mandate to arrest war criminals in the -- as SFOR
goes about performing its primary tasks if the tactical situation
permits," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not something that we can talk about in detail in terms
of what might or might not happen in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who led the Bosnian Serbs for independence from a
Muslim-dominated Bosnian government two years ago, was singled out
and indicted by the West as a war criminal during the three-party
civil war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Declines Comment on Jerusalem Census Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday declined to make any comment on recent dispute between
Israel and the Palestinians over census in East Jerusalem,
saying it was because Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
The dispute occurred when the Palestinian Authority sought to
take a census of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem on
Wednesday. But the Israeli parliament rushed to pass a law on the
same day to ban the census.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley, dodging a reporter's
question about Washington's reaction to the dispute, said the
United States could only repeat its calls for refrain from both
sides concerning the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is really the most sensitive issue, and it's one
that we believe that the parties have agreed to treat when they
get to the permanent status negotiations," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"We, the United States, have repeatedly asked both sides to
refrain from unilateral actions which might be considered
provocative by the other side, and which might predetermine the
outcome of issues that need to be decided in permanent status
negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East War, and by reuniting the city declared it the eternal
capital. But the international community including the United
States have refused to recognize Israel's declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority intends to establish a state with
East Jerusalem as its capital.
