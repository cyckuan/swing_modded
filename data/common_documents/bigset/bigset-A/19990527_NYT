SILVERBULLETDAY TO RUN IN BELMONT, BAFFERT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
The past two years, trainer Bob Baffert has had Triple Crown bids
spoiled in the Belmont Stakes. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, he hopes to play the spoiler. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said yesterday that his 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday
will run against males for the first time in the June 5 Belmont.
There she will face Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Charismatic, who stands to collect a $5 million Visa Triple Crown
bonus should he also win the Belmont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday has scored eight consecutive victories against
females, most by decisive margins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a pure athlete,'' owner Mike Pegram said of
Silverbulletday. ``You're always concerned going a mile-and-a-half,
but good athletes have ways of doing things they ain't supposed to
do and, hopefully, that's what she'll do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Silverbulletday worked a scorching six furlongs in 1
minute, 10 4/5 seconds at Churchill Downs. The way she behaved
after that workout clinched the deal, Baffert says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We got her out, and she was just full of herself,'' Baffert
said. ``That's a good sign. It just goes to show that she's fit,
but she has the lung capacity for it. You cannot train a horse to
run a mile and a half at the top level. They either can do it or
they can't do it, and I think she's got the lung capacity.` &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey is scheduled to ride Silverbulletday in the
Belmont. Her regular rider, Gary Stevens, is scheduled to leave the
United States at the end of this month to begin riding in England. &QL; 
Breeders' Cup outlook &QL; 
A Breeders' Cup in Texas won't be possible until at least 2003. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breeders' Cup president D.G. Van Clief announced yesterday that
the 2000 races will return to Churchill Downs for the fifth time.
Santa Anita had originally been chosen as next year's host, but had
to back out because of remodeling plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Breeders' Cup board of directors
unofficially indicated a preference for New York's Belmont Park in
2001, and Santa Anita in 2002. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Clief said new sites for the Breeders' Cup will be
considered for 2003. Lone Star Park and Houston's Sam Houston Race
Park have expressed an interest in holding the event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year's Breeders' Cup is scheduled for Nov. 6 at Gulfstream
Park in Hallandale, Fla. &QL;

NASDAQ INVESTIGATES NEWCOM'S CLOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Nasdaq Stock Exchange has halted trading in
shares of modem maker NewCom Inc. and initiated an investigation of
the company's abrupt Monday closure.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the exchange said, ``Trading will remain
halted until the company has fully satisfied Nasdaq's request for
additional information.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq officials did not elaborate on what information they seek
from NewCom, and the Westlake Village company's chief financial
officer, Steven Veen, did not return several telephone calls
requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   NewCom issued a press release after the markets closed Monday
announcing it had ceased day-to-day operations and in fact had done
little business since January. The press release also said its main
creditor, Deutsche Financial Services, had seized the inventory and
was suing NewCom to reclaim some of about $8million owed it.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq had alerted NewCom in February that, because the
company's market capitalization was below $5 million, it no longer
met the stock exchange's minimum listing requirements. Nasdaq had
given NewCom until Thursday to come into compliance with the $5
million requirement, and NewCom shares are expected to be delisted
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To all appearances, NewCom is a company in disarray. Even the
firm's investor relations spokeswoman had said Tuesday that she was
unsure if she still had a job with the firm. ``I don't have a lot
of answers. Things kind of snowballed,'' said Dianne Will of
Willstar Consultants Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Will said she thought the company's current woes were in part
the result of internally funding expansion of operations that took
NewCom from sales of $2.1 million in 1995 to more than $93 million
last year. Some suppliers also demanded that NewCom begin paying
for components up-front, Will said, further straining the firm's
cash flow.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian combat jets and helicopter gunships
attacked a large guerrilla force dug into the snow-capped mountains
of Kashmir on Wednesday and Thursday, sharply increasing tensions
in the nuclear-armed subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi is accusing the guerrillas of being Pakistan-sponsored
Islamic militants who are taking part in a carefully devised land
grab. But Pakistan denied knowledge of the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Two waves of air strikes on Wednesday, one just after dawn and
the other in the afternoon, were intended to dislodge a force of
500 to 600 well-equipped invaders who crossed a 50-year-old
cease-fire line between India and Pakistan this month and took
strategic positions along high ridges in the Himalayas, Indian
military spokesmen said. Those raids were followed by a third,
early on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The raids were the most serious confrontation between Pakistan
and India since the rivals tested nuclear bombs a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the conflict would test how the two countries could
manage such tensions, now that the stakes are so much higher.
</P>
<P>
   At a military briefing, Brig. Mohan Bhandari said that the
infiltrating force ``consists of a large number of well-trained
Afghan mercenaries and Pakistani regular army troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhandari contended that Pakistan's involvement was obvious from
the extent of coordination and logistical support to sustain the
operation. ``Any escalation of this conflict will be entirely the
responsibility of Pakistan,'' the brigadier warned.
</P>
<P>
   That elicited a defiant response from a Pakistani military
spokesman, Brig. Rashid Quereshi, who said, ``The Pakistan armed
forces reserve the right to retaliate by whatever means are
considered appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan put its military on ``high alert.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest raid on Thursday morning was undertaken by six MIG
fighter jets and two helicopter gunships, according to the Indian
military. It targeted the same area as on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which borders India and
Pakistan, has been the chief cause of two of the three wars that
the two nations have fought since gaining their independence in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   In the complicated give-and-take that accompanied the partition,
predominantly Muslim Kashmir ended up as part of predominantly
Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   The countries began to fight, and a cease-fire divided Kashmir
in two. Since then, India has insisted that the territory is
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan argues that the Kashmiris should be allowed to choose
their preference.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for Islamic militants to cross the cease-fire
line into India. But the force that was discovered this month was
exceptional not only for its size but also for its location.
</P>
<P>
   The intruders occupied a 30-mile stretch of inhospitable terrain
ordinarily abandoned to the cold and ice. They reportedly ambushed
an Indian patrol sent to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial surveillance later showed that the militants were
dispersed among 24 or more well-fortified positions around the
towns of Dras and Kargil. Rather than the usual hit-and-run
invaders, the units had snowmobiles, artillery and huge stocks of
supplies, the Indian military said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation had the earmarks of months of planning. The
Indians said they thought that it was most likely that preparations
were under way even as the two nations engaged in promising peace
talks in February. At those meetings, the two prime ministers
signed the Lahore Declaration, in which they pledged efforts to
resolve the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, the Indian army and the militants have exchanged
artillery fire. The militants hold the formidable high ground, a
superiority that the Indians enjoyed in a 15-year-long conflict
with the Pakistani army in a region around the Siachen Glacier in
remote Kashmir. Neither side has used air power in that campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The assault with planes and helicopters represents an
intensification in the mountain combat. The Indians said they had
been careful not to invade Pakistani air space. But the Pakistanis
said that a number of bombs had landed on their side of the
cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that this is serious,'' an official of the
American Embassy here said. ``This is not being viewed by the
Indians as another summer infiltration of the usual order. On the
other hand, I think there is a desire on the Indians' part to treat
this as a limited phenomenon, to respond forcefully in a limited
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department official mentioned that Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, had discussed the confrontation by telephone. ``We
encourage them to stay in touch,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, a militant separatist movement has grown among
Kashmiri Muslims in India, which has mounted an extensive military
response. Some estimates attribute up to 30,000 deaths to fighting
between rebels and security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic ``freedom fighters'' from several nations, especially
Afghanistan and Pakistan, have routinely entered the fray,
considering it a holy war. Pakistan concedes that it has offered
those soldiers moral and political support. India contends that the
assistance is financial and military, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz of Pakistan on Wednesday denied
knowledge of the Islamic combatants under attack. ``No one knows
where they come from and who they are,'' Aziz said.

CLASS OFFERS REAL-LIFE LESSONS IN CONSTRUCTION TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER TAYLOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One look at 18-year-old Sean Jackson's
paint-splattered hands and clothing and you may not think he spent
the last two hours studying.
</P>
<P>
   But to Art Sweany, his Oak Park High School building trades
instructor, the paint under the fingernails shows just how hard
Jackson and a crew of 17 students have worked on a newly
constructed two-story house in the Pine Lake subdivision in Kansas
City, North.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything. We framed all the walls, put on all the
ceilings,'' said Jackson, a senior at Oak Park who served as the
superintendent of the project.
</P>
<P>
   As in many school districts, building a house is an annual
project students take on to earn credit in the building trades
course. The vocational education program, open to juniors and
seniors from the North Kansas City School District's three high
schools, offers entry-level job training in building trades.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years Sweany has taught the course, he said, this is
the first year construction has run behind schedule. He attributed
the delay to heavy rain in the fall and a larger floor plan.
</P>
<P>
   The students are preparing for an open house this weekend, but
Sweany anticipates the house won't be finished for another two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose for our guys who have worked on it is to show
Mom and Dad,'' Sweany said. ``They have a lot of pride in what they
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,051-square-foot house has three bedrooms, vaulted ceilings
and fireplaces in the master bedroom and living room. It also has a
heat pump with backup gas furnace, a central air-conditioner,
custom kitchen cabinets, carpeting and a finished two-car garage
with insulated doors.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second house Jackson has completed in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got into it, I knew it was something I wanted to do,''
he said. He is considering an apprenticeship program after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spent much of his time supervising others and making
sure younger students didn't hurt themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For David Sears, 17, of Oak Park High School, the program has
inspired plans of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. Once I got into this, I'm pretty sure this is what
I want to do,'' Sears said. ``When you are sitting at a desk, you
are doing the same thing day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that when they started the project, it was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come here and there's nothing but dirt on the ground,''
Sears said. He said he'll notice the house for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The work completed by contractors included the foundation,
plumbing, wiring and brickwork.
</P>
<P>
   Interior design students participated by selecting brick and
roof colors, interior and exterior color schemes and wallpaper
borders. They also used faux painting techniques on walls and
helped select trim throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   The school district will sell the house to the highest bidder,
with a $135,000 minimum. The proceeds will support the program and
pay for materials. &QL;

APACHES GET NEW DICTIONARY PUBLISHED BY ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Bray can translate hundreds of Apache words and explain
how to write their peculiar clicking and nasal sounds.
</P>
<P>
   She knows all about Apache grammar and how words spoken by White
Mountain Apaches in central Arizona differ from those of San Carlos
Apaches near Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Just just don't ask her to speak Apache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too chicken,'' said the Casa Grande retired college
teacher who spent nearly 15 years editing the new ``Western
Apache-English Dictionary'' published last year by Arizona State
University.
</P>
<P>
   She hesitates to speak the language because some words change
meaning just by being stretched out a mite longer, a minute
difference that Bray is unable to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say something, I'd end up saying something different.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``bita'' means ``forehead'', but ``bitaa,'' with a
slightly longer ``aa'' sound, means ``my father,'' said Edgar
Perry, an Apache who teaches youth and adult language classes in
Whiteriver and Cibicue.
</P>
<P>
   If you tried to say you slapped your forehead, but stretched out
the ``a'' too long, it could be embarrasing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, volunteer Bible translators began to record
Apaches talking, devised a way to write down their language, then
translate words into English and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The new 10,500-word dictionary is the second of two
Apache-English dictionaries published in Arizona, but it includes
about five times as many words as the first, released in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 61, who worked on both dictionaries, hopes the new book
will prolong interest in the Apache language, which he said is
losing out in Native American communities to English-dominated
television.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates about 70 percent of the public school students in
Whiteriver can't speak Apache or just understand a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Apaches) should get away from TV and ride a horse and go
see Grandma and learn a language. But it's English, all the time
English, English, English,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   But many youth are not receptive to learning the language of
their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little kids, they enjoy it at first. Some learn, but some are
too stubborn. They would understand it if their parents talked to
them,'' he said. &QL; 
ARIZONA DIALECTS
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary is aimed mainly at the White Mountain Apaches who
live on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in east central Arizona
and San Carlos Apaches on the San Carlos Apache Reservation east of
Phoenix. The book includes their different dialects.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 members of the White Mountain Apache Tribe spent about
15 years writing Apache words and their translations by hand onto
index cards for the latest dictionary, but their work stalled in
the late 1980s for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Their work, however, resumed after ``The Arizona Republic'' ran
a story in December 1988 on how the dictionary was languishing for
lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article got it going again,'' said Bray, 60, who also came
back to the project after dropping out for several years. ``I guess
it just kept haunting me. I felt if I didn't do it, it wouldn't get
done.'' &QL; 
ASU JOINS EFFORT
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University's Bilingual Press came on board and
worked with the project for another decade until it was done,
partly with the help of a $3,000 grant from the Arizona Humanities
Council.
</P>
<P>
   It took another 10 years because all the handwritten notes had
to be typed and entered into a computer for typesetting. Bray said
there were countless meetings to check and recheck the meanings and
spelling of words.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the longtime volunteers never lived to see the
dictionary published, including Wesley Bonito, a former tribal
education director who died in 1995, and Faith Hill, one of the
early Bible translators who died a few months before the dictionary
was published.
</P>
<P>
   The project was complicated because Apache, like its Navajo
cousin, has nasal, clicking and other sounds that can't be captured
by the English alphabet and some new characters had to be created.
For example, there's a sound made by putting your tongue on the
roof of your mouth that is depicted by an ``l'' with a slash
through it.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Perry could describe it was the ``tl'' sound in the
word ``atlas.''  &QL; 
Grammar differs
</P>
<P>
   The grammar also is different. There aren't separate gender
pronouns like he and she. Plural words refer to three or more,
instead of two or more as in English.
</P>
<P>
   Verbs come at the end of the sentence. For example, the
sentence, ``The horse is licking the salt'' would be said, ``Horse
salt licking'' in Apache, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it takes half a dozen Apache words or more to say
one English word, especially business and technology terms. ``New
words had to be made for all the 20th century inventions,'' Bray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend, for example, is conveyed by Apache terms for ``where
money is kept/you are part shareholder.''
</P>
<P>
   Apache, like many other Native American languages, predates the
arrival of the Spanish missionaries in the 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   So the Apaches apparently just incorporated the new words
introduced by the Spaniards or Mexicans, such as apple, ax, barrel,
cough, cow, dry, gold, money, onion, owl, pig, pocket, potato,
scar, scarf, soldier and thread, according to the earlier
dictionary. &QL; 
CULTURAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS
</P>
<P>
   In her years talking to Apaches, Bray also learned how their
speech patterns often differ from English. For example, they don't
raise their voice at the end of a question or to convey emotion.
</P>
<P>
   This can lead to misunderstanding, she said. ``We may think
Apaches have no emotion because they don't express them in their
speech patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Apache and Navajo are part of the Athabascan family of languages
also used by various bands of Athabascan Indians in Alaska, and
possibly distantly related to Asian languages.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists and linguists have theorized that Athabascan
ancestors somehow crossed the 55-mile-long Bering Strait perhaps
about 35,000 years ago and settled in Alaska, with some groups
migrating south. Perry contends the White Mountain Apaches settled
in their present location around 1300.
</P>
<P>
   Athabascans and Apaches share words for snow, mountain, water
and fire and many other essential subjects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's even some similarities to Japanese, such as the word
``kude,'' for ``here,'' Perry said. However, he said he would have
to study Japanese more to learn how much they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an odd twist if Apache and Navajo were distantly
related to Japanese. During World War II, the Marines used Navajos
as code talkers to transmit military secrets because the Japanese
couldn't understand the Native American language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navajo code talkers used it (Navajo) against the
Japanese,'' Perry said, ``and we have the same language.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also Apaches in New Mexico and Texas with different
dialects. &QL;

GAMING PANEL VOTES TO END BOARDING TIMES ON MISSOURI RIVERBOAT
CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Gaming Commission agreed
unanimously Wednesday to abolish restrictive casino boarding times,
but only if the casinos move all their automatic bank teller
machines away from the slot machines and other gambling areas.
</P>
<P>
   If wide-open gambling does come to Missouri, it won't happen
before Oct. 30 _ and perhaps not at all at Kansas City's largest
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers, casino operators, tourism boosters and others have
sought an end to boarding times since the first Missouri casinos
opened in 1994. The rule requires gamblers to stand in line as long
as 75 minutes, waiting to enter a casino.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/.MDNM/The ATM restrictions _ though they've been debated
in the General Assembly over the years _ came as a last-minute
surprise Wednesday from the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have open boarding, we think it's good
public policy to at least move them off the gaming floor,'' said
the commission's deputy director, Kevin Mullally. ``That way,
there's a cooling-off period that gives a player a little time to
think'' about withdrawing more money.
</P>
<P>
   The ATM issue probably won't become a sticking point, said Mike
Ryan, executive director of the Missouri Riverboat Gaming
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how they interpret `gaming area.' If it (new ATM
locations) doesn't become a great inconvenience to our customers,
we can work it out,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the change won't happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earliest date (for open boarding) is Oct. 30,'' said
Mullally, and that's only if the state's cumbersome administrative
rule-making procedure, including a round of public hearings, is not
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino Kansas City also might fight to keep ATMs on its
casino floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we would not agree to,'' said Troy
Stremming, Station's general counsel for Midwest operations.
``We're just inconveniencing the guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its competitive advantage as a two-boat casino with
staggered boarding times, Station officials in Kansas City and St.
Charles never joined the campaign for open boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel, Kansas City's other
two-boat operation, has been a leader in pushing for open boarding.
</P>
<P>
   If the change comes, Stremming said Wednesday, Station may not
change with it.
</P>
<P>
   He said if the price for open boarding is to inconvenience
guests' use of ATMs, ``We'd have to re-evaluate the situation and
determine if that is in the best interests of the operator and the
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to be left up to the individual operators,''
Stremming said.
</P>
<P>
   A commission staff report on open boarding estimated that the
change would increase annual casino revenues about $21 million _
less than 3 percent of the $800 million statewide casino market.
</P>
<P>
   And state and local government gaming taxes and fees collected
could increase by as much as $22.5 million, the staff said. Casino
companies are charged $2 a passenger for each two-hour cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern over open boarding centered on enforcement
of the state's $500 loss limit rule. Under state law, players can
buy up to $500 worth of slot machine tokens or table chips per
two-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   At informal public meetings last month to gauge public opinion
on the change, casino officials told the commission that the
electronic-swipe cards issued to slot club members and other guests
are programmed in two-hour increments to monitor players' spending.
</P>
<P>
   Although players will be less aware of the two-hour periods,
computers will keep track of how long players are using their
cards. Whenever a card is used during a new two-hour period, the
casino is billed another $2 by the state. The state keeps $1, and
the host city gets the other buck.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which met Wednesday in Maryland Heights, also:
</P>
<P>
   Set another new rule into procedural motion that would legalize
card counting in blackjack. The proposed rule also would permit
casinos to take countermeasures, including restricting mid-game
access and, under some circumstances, limiting the size of players'
bets.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri casino operators routinely bar known or suspected card
counters from their tables, saying their systems for mentally
keeping tabs of high and low cards played gives them an unfair
advantage. Kansas Citian Robert Cherry filed an objection to the
practice almost three years ago after he was barred from the tables
at Harrah's.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's proposed regulation is patterned after a rule in New
Jersey _ one of the few states that sanction card counting.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed a $25,000 fine against Station Casino Kansas City for
its slow reporting to state authorities of illegal gambling
activities in the casino hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said Station employees discovered a ``March
madness'' college basketball pool being conducted by patrons in a
hotel hospitality suite this spring, but did not report the
incident until a week later.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming agency requires any known law violations on the
premises to be reported immediately to law enforcement officers
assigned to each casino.
</P>
<P>
   Stremming, the Station counsel, said no decision on an appeal
had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Began writing regulations to enforce the General Assembly's
passage earlier this month of a measure that allows slot machine
customers to buy electronic credits instead of metal tokens to
begin play.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislation is signed by Gov. Mel Carnahan, that change
won't take effect until Aug. 28 at the earliest.

EXPANSION SOLIDIFIES KC PLANT AS BIGGEST FORD'S TOP PRODUCTION
FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ford Motor Co.'s Claycomo plant now is the
company's biggest producer of vehicles worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And the plant is expanding to accommodate increased production
expected from three new products, including the Lincoln Blackwood.
The Blackwood, which combines elements of a luxury sport-utility
vehicle and a pickup truck, made its Kansas City debut Wednesday on
the lawn of the Westin Crown Center hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the official unveiling with Ford executives were
officers of the United Auto Workers union and Missouri Gov. Mel
Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackwood, which is expected go into production in late
2000, will be the third product to be launched at the Claycomo
plant over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Ford expects to begin building the F-150
SuperCrew, a four-door pickup with a bigger backseat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ford plans to start producing a compact
sport-utility vehicle at Claycomo in the first quarter of next year
to replace its Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant last year built 404,083 vehicles, more than
any other Ford plant worldwide. Previously, Ford's plant in Genk,
Belgium, was its biggest producer, said David Thursfield, Ford's
vice president of vehicle operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Minor, Ford's Claycomo plant manager, said the facility
was being expanded and retooled in preparation for the new
products.
</P>
<P>
   Minor said construction in recent months had added 320,000
square feet to the plant, giving it 4.5 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will soon have the capacity to build 514,000 units a
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minor added that the Claycomo plant's F-series truck line would
increase its line speed this September to 55 vehicles an hour from
52 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the projected production boost, Ford officials
maintained Wednesday that they didn't anticipate a lot more jobs at
the Claycomo plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a minimal impact on employment, due to
attrition,'' said Rich Voytowich, a Ford spokesman. ``We're not
looking at hundreds of jobs being added.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kline, president of United Auto Workers Local 249, had
earlier disputed management's statement, saying there could be a
net gain of up to 600 jobs at Claycomo. However on Wednesday, Kline
said: ``I guess the question of the day is what will be the impact
on employment. We're going to have a stable work force well into
the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline gave credit to the 5,200 employees at Claycomo for Ford's
decision to produce three new vehicles there. ``They're the true
stars of this plant,'' he said.

BACKLASH TO HIGH CEO PAY: THEY'RE TAKING THE MONEY AND RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this irony, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same corporate boards that inflated executive
salaries to balloon-popping dimensions are whining now that they
can't retain their top talent. Their CEOs are taking early
retirement because /{they have all the money they need/}.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of years, I've attended periodic information
breakfasts presented by the Hay Group, a business consulting
organization that, among other things, studies and advises clients
on pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn A. Joy, a senior consultant in Hay's executive compensation
practice, didn't mince words at a recent breakfast when she warned
that huge pay packages for U.S. CEOs were causing problems. And
it's not just that the CEOs are so flush they're escaping to
Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it because worker-bee morale is hurt by insanely
skewed corporate pay structures. Big-company compensation
committees ignored that fallout while cultivating pay systems to
reward Fortune 500-type CEOs with more than 400 times the annual
pay of average blue-collar workers. (Just 20 years ago, the
difference was ``only'' about 40 times average-worker earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also a world marketplace backlash. This is a global
economy, remember? European and Asian executives are not drawing
anywhere near the monster bucks of their American counterparts, and
they don't like competing with those who do.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation kinks in the Daimler-Chrysler merger were a
perfect example. Uppermost Daimler execs earned noticeably less
than Chrysler execs in subordinate positions. Talk about difficulty
meshing corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the free-market theory of supply and demand _ which
holds that top executive talent commands whopping pay because
demand for proven business winners exceeds the supply _ has been
undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Joy blamed Section 162(m) of the federal tax code, passed in
1993. Reacting to public outcry against surging executive pay,
Congress decided that publicly traded companies no longer could
take tax deductions for compensation exceeding $1 million to any of
their top five executives, except for certain performance-based
compensation. Companies reacted by channeling more executive pay
into those performance-based exemptions, such as bonuses and stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   But the unintended legacy of the intended pay cap, Joy said,
``was that it sent out the message that, hey, we can go up to $1
million before there's a problem of excess _ so it just set a new
floor instead of a maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this surprises Responsible Wealth, a program of United
for a Fair Economy, and the Executive PayWatch project of the
AFL-CIO. The groups have campaigned for years for brakes on
executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their bottom line is pretty much mine in this regard: Yes, there
are executives whose intellect, vision, skill and charisma combine
to lead their organizations to strong growth and a competitive
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But show me one who's doing it alone.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't see how it's possible for Michael Eisner _ to pick
on one of the megabuck collectors _ to have /{earned/} $575 million
last year.

COURT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON UNUSUAL MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tyrone attacked his therapist when she came to check
on him at his Everett, Wash., home. Sam tried to save the woman,
but couldn't make Tyrone stop.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tyrone and Sam are jailed for life _ along with the 22 other
personalities said to occupy the head of the therapist's client,
William B. Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington state Supreme Court will hear arguments Thursday
on the unusual multiple personalities case, deciding whether Greene
should have been allowed to argue he was not guilty by reason of
insanity when he tied up and molested his therapist in 1994. In
doing so, the court will address a glaring clash between law and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One arm of the state _ mental health professionals at Twin
Rivers Corrections Center _ had diagnosed Greene with multiple
personality disorder, now known as disassociative identity
disorder, and treated him for the illness since 1991. Therapists
determined there were 24 separate personalities who ``took
executive control'' of Greene's body at times, from a baby girl
named Tabatha to the father-protector Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But another arm _ a Snohomish County Superior Court judge _
ruled there wasn't enough evidence that the disorder existed to
allow it at Greene's 1995 trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ``The state successfully prevented the jury from
hearing the very diagnosis that it had made years earlier,''
Greene's appeals lawyer, David Koch, said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury heard nothing of the mental disease, and convicted
Greene of indecent liberties and kidnapping. Greene, a
three-strikes, you're-out criminal with previous convictions
including a markedly similar indecent liberties case in 1988, was
sentenced to life in prison without possibility of release.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court last year reversed the Superior Court
decision and ordered a new trial for Greene. The appeals court
ruled that multiple personality disorder is indeed accepted in the
scientific community, relying particularly on its longtime
inclusion in the Diagnostic &AMP; Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, the bible of mental health diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will make a final ruling in the case after
deliberating Thursday's arguments, setting a statewide precedent
for future cases.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple personality defenses have been a rare phenomenon to
date nationwide, and there is no clear consensus in other state
courts on how to address them.
</P>
<P>
   But Seth Fine, the Snohomish County deputy prosecutor handling
the appeal, said the diagnosis is becoming increasingly common, and
is likely to make up a significant number of future cases if the
Supreme Court allows it as a legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the breadth of its ruling, the court's decision
also could open the door for other controversial mental disorders
to be considered at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched by mental health professionals who
deal with disassociative identity disorder _ including Greene's
victim, who had opposed the decision to block evidence of the
disease at trial. She had hoped to see Greene confined to a
psychiatric facility, where he would receive treatment, rather than
be sent to the state prison in Walla Walla.
</P>
<P>
   The therapist, according to court papers, visited Greene at his
Everett home the day of the attack fearing he might be suicidal
after losing a job. He blocked her from leaving, molested her over
a period of several hours, then bound and gagged her and fled in
her car, court papers said. She freed herself and went to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Both the therapist and Everett police who later interviewed
Greene noted Greene appeared to be switching among different
personalities, court papers said. The therapist recognized
``Tyrone,'' identified by one defense witness as a child whose
mother taught him to commit indecent liberties as a way to gain
love, as the personality in control at the time of the assault.
</P>
<P>
   A history of childhood abuse is common in patients diagnosed
with disassociative identity disorder, and Greene's therapy records
indicated a lifetime history of abandonment, physical and sexual
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Greene suffers a mental illness that is not appropriately
taken care of and addressed in a prison,'' his victim said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   While the attack was frightening and traumatic, the therapist
said, she had no doubt that it stemmed from Greene's disease and
not from the sexual sadism that a prosecution expert claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that some day society will look at people who
are mentally ill like we look at people who are physically ill, and
deal with it in that context and not send them behind bars,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys face obstacles in bringing most insanity pleas
to trial, grappling with a public often skeptical of mental illness
claims and a narrow legal definition of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   In Greene's case, those difficulties were compounded by his
controversial diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The dissension over disassociative identity disorder within the
mental health field influenced Superior Court Judge Richard
Thorpe's 1995 decision that only the most obvious, rare cases of
the disorder are generally accepted in that community and that the
disease didn't meet the legal standard for trials. Science can
offer no way to tell legitimate patients from malingerers, Thorpe
wrote, and can offer no consensus even on matters as basic as
whether one personality knows what another is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, Greene's appeals attorney, said the question isn't whether
every mental health professional believes the disease exists, but
whether it's a generally accepted diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   He _ and the appeals court _ holds that it does meet that
standard, relying partly on its inclusion in the most commonly used
diagnostic textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something is published in the (Diagnostic &AMP; Statistical
Manual), that means that according to the American Psychiatric
Association the research is sufficiently clear to say yes, this is
a (real) thing. I would offer that the controversy has more to do
with how widespread it actually is or isn't,'' said Dr. Robert
Olsen, past president of the Washington State Psychiatric
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen, who testified for the defense at Greene's 1995 hearing,
believes in the disorder's existence and has treated patients for
it since 1983. Still, he said, doubts remain among others in his
field and have become even more strident in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The legal controversy won't end even if the Supreme Court
accepts that there is a sufficient consensus the disease exists.
The state also has asked the court to address the mind-bending
legal questions its existence would raise _ namely, whether a
defendant's mind can really be divided into guilty and innocent
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity requires that
defendants either not know the difference between right and wrong
at the time of their actions or that they be unaware of the nature
and quality of their acts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Fine asked the state court to set strict guidelines
for when a ``multiple'' would be considered guilty, rather than
leave the matter to a case-by-case basis as the appeals court did.
</P>
<P>
   How, prosecutors asked, could a childlike personality within a
40-year-old man's mind have less awareness of right and wrong than
that man? How can one personality really control another, they
asked, when both are part of the same human being?
</P>
<P>
   ``People with DID create imaginary personalities and divide
responsibilities for their actions among them. The law should not
join them in this game,'' Fine said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Fine argues that if any alternate personality was aware that the
criminal acts were occurring and that they were wrong, the
defendant as a whole should be considered culpable.
</P>
<P>
   But Elyn Saks, a University of Southern California law professor
who has written extensively on the legal questions raised by the
disorder, argued the opposite in a brief that nine legal experts
filed with the appeals court on Greene's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Saks suggests it would be wrong to hold a multiple criminally
responsible for one personality's actions unless every other
personality knew about and acquiesced to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``non-retributive'' confinement would be called for if the
personality in question remained dangerous, she said, but prison
would be unreasonable since there's no way to punish just the
guilty personality and spare ``the innocents within.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's valuable for therapists to hold a multiple
responsible for one personality's actions during treatment, Saks
said this week, criminal responsibility is another matter. She
compared it to the value of parents spanking a 5-year-old child for
wrongdoing versus jailing the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (Greene) has his day in court,'' Saks said.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing evidence of multiple-personalities disorder in court
would be only right, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he should prevail is obviously a different matter.''

PREMATURE FIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't Charlie Hough's fault that the Dodgers picked up
Carlos Perez and unloaded Dave Mlicki. Nor can anyone accuse Hough
of goading Chan Ho Park's agent Steve Kim into contract talks that
got nowhere except into the pitcher's head.
</P>
<P>
   Hough couldn't help it if he was installed as pitching coach by
a regime that since has been pretty well purged. But somebody had
to pay for the sins of the team's .500 start. The ax conveniently
dropped Wednesday on the one-time Dodgers reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the knuckleball that was Hough's money pitch during his
25-year big-league career, the Dodgers' heave-ho didn't catch many
people off-balance. Anybody could see Hough was a made-to-order
scapegoat, as vulnerable to the blame-seeking missiles as Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' team ERA of 4.47 through their first 44 games was
just bloated enough to obscure the 3.68 team ERA and 11 complete
games that Dodgers pitchers threw last season on Hough's watch.
</P>
<P>
   First-year manager Davey Johnson foreshadowed the move in his
heavy-handed way, making repeated references over the past few days
to a corroding communication between the pitchers and the catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did we mention that Hough and Glenn Hoffman, the erstwhile
bullpen coach, were the only coaches Johnson inherited when he took
over for Hoffman who, in turn, had replaced Bill Russell?
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say Johnson had a voice in the selection of Hough's
successor, Claude Osteen, who brings to the task the one thing
Hough didn't: previous big-league coaching experience. Osteen has
13 years of it, most notably in Philadelphia. Osteen will be
working closely with former catcher and third-base coach Rick
Dempsey, who traded places with Hoffman in another personnel move
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So one bitter pill swallowed, a double dose of relief for this
headache of a season on the way. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers reached for the quick remedy last year _ firing the
front office, trading the franchise player and a few top prospects
_ and all they ended up with was a costly hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it . . . isn't? If the
Dodgers in 1998 and the Lakers in 1999 showed Angelenos anything,
it's that there isn't always a quick fix for what ails a team.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the best thing a front office can do is sit back and
wait for the aches and (growing) pains to run their course. Team
slumps can be a sort of fever, spiking and then receding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes if you rely on liquid cold medicines for relief, you
end up trading one symptom for another. The fever leaves and is
replaced by a drugged confusion. Sports teams also can trade one
malaise for another, if they're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   Take the trade of Mlicki to Detroit. The move was meant to give
the Dodgers some financial freedom. But all it has done is shrink
the margin for error among the remaining pitchers. The reliever
they got for Mlicki, Robinson Checo, appeared in two games before
being sent down to Albuquerque. The Dodgers couldn't in good
conscience keep Checo in L.A. after he allowed 10 hits and seven
runs in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you wonder if Heather Locklear, in those
Nike ads, isn't really saying, ``Checo digs the long ball.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been so many multihomer games this season _ there
were eight in one day alone last week _ the only thing tighter than
the new strike zones are the collars of pitching coaches.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone looks like he's fidgeting
more these days, there's a reason. Braves superstar pitchers Greg
Maddux's and Tom Glavine's early-season performances have been less
than Cy Young quality. But there's no talk there of replacing
Mazzone.
</P>
<P>
   The worry here is that the Dodgers panicked. A few months into
Kevin Malone's first year as general manager is no time to make
rush judgments and push good people aside.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' problems hinge on purpose, not personnel. The
team's record will get better as soon as does the players'
execution. Better to recognize that now, before another coach faces
the firing squad.

   LOS ANGELES _ This is one of those stories you cut out and put
up on the refrigerator so the next time your kids start complaining
about how tough they've got it, you can say, ``Yeah? Read this.''
</P>
<P>
   A gritty team of four young girls representing Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley last weekend in the All-City Los Angeles
Synchronized Swimming Championships won four gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty impressive considering their home pool, the city facility
at Cleveland High School in the Reseda community of the San
Fernando Valley where the girls were supposed to be training for
these championships, has been empty and shut down for more than a
year now because of El Nino damage.
</P>
<P>
   With other city pools throughout the Valley closed during the
winter months, the girls practiced their synchronized swimming
without any water. They trained mainly on the pool deck, backyard
lawns and in each other's living rooms. Sometimes, they got to use
the small pool at their coach's condo.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine winning the city baseball championships without your own
ballfield to practice on, the football title without a football
field, a tennis crown without tennis courts or a basketball
championship without your own hard court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, add one other thing. In one year, your team has gone from
30 girls down to four because of the pool closure.
</P>
<P>
   The winter championships have arrived and you're going up
against nine much-larger teams from throughout the city with their
own Recreation and Parks pool to practice in every day _ some teams
with private coaches for the girls.
</P>
<P>
   And, yet, you win.
</P>
<P>
   You don't quit on your team or your coach, said Michelle
Theriault and Hayley Hays, both 10, Heather Hays, 16, and Naeta
Rohr. No matter how tough things get. And things got pretty tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went anyplace we could and did a lot of land drills to make
up for the time we weren't able to be in the pool practicing,''
said Michelle, who won a gold medal in solo performance in the
midget novice division and then teamed with Hayley to win gold in
the duet performance in the midget open division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we were so surprised that we won,'' she said. ``We
thought the other girls would be much better than us, but we were
just as good as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges said better, honey.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley also won a gold medal in solo performance in the midget
open division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck it out because we love the sport and are very
dedicated to our team and our coach,'' said her older sister
Heather, who won a gold in solo performance in the senior division.
</P>
<P>
   It's been tough this past year, the girls said, coming to
practice and watching your teammates drop out because there was no
pool to practice in anymore or because they couldn't make the
earlier practice times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from 30 girls down to 18 when the pool closed, then
down to 10,'' said Brenda Erazo, a 22-year-old CSUN student who
coaches the team.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Recreation and Parks Department rented them time for
a couple of months at the Porter Valley pool before it closed for
the season, but the girls were given only one lane to practice
their routines in and it was pretty cold up there, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the team was left with only four swimmers, Erazo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Naeta, a beginner in synchronized swimming, went along to the
championships and participated in the novice division just for the
experience, Erazo said. She did not medal, but watch out for her
next year, her coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, we would practice our whole water ballet routine on the
pool deck,'' Erazo said. Or the team would go to each other's
houses and back yards _ turn on the music they would synchronize
swim to, and pretend that was water they were treading, not grass
they were stepping on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of them,'' Erazo said. ``I didn't think we would
win much, but I was hoping we would get a third or fourth in our
divisions because I knew these girls are very talented and would do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But they fooled everybody and won, proving it isn't the pool or
the logo on the equipment athletes use that makes them winners.
</P>
<P>
   It's the heart and drive inside, and these girls are loaded with
that to go along with their talent.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the city's Recreation and Parks Department,
which owns and operates the Cleveland High pool even though it's on
Los Angeles Unified School District property, is replastering the
pool next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, by mid- to late June, it'll be open again,'' said
Ralph Lew, project manager with the department.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, but it looks like the girls really don't need it.

DODGERS REGAIN ENERGY IN CINERGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ If this is what it takes to make the Dodgers'
offense take off, they might be out of coaches by the end of the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching coach Charlie Hough was fired earlier in the day
in what the players perceived as a shake-up move, the Dodgers
played one of their more sound games of the season and beat the
Cincinnati Reds 9-3 Wednesday at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Everything the Dodgers seemed to fail at in the past few weeks
was accomplished against the Reds. They scored early, received
solid starting pitching and came up with timely hits in a six-run
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (23-22) scored more than eight runs in a game for
only the second time since May 1 and kept from falling below .500
for the first time since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bats came alive,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``It was something we needed. It's what the doctor ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming sentiment in the Dodgers clubhouse was Hough
was fired to jolt the club, which had lost seven of its past nine.
Most of the players expressed remorse for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize it's not Charlie's fault,'' said Dodgers second
baseman Eric Young, who returned from sore ankle after missing
three games. ``We go out and hit the ball and field the ball. I
think (the game) was crisp because it starts with the pitchers.
Chan Ho (Park) pitched well.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's outing was a welcome sight to the Dodgers. Park (4-3)
pitched seven strong innings. He allowed two solo homers and three
runs but fought out of two bases-loaded situations in the fourth
and fifth innings, allowing just one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho battled,'' Johnson said. ``I'll tell you one thing: he
got in a couple of bases loaded jams and he battled. He showed me a
lot of heart. I've seen him a little sharper . . . but he made the
pitches he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should have felt the repercussions of Hough's firing,
it's Park. Left-hander Carlos Perez has pitched the poorest among
the Dodgers' starters, but Park could be classified as the biggest
disappointment through the first two months given the high
expectations placed upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Park's been inconsistent. He's yet to string together three
quality starts (three earned runs or less in six innings) this
season and has had trouble communicating with catcher Todd Hundley.
The two worked well together against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of confidence because we scored early,'' Park
said. ``I was really happy with that and with Hundley. We've been
talking about (getting on the same page) and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But inevitably, Park's thoughts drifted to Hough, who was
replaced by Triple-A Albuquerque pitching coach Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up and got the message it was . . . a surprise,''
Park said. ``I miss him because he was trying to help. I miss him.
He gave me an idea and I just followed that. He told me to throw
more fastballs and be ready to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Park was aided by the Dodgers' ability to score two runs in the
first, sparked by the return of Young. He went 2 for 4 with two RBI
and two runs scored to lead a 10-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   Young's single in the first gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead. He
scored when he stole third and Reds third baseman Mark Lewis
couldn't handle the throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied it on Sean Casey's solo homer in the first and
Lewis' sacrifice fly in the fourth before the Dodgers broke it open
against Brett Tomko (1-3) in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Young had an RBI double, Gary Sheffield doubled in a pair of
runs, Eric Karros stroked an RBI single and third baseman Adrian
Beltre hit a two-run homer to make it 8-2. Raul Mondesi added his
17th homer of the season in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys realize we haven't been playing well lately,'' Young
said. ``Maybe the shake-up of the coaching staff will make guys
realize we could be next.''

UCLA OFFICIAL NAMED IN ART THEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A former director of counseling at UCLA was
indicted on charges of stealing an original 19th century painting
and selling it for $200,000 through a middleman to a New York art
gallery, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beverly Hills attorney for Jane Crawford, 50, said the
oil painting by American impressionist Arthur Wesley Dow was given
to his client by a fellow UCLA counselor and that she's now being
used as a scapegoat to cover up for the university's carelessness
in protecting donated art.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's being held out as a scapegoat for their slipshod manner
in which they record and maintain donated works of art,'' said
attorney Lawrence S. Strauss. ``In my opinion, they are trying to
blame this all on her to protect their reputation so people will be
not be afraid of making donations of art in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA spokesman Harlan Lebo said he is unaware of another art
theft of this magnitude at the university. Daily News records show
that a painting of George Washington valued at $200,000 was stolen
from UCLA in March 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university does everything it possibly can to protect the
artwork and other materials donated to the university by very
generous benefactors, and we'll continue to do so,'' Lebo said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted Crawford late Tuesday on two
counts of wire fraud, two counts of interstate transportation of
cashier's checks fraudulently obtained from the gallery and one
count of engaging in monetary transactions involving funds obtained
through fraud, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ranee Katzenstein. If
convicted, the former director of counseling in the College of
Letters and Sciences faces a maximum of 40 years in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Crawford stole the ``Frost Flowers,
Ipswich 1889'' painting from UCLA in 1994 and sold the painting
through a middleman to the Ira Spanierman Gallery in New York for
$200,000. The painting depicts a field of flowers and a sky with
clouds in Ipswich, Mass. The proceeds were deposited into an
account controlled by Crawford and a cohort, Katzenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was used to pay her personal expenses,'' Katzenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who has worked at the university since 1976 as a
professor and most recently as a director of counseling, has agreed
to surrender to federal authorities. She will be arraigned in
federal court in Los Angeles in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the investigation by the FBI began in 1996 when
Crawford and her cohort, whom Katzenstein did not name, had a
dispute and he went to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators learned that Crawford had the painting in her
office at UCLA, took it to her house and then sold it through the
middleman to the New York gallery, Katzenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represented to the gallery that the co-schemer was the
true and rightful owner of the painting, which of course is
untrue,'' Katzenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   During the FBI's investigation, the Ira Spanierman Gallery sold
the painting to a collector for $300,000, Strauss said. After the
sale, the FBI seized the painting. Last November, the gallery filed
a lawsuit in New York against the UCLA Board of Regents to recover
the painting. A motion is now before a New York judge to transfer
the case to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, UCLA fired Crawford, Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have documents saying the reason they fired her is
because of the Spanierman lawsuit,'' Strauss said. ``In my view,
the firing of her is an effort to save face. If the painting was
the property of UCLA, they were lax and remiss in safeguarding this
apparently valuable donation.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss said Crawford is a ``poor scapegoat'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She reasonably believed at the time (that the UCLA counselor)
had ownership of the painting that he was giving to her and she
never had any intent to receive stolen property or deprive UCLA of
any of its property,'' he said. ``I feel very bad for her. She has
lived a very law-abiding life and was a professor with tenure.''

COURT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON UNUSUAL MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tyrone attacked his therapist when she came to check
on him at his Everett, Wash., home. Sam tried to save the woman,
but couldn't make Tyrone stop.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tyrone and Sam are jailed for life _ along with the 22 other
personalities said to occupy the head of the therapist's client,
William B. Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington state Supreme Court will hear arguments Thursday
on the unusual multiple personalities case, deciding whether Greene
should have been allowed to argue he was not guilty by reason of
insanity when he tied up and molested his therapist in 1994. In
doing so, the court will address a glaring clash between law and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One arm of the state _ mental health professionals at Twin
Rivers Corrections Center _ had diagnosed Greene with multiple
personality disorder, now known as disassociative identity
disorder, and treated him for the illness since 1991. Therapists
determined there were 24 separate personalities who ``took
executive control'' of Greene's body at times, from a baby girl
named Tabatha to the father-protector Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But another arm _ a Snohomish County Superior Court judge _
ruled there wasn't enough evidence that the disorder existed to
allow it at Greene's 1995 trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ``The state successfully prevented the jury from
hearing the very diagnosis that it had made years earlier,''
Greene's appeals lawyer, David Koch, said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury heard nothing of the mental disease, and convicted
Greene of indecent liberties and kidnapping. Greene, a
three-strikes, you're-out criminal with previous convictions
including a markedly similar indecent liberties case in 1988, was
sentenced to life in prison without possibility of release.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court last year reversed the Superior Court
decision and ordered a new trial for Greene. The appeals court
ruled that multiple personality disorder is indeed accepted in the
scientific community, relying particularly on its longtime
inclusion in the Diagnostic &AMP; Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, the bible of mental health diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will make a final ruling in the case after
deliberating Thursday's arguments, setting a statewide precedent
for future cases.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple personality defenses have been a rare phenomenon to
date nationwide, and there is no clear consensus in other state
courts on how to address them.
</P>
<P>
   But Seth Fine, the Snohomish County deputy prosecutor handling
the appeal, said the diagnosis is becoming increasingly common, and
is likely to make up a significant number of future cases if the
Supreme Court allows it as a legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the breadth of its ruling, the court's decision
also could open the door for other controversial mental disorders
to be considered at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched by mental health professionals who
deal with disassociative identity disorder _ including Greene's
victim, who had opposed the decision to block evidence of the
disease at trial. She had hoped to see Greene confined to a
psychiatric facility, where he would receive treatment, rather than
be sent to the state prison in Walla Walla.
</P>
<P>
   The therapist, according to court papers, visited Greene at his
Everett home the day of the attack fearing he might be suicidal
after losing a job. He blocked her from leaving, molested her over
a period of several hours, then bound and gagged her and fled in
her car, court papers said. She freed herself and went to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Both the therapist and Everett police who later interviewed
Greene noted Greene appeared to be switching among different
personalities, court papers said. The therapist recognized
``Tyrone,'' identified by one defense witness as a child whose
mother taught him to commit indecent liberties as a way to gain
love, as the personality in control at the time of the assault.
</P>
<P>
   A history of childhood abuse is common in patients diagnosed
with disassociative identity disorder, and Greene's therapy records
indicated a lifetime history of abandonment, physical and sexual
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Greene suffers a mental illness that is not appropriately
taken care of and addressed in a prison,'' his victim said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   While the attack was frightening and traumatic, the therapist
said, she had no doubt that it stemmed from Greene's disease and
not from the sexual sadism that a prosecution expert claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that some day society will look at people who
are mentally ill like we look at people who are physically ill, and
deal with it in that context and not send them behind bars,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys face obstacles in bringing most insanity pleas
to trial, grappling with a public often skeptical of mental illness
claims and a narrow legal definition of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   In Greene's case, those difficulties were compounded by his
controversial diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The dissension over disassociative identity disorder within the
mental health field influenced Superior Court Judge Richard
Thorpe's 1995 decision that only the most obvious, rare cases of
the disorder are generally accepted in that community and that the
disease didn't meet the legal standard for trials. Science can
offer no way to tell legitimate patients from malingerers, Thorpe
wrote, and can offer no consensus even on matters as basic as
whether one personality knows what another is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, Greene's appeals attorney, said the question isn't whether
every mental health professional believes the disease exists, but
whether it's a generally accepted diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   He _ and the appeals court _ holds that it does meet that
standard, relying partly on its inclusion in the most commonly used
diagnostic textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something is published in the (Diagnostic &AMP; Statistical
Manual), that means that according to the American Psychiatric
Association the research is sufficiently clear to say yes, this is
a (real) thing. I would offer that the controversy has more to do
with how widespread it actually is or isn't,'' said Dr. Robert
Olsen, past president of the Washington State Psychiatric
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen, who testified for the defense at Greene's 1995 hearing,
believes in the disorder's existence and has treated patients for
it since 1983. Still, he said, doubts remain among others in his
field and have become even more strident in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The legal controversy won't end even if the Supreme Court
accepts that there is a sufficient consensus the disease exists.
The state also has asked the court to address the mind-bending
legal questions its existence would raise _ namely, whether a
defendant's mind can really be divided into guilty and innocent
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity requires that
defendants either not know the difference between right and wrong
at the time of their actions or that they be unaware of the nature
and quality of their acts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Fine asked the state court to set strict guidelines
for when a ``multiple'' would be considered guilty, rather than
leave the matter to a case-by-case basis as the appeals court did.
</P>
<P>
   How, prosecutors asked, could a childlike personality within a
40-year-old man's mind have less awareness of right and wrong than
that man? How can one personality really control another, they
asked, when both are part of the same human being?
</P>
<P>
   ``People with DID create imaginary personalities and divide
responsibilities for their actions among them. The law should not
join them in this game,'' Fine said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Fine argues that if any alternate personality was aware that the
criminal acts were occurring and that they were wrong, the
defendant as a whole should be considered culpable.
</P>
<P>
   But Elyn Saks, a University of Southern California law professor
who has written extensively on the legal questions raised by the
disorder, argued the opposite in a brief that nine legal experts
filed with the appeals court on Greene's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Saks suggests it would be wrong to hold a multiple criminally
responsible for one personality's actions unless every other
personality knew about and acquiesced to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``non-retributive'' confinement would be called for if the
personality in question remained dangerous, she said, but prison
would be unreasonable since there's no way to punish just the
guilty personality and spare ``the innocents within.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's valuable for therapists to hold a multiple
responsible for one personality's actions during treatment, Saks
said this week, criminal responsibility is another matter. She
compared it to the value of parents spanking a 5-year-old child for
wrongdoing versus jailing the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (Greene) has his day in court,'' Saks said.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing evidence of multiple-personalities disorder in court
would be only right, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he should prevail is obviously a different matter.''

METS DEFEAT PIRATES, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Orel Hershiser had his second straight strong
outing on Wednesday night in the New York Mets' 5-2 victory over
the Pirates. But, after the game, the Mets received troubling news
about Jason Isringhausen, once considered one of their most
promising young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen felt pain in his surgically reconstructed right
elbow, and is having another magnetic resonance imaging test on it
Thursday. He said on Wednesday that he felt something he had never
felt before in his elbow after a 14-minute side session on
Wednesday afternoon. He and the rest of the Mets are hoping it is
nothing more than the breaking of scar tissue, but it obviously
puts his scheduled start against Arizona at Shea Stadium on
Saturday in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The initial diagnosis is a strain. ``It was just something I
never felt before,'' Isringhausen said late Wednesday night after
his latest setback. ``That's why I'm hoping it's just scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was an inch over, then I'd be worried,'' Isringhausen
added, pointing at his scarred elbow. ``But this is just another
nice day in my life. It's starting to become a joke. I'm just tired
of it. Every time I get close to being back, something's wrong.
Just the timing of it is more upsetting than anything.
</P>
<P>
   The news about Isringhausen put a damper on the Mets' sixth
victory in their last eight games, one that featured good hitting
and better pitching from the 40-year-old Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   But fortunately for the Mets, Hershiser (4-4) is feeling good
these days. He allowed five hits and two runs in six-plus innings,
and went 2 for 3 with a run-scoring double, en route to his second
straight victory. In three starts now with his new contact lenses,
Hershiser has allowed 8 runs in 18 2/3 innings, a respectable
earned run average of 3.86.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Hershiser _ who is now 6 victories shy of 200 for his
career _ admitted that he had questioned whether he was done after
he had allowed 22 runs in 29 1/3 innings, for an era of 6.75 over
his first three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have thoughts,'' said Hershiser, whose era is now
down to 5.63 ``Because even though I was healthy and strong as an
ox, I didn't have an idea where the ball was going. So it could
have been something as simple as my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser received a team effort on Wednesday. Benny Agbayani
belted a lead-off homer off former Mets left-hander Pete Schourek
(2-5) in the top of the fourth to tie the game at 1-1. Hershiser
later pulled his bat back on a fake bunt attempt and whacked a
run-scoring double into left.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hershiser was eventually thrown out at the plate
trying to score from second on Warren Morris' error at second,
before Morris tied the game in the bottom of the fifth with a
two-out home run, Edgardo Alfonzo and Robin Ventura each whacked
consecutive doubles in the sixth to give the Mets the lead for
good.
</P>
<P>
   After Hershiser _ who threw only 80 pitches _ walked
Pittsburgh's No. 8 hitter, Abraham Nunez on his first _ and last _
four pitches of the seventh, Dennis Cook recorded the next three
outs to preserve the lead.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after Armando Benitez struck out the side on 13
pitches in the eighth, John Olerud delivered a 2-run single in the
top of the ninth, before John Franco pitched a scoreless ninth for
his 14th save in 14 tries.  &QL;

OSTEEN TAKES OVER AS PITCHING COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN d 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When Charlie Hough was promoted to pitching coach
of the Dodgers last summer, the staff experienced success.
</P>
<P>
   When Davey Johnson was choosing a pitching coach upon being
named manager of the Dodgers in the fall, he took that success into
account when deciding between Hough and Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hough was fired Tuesday, factored in the difficulty of
finding a new pitching coach in midseason, Osteen was the natural
fit. He was promoted from Triple-A Albuquerque to be the Dodgers'
pitching coach. He arrived here late Tuesday night and was on the
bench for Wednesday's 9-3 win against the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to be about pitching,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``Right now I'd have to say we haven't pitched
up to those expectations. I think Claude will help us establish an
approach, a tone, that will clearly establish the Dodgers pitching
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was concerned how the pitchers would react to
Osteen given their close relationship with Hough. But he said
Osteen, who has been a pitching coach for 13 years in the majors,
should be helped because he's worked with many of the Dodgers'
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Osteen watched several of the Dodgers' pitchers
throw on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing for the whole team,'' Osteen, 59, said.
``You get close to the team and coaches and you realize how much
they try to help you. I know, basically, what kind of stuff they've
got and what they throw.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to spending the last three seasons at Albuquerque,
Osteen was the pitching coach when staff ace Kevin Brown was played
for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen said he'll work with the pitchers on holding runners on
base and to quicken deliveries to home. He said it will take a few
weeks for him to familiarize himself with the pitchers on staff.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaches switch spots: Hough and Osteen weren't the only
coaches involved in movement. Johnson also had coaches Glenn
Hoffman and Rick Dempsey swap roles. Hoffman will coach third base;
Dempsey moves to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he made the move so Dempsey could have more
hands-on dealings with the pitchers and catchers. Johnson said one
of the reasons the decision was made to fire Hough were weaknesses
in communication with the battery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That precipitated having Dempsey more involved with the
pitchers and catchers,'' Johnson said. ``This is not a demotion in
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no overlooking the fact that in 44 games the
Dodgers had seven runners thrown out at the plate _ four from the
outfield and three from the infield on nonforce plays.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the Dodgers' manager last season, doubled as Triple-A
Albuquerque's manager and third-base coach in the 1{ seasons he
spent with the Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, (Dempsey) was fine at third,''
Johnson said. ``He has the make-up. He fits over there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra bases: Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi hit his
National League-leading 17th homer in the ninth inning. . . .
Though Chan Ho Park recorded the win for the Dodgers, he gave up
two homers. He's tied with Ismael Valdes for most homers yielded on
the staff with 12. . . . Cincinnati's Mike Cameron struck out for
the 54th time in 41 games in the first inning.

WELFARE BANKING REFORMS LAGGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine months after a self-imposed deadline for
putting welfare payments into families' bank accounts by direct
deposit, Los Angeles County is still at least 15 months away from
starting the program because of computer difficulties, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay means tens of thousands of welfare families will
continue giving a percentage of their monthly aid to check-cashing
firms that distribute the checks for the county.
</P>
<P>
   Many welfare recipients don't have bank accounts, and financial
institutions won't cash their checks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The program had a scheduled starting date of Sept. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A further delay of 15 months or longer should be unnecessary for
the Department of Public Social Services, said Tessa Carmen De Roy,
director of banking programs for Strategic Actions for a Just
Economy, a nonprofit group advocating electronic direct deposit of
welfare checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody else could do it in three months,'' De Roy said.
``They need to make it a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should start doing it now,'' said welfare recipient Rita
Mancha, 48, of Pacoima, who said she worries about getting robbed
outside the check-cashing office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer the bank,'' she said. ``That would be much better and
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County used to mail out welfare checks but so many
mail carriers were getting mugged around the first of the month
that the U.S. Postal Service complained, and the county switched to
the check cashing outlets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much trouble setting up the new computer
system that officials had to postpone direct-deposit capability,
said Vance Martin, chief of eligibility for the welfare-to-work
program in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Each county administers the California Work Opportunity and
Responsibility to Kids program welfare-to-work program.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the county's welfare families cash their
CalWORKS aid checks at the check-cashing firms that distribute them
and pay as much as 3 percent as a fee, said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   A welfare check is roughly $600 for a mother and two children,
and a 3 percent fee takes $18 from them every month.
</P>
<P>
   Getting direct deposit of welfare checks is important because
``it takes a lot of hardship out of people's lives,'' said Gilda
Haas, director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has developed a pilot program in which welfare
checks would be hand-delivered to special savings accounts that
Washington Mutual has agreed to set up for as many as 1,000 welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The program could start in August, Martin said. It was supposed
to start June 1, but the county has had to work out liability
issues, such as who is liable if the courier fails to deliver the
checks to Washington Mutual's processing office in Chatsworth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program will be in the South Central and East Los
Angeles districts of county Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and
Gloria Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said she plans to meet with the department director, Lynn
Bayer, next week to urge speedy availability of direct deposit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything should be done to try to speed things up,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County has nearly 232,000 welfare families.

HEALTHY NIEUWENDYK HELPS STARS TAKE 2-1 LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Joe Nieuwendyk has been fighting the flu bug for two
weeks. And only last night could you tell just how much it has been
bothering him.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, who said he has been loading up on sleep and
vitamins, had his leg speed back and skated circles around the
Colorado Avalanche, scoring a goal and dishing out two assists to
lead the Stars to a 3-0 victory in Game 3 of the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same kind of performance that Nieuwendyk had been
producing at the beginning of the playoffs, and combined with the
electrifying goaltending of Ed Belfour, gave the Stars a 2-1 lead
in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel so much better now, like I can skate again,''
Nieuwendyk said before the game. ``I just felt so bad for such a
long time, like I was just holding on. Now, I can feel it coming
back, my legs and my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Nieuwendyk could be the key to the Stars' chances at a
Stanley Cup. After all, several players said Nieuwendyk's injury
last year was what sank the Stars. Now, the 1-2 punch of Mike
Modano and Nieuwendyk is proving to be the undoing of the
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're both going, I don't know how you check them,''
Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers said. ``Individually they mean a
ton to us. Together, they're incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's performance was so strong that it almost made
Belfour's spectacular night in goal seem average. But in stopping
34 shots and posting his sixth career playoff shutout, Belfour
continued to put up the best numbers of any NHL playoff goalie. His
1.61 goals-against average is better than the Avalanche's Patrick
Roy, the Toronto Maple Leafs' Curtis Joseph and the Buffalo Sabres'
Dominik Hasek. His .934 save average is better than Roy's and
Joseph's. Hasek's .942 save average tops all playoff goalies, but
Hasek is out with a groin injury and Belfour has been busy winning
two of the biggest games in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about the guy, he's been our best player in
the playoffs,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said of Belfour. ``This
was a big game, a road game. Your goaltender has to be your best
player in road playoff game, and he was that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk wasn't far behind. He tallied his eighth goal of the
playoffs, second only to Detroit's Steve Yzerman _ and he recorded
his fifth game-winning goal, leading the NHL in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably more key than Mo,'' Avalanche winger Theo Fleury
said. ``When they need a big goal or a big play, they really look
to Joe to go out there and make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk was somewhat lucky on his first goal, but he earned
the luck with a fantastic shift. After keeping the puck in the
offensive zone for 25 seconds and getting a shot on goal,
Nieuwendyk wheeled behind the Avalanche net to win the battle for a
loose puck. Looking to create a scoring chance, Nieuwendyk tossed
the puck into the slot and watched as it deflected in off the skate
of Avalanche defenseman Aaron Miller at the 2:22 mark of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge, it gave us something to show for our effort,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   And Nieuwendyk and his linemates also worked for the other two
goals. On goal No. 2, winger Dave Reid gave up his body and took a
heavy check to make a pass to Nieuwendyk in the neutral zone after
a Fleury turnover. Nieuwendyk then hit Jamie Langenbrunner with a
pass from the left wing to the slot, and Langenbrunner lifted in an
insurance goal at the 10:44 mark of the third period. Reid added
another goal at the 16:05 mark, and the Stars were under the skin
of the Avalanche, who dropped to 2-5 in home playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were struggling at home and we wanted to take
advantage of that,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``We did and
we put the pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars were outshot 34-26 in the game, they again kept
their composure in a critical third period and received key
performances by all six defensemen, by Nieuwendyk, Reid and
Langenbrunner, by Belfour and by Carbonneau, who continued to be a
defensive demon and still fired a team-high five shots.
</P>
<P>
   And with all that, the Stars still vow to play better in Game 4
tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better because we were sucking wind all
night,'' Hitchcock said. ``With four days at this altitude, I
really feel we will be better in Game 4.''

KOREAN PITCHER EARNING RAVE REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ The kid they call B.K. has learned a new English
greeting this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up?'' Byung-Hyun Kim says to pitcher Dan Carlson in the
Tucson Sidewinders clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson rubs his sore right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Kim grabs Carlson's right hand and begins massaging the knuckle
on his ring finger. It's a pressure point that is supposed to
relieve soreness in the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You supposed to feel this much pressure?'' Carlson says,
cringing.
</P>
<P>
   Kim doesn't understand what Carlson is saying and continues
working the knuckle, deeply, quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experiment now, but he was ready to drop me on that
one,'' Carlson says later. ``I tell you what, if it helps my
soreness in my elbow, I'm going to be rubbing that knuckle every
single day.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Kim (his first name is pronounced Be Young He
Yun) didn't come here from Korea to provide acupressure for
sore-limbed players in the Diamondbacks organization. Signed in
February as a free agent, he's here to pitch, bringing 90-plus-mph
fastballs sidearm and submarine style, throwing four different
sliders, bringing breaking balls that dance to the plate, as El
Paso catcher Rod Barajas described.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the Diamondbacks envision him on the
mound at Bank One Ballpark someday. The question with Kim is not
if, but when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim has a very special arm,'' said Tommy Jones, Diamondbacks
director of minor league operations, who is monitoring the
right-hander's progression from Double-A El Paso to Triple-A
Tucson. ``The biggest challenges are off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving in Tucson in late March, late because of
visa problems, Kim asked Manager Buck Showalter _ through
24-year-old interpreter Min Soo Kim _ whether it would be all right
if he pitched against Korean phenom Chan Ho Park in Arizona's
season-opening series in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Slow down.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stuff of dreams and part of the confidence that Kim
took with him to America, where he is embarking on a whole new
world, one in which he is finding his way with an interpreter by
his side.
</P>
<P>
   He finds a sense of home through the Korean restaurants and all
the McDonald's locations along the way to what he hopes is a quick
rise to the big leagues. McDonald's is big in Seoul, Kim says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves McDonald's hamburgers,'' said Levern Wilson, who owns
Seoul Restaurant in El Paso, a five-minute jaunt from the park in
which Kim was dominating this month.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who speaks Korean and whose wife is from Korea, took in
the two Kims (no relation) while they were in El Paso. Nearly every
day, they came to the restaurant for kim chee soup, Byung-Hyun's
favorite dish. Wilson would use extra spice for the young Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Min Soo said when they go out to eat American food, he has to
describe everything on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes chicken, but he wants to know every ingredient that
went into making it,'' Min Soo said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he moved from El Paso, Kim corresponds with Wilson, who
wants Kim to branch out from Korean food and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he tried steak but didn't like it,'' Wilson said. ``I
said, `Put some seasoning on it. There's more than one way to cook
a steak.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Menus and the English language have been far more puzzling than
the batters he has faced so far.
</P>
<P>
   In his short stint in El Paso, Kim was 2-0 with a 2.11 ERA in
relief appearances. He had four balks, a flaw that has been
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a mandate from the (Texas) league that his delivery was
illegal because it had a little pause in it,'' El Paso pitching
coach Dennis Lewallyn said. ``We corrected that. We taught him all
the bunt plays and team defense. We let him pitch and get used to
pro baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim has been a starter in Tucson. In his Triple-A debut May 14
in Omaha, Kim threw 5 innings, striking out seven, walking one and
giving up two runs on three hits for the win. He was less than
impressive in his second start but was dominating Monday in a 4-0
victory over Fresno, working seven scoreless innings, giving up
four hits and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not difficult, but the batters are more patient here,''
Kim said through his interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   If batters are more patient at the Triple-A level, wait until he
sees major league hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still very much learning his trade,'' Diamondbacks
General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``Everything is so much
faster, things like defense and covering the bases and throws over
to first base. There are so many things.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional homesick feeling, Kim says he doesn't
feel lost on or off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   He is loose in the clubhouse, laughing with teammates, even
though he doesn't know what he's laughing`` at'' most of the time.
He is charmed by closer Rich Batchelor's guitar. He says he beats
starter Nelson Figueroa in fighting games on Play Station. Every
once in a while, he springs a Spanish phrase he learned from one of
the Latin players on a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's picking up more or less the swear words in Spanish,''
Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Batchelor tries to communicate with Kim through music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a nice guy, but it's got to be tough, coming into
a new culture and learning a new language,'' Batchelor said.
``Everyone includes him in everything, whether it's goofing around
in the clubhouse or going out to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   When pitcher Bobby Chouniard recently was brought up from
Tucson, Garagiola and Showalter asked how Kim was doing with his
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby said, `Actually, I think he's farther along in his
Spanish,' '' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks organization received permission from the Texas
and Pacific Coast leagues for Kim's interpreter to dress in uniform
and come to the mound for meetings with Kim. But that is not
permitted in the major leagues, Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter says the only Korean he knows is ``Byung-Hyun Kim.'' &QL; 
So far, the kid with the infectious smile is progressing so well
that the call to bring him to the Diamondbacks could come sooner
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In his last appearance in El Paso, Byung-Hyun struck out eight
in four innings and ``looked like he was overmatching everybody,''
said Matt Hicks, Diablos play-by-play announcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Diamondbacks were treating him special,'' Hicks
said. ``They didn't use him as a closer, only in a certain way in
relief. That limited how much an impact he could have had. He'd
come in the sixth or seventh inning, when not a lot was on the line
and there was no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucson Manager Chris Speier hit against former submarine
pitchers Dan Quisenberry and Ted Abernathy, but none with Kim's
velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a tremendous sinker,'' Speier said. ``But then, his
breaking ball goes the opposite. You're used to seeing breaking
balls go down. He's got the breaking ball that goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun has a exercise routine that has his fellow pitchers
shaking their heads in amazement. He throws daily. He is constantly
on the bike or treadmill. He's lifting weights, running around the
park. El Paso Manager Don Wakamatsu said he had to slow down Kim's
pace after seeing him do exercises in the bullpen four innings
before he was scheduled to pitch the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Speier says he lets Kim go, knowing his regimen works for him.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks management realizes it has a gem.
</P>
<P>
   Min Soo was showing Kim how to grip the ball before the
Diamondbacks coaching staff stepped in and explained to Min Soo
that his job is to coach English.
</P>
<P>
   Min Soo understands. &QL; 
The two, it seems, are connected, if not at the hip. They live with
a Korean family in Tucson. Min Soo, a former pitcher and outfielder
who once had big league dreams like the man he speaks for, was
working for the Diamondbacks as a scout in Canada before Garagiola
hired him to be Kim's interpreter. Min Soo will join Kim in Phoenix
if the pitcher gets another promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a basketball, Kim keeps an English translator book in
his locker stall.
</P>
<P>
   Min Soo gives Byung-Hyun a new word or phrase to learn in
English each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing well,'' Min Soo said. ``I keep the words small,
simple. He's learning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ken Huckaby, who roomed with Chan Ho Park in Albuquerque
in '95 when the hard-throwing pitcher came over from Korea to work
his way up the Dodgers organization, said both are soft-spoken and
exude confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to read (Kim),'' Huckaby said. ``He seems to
be having a good time out there more so than worrying about what is
going on. He's confident that nobody in baseball can hit his
slider. So he's always got that to fall back on when he's out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim doesn't admit it, but his teammates know he misses his
parents. He writes to them. They live in Kwangsan-ku Songjung-dong,
Ko rea, where Byung-Hyun said baseball is work and ``not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it fun here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. It is very fun,'' he said, his eyes lighting up.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he'll return to Korea in November to serve a four-week
military training stint. Then he'll return to Arizona and take a
crash course in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I found out, there seems to be a correlation to
learning the language and developing as a player. There's that
ability to understand what is being told by the coaches,''
Garagiola said. &QL; 
Kim is getting a crash course on baseball with the Diamondbacks,
and his name could be called soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Showalter said ``it's tough to put a timetable on a
20-year-old'' still learning the culture and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to bring him up for the sake of bringing him
up,'' Garagiola said. ``The baseball highways are littered with
young players who were rushed in.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the rate Kim is going, the Diamondbacks may have no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   He thrives on facing the best in America. He caught the
organization's attention last year when he was a member of the
Korean national team. During a trip to Tucson, pitching against an
American team, Kim struck out 15 in 6 innings. He led the team to
the finals of the World Championships in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he looks forward to the day when he can pitch against
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what they are doing, taking me step by step,''
Kim said through Min Soo. ``I'm very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Parr, president of the El Paso Diablos, predicts that by
August, when he gives away five yo-yos with snapshots of the club's
top prospects who started the year there _ including pitchers John
Patterson, Nick Bierbrodt and Brad Penny _ Kim's will be the most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be huge,'' Parr said. ``Everybody's going to want that
yo-yo.'' &QL; 
Hicks said it's easy to root for Kim because he's not only pleasant
and easy-going, but has the underdog look at 5 feet 11, 176 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can get guys out at the big league level,'' Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who befriended Park during his transition period in pro
baseball in 1994 and gave him a place to live during his minor
league stint in San Antonio (where Wilson and his wife lived at the
time), said he often is asked which one is better.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson won't answer that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I will tell is that Kim will go a long ways,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is ready, translation books in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the vision of pitching in Bank One Ballpark,
Byung-Hyun turns to Min Soo and says in Korean: ``It is no longer a
dream. It's a matter of time now.'' &QL;

STARS DISPLAY THE BENEFITS OF VERSATILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Forty-eight hours earlier it was out with the old, and
in with the new. The Stars had stomped on the gas pedal, enjoyed
immense success on this new fast track, and therefore, horsepower
hockey was here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about how the Stars used to do it. After Game 2 at
Reunion Arena, there would be no more rope-a-dope acts while
sitting on slim leads. And Ken Hitchcock all but vowed to burn his
defensive bible.
</P>
<P>
   And if you believed that ...
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour has a couple of dented posts and one dimpled
crossbar he'd like to sell you.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as you win, it never matters how, right?
</P>
<P>
   Round 3 of the NHL's Western Conference finals here last night
came down to a third-period stretch with the Stars trying to hide
behind a one-goal lead. It was a defensive shell game that had only
one chance to succeed. That one chance was named Belfour, who gave
the performance of his between-the-pipes life.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour refused to lose the lead, or the game.
</P>
<P>
   And style of play, even though totally different from Monday
night in Dallas, again worked beautifully. Lured into offensive
mistakes, the Avalanche was stung twice in the last 11 minutes of
the third period, and the Stars hung up a 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Home-ice advantage swung back to Dallas, now up 2-1 in the
series, but more important, deep frustration piled up on Colorado's
front porch. In a 48-hour span, the Avalanche lost a shootout,
which is their strength, and then last night saw Belfour beat them
in goal _ and wasn't that advantage suppose to belong to Patrick
Roy in this series?
</P>
<P>
   But back in North Texas, there had to be massive nerve damage
watching the Stars try to milk a third-period lead for nearly half
of the final 20 minutes. And just think how Belfour must have felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't us sitting on the lead as much as it was trying to
work their defensemen as much as possible, hoping to wear them
down,'' said Hitchcock. ``The gamble was that the more we could
force the defensemen to start inching up on the rush, the better
chance we had for a mistake to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a mistake did happen, and probably not soon enough for
Belfour. Among his 34 saves, about 12 of them were on the
sensational side. Plus, he had the help of the crossbar and a post
in the second period, and another shot clanged off the post in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the mistake Dallas needed. The little man, Theoren
Fleury, lost the puck in the Dallas zone to Darryl Sydor, who fed
Dave Reid at neutral ice, and that set up a blunder by Colorado
defenseman Adam Foote.
</P>
<P>
   With Reid an easy target along the boards, Foote buried him with
a check, but not before Reid shoveled the puck to Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hitchcock said, a defenseman was pinching instead of
playing his man. Nieuwendyk was off to the races on an odd-man rush
with Jamie Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect feed across the slot set up Langenbrunner's
one-timer, which sailed above Roy's left shoulder and into the
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was 2-0 with 11 minutes left, and the air was sucked out
of McNichols Sports Arena. As a matter of fact, the McNichols crowd
was docile all evening, taken out of the game by Belfour's robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing about the third period was we were wearing
down in the thin air,'' said Hitchcock. ``The altitude got to us.
We had some shifts out there with guys just hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee you we will play a better game on Thursday
night. That will give us four days up here, and we will be
acclimated. But it was a struggle tonight. Eddie had to save us.''
</P>
<P>
   A fluke second-period goal by Nieuwendyk changed the entire
course of the game. But there was nothing fluke about the way the
goal was set up.
</P>
<P>
   With Reid on the line with Nieuwendyk and Langenbrunner, they
dominated the Avalanche on every shift, and that line scored all
three goals. But in a forechecking frenzy early in the second
period, the puck stayed in the Colorado zone forever. Nieuwendyk
centered a shot from behind the goal that hit off the toe of
defenseman Aaron Miller's skate, and then scooted past Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Luck? Yes. But luck came as a result of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen in hockey,'' said Miller, ``but if we're
gonna give them the lead in every game, it going to be a long
series for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That one-goal lead caused the Stars to play the old way last
night. But they've also won in this series doing it the horsepower
way. And now Colorado has to guess what's coming next in Game 4.

`CRAZY EDDIE' SHOWS NO SIGNS OF MELTDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ To some knee-jerk critics, he will always be Crazy
Eddie, the Inevitable Melting Goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the scouting report will always say that the way to get
to Ed Belfour is through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the jury's still out on Eddie,'' Stars teammate
Mike Modano said last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the jury is in.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 3-0, in a manner of speaking. In these Stanley Cup
playoffs, we were reminded at McNichols Arena, the jury has found
Belfour not guilty of lapsing into Crazy Eddie. Belfour, not guilty
of allowing himself to be goaded into distraction. Belfour, not
guilty of being a speedbump on the road to Lord Stanley's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has pretty much silenced his critics,'' Modano
continued, after Belfour himself had stifled the Colorado
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been our best player.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time, indeed, to reassess the playoff prowess of Ed
Belfour. Time to peer again into those azure-blue eyes and try to
see what one can see.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the Stars' playoff fates were cast last year when
Belfour began raining fists on Shawn Burr late in an
already-decided first-round game at San Jose. It was a hint, they
said, of the total meltdown to come in the Western Conference
finals at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   What hogwash. The critics seem to ignore that the Stars' offense
had dimmed and that the power play had been firing nothing but
blanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much bull said,'' teammate Brian Skrudland
said. ``I know Eddie says he doesn't read the papers. But some of
the things that are written about him are really uncalled for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we play for the whole team. But for Eddie's sake,
I'd like to see us continue on and get this big prize, so he can
put this stuff, once and for all, behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is spreading throughout the Stars' locker room.
And Belfour, ever quiet and inscrutable, keeps giving his teammates
reason to think so.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers alone don't do Belfour's night justice. Matched
against the well-credentialed Patrick Roy, Belfour turned back 34
shots and snuffed three power plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' defense, as per custom, did throw a spidery web in
front of him. But whether it was a game-opening siege by the
Avalanche, whether it was Theo Fleury trying to stick in a rebound
high, whether it was Sandis Ozolinsh with a backhander from the
slot, or whether it was Peter Forsberg flying in short-handed,
Belfour never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome,'' Colorado defenseman Aaron Miller said. ``We
could've easily had three or four goals, but he wouldn't let us.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury that Modano spoke about has been a kangaroo court. In
these playoffs, Belfour has displayed nerves of steel and a heart
of steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in that zone that people talk about,'' teammate Craig
Ludwig said. ``Our defense tonight? You can describe it in one word
_ Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he signed with the Stars as a free agent last year _ a
three-year deal worth $10 million _ Belfour carried the cross of
eight years of playoff frustrations in Chicago. His resume lacks
the silvery (or gold, in some cases) finish of a Roy, a Dominick
Hasek and a Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Of those four goaltenders, all having carried their teams to the
NHL conference finals, Belfour likely would rank fourth in most
straw polls. But there we go, convening juries again.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the four _ Roy, Hasek, Cujo or Belfour _ has been
better in this last month?
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Eddie. Clearly, we know which goalie has outplayed the
other in this Stars-Avs series.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour does not surrender much personal information in
interviews. Purportedly, he doesn't read the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that might be something that's driving Eddie right now,''
Ludwig suggested. ``He reads the papers. He knows what's been said.
And he's basically right now telling all you guys to stick it
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had those questions about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury can rest.
</P>
<P>
   With Belfour stealing the show, the Stars are poised to take a
giant leap in these Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   That's not crazy. That's the Stars' playoff MVP.

ASU  COACH LIKES VIEW FROM DUGOUT  
 1ST SERIES BERTH IN 10-YEAR STINT 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ When the Women's College World Series begins
today, David and Blanche Wells will be camped in their familiar
seats (Section D, last row) at Don Porter Hall of Fame Stadium, but
not sitting with one of their usual party.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Linda, for the first time in the 18-year NCAA
softball history, will be in the dugout as Arizona State returns to
nationals for the first time since 1987 and first time of the
10-year Wells era. The Sun Devils open against Washington at 4 p.m.
(Arizona time).
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll know my mom: We look exactly alike,'' said Wells,
ecstatic that she can share this experience with three generations
of family. Her 88-year-old grandmother, Clara Shepard, and her aunt
Edna, 85, are here, as is her sister, Jodi Suerig, and 7-year-old
niece, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crosses your mind that maybe you're not ever going to get a
(CWS) team that your grandmother can see,'' said Wells, who turns
50 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Or that her parents, in their early 70s, can cheer just as
they've been cheering for Linda since she first picked up a bat at
age 6.
</P>
<P>
   A three-sport athlete in high school, before it was cool for
girls to do even one, Wells expanded to five sports while a
collegian at Southeast Missouri. Then she coached three
(basketball, volleyball, softball) in 18 years at the University of
Minnesota before replacing Mary Littlewood at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA began administering softball in 1982, when Littlewood
had a fourth-place finisher. The Sun Devils were two-and-out at the
'87 CWS and only now are returning, in part due to the wave that
has swept the University of Arizona to five national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would take 10 years at all,'' Wells said.
``I thought ASU, how simple will that be to recruit. I've been
recruiting and playing in the top 25 at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I find out it isn't easy because of not being able to
attract the Arizona kids and there being so many schools in
southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the last time ASU won a game over UA, the programs were
reasonably even. The Devils, in fact, were second in the Pac-10,
four games ahead of the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   But that postseason, when pitcher Susie Parra of Scottsdale was
a freshman, UA swept ASU in a regional and never looked back. The
Wildcats won the school's first women's championship in any sport
and now are within two of UCLA for the most softball crowns.
</P>
<P>
   ASU, even in this breakthrough season, is 0-4 against Arizona,
extending that losing streak to 36. It was last in the eight-team
Pac-10 but emerged as one of a record five CWS qualifiers from the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake I made was spending a lot of time recruiting kids
I wasn't going to get from the get-go,'' Wells said. ``Then by the
time you've crossed off three or four, you're getting pretty slim
and we're signing people in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had years when I'm just flat taking a body, and I know I'm
not taking anybody that I can compete with. I'm filling the
roster.''
</P>
<P>
   That began to change with the signing of Alyssa Johnson of Tempe
in 1993 and Lisa Dacquisto from southern California a year later.
But until ASU could land a blue-chip pitcher, the job remained
undone.
</P>
<P>
   Wells still recalls assistant coach and recruiting coordinator
Ann Pedersen returning from a 16-under national tournament in
Chattanooga, Tenn., after first seeing Kirsten Voak.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so excited to tell me about that young kid and she was
adamant, we're going to get her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it takes, early identification. There's only so
much you can do with them until they're juniors, but by then it's
important you get a relationship established and you do everything
you can do within the rules to make the difference. I think that
was the difference for Voak.''
</P>
<P>
   Voak, as a freshman, already has equaled the ASU single-season
record for victories (24) and set the mark for strikeouts (307).
</P>
<P>
   , Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ASU breaks ground June 15 on its new softball stadium, perhaps
the final piece in competing on even ground with UA, which is
212-14 at home since moving into $1 million Hillenbrand Stadium in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached long enough, I've been on the pendulum, and this
pendulum has given me a big down ride,'' said Wells. ``Now I feel
very optimistic that it's swinging up.''  &QL;

EDITORIAL: A PYRRHIC VICTORY FOR ALBANY
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Republican county legislator named Thomas Morahan
defeated a Democratic county legislator named Kenneth Zebrowski for
an open seat in the New York State Senate. As a result, the
Republican majority's control of the Senate will rise from 35-25 to
36-25. For this, the Legislature killed a tax worth $360 million to
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a legislative body with a notoriously warped
decision-making process, the saga of the Rockland County Senate
seat represents a new low. In an attempt to score points for their
candidate in a close contest, the Republicans who control the State
Senate announced earlier this month that they were going to pass a
bill repealing the New York City commuter tax, which imposes a
modest levy on people who work in the city but live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, including New York City's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, expected the Assembly Democrats to protect the city's
interest and allow the repeal bill to expire in limbo. But Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver stunned everyone by announcing that he
intended to help the Democratic cause in Rockland County by passing
the bill. Many of his New York City members supported the idea,
delighted at the chance to upset Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Now the game-playing is over. Control of the State Senate is
unchanged. Commuters, who are already the beneficiaries of a huge
state property-tax reduction program, will get a small boost in
their take-home pay. The courts will almost surely give the same
boon to Connecticut and New Jersey commuters. Unfortunately, when
the economy turns down, the city will have several hundred million
dollars less revenue each year for services, either for poor
neighborhoods represented by many Democrats who supported repealing
the tax, or for the Manhattan business districts where so many
commuters work. When New York City becomes an unpleasant place to
do business, the economic engine that drives the region begins to
falter.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani will probably be long gone from City Hall when that
happens. But when the legislators' constituents start complaining
about lost services, more dangerous streets and threats of
corporate departures for southern climes, perhaps they can console
themselves with the memory of how angry he looked when they socked
it to him on the commuter tax.

SHUFFLING THE DECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The disappointing Dodgers needed a fall guy, and
with the starting pitchers performing poorly, the choice was made.
</P>
<P>
   Saying they were displeased with how the pitchers and catchers
were prepared for games, the Dodgers fired pitching coach Charlie
Hough on Wednesday. Hough was replaced by Triple-A pitching coach
Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, manager Davey Johnson reversed the roles of
Glenn Hoffman and Rick Dempsey. Hoffman will coach third and
Dempsey becomes the bullpen coach.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear the motivation for the moves was to spark the
Dodgers, who were 22-22 going into Wednesday's game and 3{ games
out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't blame Charlie. I blamed everyone in the room,'' said
Johnson, whose eyes watered when he talked about the firing of his
friend. ``I wanted everyone in that room to know what a loss it was
to me. I wasn't just blaming the pitchers, but also my coaches and
me, individually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were touted as having one of the best starting
rotations in baseball, but Chan Ho Park, Carlos Perez and Darren
Dreifort haven't lived up to expectations. Kevin Brown is pitching
spectacularly and Ismael Valdes has been solid, but they couldn't
save Hough's job.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers starters were a combined 19-16 with a 4.19 ERA,
which ranked second and fourth, respectively, in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame that a guy as good as Charlie is, as a
person and a coach, that it comes to this _ that he has to be on
the short end of the stick because we played so poorly,'' Brown
said. ``It's not a situation where Charlie Hough failed us. It's a
situation where we failed Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing. It really is, to play that bad to get a guy
like that fired. I have the utmost respect for Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and general manager Kevin Malone said the relationship
between the pitchers and catchers was substandard, which was a
major factor in the decision. Johnson pointed to poor pitch
selection and poor location as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitcher-and-catcher relationship has to be on the same
page,'' Johnson said. ``That's got to be tightened up. That's
paramount. That's on any club. Obviously, the (pitcher) has (the
ball) in his hand, but the relationship has to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several pitchers and catcher Todd Hundley said Hough wasn't to
blame for the Dodgers' pitching problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie kept the players well-informed,'' Hundley said,
echoing the words of several pitchers. ``When coaches get fired, or
a manager gets fired, it's the players' fault. I think it's
something to shake up the club. We're going to make moves if the
job doesn't get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have other problems beside pitching. Like batting
average (.266), hitting with runners in scoring position (.243),
defense (40 errors leading to 26 unearned runs) and the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to go,'' Hough said. ``The only thing that upsets
me is I had to come here (to Cincinnati). I didn't get fired
because of (Tuesday) night's game. I'm going to play golf and watch
the season unfold. They'll be fine here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll go get (Greg) Maddux straightened out. (Tom)
Glavine, too. They're behind us in pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Hough was asked if he had been given a fair chance, to which he
responded ``No.'' Malone said it was enough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as an organization, as a pitching staff, weren't moving in
a direction we wanted to go,'' Malone said. ``Should you wait just
for the sake of waiting? We felt we could make this move and get
the pitching back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about being 22-22. It's about the direction we're
going. It's like Davey pointed out, we're regressing. We're trying
to move forward and get better. Should we wait until we're 65-65?
When you identify something needs to be fixed, you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a Johnson-managed team has changed pitching
coaches in midseason. Johnson said discussions of Hough's role
began ``a few weeks ago.'' He told Hough of the move after the
Dodgers' 3-2 loss to Cincinnati on Tuesday night at the team's
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers said Hough was offered a reassignment within the
organization, but Hough said he heard of no such offer. The
51-year-old Hough said he wouldn't accept a reassignment if one
were offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing the way we're playing with the talent we
have, it's the rule of thumb,'' Dodgers reliever Alan Mills said of
the move. ``I'm sure if we continue playing the way we are playing,
more changes will certainly be made.''

EDITORIAL: PRIVACY AND RIDE-ALONGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court followed understandable legal reasoning this
week when it barred the police from allowing reporters and camera
crews to follow officers into private homes that are being raided.
The unanimous decision, which cited ``the right of residential
privacy'' as a core principle of the Fourth Amendment, will mean
fewer television shots of drug busts. Even so, it is very important
that the police see the court's action for what it is, a narrow
reinforcement of traditional residential privacy rights, and not
use it to deter serious newsgathering and journalistic
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In any ruling of this sort, the danger is that secretive
officials will use it to chill reporting they dislike. That is
among the reasons The New York Times joined other news
organizations in arguing that such ride-alongs should not be
constitutionally forbidden in all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in question arose in 1992, when a joint federal and
local law-enforcement task force, seeking publicity for its
operations, invited The Washington Post to send a reporter and
photographer to accompany agents on an early-morning search for a
fugitive in a Maryland couple's home. The photographer took
pictures of the couple wearing skimpy nightclothes, which The Post
never published.
</P>
<P>
   The court's disgust with the raid was clear. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor called the raid ``an amazing invasion,'' foreshadowing the
court's ruling that inviting the media into a home without the
consent of the residents had turned a lawful search into an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the possibility of good public relations for the police
is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-along
intrusion into a private home,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist
wrote for the unanimous court. By an 8-to-1 vote, however, the
court declined to impose personal liability on the officers
involved because it was not clear at the time that their actions
were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A second case involving federal wildlife agents who took a CNN
camera crew on a search of a Montana ranch in 1993 was sent back to
a lower appellate court for review in light of the new ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The court's interest in privacy is healthy. But its decision
could have perverse consequences if police departments misread its
narrow holding as a broad license to fence off large areas of
police activity from journalistic observation and reporting. In
future cases the court should make clear that its ruling applies
only to residences, not to surrounding grounds or public areas.

FOYT'S POISE BOOSTS BOAT'S CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There are no bruises on his chin, no broken jaw
bones, no black eyes, no fat lip, no ear in need of stitching and
not a single chipped tooth.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to wear a body cast, doesn't need a cane to
stroll through Gasoline Alley and not once has he felt the need to
leaf through the checkbook to make sure the life-insurance policy
was paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, a thankful Billy Boat not only survived three hard
crashes in the days leading up to Indianapolis 500 qualifying last
Saturday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, he also survived A.J.
Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   We know about Foyt, don't we?
</P>
<P>
   Remember two years ago, when he tried to box Arie Luyendyk's
ears during a victory lane ceremony at Texas Motor Speedway,
tearing into Luyendyk the way a hungry wolf might tear into a rump
roast?
</P>
<P>
   Or the time an incensed Foyt smashed a laptop computer to
smithereens during a frantic pit stop at Indy?
</P>
<P>
   Better some geek's computer toy than someone's fleshy neck,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' Boat said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boat helped make amends by later qualifying for an
outside front-row starting position in Sunday's Indy 500, he
remains somewhat surprised he wasn't forced to steer with one arm
in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, when (Indy Racing League Director of
Medical Services Dr. Henry Bock) was about to release me from the
infield hospital after the third crash (on a warm-up lap during his
first qualifying attempt), I told him I hoped I wouldn't be back in
10 minutes after I was done talking to A.J.,'' said Boat, who lives
in Glendale. ``But A.J. never once ranted and raved or raised his
voice at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time he ever came close to doing that is when I was
yelling at myself after the third crash. He said, `Don't worry
about it. We'll just put (the car) back together and go back out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gives you the confidence to go out and qualify for
the front row. He's always there for you. After what I'd been
through, he still made me feel confident that I could go out and
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   When Scott Sharp drove for Foyt during the 1996-97 seasons, he
also recalls an understanding Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, A.J.'s pretty cool about things like that,'' Sharp
said. ``He's been there before, and he's really pretty patient. He
knows when you try and get everything out of the car, it can get
away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt a softy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him (expletive) like that happens,'' Foyt said
Wednesday, standing a few feet away from where a smiling Boat was
busily signing autographs. ``I drove these race cars, and I made
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense jumping all over Billy and raising hell. The
worst thing you can do is bring his morale down. If you want
someone to push the button, you have to expect stuff to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuff happened all right.
</P>
<P>
   Three crashes translates into a lot of dollars, dollars that
could have been used to buy spare parts, not new parts to replace
broken parts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it counted most, Boat delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, however, admits his confidence was shaken after
back-to-back accidents during the first two days of practice last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really tough week,'' Boat said. ``The roller coaster
of emotion was unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tested here, we could run 222 (mph) to 224 (mph)
fairly easily, and I think that's what got me in trouble. We tried
something new, and I probably pushed the car a little too soon.
Then, after that first crash, we were behind and trying to play
catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we had the incident the following day and we got further
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the week went smoothly, and Boat began to
believe his string of bad luck was over.
</P>
<P>
   Then, whammo, a third crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to push the car as hard as I could to make sure I
had my tires hot when I took the green flag,'' Boat said. ``And I
pushed it too quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really dejected. It's not the lowest I've ever felt, but
I think it's the most I've ever been disappointed in myself. I
shouldn't have let (that accident) happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have to thank A.J. and the crew for picking me up.
After the week I had, I probably felt better being on the outside
front row than I did last year sitting on the pole. Last year, we
had a fairly flawless week leading up to qualifying. This year, we
struggled. So I feel like we made more of an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   With only today's Carburetion Day practice separating drivers
and the race, Boat already is feeling as chipper as he has the past
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my confidence is back to the level it needs to be,''
Boat said. ``The race is a totally different mind-set than
qualifying. It's 500 miles long, and you have to be very patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure you're there at the end of race, so
you're not quite on the edge like you are doing qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can sit back and just concentrate on the race, and let
me tell you, that's a big relief.'' &QL;

COYOTES WILL INTERVIEW TORTORELLA FOR COACH'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said he intends to give
assistant coach John Tortorella a formal interview next week for
the team's vacant head coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   The interview likely will take place Tuesday after Smith returns
from Toronto, where he will spend the rest of this week on
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with John on the phone today, and I told him we'll
meet early next week,'' Smith said Wednesday, a day after
Tortorella publicly expressed an avid desire to replace the fired
Jim Schoenfeld behind the Phoenix bench next season.
</P>
<P>
   Tortorella, 41, an assistant with the Coyotes the past two
seasons, has emerged as the leading candidate for the job since
Schoenfeld's firing Monday. Others who have expressed interest in
the job thus far include former NHL coaches Mike Keenan and,
possibly, Ted Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan is also up for consideration for the vacant head coaching
job with the Los Angeles Kings, who also have interviewed
minor-league coach John Vanboxmeer and are expected to interview
Detroit Red Wings associate coach Dave Lewis, a former Kings
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Another Red Wings assistant, Barry Smith, is a possible
candidate for the Coyotes. Bobby Smith interviewed him for the job
two seasons ago before hiring Schoenfeld. Bobby Smith has not yet
contacted the Red Wings for permission to speak with Barry Smith
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't, but I could see a small chance that he might,'' a
Red Wings official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential candidate is former NHL great Bryan Trottier,
now an assistant with the Colorado Avalanche. Trottier, who played
18 seasons in the league 15 with the New York Islanders has been on
six Stanley Cup championship teams and won the Art Ross and Hart
Memorial Trophy in 1978-79 as the NHL's leading scorer and Most
Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   He previously worked as an assistant for the Pittsburgh Penguins
and spent the 1997-98 season as coach and director of hockey
operations for the Portland Pirates, the American Hockey League
affiliate of the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Trottier also is among the candidates being considered by the
expansion Atlanta Thrashers. &QL;

CASEY PLAYS NUMBERS GAME  
 ASU GOLFER WONDERS,`WHY NOT 58?' 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-CASEY-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mad dog or Englishman? The answer is a bit of both, Arizona
State golfing sensation Paul Casey says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the golf course, I'm probably a mad dog,'' said Casey, who
grew up in Weybridge, near London. ``Off the course, I'm probably
the Englishman.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Casey growl?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the worst loser ever,'' he conceded. ``They say the
English are good losers, but I've never said that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prim and proper world of golf, Casey is fresh stuff. And
despite a lack of rigorous training, he plays golf on a level that
few of his peers ever realize.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case last month when the 21-year-old sophomore
posted the all-time low round in college golf. His 10-under 60 in
the final round of the Pac-10 Championship not only eclipsed Tiger
Woods' 61 at the same tournament in 1996, but it broke another
significant record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you shouldn't break records like that,'' said Casey,
referring to Byron Nelson's course-record 62 during the 1945
Seattle Open at the Broadmoor Club, the same layout Casey humbled
during the Pac-10s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a great player, and that 62 came a month after
he'd won 11 straight tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverence lasts only a few seconds before he jumps to the
possibility of other low scores in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I thought about the 59 (when he shot 60),'' he said of
golf's most coveted score. ``But why not 58? How come nobody has
ever shot a 58? I'm sure that Hazeltine is not going to give that
up. But then again, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   His reference to Hazeltine National Golf Course near Minneapolis
comes with the knowledge that he and his fifth-ranked ASU teammates
will attempt to win the NCAA Championship there next Wednesday
through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course reminds me of golf back home,'' Casey said of the
trees and rolling hills. ``I'm not a big fan of desert golf.''
</P>
<P>
   That Casey ended up among the cactus and sagebrush is part
coincidence and part choice. He heard about the ASU program in
1996, just after the team captured the NCAA title. His interest was
piqued by Ron Commans, a former player for Sun Devils Coach Randy
Lein. Commans was a teaching pro at Casey's home course in England,
Wisley Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul wrote me a letter looking for information, and I gave him
Ron's name,'' said Lein, who coached Commans at Southern
California, where Commans won the 1981 NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who was an 18-year-old bartender at Wisley, made a big
impression on Commans, now an instructor at the Karsten Course at
ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron wrote me back and said that Paul could start for any team
in the country,'' Lein said.
</P>
<P>
   A recruiting visit, and a wild football game between ASU and
Nebraska, convinced Casey that Tempe was the place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first football game, and it turned out to be a
complete riot, a 19-0 shutout (by ASU), where they ended up tearing
down the goal posts,'' he said. ``. . . I left convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took Casey nearly a year before he convinced Lein that he
could be a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul played OK the fall of '97, then he broke through that
spring, winning the USC tournament,'' Lein recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Casey added the '97 Pac-10 and NCAA West Regional titles, then
collapsed at the national championship. His game stayed in a rut
last fall, when he was dogged by a case of flu.
</P>
<P>
   But after Jeff Quinney, his chief rival among the Sun Devils,
exploded for a 62 at the Thunderbird/SAVANE Invitational in April,
Casey seemed to re-ignite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has an ego, and Jeff has made Paul a better player, just
like Paul has made Jeff a better player,'' Lein said.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to get Casey going. He is a free spirit,
something that shows in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I'm majoring in sociology,'' Casey
admitted. ``I started out in business, then went to broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Casey earned a 3.8 grade-point average this past
semester, Lein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's the first time I ever tried,'' Casey conceded.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit is also displayed by ``misspent time in a hotel
room'' that led to his trick-shot abilities. And the kidding he
takes from his teammates for dating the assistant coach of the ASU
women's team, Ashley Adleta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't winning, they'd give it to me even more,'' Casey
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he is, going 28 under in his past four tournaments and
lowering his scoring average to 69.23.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I was good, not great,'' Casey said. ``But I
played against some pretty good competition, like Justin Rose, the
guy that got all the attention after (the 1998) British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not great, but I'm playing the best I've ever
played.''
</P>
<P>
   So are his ASU teammates, who have captured three of their last
four tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the best team in the country,'' Casey said. ``Last
week in Tucson (at the NCAA West Regional), we won without our best
stuff. That's inspiring because, hopefully, our best is yet to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who finished eighth at the regional, has a little
something extra working for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are going to see me play for the first time in the
States,'' he said. ``It will be nice because my mum hasn't seen me
play in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the mad dog will give way to the Englishman with his
mother in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, not Paul Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in the chase, I'm clueless,'' said Casey, whose
nickname is Spaceman. ``It's the mad dog thing.''

STARS OF FIRST MAGNITUDE TURN OUT FOR RUSSELL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How's this for a team?
</P>
<P>
   Centers: Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton,
Dave Cowens, Willis Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards: Bob Pettit, Julius Erving, Rick Barry, Jerry Lucas,
Dolph Schayes.
</P>
<P>
   Guards: Oscar Robertson, Tiny Archibald, Hal Greer, Dave Bing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the Hall of Fame,'' decided Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, him, too.
</P>
<P>
   When you're Bill Russell, the heaviest of the heavy hitters show
up for your time. And then you get videos from the likes of Michael
Jordan, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Bill Bradley, Lenny Wilkens,
Magic Johnson, Kevin McHale, and a major politician who lives in
Washington, D.C., and who described himself as ``a fellow
lefthander.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aretha Franklin said it best,'' explained Dick Ebersol, a TV
fellow of note. ``It's r-e-s-p-e-c-t.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. Guess who sang the national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   This is without even mentioning the other Celtic alumni. You
know, the Cousys, Heinsohns, Havliceks, Ramseys, Embrys,
Loscutoffs, Sanderses, Whites, Sharmans, Risens, and Joneses (both
Sam and K.C.). This is what Bill Russell deserved, and this is what
Bill Russell got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know how to play if it weren't for him,'' declared
Abdul-Jabbar, whose adolescent tutorials came both at the old
Madison Square Garden and at Power Memorial High School. ``NBA
teams used to practice at our gym, and from 1960 through 1965 I
must have gone to every doubleheader. The Celtics played in many
opening games. I would have to say I saw them play 25 times and the
man I studied was Bill Russell. I learned so much. The next day my
coach would say, `How many of those guys scored 20 points?' and the
answer would be `none.' But everybody would have had something to
do with it, most of all Bill Russell. Watching him I learned the
dynamics of the game, and how to win. Being a Knick fan in those
days was agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles away, a tall, skinny redhead was studying
his Russellology in La Mesda, Calif. ``Most players play in spite
of their teammates,'' said Walton. ``Russell's sole purpose was to
make the rest of them the stars, and in so doing win the game. He
was my favorite player of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that the charity that is currently near and dear
to Bill Russell's heart is the National Mentoring Partnership.
Russell operated on both sides of that relationship, and in each
case the party of the second part was here to pay his respects.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Bill Russell was not a finished product when
he entered the league in December 1956. He was talented beyond
measure, but he didn't know the NBA. That is where Arnie Risen came
in. Arnie was then in the penultimate year of what would turn out
to be a Hall of Fame career, and it didn't take long for him to
learn that his primary function on the team would be shifted from
being its starting center to the professor for this new kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel flattered when I hear Bill Russell say I was his
mentor,'' said Risen. ``I'm not sure that isn't just an old friend
boosting a teammate. If I did anything for him, it was tell him
what to expect from the other players in the league, and to help
him with our offense. But I never thought of it as mentoring. In
those days we all helped each other. It was the natural thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Bill Russell was at the zenith of his career,
seven titles and four Most Valuable Player awards in hand. The new
backup center was a kid out of Providence by the name of John
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me,'' said Thompson. ``Very much so. I just felt so
safe with him. On and off the floor. When I was in his presence I
knew I had nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that no other great player gets talked
about in those terms. There was something very different and very
special about Bill Russell, as speaker after speaker made clear at
the well-attended (12,000-plus) and well-run (how can you go wrong
when you've got Bill Cosby at the throttle?) and long overdue
tribute to Bill Russell at the FleetCenter Wednesday night. It was
such a blissful evening a case can be made that if you've got to
wait 30 years in order to get it right, then maybe that's what you
should do.
</P>
<P>
   The point of it all was to do the right thing by the greatest
team sport athlete in American history, and the point within the
point was to see his No. 6 properly raised. It's been up there
since 12:55 p.m. EST March 12, 1972, when the Celtics ambushed
Russell by hoisting the number when he was in town on a broadcast
assignment for a Sunday afternoon ABC telecast of a Celtics-Knicks
game. A very grudging Russell would only allow the number to go up
if no fans were present, and so the big 6 was raised with only Red
Auerbach, Celtics players, local writers, Garden personnel, and ABC
techs watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red knows how I feel about this,'' Russell said. ``I'm not
that type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and this was now, and thus at 10:07 p.m. EDT
on May 26, 1999, the number was re-raised, this time before an
appreciative crowd that numbered a roster of NBA luminaries whose
combined 1999 market value would be in the billions, with a capital
B. And Bill Russell looked pleased.
</P>
<P>
   He talked team, as he always did and always will. ``Red's theory
was that there were 10 players, two referees, 13,000 people, and
one basketball,'' Russell explained, ``and we decided what to do
with the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   This was one time Bill Russell was not in control of anything.
The time had come for him to be properly honored, and that was
that. There were all those people in that building, and they were
the ones who made sure Bill Russell went to bed Wednesday night
aware that everything he has done for his team, the game, and his
country was completely appreciated.

DODGERS SPRING HOME STILL UP FOR GRABS  
 VERO BEACH, FORT MCDOWELL IN CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tug-of-war between Arizona and Florida with the Los Angeles
Dodgers as the prize is about to enter its final phase.
</P>
<P>
   It's a contest between Indian River County in Florida and an
Arizona tribe that hopes to build the first spring training complex
on a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Face-to-face negotiations are under way between the Dodgers and
Vero Beach area officials over terms of a deal that would keep the
team training in its spring home of 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials in Vero Beach expect a final offer will be put
together in about 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, meanwhile, the Fort McDowell Yavapai-Apache Indian
Tribe continues to quietly work behind the scenes on its plans for
a spring training complex for the Dodgers on the reservation east
of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   But the once-grand vision of a mega-complex featuring housing,
recreation, practice fields and a 12,500-seat stadium likely will
be scaled back significantly if the tribe decides to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of this time they're still working on the pros and cons,''
said Chris Baier, sports development director for the Arizona
Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Baier said talks with other teams such as Toronto, Texas and
Kansas City _ one of which could join the Cactus League with Los
Angeles and share the Arizona facility with the Dodgers _ are on
hold while efforts focus on LA.
</P>
<P>
   While the Tribal Council continues to weigh the merits of luring
the Dodgers and whether it would make long-term economic sense to
its community, an emerging public debate in Vero Beach over
financial issues could give Fort McDowell an opening and a chance
to pre-empt the Vero Beach talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has little to offer Fort McDowell now in the way of
financial aid because the car-rental tax that pays for improvements
to Cactus League facilities likely won't have any money available
until 2017. The available funds are locked into paying for the more
than $160 million in improvements to Cactus League facilities this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   A possible change in the car rental tax from a flat $2.50 in
Maricopa County and $3.50 in Pima County to a percentage of the
rental contract has been floated but would have to be approved by
the Legislature and county boards, and that couldn't happen until
next year.
</P>
<P>
   With such a change, though, Cactus League funds would increase
significantly and the Fort McDowell tribe could envision a payback
on some of its investment in a much earlier time frame than first
thought.
</P>
<P>
   In Vero Beach, the debate over a public buyout of Dodgertown
could add a nasty overtone to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One Vero Beach businessman on Tuesday demanded the county
commission hold a referendum on the issue. The commission said it
would consider holding a non-binding referendum. Newspaper letters
to the editor question the merits of the plan and helping Rupert
Murdoch and his Fox Group, owner of team; others say the town would
be foolish to let the team go.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers, who likely won't have to pay a cent in either
place, stand to win either way but may not get everything they
want.
</P>
<P>
   The Vero Beach proposal centers on a $20 million deal with $7.5
million recently appropriated by the state Legislature with Gov.
Jeb Bush's support, and the rest to come from an increase in the
county tourism bed tax and extension of a local half-cent sales tax
increase that was approved years ago for a bond issue that is
almost paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The county and city would use some of the money to purchase
Dodgertown from the Dodgers and then lease it back to them, and the
rest of the money for improvements to the aged facilities and
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to work and the people are going to be
satisfied with it,'' said Milt Thomas, Vero Beach Chamber of
Commerce economic development director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there's a lot of misinformation. They're
raising the mantra of Rupert Murdoch and lining his pockets.
There's a lot of knee-jerking,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   One non-negotiable point in Vero Beach is that the Dodgers do
not want to own the facility any longer. They are the only major
league team that owns and operates its spring training facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want vast improvements to Dodgertown, including
construction of a cloverleaf four-field practice facility on what
is now a nine-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Their appraisal of the facilities and land including the golf
course was $14 million. The Vero Beach appraisal was about $8
million and didn't include the golf course land. If Vero Beach had
to pay $14 million to buy Dodgertown from the team, it would have
only $6 million left for improvements, far short of what the
Dodgers envision.
</P>
<P>
   And while Fort McDowell, if it decides to move forward with a
proposal, may not have all the bells and whistles it once hoped to
offer, it would seem to be in a good position to best Vero Beach
even without housing and recreation amenities such as golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pessimistic, but I've been encouraged in my brief
discussions with the Dodgers recently,'' Baier said. ``They clearly
haven't made up their minds. And they are not using Arizona for
leverage. They want us to continue to work at this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort McDowell is working hard on this. We want to see what we
can do to help, but there are limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sculley, executive director of the Maricopa County
Sports Commission, said the commission is not assisting on the
project because the tribe is not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials would say only that work continues on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is coming when our plans need to be on the table,''
Baier said.

RUSSELL ENJOYS LAST LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
 TRIBUTE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thirty years and three weeks to the day after Bill
Russell played his last game for the Celtics, a game that fittingly
ended in a world championship, the town, the team, the fans, and a
glittering list of celebrities and players paid homage to the man
and his career.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly three-hour ceremony that featured lighthearted
moments and moving tributes, the 65-year-old Russell, an intensely
private man who called the whole affair ``totally and completely
embarrassing,'' had his uniform No. 6 re-retired in a very public
ceremony Wednesday night at the FleetCenter. The number originally
was retired March 12, 1972, in a private ceremony, which was
Russell's wish at the time.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was anything but private. Organizers of the event,
a benefit for the National Mentoring Partnership, expected a crowd
of about 10,000. The event was held on the 30th anniversary of
Russell's last season and last title, won May 5, 1969, in Los
Angeles against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates from his Celtics days were there, ranging from Bob
Cousy to John Havlicek to Bill Sharman to Sam Jones to Arnie Risen.
Celtics players who followed him and won titles, Larry Bird and
Dave Cowens, were there. Wilt Chamberlain decided at the last
moment to be a part of the night and took a red-eye flight from Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby and Bryant Gumbel were the masters of ceremonies.
Johnny Mathis and Aretha Franklin sang. President Clinton, would-be
president Bill Bradley, and Michael Jordan were among several who
offered taped tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's former coach and Celtics icon Red Auerbach helped him
raise the banner to the rafters to the music of ``Summon the
Heroes.'' Russell then spoke for about 20 minutes, telling stories
of his parents, thanking the fans, and saying, simply, ``The life I
led was the life I thought I should lead.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Russell again said it was overwhelming to be
the subject of so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think of myself as Charlie Russell's kid,'' he said.
``This kind of stuff is foreign to me. I really don't understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ceremony was ``fantastic, almost like another
(championship) banner up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The stands were half-full, much like they were when Russell was
leading the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years. Sixty-five tables
were scattered on the floor, each with a basketball centerpiece,
green and white napkins, and a chocolate dessert with a white
shamrock and green No. 6 on top. (Most went uneaten, except at the
Globe table.)
</P>
<P>
   Much like Russell's career, the evening got off to a late start
and lasted a little longer than expected. (Russell did not join the
Celtics as a rookie until December due to an Olympic commitment.)
The highlight for the fans was the joint appearance of Bird (also a
late addition), Bill Walton, Cowens, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
offer their thoughts on Russell and winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Bill Walton doing up here?'' Bird cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Walton went on to explain how Russell was his hero and role
model, then took a shot at some conservative blacks, mentioning
Clarence Thomas and J.C. Watts. ``Somehow,'' said Walton, ``things
got turned around.'' But, he also said, ``no one in the history of
sports did a better job of making people's life better than Bill
Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird noted that Russell set the bar so high ``that if you put on
a Celtic uniform and didn't win a championship, you have no game.''
Bird also took a shot at Jordan, who, in his video tribute, noted
Russell had won all his titles in an eight-team league. NBA
commissioner David Stern also took note of Jordan's remark, adding
that all the good players in the league in Russell's time were on
eight teams.
</P>
<P>
   When Russell made his first appearance on stage, the crowd gave
him a five-minute standing ovation, which brought him to tears. He
took a seat on the stage, looking almost as if he would rather be
anywhere else, comforted by a couple of Cosby wisecracks.
Eventually the crowd quieted to hear Auerbach present his franchise
center with a piece of the parquet floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby noted how Russell started as a champion, ended as a
champion, and won most of the time in between. He then admitted he
had trouble with all the adulation ``because I'm from
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell also was praised on tape by Clinton, Bradley, Jordan,
Kevin McHale, Magic Johnson (who was thought to be coming), Jerry
West, Elgin Baylor, and Lenny Wilkens. Tom Brokaw, Jim Brown,
George Plimpton, and writer Frank Deford offered tributes.
Russell's daughter, Karen, broke into tears when she referred to
her father as ``the greatest daddy in the whole wide world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino presented Russell with a Paul Revere
bowl, which apparently was misinscribed. (Russell's middle name is
Felton. The bowl had the name spelled Fenton.) Celtics
coach/president Rick Pitino _ who got some boos _ presented Russell
with a small replica of the banner with Russell's number on it. He
said the highlight of this past season _ and admitted there weren't
many _ was the night when Russell addressed the team.
</P>
<P>
   Six teammates from Russell's first title team, 1956-57, were in
attendance. Cousy, on behalf of the squad, presented Russell with a
watch. ``You should have had this years ago because you were late
to every practice Arnold (Auerbach) ever called,'' Cousy said.
</P>
<P>
   Four teammates from the championship teams from the 1960s _
Havlicek, Tom ``Satch'' Sanders, K.C. Jones, and Sam Jones _
presented Russell with two wooden seats from old Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen opponents from Russell's years _ Jerry Lucas, Rick
Barry, Willis Reed, Bob Pettit, Oscar Robertson, and Dolph Schayes
_ offered their thoughts on playing against him. That, in turn, led
to the introduction of Chamberlain, who good-naturedly played the
role of villain.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby talked about the dinners Russell and Chamberlain would
have on Thanksgiving at Chamberlain's home in Philadelphia. The
Celtics and 76ers would play that night. ``He ate the dinner and
then he ate you,'' Cosby said to Chamberlain. Russell not only ate
at his house, but took a nap in his bedroom, too.
</P>
<P>
   The two then engaged in a toy game of pop-a-shot and Chamberlain
won, 1-0. ``I finally won a game in Boston,'' he cracked. Russell
earlier had said he was fortunate to have had Chamberlain as a
rival; it had made both players better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to improve,'' he said, ``and if I didn't improve, I'd be
embarrassed every night.''

TIME FOR SCOUTS TO EARN THEIR KEEP  
 ANNUAL AMATEUR DRAFT ON DECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They know which fast-food chain has the best french fries. They
know which rental cars get better mileage. They've hustled across
airports to make connecting flights so they can get to a game in
time, only to find that a high school coach has changed his
pitching schedule. They've even dodged tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all worth it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year that baseball scouts live for. They're
done scouring the country. Now it's a matter of going over reports,
making a few more telephone calls and perhaps getting one last look
at one or two prospects before Major League Baseball's annual
amateur draft, which will be held over a three-day period beginning
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 clubs will draft up to 50 players apiece, with about half
of those eventually putting their names on the dotted line.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will have the fourth overall pick, their
highest ever, and two compensatory picks (Nos. 31 and 71) for the
loss of center fielder Devon White to the Los Angeles Dodgers via
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   After the pick at No. 71 (second round), Arizona will not select
again until the sixth round because it signed three primary free
agents _ left-hander Randy Johnson, right-hander Todd Stottlemyre
and center fielder Steve Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks scouting director Don Mitchell conducted regional
scouting meetings in Atlanta on Friday, Dallas on Saturday and
Phoenix on Sunday. This week, Mitchell has been meeting with
assistant director Bob Miller, national coordinator Kendall Carter
and regional supervisors Howard McCullough (eastern), Mike Rizzo
(central) and Steve Springer (western).
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the team will hold an invitation-only workout for
two to three dozen players, similar to what it did before last
year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This draft appears to be very deep, pitching-wise,
particularly in college, and after the top couple of rounds, the
position players fall off a little bit,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   So because of that pitching depth, are the Diamondbacks more
likely to go for a position player higher, so they can get a
promising pitcher or two in the middle rounds?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a possibility,'' Mitchell said, not wanting to
reveal too much.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Diamondbacks have the fourth overall pick behind Tampa
Bay, Florida and Detroit, a lot of attention is being paid to that
spot.
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus among Diamondbacks staffers and most people
around baseball that a small handful of players could go in the top
five or six.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the top four players likely will be high schoolers _
outfielder-pitcher Josh Hamilton of Athens Drive High in Raleigh,
N.C., pitcher Josh Beckett of Spring (Texas) High, and catcher Ryan
Christianson of Arlington High in Riverside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Other high first-round possibilities are catcher Eric Munson
from the University of Southern California, pitcher Kyle Snyder of
the University of North Carolina and outfielder B.J. Garbe of Moses
Lake (Wash.) High. Garbe's teammate, outfielder Jason Cooper, also
could fit into the top 10 mix.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he has had direct contact with the families and/or
representatives of Hamilton, Beckett, Cooper, Garbe, Munson and
Christianson.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett, a right-hander, has been the subject of speculation as
the No. 1 overall pick for quite some time, but the left-handed
Hamilton, who likely will be an outfielder in the pros, may have
supplanted him. Munson is attractive because he is a left-handed
hitter with power. His defense needs work, as does that of
Christianson, ``but they know that. It's no real surprise,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianson is strong-bodied, with a plus-arm and plus-power.
He's aggressive and likes to get dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, Mitchell says, ``has a special approach to the game.
He comes from a great family. Our Texas-area scout, Ray Corbett,
has known Beckett since the ninth grade. The young man has a
tremendous breaking pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell calls Garbe ``a well-rounded player who can really
hit.'' Garbe also is a right-handed pitcher in addition to his
center field duties and has the versatility to where he could be
tried as a third baseman. Cooper, his teammate, hits for more power
and has similar long-ball potential to Arizona's top pick in 1997,
Jack Cust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those Washington kids are very bright. They've signed
college letters to Stanford, so that should tell you something,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also like University of Miami shortstop Bobby
Hill for his versatility and hustle but aren't likely to take him
at No. 4. It is doubtful he would be available at No. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Want a sleeper or two?
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on right-hander Matt Ginter of Mississippi State,
which is the alma mater of Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter, and
right-hander Ben Sheets of Northeast Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Signability also can figure into the thinking on draft day.
While the price tags for draftees has risen considerably over the
last few years, Mitchell said it is unlikely that most of this
year's crop will extend the negotiating process over a lengthy
period as their predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you draft and who you draft, there are no absolutes in
this thing. You do your homework as best you can,'' Diamondbacks
General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projecting of where these players will be in three or four
years is difficult, because many of them use aluminum bats, and you
have to take into consideration what might be inferior competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with what we've done in our first three drafts,
particularly the first one in 1996. But none of them have reached
the major leagues, and you can't truly assess everything until that
time comes.''

BELCHER'S BOUNTY GOES BUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ At long last, the Anaheim Angels are seeing
the Tim Belcher they thought they had signed to a two-year, $10.2
million contract last December.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher put together his third consecutive solid outing
Wednesday night, but there was something missing as Belcher came up
short in his bid for a third consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, it was the Angels offense that took the night off in a
3-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles before 22,058 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare showing _ or non-showing _ by the Angels hitters
in a game pitched by Belcher. The offense had averaged 5.9 runs per
game in Belcher's starts this season, including six games in which
they scored six or more runs.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Orioles starter Sidney Ponson (5-3) held the
Angels to four hits in eight innings, the Angels' two runs scoring
on solo home runs by Mo Vaughn (No. 10) and Garret Anderson (No.
11).
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes pitched a 1-2-3 ninth and earned his first save of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who gave up three runs and four hits in seven-plus
innings, had won his previous two starts before Wednesday, which
confirmed Angels manager Terry Collins' belief that Belcher's bad
starts early in the season were nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that would concern me would be his health,''
Collins said. ``Was his arm OK? Was there a drastic drop in
velocity from last year? There hasn't been. Command of his stuff
has to be there, and he's starting to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins also said he never sensed that Belcher got down on
himself during his slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `down' as much as if he had a bad game, he
couldn't wait to get back out there,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   When Belcher has been hit this season, he's been hit hard. Going
into Wednesday's game, opposing batters were hitting .348 against
him. His 11 home runs allowed were tied for third-worst in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the home run ball that hurt him early on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Baines homered with one out in the second inning for a
1-0 Orioles lead. It was Baines' 356th career homer, moving him
past Gary Gaetti into 50th place on the all-time list. Later in the
second, Charles Johnson's two-out single on a 1-2 pitch scored Will
Clark for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick homered to lead off the third inning for a 3-0
Baltimore lead, but Belcher settled down after that.
</P>
<P>
   After Bordick's homer, Belcher retired the next 15 Orioles
batters, taking him through the seventh inning. It took a couple of
outstanding defensive plays to keep the streak going.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning third baseman Troy Glaus dived to his left
to snag a smash by Albert Belle, then threw him out at first. In
the seventh, right fielder Todd Greene caught a long drive by
Delino DeShields while crashing into the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's streak ended when he walked Johnson to begin the
eighth, and that was enough for Collins to summon relief help from
the bullpen.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ROGER Goodell is one of NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
lieutenants and has been a behind-the-scenes backer of the
anything-goes movement to put pro football back in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Goodell was holding a scale model of the planned
rebuilt LA Coliseum and he dropped it on himself, opening a gash
that required 30 stitches to close and a calf-high walking cast.
</P>
<P>
   There is a message in there somewhere. Maybe that plague, famine
and pestilence will follow if the NFL ignores Houston's
flesh-and-bones proposal to chase a dream in La-La Land.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy to scare the league's ownership. We
could arrange to have a few horse heads turn up under their sheets
and be playing football in our own swanky new stadium by the fall
of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to keep reminding yourself that this is a weird
breed with which we are dealing. F. Scott Fitzgerald said the rich
are different from you and me, and the 31 owners of the NFL are
different from most of the rich _ stubborn, cliquish, bloodless. Al
Davis, Bud Adams, Bill Bidwill and the like. This is the strangest
collection of life forms outside of the bar scene in the original
Star Wars.
</P>
<P>
   So they ignore basic realities like a lack of public funding and
a shortfall of $225 million for 21st century parking garages in
Michael Ovitz's new whiz-bang renovation of the Coliseum and a
desperate attempt to get the NFL back into the nation's
second-largest TV market.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word out of the owners meetings in Atlanta that the
league has decided to back off and take another 30 days to review
this latest offering from Hollywood. There have been no official
announcements. But there are strong indications that commissioner
Tags and his cronies are talking about extending the Sept. 15
deadline for LA to get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is as much a revelation as learning that the
president plays fast and loose with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   However, after all these many months of waiting patiently, doing
all the right things and allowing himself to be used as the NFL's
foil in this rigged-from-the-start expansion game, Houston's Bob
McNair may have come to the end of the rope from which he has been
dangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to just fold our tent on Sept. 16,'' McNair
said. ``But do we continue to pursue the 32nd NFL franchise?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it becomes clear that their approach is delay, delay and
delay on the 32nd franchise, then I think it would be wise to turn
our attention then to an existing team that has problems in its
current city. That's not to say we're not talking to people right
now, because we are. I'd just say that if the NFL chooses to delay
past the Sept. 15 date, then we've got to look at turning 100
percent of our attention to getting an existing team rather than
about the 80 percent of the time we're spending now.''
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on how far the NFL wants to chase the LA fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand people saying, `Wow!' to the new LA plan,'' said
McNair's right hand, Steve Patterson. ``I mean, we could have put
glass with a frosted cocktail rim and salt around our stadium and
called it the Cuervo Dome. But we can pay for our deal. They don't
have the money, and they don't have approval from the Coliseum
Commission to do what they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're dealing with just two parties here _ us
and the NFL. Our deal in Houston is far more complicated. We've got
the concerns of the rodeo to take into account, the county's
deadlines and commitments, and the city has to decide what it wants
to do with a new downtown (basketball/hockey) arena. We just can't
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   And they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the NFL wants to be in Houston and eventually will be. But
whenever the NFL is ready and is through using Houston to leverage
every single dollar out of every other city that has not ponied up
for a new stadium and a sweetheart lease. If the league does extend
the Sept. 15 deadline _ formally or otherwise _ then this is the
signal for the bootlicking to stop and the hardball wheeling and
dealing to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is in play, having just had a stadium proposal voted
down. So are Buffalo, Minnesota and Oakland. And keep an eye on New
Orleans, where the closings of many corporate headquarters are
drying up a major revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having conversations with many people right now, and I
don't want to mention names because then it will all stop,'' McNair
said. ``But there are a lot of teams that might not be able to make
a go in their current markets. If the NFL doesn't want to deal us
into the expansion game, maybe it's time we went out and did
something on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Past time. Way past time.

VERDE MAY BE SMALL, BUT IT PACKS A WALLOP  
 UPPER AREAS HARD TO FIND, JOY TO FISH 
</HEADLINE>
 RIVER-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost any experienced Arizona angler knows that the Verde River
above Horseshoe Lake contains smallmouth bass.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a more desirable fish than the smallmouth.
An old cartoon perfectly fits the smallmouth. In the cartoon, two
buzzards, known as birds that eat dead creatures, are sitting in a
tree. One says to the other, ``Patience, hell, I'm gonna kill
something.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the smallmouth. It constantly chases down prey. Its red
eyes, nasty disposition and great battling ability make it a
favorite of fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Verde. Significant numbers of anglers pursue the
smallmouth in the mid to lower reaches of the Verde. But they don't
know about its potential upstream.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Burton, an assistant director for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department in charge of services, once was a research biologist and
did a lengthy fisheries study on the upper Verde.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of Arizona's major rivers. Its flow is modest at the
upper end but grows in size from feeder streams as it progresses to
Horseshoe. It almost never gets very large _ not at all like the
Salt River _ but it's extremely important because of the riparian
areas it nourishes. It also keeps water in Horseshoe and Bartlett
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it contains seven native fish, tying it with
Aravaipa Creek for the most in the state. Included are two
endangered fish _ the razorback sucker and the Colorado pike minnow
_ and the threatened spinedace.
</P>
<P>
   Burton is a Type A personality, an extremely bright, friendly
man who seems to be in perpetual motion. He's so knowledgeable
about wildlife biology that he can answer almost any question, even
rhetorical ones.
</P>
<P>
   He and his boss, Steve Ferrell, who is the deputy director of
the agency, have fished the upper reaches of the Verde together too
many times to remember. They seldom encounter other anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Where are we talking about? Between Prescott and Ash Fork on
U.S. 89. You're right, that's a lot farther northwest than you were
expecting.
</P>
<P>
   This stretch of river was reached by going north of Prescott to
just beyond Paulden. There you'll see a sign on the right that
announces Verde Ranch Ranch Road. Take that road for about five
miles. There you'll encounter a road to your right. It's Forest
Road 638. You have to look up the road to see the marker.
</P>
<P>
   This road goes south. It's too rough for cars. A high-clearance
vehicle is needed, not necessarily a 4x4. Most maps show that the
road goes to the stream and out the other side. It doesn't.
Prescott National Forest was having too much trouble with
all-terrain vehicles and closed the road at the rim where it drops
down to the Verde.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a half-mile hike on a steep road with many rolling
rocks to the river where an awesome scene appears.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the area has been closed to livestock grazing for a
number of years. The river is lined now by large numbers of young
cottonwoods and willows. Its water is absolutely beautiful. The
trees have allowed the current to slow and create marshes and
waterweeds that slow the current even more. You probably won't see
a more impressive riparian area.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks, songbirds, beavers, muskrats, predators and fish now
thrive on this stretch of river. It's wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet water below riffles is filled with fish, some very small
because this area isn't fished enough. Spinners and other lures are
deadly in this areas. Some of us caught nothing but small fish.
Burton hit a honey hole and caught some larger smallmouth, a
largemouth, a channel catfish and a round-tail chub, which looks
like a trout and was called a Verde trout by early settlers. All
but the chub are exotics in Arizona but were stocked. The
largemouth was about 2 pounds. Ferrell caught his share, too.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a wonderful place for children old enough to do
the hike in and out. Fish are thick and the catching easy.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the farther anglers go downstream, the larger the
fish. And the rock formations along the river make even more a
beautiful spot.
</P>
<P>
   Like parts of the Black River, this river needs anglers. Food
doesn't match the number of fish. A lot of them need to be removed
to promote a larger average size.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rather long drive but a great fishing trip for light
tackle and fly-fishing gear. &QL;

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Pedro Astacio worried so much about who was on first base Wednesday
night, he forgot who was at home plate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glen Barker put the winning run in scoring position with his
speed in the ninth inning. Craig Biggio pushed it across with his
bat as the Astros stretched their winning streak to four with a 3-2
victory over the Colorado Rockies in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, one of the fastest Astros, played a game of
cat-and-mouse with Astacio. Inserted as a pinch runner following a
single by Paul Bako, Barker worked Astacio from first base while
the pitcher worked to Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Barker eventually stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The distraction must have worked; after Biggio fouled off
several pitches, Astacio hung a 3-2 breaking ball that Biggio sent
up the middle for the game-winning single and the Astros' fourth
straight come-from-behind victory and 17th overall.
</P>
<P>
   At 29-16, the Astros are off to the best 45-game start in club
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking to try and deke me back and stuff to keep me
thinking about going back so my jump wasn't as good,'' Barker said
of Astacio. `` That's what their plan is, so you have to play the
game back.''
</P>
<P>
   Astacio (4-4) kept the Astros off balance most of the night
before they chipped away at a 2-0 deficit, scoring the tying and
winning runs in the last two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio allowed nine hits and struck out seven in 8 innings. The
loss broke his four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro did a good job of keeping us off balance,'' said Biggio,
who went 3-for-5 and is a .378 career hitter against Astacio. ``You
can't steal off him. His slide step is real fast, real quick.
Barker did a good job picking a good pitch to get himself in
scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell (3-1) pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Sean
Bergman, striking out three batters while suffering from a stomach
flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning with the chills, and my whole body
ached, which is something you don't want to have, especially
against the Rockies,'' Powell said. ``Once you get out there, the
adrenaline kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part was between innings sitting. They asked me how
I felt, and I was all right. Then we had a long (eighth) inning,
and I started feeling weak again.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, Carl Everett delivered late.
Everett, who drove in both Astros runs Tuesday, pulled them even at
2 in the eighth inning of Wednesday's game with a sacrifice fly
that scored Bill Spiers. Spiers had reached on an error by second
baseman Chris Sexton.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be a high-scoring series, pitting two of
the National League's most explosive offenses, has turned into one
pitching duel after another. In three games, the teams have
combined for 15 runs, the Astros winning 5-2, 2-1 and 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman held the Rockies to five hits Wednesday before being
lifted in the seventh inning. His only lapse came in the fourth,
when the Rockies took advantage of a walk and two hits for their
two runs.
</P>
<P>
   All six starting pitchers used in the series have gone at least
six innings. Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton each went nine innings
as the Astros won the first two games of a four-game set, which
concludes today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some good pitching. Pedro Astacio has been a good
pitcher for a long time,'' Bergman said. ``Just because they are
the Rockies doesn't mean they can't pitch. You have to give them as
much credit as you would us for pitching a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker said, ``Even to get three runs off Astacio
he was all over the corners, changing speeds, throwing breaking
balls. We really battled him hard. I know it looks like we weren't
hitting, but when a guy is pitching that way you don't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took the lead when Bergman walked Neifi Perez to lead
off the fourth and Larry Walker singled. Dante Bichette's sacrifice
fly and Todd Helton's RBI double gave the Rockies a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little frustrating knowing that I gave up a run
without giving up a hard-hit ball,'' Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sliced the lead to 2-1 in the fifth when Biggio hit a
one-out double to center, advanced to third on Spiers' grounder and
scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros stranded eight runners Wednesday, bringing the total
to 32 for the series, but did enough in the final two innings to
win.
</P>
<P>
   With a little help from Barker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may have helped a little bit to have Barker on
base, just a simple splitting of the concentration of a guy that
was already a little weary, I'm sure,'' Dierker said. ``That whole
situation at first base, maybe Biggio got a pitch to hit because of
it, or maybe he (Astacio) just made a mistake.''

PERCIVAL PUTS TRUST IN CURVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ask Troy Percival about the groove he's been
in recently and he'll give you the hand _ meaning ``stop right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival is a little superstitious when it comes to talking
about his string of nearly flawless performances for the Anaheim
Angels. ``Ask me about it when it's over,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday's game, Percival had thrown 91/3
consecutive hitless innings covering his previous nine appearances.
It's the longest stretch of hitless innings by a reliever in the
big leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he hadn't allowed a baserunner in his previous eight
appearances covering 72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Percival's success this season _ 12 saves in 13 opportunities _
is partly a result of him trusting his curveball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two years I used my curveball quite a bit,'' he said.
``But the last two years I got away from it because I couldn't
throw it for strikes. Now, it looks like I'm throwing a lot of
off-speed stuff but I'm still throwing 85 percent fastballs.
Hitters have to respect my off-speed stuff because I'm throwing it
for strikes, and that makes my fastball that much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival also credits the overall success of the bullpen for his
success this season. The bullpen's ERA going into Wednesday was
2.87, best in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is predicated on the pitchers before me,'' Percival
said. ``Every time we get a lead, the bullpen is keeping it a save
situation for me. It limits the pitches I have to throw down there
(warming up in the bullpen).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saved a lot of games, but I don't know if his stuff has
been as consistent as right now,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``His location, velocity, I don't know if it's ever been like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sparks skipped: Pitcher Steve Sparks will have his next start
bumped from Friday to Saturday so that Chuck Finley can remain on a
five-day schedule. When asked if Sparks was upset about the move,
Collins said: ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, though, said he doesn't have a problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said Sparks, who is 1-4 with a 6.04 ERA
in nine starts. ``I was here last year and I know how they shuffle
guys to keep Finley on his rotation. I'm used to that. It doesn't
bother me. I understand it. Even if I was pitching better, as well
as Chuck's throwing, they want to try to keep him on as normal a
rotation as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With next week's off-day (Thursday) falling on Sparks' turn in
the rotation, it's possible Sparks will miss his turn completely.
</P>

   __ It was no hitting clinic: The Angels pitchers took batting
practice for the first time this season in preparation for their
games in National League ballparks starting June 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very good,'' said Collins, who threw batting
practice to the pitchers. ``They need a few more days. We just need
them to learn to bunt, that's all. And know how to slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Sliding practice will come next week, but Collins doesn't
anticipate the pitchers needing to slide in a game very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get on base,'' he said. ``When they do get on, it
isn't pretty.''

HOOKSTRATTEN WEIGHS IN ON NFL AND L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm bamboozled by the world's events, unable to comprehend the
weird goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never understand how that sterling French gendarme,
Inspector Clouseau, wound up in charge of this country's espionage
security at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I quite understand how Mr. Magoo, that notoriously myopic
cartoon buffoon, positioned himself to direct all those wayward
sorties for NATO, that peace-loving alliance that spreads so much
world-wide good-will with its lethal bombings of foreign embassies,
hospitals, prisons, trains, buses, refugee encampments and, I'm
sure once in awhile, even Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   I'm totally in the dark about the stunning phenomenon of ``Star
Wars'', a science fiction piece of claptrap with cornball cinematic
gadgetry that is about as phony as, say, a Paul Tagliabue spiel
about the NFL returning to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite that (italicize that) phony, but just as
appallingly superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when it comes to current affairs that leave me hoarse
with laughter, that continuing NFL-L.A. football saga ranks right
up there at the top for sheer comedic impact.
</P>
<P>
   You might know that the latest development out of the latest NFL
meeting on the subject is that nothing is new, meaning Paul
Tagliabue still is playing it coyly with L.A. and encouraging
millionaires like Eli Broad, Ed Roski and Michael Ovitz to keep
coming up with glamorous new stadium and revenue plans.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish one, or all of these high-powered gentlemen would
stand up to the bullying Tagliabue and inform him, ``You can take
your NFL expansion franchise promise, and shove it! We only get on
our hands and knees in L.A. during earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-time attorney for the late Carroll Rosenbloom when he
owned the Los Angeles Rams and an interested observer of these
NFL-L.A. proceedings, Ed Gregory Hookstratten isn't sure pro
football is destined to return here in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we seem to have going on now in L.A. is a lot of
amateurism on one side and heavy politicizing on the other,'' says
Hookstratten, a Beverly Hills based mover and shaker who once also
represented Elvis Presley and Johnny Carson and still does business
for such people as Tom Brokaw, Vin Scully, Dick Enberg, Bryant
Gumble, Jim Hill and many others. ``A lot of the participants
haven't spent as many as five minutes in an NFL office. They just
don't know the game, or the heavy politics that are involved in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hookstratten has maintained the many contacts he made around the
NFL during his years with Rosenbloom, and it's his distinct
impression that the NFL would rather not return to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, it's going to cost a ton of money to totally
renovate the Coliseum,'' he says. ``With the cost overruns that are
inevitable, the price is going to be exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to put up that kind of money? There is no way the
local government is going to do it. Not with school teachers
needing to be paid more money. Not with roads needing to be
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I doubt, when all is said and done, that any one person is
going to put up his own money in such a risky investment. Look,
you'll only have 10 NFL games a year at the Coliseum. Where's all
the money going to come from? Concerts? Forget it. What group's
going to fill the Coliseum?
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem, as I see it, is who's going to pay for what.
The NFL wants the local government to chip in some money, but I'm
not sure that can happen. And guys like Eli Broad and Ed Roski
didn't become multi-millionaires blowing their money on bad
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hookstratten sees parking as another Coliseum problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they really think parking structures around the Coliseum
are going to be the answer?'' he says. ``Absolutely no way. You'll
all go in at the same time, and go out at the same time. That'll
take hours. And what happens when a car breaks down. It'll be an
absolute mess. To me, the parking structure idea is laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hookstratten also doesn't see L.A. corporate interests tripping
over themselves to purchase luxury suite boxes, nor locals plunging
down on PSLs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifestyle here in Southern California is a lot different
than it is in Cleveland, Ohio, or Irving, Texas,'' says
Hookstratten. ``In those places, going to a sporting venue is a
vital part of social life. But here in Southern California, we have
access to the beaches, to the desert, to the mountains, to Las
Vegas, to do many different places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luxury suites won't be an easy sell here, and there is no way
the PSLs (private seat licensing) would be. No way you're going to
get many L.A. fans to spend extra money to buy their tickets so
they can be assured of buying the same ones for future years. That
might work in some towns, but never will in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Hookstratten believes the best area for a new stadium would be
at Chavez Ravine on the Dodger Stadium property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect location with all the necessary roads in
place,'' he says. ``The next best place would be the Hollywood Park
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Hookstratten doesn't envision Paul Tagliabue changing his murky
stance towards L.A. in the upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is going to continue its brinkmanship until some group
convinces the league it has the money and the wherewithal to do
it---and so far none has,'' he says. ``What's troubling is the
clock is clicking, and people in L.A. are finding other things to
do with their Sunday afternoons in the fall rather than look at NFL
games. I know a lot of people in L.A. now totally indifferent to
the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gregory Hookstratten was with the Rams when Rosenbloom had
his dispute with the L.A. politicians that led to Rosenbloom
deciding to move the franchise to Anaheim after the 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carroll wanted to put the team's daily training facilities at
Rancho Park which was near the team's headquarters on Pico
Boulevard,'' recalls Hookstratten. ``But an L.A. councilman killed
the deal, and that's when Carroll began talking with the Anaheim
people. Within a year or two, the deal was made. If the L.A.
politicians had given Carroll what he wanted back in 1976---and
Carroll didn't want much, in retrospect---I'm sure the Rams still
would be in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   And we wouldn't be treated to the obscene spectacle of
multi-millionaire moguls throwing themselves at the mercy of Paul
Tagliabue and his NFL bosses.

ELLIOTT COULD EARN GALAXY STARTING SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Newly acquired New Zealand midfielder Simon
Elliott might have earned himself a start when the Los Angeles
Galaxy visits Columbus on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott became the first non-Latin foreigner to sign with Los
Angeles last week. Against New England Saturday, the former
Stanford standout made a strong contribution as a 35th-minute
substitute during the Galaxy's 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   He might not be the player L.A. needs to draw fans `/E5P-Y gate,
but as Elliott points out, there are other ways to draw fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I don't quite fit the mold of a typical sort of
L.A.-market foreign player,'' said Elliott. ``But if the team sort
of does well and gets wins, that will get the fans coming
regardless of where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid was impressed with Elliott's vision and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played very well,'' said Schmid. ``He's not a
flashy player, but he's a player who does the little things to help
connect the team. I thought the thing he did really well was give
us some cover at midfield. And he did a good job of (giving)
Mauricio (Cienfuegos) the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he showed he can help us a little bit, we're thinking
about starting him (against Columbus). He's a foreign player. You
expect guys like that to play and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hermosillo returns:Schmid hasn't talked to Carlos Hermosillo
since his Mexican team was eliminated from the Mexican playoffs
over the weekend. Hermosillo, expected to arrive in 7-10 days,
could be back for the Galaxy's next home game June 6 against Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had agreed that after his season was over in Mexico, he
could take a week to 10 days off,'' said Schmid. ``I'd rather have
him take a break now than come into a situation and be tired. I
want to win a championship and that means we have to win games in
August, September and October. So if we miss him for one more game
that's OK, because we will need him later.''
</P>
<P>
   __ New old face: Another new face during training this week was
also a familiar one. Harut Karapetyan, who spent 1996 and '97 with
Los Angeles before recent stints with San Jose and Tampa Bay, is
hoping to earn a roster spot with the Galaxy again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's left-footed and offers us some options on that side of
the field,'' Schmid said. ``He's somebody who's comfortable in Los
Angeles because his family is here. Sometimes those players play
better when they're closer to home. He's had a couple good goals in
training and he's definitely someone we're giving a serious look
to.''

D-BACKS LOOK LIKE REAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is almost Memorial Day. The first checkpoint in the marathon.
The first alert for contenders.
</P>
<P>
   And if first place is still on the radar screen when summer is
sworn in for duty, it's time to take your baseball team seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of the lingering turnstile apathy at BOB, take a moment
and grasp the significance of what's happening here. The
Diamondbacks are fresh, entertaining, no longer nine ushers in a
giant amusement park. They have blown a bundle of games and
survived. They are a second-year franchise flirting with the
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The other night on ESPN, noted baseball analyst Joe Morgan was
asked an interesting question. Of all the teams in the National
League West, who did he feel was most capable of running away with
the division?
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco or Los Angeles,'' Manager Buck Showalter
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan picked the Diamondbacks. Without a hint of reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Joe has never been a GM or a manager,'' Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winning carries its own aura, and while nothing is what it
seemed to be in 1998, the personality of this team is almost
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   We have learned that Jay Bell is not only combustible, but once
loved chemistry experiments in high school. That Joe Garagiola Jr.
is more than just a punch line, and if you needed any more proof
that Luis Gonzalez was a classic heist, well, the Hall of Fame
called earlier in the week. They want his bat.
</P>
<P>
   We have learned that Showalter isn't so rigid, after all, and if
you could've only heard the salty tales he told Wednesday. And not
only have we seen how Matt Williams responds to a bad year, we have
learned his wife wants him to ponder a career in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I can act,'' Williams said. ``I can do everything from
Jean-Claude Van Damme to Al Pacino. I can run the whole gamut. It
all just comes naturally. In my own mind, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Question is, can the Diamondbacks run the gamut?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the division is ripe for plucking. The Dodgers are
already in panic mode, reassigning coaches in effort to shake up
the room. The Giants are a scrappy bunch, but certain to encounter
the laws of gravity. And in the attrition of summer, during in the
guts of the season, the Diamondbacks' rotation has the potential to
carry the load. Even without Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Much credit goes to Garagiola Jr. Whether by design or dumb
luck, there is an undeniable chemistry on this team, a lineup
producing a whole greater than the sum of its parts. For all the
solid acquisitions, the best move he didn't make was peddling Brian
Anderson, who was stellar in Wednesday's start against the Padres
and will fill a pivotal role in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   And you might want to take a seat for this: If it continues,
Garagiola Jr. will be in the running for executive of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great, balanced lineup,'' Gonzalez said. ``So much
was made out of our pitching staff in the off-season that I think
everybody forgot about the hitters. And I think we've surprised
some people with where we're at now. I think we're starting to open
some eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting to look like the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a really good mixture of guys,'' Gonzalez said.
``And we've all seemed to jell real well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are also creating a strong sense of place, a
reason to come to BOB. Entering Wednesday's game against the
Padres, they were 16-5 at home, the best mark in the majors. An
encouraging trend, and in June, they will play 19 of 26 games here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, they don't come to see a baseball game,''
Showalter said. ``They come to see the Yankees win. They don't come
to see the venue. They don't come to see the stadium. They come
there for one thing. To see the Yankees win. If you don't deliver
that, it ain't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, it's happening now. And as improbable as it
seemed eight months ago, it could happen all the way to September. &QL;

KINGS TALK WITH VAN BOXMEER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ John Van Boxmeer interviewed Tuesday for the
Los Angeles Kings' coaching position, and afterward, general
manager Dave Taylor labeled the Long Beach Ice Dogs' coach a
``serious candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good meeting with John,'' Taylor said Wednesday
afternoon. ``He's had a lot of experience as a coach. I think he
handles the bench well and I think he knows how to motivate his
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor interviewed former Buffalo Sabres coach Ted Nolan last
week. He said he would like to set up interviews next week with
``two or three'' more candidates for the job before inviting anyone
back for a second interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I've met with everybody, if one guy seems to be a
clear-cut No. 1 candidate, we'll move ahead and try to get a deal
done,'' Taylor said. ``Hopefully before the draft (on June 26), we
can get a coach in place. It's not absolutely necessary, but if I
can do that, I'd like to.''
</P>
<P>
   The job has been vacant since April 19, when the Kings decided
not to bring back Larry Robinson for a fifth season. Robinson was
hired Wednesday as an assistant coach by the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer, who could not be reached for comment, has forged a
relationship with Taylor the last two seasons, during which the Ice
Dogs have had a limited affiliation with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a comfort level with him,'' Taylor said, ``and
because of that we consider him a serious candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor would not name the other coaches he wants to interview,
but it is believed that Detroit assistant Dave Lewis is one of
them. Lewis, however, is expected to be the top candidate if Red
Wings coach Scotty Bowman decides to retire.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, Taylor confirmed that the Kings have decided
not to offer a contract to 1997 draft choice Matt Zultek, a forward
who will thus become available in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Zultek was chosen with the 15th pick in 1997. Under NHL rules,
because Zultek was a first-round selection, the Kings will receive
the 15th selection in the second round this year as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt hasn't developed like we thought he would the last two
years,'' Taylor said. ``We feel we'll get a prospect as good as or
better than Matt Zultek with the 43rd pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zultek's agent, Larry Kelly, ``If they're not keen on him,
it's better for him to go back in the draft. I know Matt will play
in the NHL at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Zultek scored an overtime goal Sunday that gave his junior team,
the Ottawa 67's, the Memorial Cup championship, but there were
concerns about his lack of physical play given his 6-foot-3,
218-pound frame. Zultek was selected with a St. Louis draft choice
acquired in the 1996 deal that sent Wayne Gretzky to the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor continues to try to sign 1997 sixth-round selection
Richard Seeley, a defenseman. If Seeley is not signed by Tuesday,
he will go back into the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're negotiating with Richard and hope to have him signed by
June 1,'' Taylor said. ``I think we have a chance there.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the Kings have a shot at signing
Aki Berg. Taylor said there is nothing to report regarding
negotiations with the Finnish defenseman. Berg spent this season
playing in Finland after a contract dispute with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting with a clean slate and we'll see where they
take it,'' said Kelly, who is also Berg's agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have begun negotiations with another Finnish
defenseman, 24-year-old Jere Karalahti, a 1993 draft selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had only preliminary discussions with the Kings,''
said Karalahti's agent, Don Baizley. ``Nothing is resolved yet. I
don't have any timeline.''

RED-HOT GRIFFEY'S MAGESTIC HOMER POWERS MARINER ROMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ A right-handed pitcher with a lifetime record 20
games below .500, the Minnesota Twins' LaTroy Hawkins doesn't seem
like a guy who dominates Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey had just one hit off Hawkins in 11 at-bats before
Wednesday, but he improved on that in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   After a single in the first, he tore into a third-inning
changeup from Hawkins, rocketing it 453 feet into the upper deck in
right field.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's major league-leading 19th homer crashed off a seat and
disappeared behind the white curtain that covers the uppermost
seats at the Metrodome. It was the longest of the Mariners' 95 home
runs this year and the second of four for the M's in Wednesday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   They took an 11-3 win behind eight innings from Jamie Moyer and
returned home with a .500 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys look at it as 1-for-11,'' Griffey said of his career
mark off Hawkins. ``When players are hot, it doesn't matter who's
pitching. When players are cold, it doesn't matter who's pitching.
It's just one of those things that happen in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But things like that don't happen for everyone. Everyone can't
hit eight homers in 12 games. Everyone can't take a pitch off the
shoetops and blast it to Mankato.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said Mariners rookie pitcher Jordan
Zimmerman, who recently joined the team from Class AA. ``That ball
had to be 520 feet up. You don't see that (in AA), I'll tell you
that. And it was a good pitch, too. It was down in the dirt, and he
pretty much golfed it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a drive that would please Griffey's Florida neighbors,
Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods. Even Griffey, who does his best not
to talk about homers, gave in after this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it,'' he said. ``I knew I hit it, and that was
it. I knew when it left the bat it was high, and some places you
have to worry about speakers. This is one of those places. I lost
it, (but) I knew I just hit it high and after it got to a certain
point, I was just like, `OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   The homer was the 369th of Griffey's career, tying him with
Ralph Kiner for 45th on the all-time list. Griffey's a little off
Mark McGwire's record pace from last year (at this rate, he'll hit
67), but catcher Tom Lampkin is awestruck all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Mark last year _ unbelievable,'' said Lampkin, who
played with McGwire in St. Louis last year. ``He's just another one
of those guys you shake your head at. You don't know how they do
it, but you know they're going to do it. Every time they do
something like that, you ask yourself, how much more can a guy do?
You figure one of these days they're going to run out of magic or
run out of talent or run out of miracles. But they just keep on
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has been going and going ever since visiting his father
on an off-day May 4. On his way to a road trip in Cleveland,
Griffey stopped by Cinergy Field for batting practice with Ken Sr.,
the Cincinnati Reds' hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Senior noticed a slight flaw in Junior's swing. It took five
games for results to show, but once Griffey started hitting, he
hasn't stopped. In his career-best 15-game hitting streak, Griffey
is batting .441 (26-for-59) with eight homers and 21 runs batted
in. He has improved his average from .270 to .328 during the streak
and is hitting with renewed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all hitting really is _ being confident that you're
going to go up there and pick out a good pitch and hit it,''
Griffey said. ``If you're not confident in your mechanics, you're
not going to perform like you can, and I think that was the biggest
thing. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I swung at a
couple of pitches (thrown by Senior), and he told me exactly what I
was doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's homer was majestic, but the one Griffey hit Tuesday
was more significant to hitting coach Jesse Barfield. That blast
was the opposite of this one, a 348-foot bullet down the left-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barometer for Junior, in my opinion, is how hard he hits
the ball to the opposite field,'' said Barfield. ``Even when a
guy's (struggling) at the plate, he can turn on a few balls and you
think, `Oh, man, he's hot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No. From a mechanics standpoint, when you see a guy drive a
ball out of the ballpark opposite field, you know he's doing
everything right. You can't cheat and do that. That was impressive
today, don't get me wrong. But a batter can cheat and do that if he
has any kind of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, that wasn't a cheating swing. That was hands. He
got the hands through the zone and stayed closed and the ball
jumped off his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   As it left the park, the homer traveled over a sign for the
``FuncoLand Fun Zone'' at the Metrodome. Thousands of elementary
school kids were among the 17,022 fans on hand, a fact not lost on
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made a big difference,'' he said. ``It's fun to play in
front of 40 or 50,000 people, but to see all those kids out there
yelling, it felt like a playground.''
</P>
<P>
   For Griffey, it didn't just feel like a playground. It was.

PACK YOUR NUT CASES FOR THIS TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his quest to become America's nuttiest golfer,
Braemar Country Club member Nobby Orens came up a few goobers shy
of a full bag. It was not for lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Orens scattered ``peanut shells'' around the globe. He
played 152 rounds of golf during an odyssey that took him to 12
countries, seven states and 40 cities.
</P>
<P>
   He played on 41 different courses, 26 of them new.
</P>
<P>
   He logged 38,445 frequent-flier miles in the process, leaving
his wife to sometimes wonder just where the heck he was, anyway,
and when he would be coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Orens' destinations included Alaska, New Zealand, Hawaii and
Florida. He even managed to work in a family vacation and keep his
travel agency running.
</P>
<P>
   All this globe-trotting was only good for second place in the
Golf Nuts Society of America's annual quest to identify the golfer
most nuts about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wendi Keene, of Scottsdale, Ariz., is top nut for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Orens was operating under the assumption the award
went to the person who put together the most impressive resume
during the year. But as in a skins game, the ``carry-over'' factor
came into play. The winner had been amassing points for 12 years
and finished 1998 with 27,942 points, jumping to the top spot from
No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Orens, who has been affiliated with this loose group for five
years, started 1998 in 10th place with 9,095 points. He earned
nearly twice as many points as Keene did but finished 1,699 points
behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the lead was too much to overcome in one year,'' Orens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bukt he's racked up some impressive numbers. He started playing
golf five years ago and has taken his game to 173 courses
worldwide. He's played 865 rounds, for an average of 173 rounds
annually. In September of 1996 he played 33 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is another benefit, besides logging thousands of
frequent-flier miles.Orens has improved his index, which is used to
calculate a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick recap of some of his more memorable stunts last
year:
</P>
<P>
   __ Visiting Alaska in July, he played 200 holes in one day. It
took 17 hours and 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   __ In September he flew to Auckland, New Zealand, where he was
met by a TV crew for a New Zealand golf show and driven to Gulf
Harbor Golf Club, where he played 18 holes. He then flew back to
Los Angeles and played 18 holes at his home club. Because the
international dateline was in play, Orens played in Auckland and
L.A. on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after flying 13,000 miles in 72 hours, he jumped
back on a plane and flew to Maui for a 100-hole tournament.
</P>
<P>
   __ In October, he played in a tournament sponsored by one of the
airlines. There was an ``Honest John'' contest, in which golfers
predict their final score. Orens predicted an 89 and ended up with
a 113.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the worst score I have shot in almost four years. For
that, I was awarded `The Optimist' trophy for missing my prediction
by the largest number, 24,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given stunts like this, Orens thought he was in pretty good
shape for bagging the trophy. But he decided to finish the year
with a flourish, just in case. In November he and his wife went to
a conference in Honolulu. But he had been invited to play in a
charity tournament on a new Greg Norman course in Naples, Fla.,
right after the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flew from Honolulu to Los Angeles on November 16, landing
at 9:04 p.m. I kissed my wife goodbye and got on a 10 p.m. flight
to Miami, landing at 5:47 a.m. on November 17, and took a car to
Naples, 110 miles from Miami,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That tournament started at 10 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m. Orens was
back in L.A. by 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during 1998, he thought he could only do this kind
of crazy stuff for a year. But the title is so close, it would be a
shame to abandon the quest. So on July 20th, Orens plans to play 54
holes of golf.
</P>
<P>
   In one day. In three cities. In two countries separated by the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   He'll start the day at 5:30 a.m., teeing off at Stokely Park
Golf Course in London. At 10:30 a.m. he'll jump on the Concorde for
a quick flight to John F. Kennedy Airport. A tee time is reserved
at nearby Clearview Golf Course, where he'll play a quick 18. Then
he will fly to Los Angeles and arrive home in time for 18 holes at
his home course and then dinner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   So how many time zones will that journey span?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got a clue,'' Orens said. ``Whatever is between
London and Los Angeles.'' &QL;

DULL HAS ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the right move.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge President Blenda Wilson, who created hard
feelings in the community when she forced out Robert Hiegert in
1995, gave the department a boost when she hired Richard Dull as
the university's athletic director on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN athletics has been plagued by bad decisions, scandals and
budget deficits. The problems aren't insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, 53, has a healthy understanding of intercollegiate
athletics. He presents himself not as a potential cheerleader of
CSUN but as a professional who knows the nuances of dealing within
a department, university, conference and the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges he faces at Northridge are daunting. The athletic
department has an $800,000 deficit. Students and the community seem
to be apathetic about anything the university does, except for a
small bloc of neighborhood groups opposed to plans for construction
of an on-campus football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the athletic department's relationship within the CSUN
academic community soured in the wake of mistakes made by former
A.D. Paul Bubb _ or embarrassing things that happened on his watch
_ specifically the arrest of women's basketball coach Michael
Abraham on federal cocaine trafficking charges and the cover-up of
an incident in which a football player was shot at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Dull has to repair that bridge, which is one of his stated
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Lewis, vice chancellor for university relations at the
University of Nebraska at Kearney, said CSUN made the right
decision to hire Dull.
</P>
<P>
   ```He's a low-key guy,'' said Lewis, who worked with Dull when
Dull was the athletic director at Kearney from 1995-98. ``He does a
lot behind the scenes. He restructured our entire (athletic)
department. He made some hard decisions and did it with style and
class. Very professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Dull arrived on campus a month ago sincerely
contrite about his role in one of college sport's infamous scandals
_ the cocaine-induced death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias in
1986. Dull was forced to resign five months after Bias died and he
spent the next 10 years in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Bias' death uncovered investigations that revealed a Maryland
athletic department that tolerated basketball players with 1.5 GPAs
or lower. Many of the NCAA's get-tough standards for incoming
student-athletes were created because of the Maryland scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dull discussed the circumstances of his resignation at Maryland
the day he interviewed. He said he made mistakes as a young
athletic director in admitting athletes who had no chance of
graduating. He's once again ready to prove himself as an effective
Division I athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dull returned from his college-athletics exile in 1995,
when he became the athletic director at Nebraska-Kearney, he's
familiarized himself with the new NCAA rules and philosophies. He
was successful at Kearney and also at Moravian College, a Division
III school with an enrollment of just 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   At both schools, Dull put special interest into their
substance-abuse programs. Two weeks ago, in a published interview,
CSUN interim athletic director Sam Jankovich said the athletic
department needs to establish a substance-abuse program.
</P>
<P>
   Dull's stated objectives as a successful athletic director were
pointed directly at CSUN on the day he interviewed. He said he
should report directly to the president. He said the key to
marketing and promoting an athletic department is basic hard work.
He said a Division I university can't afford to carry 20 or more
teams if those teams are mediocre across the board.
</P>
<P>
   He said sports facilities have to be top-notch for the health of
a college athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clear: It won't take long for Dull to identify
CSUN's strengths and weaknesses. It's time for CSUN to set the
proper course for establishing itself as a viable Division I
university again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.

GIRL POWER DRIVING SHOW AT FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mary Pierce, who is engaged to Cleveland second
baseman Roberto Alomar, may be taking a few tips from baseball's
training rooms. It appears Pierce _ she of the 6-foot-tall,
pulverizing power-stroke tennis game _ is heavily into creatine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot see what all the fuss is about in France,'' Pierce
said after her first-round win at the French Open on Tuesday. ``You
can find it in any supermarket in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the mere comparison to America is nearly as bad as
asking for ketchup on your escargot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in spite of the serious culture clash, it is always a
good time to wish you were in Paris. There's Notre Dame. The
Louvre. The Pont Neuf. Sacre Coeur. There are the bagettes. The
butter. The wine. The haughty treatment from Parisiens who detest
les Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But spring is the best time, especially now, thanks to the young
ladies who are making a lot of noise at Roland Garros Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As Pete Sampras rolls and flops in the devilish red clay, and
the men's side of the draw lacks prestige and charisma and (wait
until we get to Wimbledon) tabloid fodder, the women are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   There is Pierce, who is prone to spandex and whose personal
history gets more interesting each step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the Swiss Miss? She was in a pickle ... for
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis had already dispatched
with her second-round opponent and a public relations headache.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis beat Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of
the pair's Australian Open final. It was during that Open that
Hingis slammed Mauresmo, calling her ``half a man,'' an intentional
slap at Mauresmo, who is openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   Years after pioneers like Billie Jean King and Martina
Navratilova played on the women's tour after revealing they were
gay and losing endorsement deals, Hingis set the discussion back 20
years with her knock against Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, despite being pumped up in front of the home crowd to
knock off Hingis, Mauresmo faltered in her attempt at payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ... sink her. That's when I lost control,''
Mauresmo said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there is an end to the women's story lines.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 seed Steffi Graf and No. 3 seed Monica Seles have eight
French Open singles titles between them, but this time around, they
will both be sentimental favorites now that age (Graf is 30) and
setbacks have taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   After being stabbed, watching her father die of stomach cancer
and suffering through eating disorders and depression, Seles is
distressed over the three-month bombing of Yugoslavia and the
destruction of Novi Sad, her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   With a first-round win under her belt, perhaps like Serbian
Vlade Divac of the Sacramento Kings, who played his best basketball
ever during such a horrific time, Seles will find a way to reach
down for something extra these hard days.
</P>
<P>
   For comic relief, though, there are the Williams sisters, whose
bright, eccentric personalities continue to puzzle the tennis media
and many opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tennis Monthly Recap,'' which is written and published by
Venus and Serena Williams _ seeded Nos. 5 and 10 in the Open _
features an article in the latest issue called: ``Serena, Serena,
Serena!'' in which there is a bold prediction that one of the
sisters will win in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And in case anyone is still looking for additional feminine
subplots, what about Jennifer Capriati?
</P>
<P>
   Capriati's first-round French Open victory comes just one week
after the 23-year-old won the Strasbourg Open, pocketing $27,500
and her first tournament title in six long years.
</P>
<P>
   The last week of tennis victories represents quite a comeback
milestone for Capriati who, in 1990 at age 14 at the French Open,
was the youngest semifinalist ever in a Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, women's tennis is defined by, if not still
recovering from, Capriati's well-publicized rise and fall. As the
bubbly youngster who burned out and then had her every adolescent
mistake held up for international scrutiny, Capriati became a
lightning rod for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   As Capriati's well-chronicled tailspin was played out, tennis
re-wrote its rules, setting new age restrictions for tour
participation. The Women's Tennis Association also struggled with
how to market the game _ something desperately needed in a time
when Virginia Slims dropped sponsorship of the women's tour.
</P>
<P>
   After all this, Capriati's new success and confidence could not
come at a better time. She said there used to be times she'd look
in the mirror, hated herself and wanted to die. But now she is
having fun again. She is stronger and more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it helps Capriati that these days, instead of being the
darling who is going to save tennis, she is just one of many women
who are making the ladies' side of the French Open draw the place
to see or be seen.

decades of shoddy building practices in South Florida, exposing

that crumpled like cardboard in the driving wind and rain. The
hurricane brought much stricter building codes. But now, in a move
that has many people shaking their heads in bewilderment, the state

<P>
   BATHROOM-SINK (Undated) _ Just when you thought there was no one
left to leave you, the bathroom sink is leaving, too. Those broad
porcelain shoulders you leaned on each morning, gripped in each
hand, that bore the weight of the world for you as you woke,
staring blindly into the void, unaware of where or who you were
until the basin filled, the water stilled and your face rocked
safely into sight. Gone. Or going, with a loud, emptying suck. By
William L. Hamilton.

</P>
<P>
   PORCELAIN-TUB (New York) _ Imagine a prewar bathroom with a
deep, deep porcelain tub and gleaming (but not too gleaming) nickel
fittings: a wide sunflower shower head and those little porcelain
buttons marked with Hot and Cold in the middle of gutsy crossbar
handles. There are reproductions, of course, but the dream is the

stand alongside the bidet and the working fireplace as the latest
must-have in the well-appointed bathroom suite. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Photo has been sent to NYT photo clients.)
</P>
<P>
   BATHROOM-FLOOR (New York) _ It could have been the ultimate faux
pas: Blake Sherlock and Andrew Sloan had just moved to New York to
create artworks (at their Sloan/Sherlock Gallery in Chelsea), and I
was asking if they would redo my bathroom floor. But then, their
art is made of shells and stones and other found objects turned
into richly textured mosaics. By Fred Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-BEAUTIFICATION (Newton, Mass.) _ In the fall of 1998, the
Newton Pride Committee, the volunteer beautification army for this
grand old Boston suburb, took a quantum leap from planting tulips
and embraced wildflowers. By Ann Raver.
</P>
<P>
   AIR-CONDITIONING (Washington) _ As Memorial Day looms, few
pronouncements strike more terror in the hearts of dwellers than
those inevitable words, ``Hazy, hot and humid.'' For 73 percent of
all American homes, the most convenient _ though perhaps not
universally loved _ remedy for summer oppression is the
air-conditioner. According to Donald Albrecht and Chrysanthe
Broikos, co-curators of the new exhibit ``Stay Cool! Air
Conditioning America'' at the National Building Museum, little has
been more influential in 20th century building than the relentless
generic whir. By Patricia Leigh Brown.

SECRETS HARDLY WORTH STEALING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Now that we know the Chinese have tried to monkey-wrench our
elections and have ripped off our deepest nuclear-weapons secrets
for 20 years, shouldn't we at least TP their embassy?
<P>
   The Chinese are stealing weapons technology from our nuclear
labs, high-tech companies and Roadrunner cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we know the Chinese would never attack us with the
weapons they have developed from the stolen technology. If they
wipe us out, where would they get cigarettes? And weapons secrets?
</P>
<P>
   But the spy scandal has widespread implications. If you're like
me, you require simplistic personal advice and insight from total
strangers to direct your life, and a newspaper horoscope is too
complicated, so you rely heavily on fortune cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, I cracked open my fortune cookie, hoping for good
news about a promotion or a Pulitzer Prize. My ``fortune'' was
microfilm design specs for the W-88 nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   We have nobody to blame but ourselves. Apparently you don't have
to be a James Bond to steal U.S. government secrets. Austin Powers
could pull it off, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The only crime you're more likely to get away with is removing
the tag from your mattress.
</P>
<P>
   What really hurts is that U.S. firms like Hughes Aerospace
handed sensitive secret technology to the Chinese in order to
protect investments. If a major firm does this, it's smart
business. If you or I do it, it's prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The golden rule: Corporate needs outrank national security. Take
Standard Oil. Please. History buff Jerry Matters says that during
WWII, the Japanese shut off U.S. access to all rubber plantations,
so we had a rubber crisis. The solution was synthetic rubber, the
patent for which was shared by Standard Oil of New Jersey and the
I.G. Farben group of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   So once a year, as American lads were busily killing German lads
and vice versa, Standard Oil's people got together with Farben's
people in neutral Lisbon to talk rubber and maybe play some golf.
Neither government was hip to the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Oil's penalty when the U.S. government found out, after
the war? Ha ha.
</P>
<P>
   China's not alone. As an international game, spying is more
widespread than soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley is probably the spy capital of the world right
now, with sensitive and valuable computer information under
constant siege.
</P>
<P>
   You can't get a table at a good restaurant in Silicon Valley
because of all the spies for foreign governments and cutthroat U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for guests at Silicon Valley hotels to demand
private phone lines, since hotel lines and cell phones can be
bugged.
</P>
<P>
   The huge San Francisco Bay Area law firm of Pillsbury, Madison
and Sutro opened a 400-attorney office in Palo Alto, Calif., within
the last year, specializing in protecting ``intellectual property''
_ the secrets everyone is busy stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's only a game.
</P>
<P>
   MORE CRIME: From the Healdsburg, Calif., Tribune's Police Log
(thanks, Ed Flesch): ``When a man ordered a plate of nachos and
disputed payment for the item, he dropped the chips and let them
fall where they may, which was on the floor of the business. The
clerk called police and learned that this was not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is sharing rubber secrets with an enemy during wartime.
And did you catch the poetic/philosophic turn of phrase in the
first sentence of the nacho report?
</P>
<P>
   From the ``Sheriff's Calls`` in the Pt. Reyes, Calif., Light
(thanks, Les Blodgett): ``Deputies were notified that seven to nine
loose horses were headed east on Manana Way and then turned onto
Highway 1.``
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the local animal control has a vice squad.
</P>
<P>
   NAME DEPT.: Are we gradually returning to the days when your
surname was related to your occupation?
</P>
<P>
   Example: In old Germany and England, the ostler was the gent who
stabled your horse at the inn and mucked the stalls _ the scooper
of poop.
</P>
<P>
   A recent news story quoted an executive for the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission _ Russell Driver. Same day, another story
quoted a museum bird expert named Pamela Swan.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Franson notes that UC Davis has an entomologist named Bob
Bugg, who must be related to the insect Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Archer (a KRON news staffer and NOT an archer) came across
a news story involving an Army officer stationed in Pennsylvania.
Her name is Major Karen Basehore. I had a punch line, but coals to
Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
   Can I move the taste bar any lower?
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Peskin reports that the Syuk-Hee Spa on Broadway, scene of
many vice squad raids for prostitution, was finally shut down. But
the city has granted a massage parlor license to the shop's new
owner: Un Zipperer.
</P>
<P>
   That item makes it official: This particular column will not be
classified as ``intellectual property.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Returning prayer to schools won't fix what ails us
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early years of this century, while there was still prayer
in public schools, we saw the first stag movies, racial segregation
was enforced and lynchings were common in the Bible Belt. Big
cities were ripped by the submachine-gun fire of gangland wars and
the heartland was preyed on by megacrooks John Dillinger and Pretty
Boy Floyd. We lost scores of thousands to a flu epidemic and the
Great Depression impoverished millions.
</P>
<P>
   But since prayer has been barred from public classrooms, we have
eliminated smallpox and polio, ended segregation, enjoyed repeated
boom times, won scads of Nobel Prizes for medicine, seen ever more
kids be graduated from high school and college and routed godless
communism.
</P>
<P>
   This exercise in selective memory and the willful muddling of
coincidence with cause and effect is by way of suggesting that the
pleas for returning prayer to public schools, animated by the two
recent schoolhouse shooting sprees, promise more delusion than
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas are heartfelt. (Unless you count the radio commercials
the ever-hustling Christian Coalition is running in key
presidential primary states Iowa and New Hampshire.) Puzzled,
distressed and caught in a cacophony of agendas, we look for an
easy out. For many, having public school pupils pray seems just the
thing.
</P>
<P>
   That seems so in part because we misremember the past and
misread the present.
</P>
<P>
   It is now widely assumed that prayer and Bible readings were
universal in public classrooms before the Supreme Court in 1963, as
the hype has it, ``threw God out of the schools.'' In fact, a 1960
survey found that only five states required Bible reading. Eleven
had declared the practice unconstitutional _ Illinois as early as
1910. Many schools in states that allowed prayer and Bible reading
practiced neither.
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to what the hellfire-and-brimstone politicians
would have you think, America is flat-out the most religious
developed nation.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 60 nations found that 44 percent of Americans attend
religious services weekly. Our closest competitors are the
Canadians at 38 percent. Most other nations are in the 20s, with
some as low as 5 or even 2 percent. Another measure: 84 percent of
Americans believe in heaven; only 31 percent of Germans and 27
percent of the French do.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of us belong to a congregation, up from 59
percent in the fabled 1950s _ and incomparably more than the 17
percent affiliation in 1776 when, as tendentious legend mangles
history, we are wrongly said to have been founded as ``a Christian
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Our careful separation of church and state has been an
incomparable boon to religion. To rail now that what ails us _ and
something always ails us, after all _ could be fixed if only the
government had children recite faithless pseudo-prayers is to
counsel illusion and seed bitterness and nurture futility. A faux,
state-run piety would be an insult to the honest faith at which
Americans excel.

 &HT;    No overhaul for Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Hawks president Stan Kasten was stung by the
team's playoff collapse, but he said Wednesday that he still
believes the team is on the right track as it heads into ``the most
important year in the history of our franchise and therefore the
most important summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said the Hawks have the tools to strengthen their team
and the organization is in a position it carefully sought while
preparing for the move into the new Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that no major changes are being considered _ not
with current players nor with coach Lenny Wilkens and general
manager Pete Babcock, both of whom are under fire from some critics
and fans.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Kasten indicated that no player can
feel fully secure if the right offer comes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of not having a big media star means that we have
no one who is untouchable here,'' he said. ``The day we can improve
at any position, we will do it. And let me say that our players
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten referred to the program that started with the free-agent
signing of Dikembe Mutombo and the retention of leading scorer
Steve Smith. ``This is what we've been planning for three years,
and that's what we've got our (salary) cap exception and our four
draft picks for,'' he said. ``And we already have a very good
roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Major roster changes are unlikely, Kasten said. ``I told myself
before the year started that I would not indulge in major changes
because of the nature of how disruptive the whole season was,
because of the lockout and the way we had to all come together and
get the season behind us. I don't think it's a fair year to draw
any conclusions from, and that's how I feel today.''
</P>
<P>
   However, change clearly is in the offing, Kasten said, by the
way the Hawks very nature of having stockpiled draft picks and the
team's $4.4 million trade exception, which that will allow him to
bring in an additional established player. , Kasten said change
clearly is in the offing. We always make changes in the off-season,
both franchises (Hawks and baseball's Atlanta Braves). I would say
</P>
<P>
   The basic goals are He said the basic goals were to improve the
team's depth and its offense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this year was a disastrous offensive year for the whole
league,'' Kasten said. ``There and there are lot of reasons for
that, much of which has to do with the screwy nature of this
particular season, the short time to put teams together, short time
to train guys and then, of course, the compressed schedule. You
never had time to construct an offense.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Hawks were more guilty than most. Despite a 31-19
record in over the regular season, they ranked 28th in the league
in scoring at 86.3 a game. Against New York, they set records for
gruesome four-game playoff series records for fewest points (306),
fewest field goals (101) and worst shooting percentage (.316).
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly need to improve . . . ours as the next thing, and
one of the ways you do that is adding scoring, whether it's
starters or off the bench,'' Kasten said. ``I will say this: If
we're healthy, we should have a deep enough and good enough team
where we're getting nine or 10 players on our 12-man roster into
our games. If a year from now we don't, that would concern me.'' It
doesn't concern me now because of the screwy nature of our season,
but if it were true next year again, that would be a real red flag
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said he is ``saatisfied with our leadership'' from
Wilkens and Babcock. Regarding Wilkens and Babock, Kasten said,
``I'm satisfied with our leadership. ``We put this roster together
with trades and free-agent signings and when we're healthy,
everyone acknowledges we have a good, deep roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're poised on being the kind of team we planned on being,
and you know that doesn't happen by itself,'' Kasten said. ``That's
not an accident. So it's one thing to be down today, which I assure
you I am, but in terms of where we have to be as we move into a
great new building, I think we're exactly where we need to be, and
next year we will be at or near the top of the league.''

<P>
   TAKIUKUM, Mexico _ In an obscure village in southern Mexico,
Manuel Gomez proudly shows guests horse manure spread beneath a
tangle of vines on his modest coffee farm.
</P>
<P>
   Manure, ironically, is offering a healthier and more prosperous
life to this Mayan Indian farmer, who uses it to fertilize organic
coffee he grows for consumers tens of thousands of miles from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   In Takiukum (pronounced, ``Ta-kee-a-KOOM'') and other isolated
hamlets nestled in the hills of politically-troubled Chiapas state,
more and more subsistence farmers are growing organic coffee for
export, which provides them with about 80 percent of their cash
income.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by foreign buyers who deal directly with them instead of
middlemen, the Indians are tapping into the taste buds of voracious
American coffee drinkers and receiving a much better price for
their gourmet crop than prevailing world market rates.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' organic coffee is ending up as brew or beans found
in American and European cafes, health food stores, grocery chains
and specialty shops from Germany to Atlanta, Ga., from Italy to
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez and about 1,300 other Indian farmers belong to Union
Majomut (pronounced, ``Ma-ho-MOOT''), a cooperative whose name
means ``place of birds'' in a Mayan dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream is to make our members self-sufficient, with all
their crops organic,'' said Gilberto Aguilar, an agronomist who has
been working with Union Majomut for years in this lushly beautiful
but desperately poor part of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This quiet revolution is facing difficult challenges, however.
</P>
<P>
   Union Majomut's growers live in the middle of a virtual war
zone, where Zapatista Indian rebels and the Mexican military have
been locked in an uneasy truce since an armed uprising in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   All travelers in this area are stopped at military roadblocks
and divided Indian communities teeter on the edge of political
violence. In December 1997, anti-Zapatista vigilantes massacred 45
people -- including children in a church -- in the village of
Acteal, one of Union Majomut's member towns.
</P>
<P>
   Acteal's producers lost their entire crop that year because they
fled the village or were terrified to venture into their parcels to
harvest beans.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict still hinders production. Last year it cost the
union more than 50 percent of its anticipated yield, Aguilar said.
But the union continues to convert members by staying neutral and
working with farmers on both sides of the political divide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 80 members were organic growers. Today, 700 out of
1,300 are growing coffee by certified organic means. The remaining
600 members are making the transition, Aguilar said, which requires
not applying chemicals and complying with other norms for at least
three years before certification.
</P>
<P>
   Although this area is remote and many Indians speak limited
Spanish, pesticide companies advertise heavily here, threatening
Union Majomut's investment, Aguilar added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a serious problem with the International Red Cross
after the Acteal massacre,'' he said. ``They arrived here and
passed out free packages of agro-chemicals, putting in jeopardy all
our years of hard work. We had to meet with them and ask them not
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, the Mexican government was pushing
pesticides here, Aguilar said, and Indians who couldn't read
instructions were poisoning themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar and other agronomists worked village by village to win
the Indians' confidence and persuade them to try organic methods.
</P>
<P>
   They also teamed up with international partners who want to give
the Indians a fair price for their labor, Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   One such buyer is Equal Exchange, a Canton, Mass.-based business
that buys coffee only from growers who farm small plots of about
two acres in Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the turmoil in Chiapas, we wanted to find a way to
work with communities in need there,'' said Equal Exchange
marketing director Erbin Crowell.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee growers are always on the brink of disaster because
coffee prices fluctuate wildly. This year they've swung between $1
and $1.20 a pound, but Equal Exchange pays a guaranteed price of
$1.26 a pound, plus 15 cents for an organic premium.
</P>
<P>
   After the Acteal massacre, Equal Exchange raised $13,000 for
victims' families and refugees and gave it to Union Majomut to
distribute.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers growers up to 60 percent credit in
advance on its contracts, something Mexican banks won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Exchange roasts coffee from its Mexican buyers and sells
it under the brands Organic Cafe Mexico, Organic Mind, Body and
Soul, and other names.
</P>
<P>
   Union Majomut's coffee can be found, among other places, at
Shaw's Supermarket chain in New England, Rainbow Grocery stores in
California, the Wheatsville Food Co-op in Austin, Texas, and the
Ten Thousand Villages shop in Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Churches, too, buy the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much organic coffee is produced currently in
Mexico, said Roberto Giesemann, president of High Quality Coffees
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The organic yield could still be as low as 1 percent of Mexico's
total coffee production. But there is room for growth in Chiapas,
where the Mayan Indians' culture lends itself to organizing
cooperatives that can police growing methods and produce bulk
quantities, Giesemann said.
</P>
<P>
   It is critical, however, that the Indians maintain contact with
foreign companies willing to pay premiums and offer credit,
Giesemann added.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In broken Spanish, Manuel Gomez explains how the organic coffee
he's grown since 1991 has helped his family, which lives in a
simple wood house with no running water 26 miles from San Cristobal
de las Casas, the nearest city.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's coffee plants are hard to spot on a slope behind his
house because they are tucked under trees producing avocados,
oranges and exotic fruits he can only identify in his Mayan
dialect. Vegetables the family relies on grow under a canopy of
trees alive with the song of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The trees provide the coffee plants the right amount of shade
they need to produce robust, flavorful beans of a higher quality
than those produced by rows of unprotected plants often seen on
large plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Careful terracing prevents soil erosion in this hilly area
during pounding summer rains.
</P>
<P>
   Because farmers like can't use chemicals and are required to mix
in other trees and plants among the coffee, these farms provide
another benefit: they are refuges for birds that are fast losing
habitat as Mexican forest is cut down, said Russell Greenberg,
president of the Smithsonian Institution Migratory Bird Center in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farms in Chiapas have the second highest diversity of
birds in that area,'' Greenberg said, ``second only to natural
tropical forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez used to migrate to pick coffee on Chiapas' large coffee
plantations, where he earned pennies after weeks of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   He's still poor, but now he can afford to buy a watch, tennis
shoes, saddles and tools while growing enough food for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers like Manuel,'' said Aguilar, ``have fruits to show
for the investment they've been given.''

<P>
   TAKIUKUM, Mexico _ In an obscure village in southern Mexico,
Manuel Gomez proudly shows guests horse manure spread beneath a
tangle of vines on his modest coffee farm.
</P>
<P>
   Manure, ironically, is offering a healthier and more prosperous
life to this Mayan Indian farmer, who uses it to fertilize organic
coffee he grows for consumers tens of thousands of miles from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   In Takiukum (pronounced, ``Ta-kee-a-KOOM'') and other isolated
hamlets nestled in the hills of politically-troubled Chiapas state,
more and more subsistence farmers are growing organic coffee for
export, which provides them with about 80 percent of their cash
income.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by foreign buyers who deal directly with them instead of
middlemen, the Indians are tapping into the taste buds of voracious
American coffee drinkers and receiving a much better price for
their gourmet crop than prevailing world market rates.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' organic coffee is ending up as brew or beans found
in American and European cafes, health food stores, grocery chains
and specialty shops from Germany to Atlanta, Ga., from Italy to
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez and about 1,300 other Indian farmers belong to Union
Majomut (pronounced, ``Ma-ho-MOOT''), a cooperative whose name
means ``place of birds'' in a Mayan dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream is to make our members self-sufficient, with all
their crops organic,'' said Gilberto Aguilar, an agronomist who has
been working with Union Majomut for years in this lushly beautiful
but desperately poor part of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This quiet revolution is facing difficult challenges, however.
</P>
<P>
   Union Majomut's growers live in the middle of a virtual war
zone, where Zapatista Indian rebels and the Mexican military have
been locked in an uneasy truce since an armed uprising in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   All travelers in this area are stopped at military roadblocks
and divided Indian communities teeter on the edge of political
violence. In December 1997, anti-Zapatista vigilantes massacred 45
people -- including children in a church -- in the village of
Acteal, one of Union Majomut's member towns.
</P>
<P>
   Acteal's producers lost their entire crop that year because they
fled the village or were terrified to venture into their parcels to
harvest beans.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict still hinders production. Last year it cost the
union more than 50 percent of its anticipated yield, Aguilar said.
But the union continues to convert members by staying neutral and
working with farmers on both sides of the political divide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 80 members were organic growers. Today, 700 out of
1,300 are growing coffee by certified organic means. The remaining
600 members are making the transition, Aguilar said, which requires
not applying chemicals and complying with other norms for at least
three years before certification.
</P>
<P>
   Although this area is remote and many Indians speak limited
Spanish, pesticide companies advertise heavily here, threatening
Union Majomut's investment, Aguilar added.

<P>
   BURREL, Albania _ Agim Kaziu, a 63-year-old businessman in this
remote, poor mountain village, looks as if he has seen a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's just an American sitting big as life across the table
at a dusty roadside cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Kaziu is moved to pause from his lunch of lamb and potatoes to
mark the moment with an elaborate wave of his fork. ``If someone
had told me 10 years ago that there would be Americans in my
village, I would have said, 'Yes and maybe the man in the moon will
pay us a visit, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Kaziu would have been putting it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, communist dictator Enver Hoxha made Albania
perhaps the world's most isolated country. Hoxha told his people
that Americans -- not to mention most foreigners -- were their
mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   It is a changed world -- especially since the Kosovo crisis.
While Americans still are rare in remote areas, young people in the
bustling capital, Tirana, like to wear clothes with American themes
-- the Chicago Bulls are particularly big -- and it is hard to go
without feeling a rumbling rap music bass.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of communism many Albanians have come to
view the United States as the best hope their tiny Balkan nation
has to become a healthy, stable -- the word often used is
``normal'' -- country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look to America, which is the only country with a realistic
view of Albania,'' said Vladimir Prela, a journalist and writer
from Tirana. ``The United States is the only reliable ally we have.
This is our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians have been impressed by the consistent no-compromise
message coming from Washington on the NATO bombing campaign against
Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia. This is in
sharp contrast to the vacillations of Italy, Germany, and Greece
and to some extent, France.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, the war in Yugoslavia is regarded by many
here as just what the doctor ordered for Albania, some officials
say. A year ago, it would have been hard to imagine seeing Pandeli
Majko, Albania's boyish-looking primer minister, being interviewed
live on CNN or holding a joint news conference with NATO's
Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Albania's most visible presence in the United
States was as the country in the hit film ``Wag the Dog'' that
seemed obscure enough to make it the perfect place to stage an
imaginary war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Albania is on the world's agenda,'' said Taulant Dedja,
the deputy minister of local government. ``This presents us with
really a great opportunity. Potentially, there is a greater
possibility of getting economic aid and moving closer to the West
-- particularly America, which has a great interest in Albania and
is our guarantor of stability in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While Macedonia's leaders have been half-hearted in their
support for NATO's using the country as a staging area for a
potential push into Yugoslavia's embattled Kosovo province,
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani has placed all his country's
assets at NATO's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the United States and NATO have been allowed to set
up a base to house the 24 Apache attack helicopters and 5,000
support troops that make up Task Force Hawk, which would be the
``tip of the spear'' of any ground force going into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this is the problem with Albania: The country is willing,
but its assets are weak.
</P>
<P>
   At first look, Albania seems dreadfully poor place with few
prospects for improvement. On further inspection, it is far worse
than it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Its ancient roads, bridges and sewer systems are in utter
disrepair. Driving on a smooth surface is a rare experience to be
found mainly in the capital. Many crumbling bridges are unsafe, and
the government has closed a few simply by blocking them with
concrete rubble. Billions of dollars in new infrastructure are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine a worse place to put 450,000 poor
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians worry the refugee crisis could push the country
to anarchy. In the decades since the communists lost power, the
country has endured occasional spells of chaos and always seems on
the verge of another.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems calm now, there are pressures from the refugee
influx roiling beneath the surface, said Genc Ruli, the president
of the Institute of Contemporary Studies. ``We're talking about a
sudden population increase of 15 percent for a country that is
barely functioning,'' Ruli said.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of refugees eventually will spark inflation, while
reducing stocks of basic commodities -- clean water is in short
supply -- an age-old cocktail for civic disorder. ``This relative
stability we see now is fragile and temporary,'' Ruli said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Albania's problem comes from being isolated so long and
then having no patron country to provide basic training when
democracy and a free market arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no stable cradle for the democratic
institutions to develop,'' said Ylli Pango(CQ both), a psychology
professor here who has written a book for Albanians about the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pango and others believe Western powers abandoned Albania at its
most fragile moment. ``It was crazy, really, for the West to allow
Albania to go without any help,'' said Pango, also a former deputy
minister of education. ``In terms of history, I think it was one of
the biggest mistakes. Now we think that it is clear that Albania
cannot succeed alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here lately have been carrying articles pondering the
idea of Albania's becoming an American protectorate, to become a
ward of the great distant democratic uncle.
</P>
<P>
   While it is nearly unthinkable that the United States would go
so far as to assume such a role with Albania, there are clear signs
the countries are becoming closer.
</P>
<P>
   What one Western official described as a ``hidden protectorate''
is evolving with the United States and European Union members
providing advisors to guide Albanian government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration is moving quickly to replace the very
popular ambassador, Marisa Lino, who resigned last year. Earlier
this month President Clinton nominated Joseph Limprecht, a veteran

   With Clinton so near to the end of his term, this quick action
is seen here as a signal that Washington has come to regard Albania
with great importance.

   ``The Americans know that they now have a very keen interest in
Albania,'' Dedja said. ``Our futures are now joined.''

   WASHINGTON _ Suppose you drive around during the work week in a
sleek new Lexus but have to scale back to a clunky old compact on
weekends. Wouldn't it be nice if you could persuade the boss to let
you take the company Lexus home as well?
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays we often get a similar deal whenever we go online. A
huge slice of corporate America has invested in high-speed Internet
access for its office workers, suppliers and customers. But for
families with personal computers and modem connections, the glories
of World Wide Web all too often succumb to the frustrating World
Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 100,000 or so U.S. households currently linked
to what's known in the trade as broadband services _ either cable
``modems'' or digital subscriber phone lines from the Baby Bells _
enjoy life in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   They can download in 20 seconds what might normally take 20
minutes with a standard link. They can watch a live BBC newscast or
even a movie without settling for the choppy images of a flick from
the early 1920s. They can listen to Internet-fed CD-quality music
on their stereos.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years' time, such fast networks could become widely
available at a price of about $30 a month, thereby blazing trails
to interactive electronic commerce, two-way long-distance learning,
powerful telemedical tools, and, most probably, enhanced
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   If and when such broadband services kick in, broadcast networks
and cable television outlets could be stuck with the type of
obsolete business model that undid the once thriving typewriter
trade in the 1980s, when word processing moved over to PCs and
printers.
</P>
<P>
   But such change could be slow in coming. Only about a third of
U.S. homes are hooked into cyberspace. And while 90 percent of
schools have Internet access, studies show that most teachers still
don't use computers, let alone the Internet, in their lesson
planning or teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as more Web sites become ``tuned'' to broadband, the
long-predicted convergence between PCs and TV could finally become
a reality. If that happens, the computing world will change
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Already, along yet another digital frontier, two-way portable
devices are taking over from desktop and laptop machines. A
Canadian-built unit that hooks to my belt weighs only four ounces,
including a durable AA battery. With the aid of a PC-style keypad,
it supports a 1,000-entry address book, sends and receives E-mail
messages of up to 1,600 words and effortlessly handles
text-to-voice and text-to-fax transmissions. Like a pager, it beeps
or vibrates when E-mail or faxed messages arrive.
</P>
<P>
   With this $360 device in hand, anyone can call an toll-free
number, dedicated exclusively to a single user, and dictate a
detailed message to an operator. Or a user could startle someone by
tapping out a poem by, say, Edgar Allen Poe and having a deep
synthesized voice automatically read the poetry back to whomever
answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In today's communications casbah, the offerings are becoming
faster, smaller and easier to use than only a few years ago. The
new century promises even more profound change.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After the Cold War, many expected that the world would
enter an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Those who live
in developed nations might think this is the case today, with the
possible exception of the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Carter Center we monitor all serious conflicts in the
world, and the reality is that the number of such wars has
increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the United Nations was designed to deal with
international conflicts, and almost all the current ones are civil
wars in developing countries. This creates a peacemaking vacuum
that is most often filled by powerful nations that concentrate
their attention on conflicts that affect them, like those in Iraq,
Bosnia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   While the war in Kosovo rages and dominates the world's
headlines, even more destructive conflicts in developing nations
are systematically ignored by the United States and other powerful
nations.
</P>
<P>
   One can traverse Africa, from the Red Sea in the northeast to
the southwestern Atlantic coast, and never step on peaceful
territory. Fifty thousand people have recently perished in the war
between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and almost 2 million have died during
the 16-year conflict in neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   That war has now spilled into northern Uganda, whose troops have
joined those from Rwanda to fight in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (formerly Zaire). The other Congo (Brazzaville) is also
ravaged by civil war, and all attempts to bring peace to Angola
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Although formidable commitments are being made in the Balkans,
where white Europeans are involved, no such concerted efforts are
being made by leaders outside of Africa to resolve the disputes.
This gives the strong impression of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its dominant role in the U.N. Security Council and
NATO, the United States tends to orchestrate global peacemaking.
Unfortunately, many of these efforts are seriously flawed. We have
become increasingly inclined to sidestep the time-tested premises
of negotiation, which in most cases prevent deterioration of a bad
situation and at least offer the prospect of a bloodless solution.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive leaders can best be induced by the simultaneous threat
of consequences and the promise of reward _ at least legitimacy
within the international community.
</P>
<P>
   The approach the United States has taken recently has been to
devise a solution that best suits its own purposes, recruit at
least tacit support in whichever forum it can best influence,
provide the dominant military force, present an ultimatum to
recalcitrant parties and then take punitive action against the
entire nation to force compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The often tragic result of this final decision is that already
oppressed citizens suffer, while the oppressor may feel free of
further consequences if he perpetrates even worse crimes. Through
control of the news media, he is often made to seem heroic by
defending his homeland against foreign aggression and shifting
blame for economic or political woes away from himself.
</P>
<P>
   Our general purposes are admirable: to enhance peace, freedom,
democracy, human rights and economic progress. But this flawed
approach is now causing unwarranted suffering and strengthening
unsavory regimes in several countries, including Sudan, Cuba, Iraq
and _ the most troubling example _ Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   There, the international community has admirable goals of
protecting the rights of Kosovars and ending the brutal policies of
Slobodan Milosevic. But the decision to attack the entire nation
has been counterproductive, and our destruction of civilian life
has now become senseless and excessively brutal. There is little
indication of success after more than 25,000 sorties and 14,000
missiles and bombs, 4,000 of which were not precision guided.
</P>
<P>
   The expected few days of aerial attacks have now lengthened into
months, while more than a million Kosovars have been forced from
their homes, many never to return even under the best of
circumstances. As the American-led force has expanded targets to
inhabited areas and resorted to the use of anti-personnel cluster
bombs, the result has been damage to hospitals, offices and
residences of a half-dozen ambassadors, and the killing of hundreds
of innocent civilians and an untold number of conscripted troops.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on Serbian military forces, missiles and
bombs are now concentrating on the destruction of bridges,
railways, roads, electric power, and fuel and fresh water supplies.
Serbian citizens report that they are living like cavemen, and
their torment increases daily.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that we must save face but cannot change what has
already been done, NATO leaders now have three basic choices: to
continue bombing ever more targets until Yugoslavia (including
Kosovo and Montenegro) is almost totally destroyed, to rely on
Russia to resolve our dilemma through indirect diplomacy, or to
accept American casualties by sending military forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we are following the first, and worst, option _ and seem
to be moving toward including the third. Despite earlier denials by
American and other leaders, the recent decision to deploy a
military force of 50,000 troops on the Kosovo border confirms that
the use of ground troops will be necessary to assure the return of
expelled Albanians to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   How did we end up in this quagmire? We have ignored some basic
principles that should be applied to the prevention or resolution
of all conflicts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sort-circuiting the long-established principles of patient
negotiation leads to war, not peace.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bypassing the Security Council weakens the United Nations and
often alienates permanent members who may be helpful in influencing
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ The exclusion of nongovernmental organizations from
peacemaking precludes vital ``second track'' opportunities for
resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignoring serious conflicts in Africa and other underdeveloped
regions deprives these people of justice and equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even the most severe military or economic punishment of
oppressed citizens is unlikely to force their oppressors to yield
to American demands.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States' insistence on the use of cluster bombs,
designed to kill or maim humans, is condemned almost universally
and brings discredit on our nation (as does our refusal to support
a ban on land mines).
</P>
<P>
   Even for the world's only superpower, the ends don't always
justify the means.

   Fat, huge and biologically different, bluefin tuna are the most
sought-after fish in the ocean. Soon scientists may be able to tell
us if they're too sought after. Both scientists and fishermen are
in hot pursuit of the bluefin tuna, an unusual fish that can be
sold in Tokyo for as much as $20,000 each.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>

<P>
   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A field of honor
 &HT;    For release May 29, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tunisia _ Here, a short distance from the remains of
the Carthage that was destroyed by the Romans in the Punic Wars
more than 2,000 years ago, lie 2,841 of our own war dead, those
never came home from World War II, those whose sacrifices we recall
this Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, most relatives will not be here to place
flowers against the headstones as so many are doing in cemeteries
across the United States. But the men and women enshrined in the
North Africa American Cemetery have been well cared-for by a loving
country.
</P>
<P>
   The rows of crosses and stars of David spread for 27 acres
across land that once was Roman Carthage, the air around it exuding
centuries of history, of war, of carnage, of remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   Here lies a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and three sets
of brothers buried side by side. And here lies Celia Goldberg,
Private, Women's Army Corps, who died on Aug. 29, 1943.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be drawn to Pvt. Goldberg's grave. Her star of
David tombstone interrupts an otherwise geometric array of crosses
that dominates her section near the entrance. That she was a woman
also distinguishes her.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing at the cemetery that tells how she died, or
where it happened. At the time of her death, the fighting in North
Africa had ended. The Allies already had taken Sicily and were into
Italy. But this field of honor is not limited to North African
campaign dead; many from the fighting in Sicily and Italy also are
here.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of loss for any American entering these
hallowed grounds. As you wander through the rows of headstones, you
touch your fingers to your lips either in homage or shock _ I never
can comprehend which emotion it is _ and wonder how they would have
been had they lived, how many children they would have had, how
many would have been teachers or bankers, athletes or clergy,
mothers or fathers and, now, grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   I remain drawn to Celia because there are so few women among
these martyrs. She was from New York, the headstone says. Her age
is not given but, like so many who answered the call in those days,
she likely was unmarried, likely had not yet had a real serious
romance. She was someone's daughter who never lived to have her own
children, to take them to dance recitals or Little League games, to
see them married and have children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   That is the sacrifice Celia and all those others made on our
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever caused her death in 1943 _ bullets, grenades, perhaps
an illness _ deprived Celia of her right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, so that we may have ours.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of a cemetery holding our honored war dead being
in such close proximity to what was Carthage is evident. This is
where one of the world's first great civilizations flourished, only
to be picked apart and destroyed from without, by centuries of
invading armies: the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Phoenicians,
Romans, the Vandals and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage is a lesson to world history; a civilization more
interested in trade and discourse than in conquest devoured by
those who would have it the other way. Centuries later, the
Americans resting nearby fought the same battle that did the
Carthaginians. They may have lost their lives in doing it but they
won the war, repulsing the conquerors and subjugators.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we pause to remember them, we need also to recall their
mission.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

   1. A GAME BOY IN THE CROSS HAIRS One month after the Columbine
HIgh School shootings, another such nightmare occurred in Conyers,
Ga. Are we learning anything about what causes such violence and
how to end it? If videogames such as Doom and Quake have anything
to do with it, the possibility hasn't affected the makers much.
They are still working away to produce the bloodiest, most
weapon-laden participatory ``shooter'' games ever. By Paul Keegan.
From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (5,000 words) +
edited article available. 2. BEDLAM ON THE STREETS Increasingly,
the mentally ill have nowhere to go. That's their problem - and
ours. Especially in cases such as that of Andrew Goldstein, who
pushed a young woman to her death in front of a New York subway
train in January. A seriously mentally ill man, he repeatedly
attacked strangers, repeatedly volunteered himself for
hospitalization and repeatedly was discharged. As in many other
cases, he was left to the open streets and still the state of
America's shattered mental-health system all but assures such
calamities. By Michael Winerip. From The New York Times Magazine.

GOSPEL
</P>
<P>
   OF MATTHEW Biblical critics have offered many theories that
challenge the credibility of the gospels and the events described
in the New Testament. But now, out of the catacombs of history,
comes new information that will startle sceptics and make the heart
of believers rejoice. By Neil Altman. 2,500 words. 4. HAVE WE
FORGOTTEN THE PATH TO PEACE? Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of
the United States, who is now chairman of the non-profit Carter
Centre, writes that negotiation is an art we seem to have
forgotten, not only in the warlike approach to resolving ethnic
conflict in Kosovo, but also in our efforts to deal with other
flashpoints around the world. New York Times Op-Ed. 800 words. 5.
ENGLAND DESERVES THANKS FOR CARING. For all the anti-welfare
rigours of Thatcherism and planned constraints of Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Third Way, Britain still can offer remarkably kind,
effective care to those who are suffering. It makes an enormous
difference. To those who become aware of it, it colours a whole
society with a glow of warmth and decency. Flora Lewis writes
movingly of her daughter's death and the hospice care in Britain.
800 words. 6. LOW-DOSE HORMONE TREATMENTS LINKED TO UTERINE CANCER
Hot flashes and night sweats are some of the most bothersome
symptoms that affect women early in menopause. For these symptoms,
many women take the hormone estrogen. Although the higher potency
estrogen treatments are known to increase the risk of uterine
cancer, it has been widely believed that the low-potency treatments
are safe. But a study in this week's Lancet suggests that
low-potency estrogen use can also substantially increase a woman's
chance of developing uterine cancer. By Michael McCarthy. The
Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.

GIRL, 14, IS FOUND HANGED IN A BRONX SCHOOL BATHROOM STALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 14-year-old girl was found hanged with a
clothesline in a bathroom stall at a Bronx high school on Wednesday
in what officials said appeared to be a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A student discovered the body of Anna Perez at 9:25 a.m. in a
third-floor girl's bathroom at Herbert H. Lehman High School,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The student alerted school officials, who tried to revive the
girl with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but Anna was pronounced
dead on arrival at Jacobi Medical Center, a school board spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   A poem or rap about death was scrawled on one of the bathroom
stalls, and investigators were trying to determine whether Anna
wrote it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Anna's death was not immediately declared a suicide, pending an
autopsy by the City Medical Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The incident shocked the school of about 4,000 students. Grief
counselors were on hand in the library and in the guidance office
to help students. Many students milled outside the three-story,
red-brick building, some crying, others holding prayer vigils in a
nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' said Stephanie Belloni, 15, a freshman who
said she was a friend of Anna's. ``No one expected anything like
this, even though a lot of people wouldn't speak to her. They
sometimes called her names. They never really gave her a chance.
She was a smart, sweet, caring and intelligent girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students described Anna as a loner and an outcast. Some
said that she rarely came to school and that when she did, she left
early. Close friends said she was smarting over a recent breakup
with a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors on the quiet residential block where she lived with
her mother and an older brother refused to talk about her. No one
answered the door of the two-family, red-brick house where the
family lives.
</P>
<P>
   Details about events leading up to Anna's death were sketchy,
but the police said she attended her first-period class, which
started about 8:30. She was found during the school's second
period. Friends, acquaintances and school officials gave
conflicting accounts about her disposition Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She was spotted in the cafeteria about 8 a.m., just before first
period, chatting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was her regular perky self,'' said Jacqueline Figuero, 18,
a senior. ``She told me it was going to be her last day of school.
I asked if she was going on an early vacation and she said,
`Something like that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna had a lot of problems at home,'' Jacqueline added.
``School was the only place she would come to get away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Autry, 17, a junior, lashed out at students who
regarded Anna as an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope all the people who harassed her feel sorry now,'' she
said. ``People made fun of her. Sometimes she was beaten up by
other kids. She used to come speak to me about her problems. I told
her to take it day-by-day.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other friends, including 16-year-old Lucy Oppenheimer,
said there were signs that Anna was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked about killing herself,'' she said. ``I didn't think
she would do it. She had problems at home. She had a boyfriend who
broke up with her. A lot of kids didn't like her.''

 &HT;    While rest of economy booms, jobs inside academia are scarce
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Many of this spring's college graduates are
leaving academia pondering multiple job offers, a bounty of today's
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Luke Keller, who wants to teach astronomy to undergraduates,
knows he'll have a tougher time when he finishes his studies at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get a teaching position,'' said Keller,
who hopes to graduate in August. ``You can't assume that you're
going to be a professor.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Keller, many graduate students who want to return to
academia as tenure-track professors are finding few job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job market's very tight,'' said Rick Cherwitz, a professor
of speech communication and associate dean of graduate studies at
UT. ``That's why we created the Professional Development Program _
to increase the odds for graduate students to find non-academic
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The development program, which is designed to help graduate
students acquire skills not normally associated with the Ivory
Tower, was created by a partnership of UT's Office of Graduate
Studies, the provost's office and the Center for Teaching
Effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a pilot project with three summer courses in 1996
is now a year-round curriculum of 13 classes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 students studying 80 disciplines now take classes
such as Academic and Professional Consulting and Entrepreneurship.
Keller, who is studying for his Ph.D. in astronomy, said the
classes helped him learn how to sell his astronomy skills.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Keller couldn't find a teaching position. So, like many
doctoral students, he accepted a postdoctoral research job _ sort
of a ``holding pattern'' internship for graduate students, he
explained _ at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people that there is no logical reason why they
shouldn't have gotten (teaching) jobs long ago, except that there
are no jobs,'' Keller said. ``They're taking three and four
postdocs.''
</P>
<P>
   Universities around the nation awarded 42,705 doctorate degrees
in 1997 _ a record number for the 12th consecutive year, according
to a University of Chicago survey. That's 10 percent more than 1992
and 32 percent more than 1987. UT, which issued 787 doctorate
degrees in 1997, graduates more doctoral students than any other
university in the nation, the survey reported.
</P>
<P>
   With only about 30 to 40 tenure-track positions open in his
field nationally each year, Marty Meersman, who will receive his
master's degree in fine arts, said he feels fortunate to have found
a teaching position. He beat out about 150 other candidates and
will start teaching sculpture at Moorhead State College in
Moorhead, Minn., in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the type of person to not worry about the
future if I work really hard and am ambitious,'' Meersman said. ``I
want to teach because I love the reciprocal exchange of energy and
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other graduate students are putting teaching plans on hold
and pursuing non-traditional employment.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fiske, a scientist for Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California, said many graduate students are
benefiting in unintended ways from the lack of teaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant fraction of the Ph.D.'s in the sciences
genuinely find themselves less interested in academia than they are
in other fields,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, who received his doctorate degree in geology from
Stanford University in 1994, said he found the job market confusing
after graduation. So he wrote ``To Boldly Go ... ,'' a career guide
for new graduates. He also writes a Web-based column for young
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academia will learn that it will be stronger when its
intellectual children are pursuing a broad range of fields: in
government, in high schools, in business,'' he said.

 &HT;    A list of minor annoyances in the modern age
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGODOCHES, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Things that annoy me:
</P>
<P>
   _ Loud music piped outside at convenience stores as you pump
gas, especially when it's interspersed with canned commercials for
the establishment in question. I guess this is supposed to make one
more upbeat about buying gasoline, which is always a miserable
task. No matter what, I cannot get excited about buying gasoline,
though it's a necessity like food and water. But at least one gets
some satisfaction from consuming food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   _ I don't understand the point of playing commercials for the
store outside when you're already at the store. And the loud music
gets on my nerves. The world has gotten much too noisy, in my
opinion. It's as if we cannot stand the sound of silence anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nose rings. And eyebrow rings. If the good Lord had intended
people to pierce those parts of the body he would have made noses
and eyebrows look like earlobes. It just looks unhealthy to me. I
have nothing against earrings on either gender and am intrigued by
belly button rings on women, though it looks like that would hurt,
too. But my nightmare experience is buying gas at a store that
plays golden oldies at the decibel equivalent of a F-15 breaking
the sound barrier, and then having my money taken by a clerk whose
face has been punctured by any number of rings and studs in the
nose and eyebrow. And don't get me started on tongue studs.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I'm getting old.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who drive below the speed limit while sticking to the
left lane. I do not exceed the speed limit on the highway. I
learned my lesson the hard way after getting too many speeding
tickets. But I will drive as fast as the law allows. There is a
certain group of people who insist on moping along at 50 mph in the
left lane, forcing you to pass on the right, which is riskier and
actually illegal in some states. I do not understand the attraction
to the left lane if one does not intend to turn left sometime in
the next millennium or so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Magazine sweepstakes. I am a gambler, albeit a cheap one. I
buy Lotto tickets, play blackjack a few times a year at the boats,
and love to wager $2 on the ponies. This is not a moral issue with
me. I used to enter magazine sweepstakes faithfully, but they have
gotten too complicated. You have to put the gold sticker here, the
red star there, the blue dot on the back. Then, a few weeks later,
after you bought a magazine subscription to Auger Tips and
Techniques to improve the chances of winning, you get yet another
solicitation and are asked to go through the whole complicated
process again. Now I chunk them all in the trash. I realize this
means Ed McMahon will never come knocking on my door while I'm
taking a shower, but I'm willing to make the sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children in television commercials. This is an alarming trend.
I'm not talking about genuine child actors, like the rugrats in the
Oscar Meyer wiener spots. They're professionals, trained from birth
by stage moms hoping to ride their child's fame to riches. I'm
talking about small-business owners who decide to put Bubba Joe in
a commercial _ even though Bubba Joe, who may be cute as a button,
can't speak the Queen's English well enough to be understood _
except maybe by his grandparents. Why would a gap-toothed kid who
can't follow a Tele-Prompter or pronounce three-syllable words
persuade me to buy a tire, furniture, car or other commodities just
because he's cute? I'm not persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   _ Safety caps and seals. I bought a bottle of water the other
day. It had a plastic cap to shield the pull-up spout, which is
fine by me. I don't want someone sneaking a slug of water and
putting it back on the shelf. But it also had a seal beneath the
cap, which meant I had to pry the hard cap off, then unscrew the
pull-up spout to tear off the seal, then screw the cap back on. In
the process, being terminally clumsy, I spilled a nice load of
water on my crotch and had to drive around a while letting my pants
dry before I could go back out in public. One seal is enough. I'm
willing to take my chances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, what annoys me the most is people who complain about
what annoys them...

 &HT;    So, how was your day?
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Next time you think you're having a bad day,
recall these blunders, courtesy of the miracle of e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon
Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two
of the most expensively saved animals were released back into the
wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later they
were both eaten by a killer whale.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1992, Frank Perkins of Los Angeles made an attempt on the
world flagpole-sitting record. Suffering from the flu he came down
eight hours short of the 400 day record, his sponsor had gone bust,
his girlfriend had left him and his phone and electricity had been
cut off.
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist
toward the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the
deadly current she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the
back door, breaking his arm in two places. Until that moment, he
had been happily listening to his Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two animal rights protesters were protesting the cruelty of
sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn, Germany. Suddenly the
pigs, all 2,000 of them, escaped through a broken fence and
stampeded, trampling the two hapless protesters to death.
</P>
<P>
   And the capper...
</P>
<P>
   _ Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a
letter bomb. It came back with ``return to sender'' stamped on it.
Forgetting it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.

 &HT;    Cornyn, Morales &AMP; Murr's three-ring circus
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just when you think the trade of accusations
between John Cornyn and Dan Morales can't get any weirder, it does.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the current attorney general said he had no evidence
that the former attorney general had benefitted personally from a
contract Houston lawyer Marc Murr says entitles him to a share of
the attorneys' fees in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Cornyn was leveling allegations of fraud against
Morales, saying the former attorney general fabricated the contract
so his friend Murr could pursue a claim of $260 million. That claim
has since been down sized to a mere $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of head scratchers around here, but this one
trumps them all.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about this makes much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Question: If Cornyn has no evidence that Morales benefited
personally from the deal, then why did he air all that talk about
civil fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Question: If Murr really believes he is entitled to $260
million, why is he backing off to the tune of $259 million?
</P>
<P>
   I can give you a West Texas guarantee that if I thought I had
$260 million coming, it would take the 101st Airborne Division to
make me back off. And then I'd want to give them some lip.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious implication of the earlier innuendoes was that Murr
and Morales somehow were to split the $260 million. We might as
well say it, that's what people were thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Question: If two people, especially Ivy League lawyers, enter
into such a conspiracy implied by Cornyn, don't you think they
would be more careful than to perform a sloppy cut and paste job on
the contract?
</P>
<P>
   Think like a crook for a minute. If you and I were to enter into
a kickback agreement, why would you agree to take the full IRS ride
on the money we're cutting up? And how would I be assured that you
were going to live up to your end of the agreement once the check
is in your hands? If you tell me to buzz off, what I am going to
do? Call the cops?
</P>
<P>
   Question: Given the latest half turn, wasn't it the height or
irresponsibility for Cornyn to toss around words like ``fraud'' if
he had no evidence that Morales benefited personally?
</P>
<P>
   Morales has stoutly and consistently denied any wrongdoing and
maintained that the accusations are politically inspired. That
explanation by itself won't resolve the doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in the bull's-eye usually holler politics. Sometimes
they're even right.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anybody about this situation and you'll most likely get
shrugged shoulders as a response. Texans are entitled to better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Texans are entitled to know the truth about the matter. Last
week, I suggested that the allegations and implications of those
allegations were serious enough to warrant a separate, independent
inquiry into the situation. I suggested then that a court of
inquiry be convened to look into the matter and look at it in the
open.
</P>
<P>
   Candidly, I don't expect a judge to leap into this morass
willingly, but Texans are entitled to know the truth. Something is
seriously wrong here, and citizens are entitled to explanations.
</P>
<P>
   A court of inquiry would be one way of getting to them.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and lawyer I respect suggested that a court of inquiry
would turn into a circus.
</P>
<P>
   That may be, but the difference between a circus and this show
we're watching now is that no one is selling popcorn and lemonade.

 &HT;    Point of order can be bill's demise
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two years ago, Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth knocked
down 52 bills in what came to be known as the Memorial Day
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The chairman of the Calendars Committee neglected to
say out loud that the meeting at which the bills were set for
debate would be in the Speaker's Committee Room off the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlgemuth (R-Burleson) was retaliating to a similar legislative
move by Rep. Debra Danburg (D-Houston) in killing a bill on
parental notification on abortion. Danburg had noted that the
witnesses at a public hearing on the notification bill were
incorrectly identified.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative device Wohlgemuth and Danburg used is called a
``point of order.'' Such points are allegations that a bill, on its
way through the legislative maze to the floor, violated the House
rules designed to keep government open and aboveboard.
</P>
<P>
   Points of order are aimed at killing or delaying a bills. Some
points are duds, ruled invalid by the House speaker. But others are
deadly.
</P>
<P>
   They are seldom used in the smaller, clubbier 31-member Senate,
where senators can hold up a bill in committee for 48 hours if it
has not had a public hearing by ``tagging'' it or by talking it to
death with a filibuster. Because Senate tradition demands a
two-thirds vote in the first place to bring up a bill, points of
order are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Sen. Mario Gallegos (D-Houston), a former House
member, raised a point of order two years ago that killed an
annexation bill sponsored by Sen. Jon Lindsey (R-Houston), Lindsey
derisively called it ``a rinky-dink House ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't call points of order in the Senate,'' Lindsey
declared with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 150-member House, points of order are such effective
devices late in the session that some legislators have developed
reputations as accurate and often deadly snipers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most feared rules experts are Democrat Ron Wilson of
Houston and Republican Warren Chisum of Pampa.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, now in his 23rd year in the House, is feared like a hit
man when he approaches the House's back microphone, often wearing
his trademark dark glasses, during the closing days of a session.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says he actually does have a formula for finding points
of order. But like a master chef with a secret recipe, he hasn't
written it down _ anywhere. ``I keep it all in my head,'' he said
with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Chisum says it's no secret _ ``just work. You need to know the
rules and the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But he credits Derek Seals, a lawyer on his staff for a decade,
with finding most defects in bills. Seals is ``the master of
disaster,'' lobbyist Rob Johnson said reverently.
</P>
<P>
   Some former legislative staffers hire out as bounty hunters,
charging a goodly sum to check out a bill for a lobbyist. If they
find a point of order that winds up delaying or killing a bill,
they get a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But they also look over bills some lobbyists are trying to pass
to help ``scrub'' them of glitches that could kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Some lobbyists avoid bounty hunters, because they don't want to
irk House Speaker Pete Laney. During Laney's tenure, the House
rules, and the bill-writing Legislative Council, have worked to
make points of order harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The House rules, in fact, were changed in 1999 to allow the
speaker to strike down points of order that don't materially affect
a bill. And the House has set up a division to write required
analyses of bills to lessen the chance that a new committee clerk
will make an error that could jeopardize a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wilson and Chisum agree that bill-killing points of order
are tougher to find these days. And Chisum says that's mostly for
the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are good,'' Chisum said. ``They keep from misleading
people about what's really in the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause. Slow smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Chisum added, ``you can also use those sometimes to
your advantage, too.''

 &HT;    Social Security dilemma is real
 &HT;    By Mark Sanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My four little boys love to pretend. They can spend hours
pretending to be cowboys, corralling their brothers with ropes in
the back yard; or in their rooms with towels around their necks
like Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   When I return home from Washington every week and see them
playing, I'm reminded how their games of make-believe reflect
what's going on in our nation's capital regarding Social Security.
Folks in Washington, in general, seem to be lackadaisical about
shoring up Social Security for the 76 million baby boomers
approaching retirement. Politicians are feigning concern, but no
one seems to be pressed to make anything happen. If Washington
keeps this up through the year, chances of reform will be as great
as my 6-year-old son striking down a storm trooper with a light
saber.
</P>
<P>
   Folks back home in South Carolina consistently tell me they want
the system fixed. And they don't want to hear about higher taxes or
lower benefits. That leaves only one other option _ earning more on
our Social Security investment. The question will be how:
collectively or with personal accounts?
</P>
<P>
   As a proponent of the second option, I will propose a bill that
will help working Americans control their retirement security by
keeping Social Security surpluses away from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Like most reform proposals, this plan would provide a system of
personal retirement accounts that would enable people to own and
control their retirement money. The bill would allow workers to
receive their share of the Social Security surplus each year, dir-
</P>
<P>
   ectly deposited in individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   How would this work? Let's look at last year. In 1998, Social
Security ran a $100 billion surplus. Washington spent $30 billion,
and the remaining $70 billion paid part of the existing federal
debt. The government didn't use one cent for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Under this approach, however, Social Security's $100 billion
surplus would have been rebated to Americans' PRAs. Every worker
would have had about one-quarter of what he paid in FICA taxes
returned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Congress voted to spend $13 billion of the
Social Security surplus to fund military actions in Kosovo. More
than 300 members of Congress, many of whom had previously talked
about ``not touching'' the Social Security Trust Fund, voted to
borrow the money.
</P>
<P>
   If last year's surplus had been deposited in personal retirement
accounts, there would have been no way for lawmakers to ``borrow''
that money.
</P>
<P>
   The money rebated to these PRAs would be considered down
payments on future Social Security benefits. This would then reduce
the program's future financial obligations. With $2.8 trillion in
surpluses expected over the next 15 years, it would be foolish to
waste this golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Make-believe is fun for children, but pretending, as a nation,
is scary. Social Security's problems are not going to magically
disappear. For the sake of my four little boys, I hope folks in
Washington consider real reform before it's too late.

 &HT;    Clark climbs charts with hatful of hits and no pretensions
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Terri Clark is one of those country music
artists whose look is so striking you could pick her out by
silhouette _ a cowboy hat the size of a truck tire, thick auburn
hair, tight T-shirt, cowboy-cut Wranglers and boots that could kick
up plenty of sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when most female acts in Nashville are donning
designer gowns, she's Cocky Chick Country, a carefully constructed
image of beauty and swagger that has made Clark the video darling
of Country Music Television and one of Nashville's critically
acclaimed hitmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another female act in country who is doing
what she's doing. She's a knockout who is also aggressive and
comfortable enough to be one of the guys,'' says Steve Mitchell,
the program director at Atlanta country station Y-106.7. Like
others, Mitchell has watched Clark's ascension up the charts since
her breakthrough in 1995, and likes her ``refreshing style and
attitude in this day and age when everybody wants to play dress-up
and sing ballads.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Clark steps into Tootsie's Orchid Lounge on a recent
spring morning, no one in this historic temple of country music
recognizes her at all. She's not the posturing, tough tomboy one
would expect from come-hither album covers and sassy music videos.
The 30-year-old singer/songwriter, looks more like a student on the
way to class, sporting torn jeans, a simple denim shirt, little
makeup and a bottle of mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not wearing the famous hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't have it on today,'' she says, settling into her
favorite black vinyl booth in the beer joint where she got her
start as an 18-year-old newcomer from Alberta, Canada. ``You know,
it's been a blessing and a curse for me. Sometimes I feel like
Terri Clark is an alter ego. That's her and this is me. I think
I've definitely hit a turning point where I'm not inhibited about
people seeing another side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark quickly proves that this growing liberation from her looks
is more than idle talk. She knows she's going to have her picture
made today, but hasn't demanded photo approval, a fairly standard
condition in today's marketing-obsessed Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gonna get riled up about something stupid like whether
or not a picture looks right,'' she says. ``Just pick something
flattering and don't make me look fat.'' She seems quite at home
here among the fading publicity photos that smother the greasy
walls, and says she still slips in the back door of the famous
watering hole from time to time to hear ``good ol' country music.''
</P>
<P>
   An image consultant would probably cringe at this earthy lack of
pretension. But it is Clark's refreshing candor in both her life
and her lyrics that has made fans _ and the Nashville music
community _ embrace her like a drinking buddy on a Saturday night.
Men seem to love the confidence she exudes. On Clark's Web site,
for example, two fans named Rodeo Man and Redneck Man are going to
head down to a show to ``drink beer and yee-haw.'' Women appreciate
the fact she's no magnolia, and often show up at her concerts
dressed from head to toe in Clark costume. Like Anne Murray,
Wynonna and Mary Chapin Carpenter, the divorcee also attracts a
large following of gay fans.
</P>
<P>
   Country queen Reba McEntire, who has toured with Clark and
claims to be one of her biggest admirers, says ``Something I've
learned from my 23 years in the business is that the fans love
honesty. With Terri, her natural personality offstage transfers
honestly and easily onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of today's pop-oriented Nashville acts, Clark's
sound is rooted in the twang of traditionalism. Although she speaks
with no regional accent, her singing voice rings like a dinner bell
_ girl is ``gurrrl,'' poor is ``purr'' _ phrasing drawn from hours
listening to albums by Ricky Skaggs and the Judds as a teen-ager.
As Y-106.7's Mitchell observes, ``she also has contemporary
sounding music behind her,'' which positions her somewhere between
the pop of Shania Twain and the rodeo sounds of George Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe she has had a lot of big songs because she cuts
through the clutter in country music,'' Mitchell says. ``She is
clearly having lots of fun, and that comes through the speakers at
you. You can't fake fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With the release of her third album, ``How I Feel,'' Clark finds
herself at a personal and professional crossroads. She's maturing
from the newcomer known for seductively cute novelty songs, such as
``Better Things to Do,'' to a more confident artist who isn't
afraid of testing a new look as well as new material. For example,
the first single off the latest album, ``Now That I Found You,''
was was originally an R&AMP;B tune. Clark's slow country treatment of
the song gave her her first No. 1 hit _ and she didn't wear a hat
in the popular video.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an artist, she seems to have more focus as to what she's
doing,'' says Chris Parr, programming director at CMT. ``The last
three videos we've gotten have been great material. Some of the
more ditty stuff she did earlier, like `Poor, Poor Pitiful Me' or
`When Boy Meets Girl,' there wasn't a lot of substance to them.
They were fun songs, which is fine, but she's starting to strike
deeper chords now.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be because, since finding fame and fortune in Nashville _
and going through a painful divorce from her husband of seven years
_ Clark has embarked on a personal journey to figure out just who
she is outside of the hit-making machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment industry is all about `look at me, look at
me', and I'm trying to find my niche in that,'' she says with quiet
reflection. ``It's an ego-based industry, and you have to have a
healthy ego to do this. But I've never had cockiness or phoniness.
What has really changed is that I've gotten in touch with my spirit
and what I am inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans have no doubt noticed Clark's soul searching on her latest
hit ``Everytime I Cry,'' which hit Billboard's Top 10 country
charts and was the No. 1 video on CMT for two weeks this month.
Overwhelmed by the whirlwind of fame, Clark says she felt an
increasing need to make some kind of an impact through her fame, so
she dipped into her own pocket to pay for a two-day video shoot
that turned the song into a platform against domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   CMT's Parr was so struck with the power of the tune and the
video that he chose Clark to be May's artist of the month. He says
when he first screened the clip, ``it really made you stop and
think. Visually, I think she's moved up a notch on the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   The metamorphosis may stem from the fact that, in the past year,
Clark has turned her attention to soul searching. She meditates
twice a day in the bedroom of her intown Nashville home, which she
calls ``ridiculously big. Sometimes I feel guilty.'' She's also
been writing songs with folkie Mary Chapin Carpenter, tunes she
says ``have a more uplifting, spiritual connotation to them.'' Her
bedside books are self-help guides by motivational guru Deepak
Chopra, whom Clark met on a retreat at his meditation center in La
Jolla, Calif. When she talks, her conversations are peppered with
New Age vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it has done for me is bring me to an awareness of my
spirit and that it does go on,'' she says. ``Everything that goes
on outside of me _ relationships, career, money, cars _ is all
nonlocal reality. When I'm seeking approval from everybody and
concerned that everybody likes me, that's an ego-based emotion and
not from the spirit. As long as you give, you get. If you stop
giving and only think of yourself, it's going to clot like a blood
clot. I realize what really matters, and it's inside me.''
</P>
<P>
   Can fans accept this newer, karmic version of Terri Clark?
Longtime fan Donna Raney thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the 33-year-old Delta Air Lines customer
service rep has run Clark's official Web page from her home in
Acworth, Ga. She says ``her true fans will follow her. A true fan
is in it for the music and not her image. Terri has worked very
hard for her career, and she's going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark says she believes that ``an artist pretty much has a five-
to-seven-year window to make their money, then it's over. So you
gotta make hay while the sun's shining.'' Having established a
track record, she says she believes now is the time to push the
envelope and explore new directions. For the next album, set for
release early next year, she's working with a new producer, new
session players and new co-writers. Mercury Nashville President
Luke Lewis has given her broad artistic license, telling Clark she
can do whatever she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a side of myself that likes very organic, folk rock,
and I'm probably going to incorporate that more into what I do,''
she says. ``The next album is gonna be so different that it's
either going to be huge or bomb. There probably won't be a hat on
the cover, but every artist _ from Reba to Trisha _ has reinvented
themselves. But I'm going with my heart. If somebody is listening
to my music because I'm wearing a hat, they're listening for the
wrong reasons.''

 &HT;    TAAS: virtue or virus?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Check the appropriate:
</P>
<P>
   (A.) In a clinical setting, and with sufficient repetition,
education policies in Texas could have conditioned Pavlov's dogs to
do long division.
</P>
<P>
   (B.) Education policies in Texas would cause Pavlov's dogs to
stop salivating over sirloin.
</P>
<P>
   (C.) Given sufficient prodding, education policies in Texas
could lead a room full of monkeys working round the clock to type
out a single composition that would score a passing 3 on the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills.
</P>
<P>
   (D.) Education policies in Texas would find young William
Faulkner getting marked down on the same test for not getting to
his point in 27 lines.
</P>
<P>
   Answers: B and D are locks. A and C remain to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   That just about sums up the test-driven education policies in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember the ``back to basics'' movement? What we have in
Texas is not just a sequel, not just ``Planet of the Basics Part
II.'' We have ``Beneath the Planet of the Basics.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's working, which is really good and really a problem,
depending on who's getting taught. For those students who have
below-level English and math skills, it's improving their basic
skills. For many at or above grade level, I fear it is leveling
them off, numbing their palates. Sirloin? Um, what have you got in
the area of food pellets?
</P>
<P>
   In the Waco Independent School District, one of the state's
strictest TAAS-based retention-promotion policies has raised TAAS
passing rates that were in the 60s (passing all portions) for most
grade levels two years ago to more than 70 percent, 80 percent
among fourth- and fifth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   This is a definite point of pride, particularly in a district
used to getting roughed up over social ills it inherits and is
expected to abate.
</P>
<P>
   WISD deserves credit for doing what Texas has assigned: improve
low-achievers' skill levels. But what about those not so low?
Particularly in the elementary grades, particularly when there's a
thirst and a need for health, science, social studies and all else
that education really means.
</P>
<P>
   Even low achievers need these life-affirming, scintillating
experiences. But as applied, the TAAS drumbeat can drown them out.
This emphasis seems to assert the need for something school
districts long ago forsook: tracking, separating students according
to skill levels so that those who really need remediation get it,
and those who don't move on.
</P>
<P>
   Several states are positioned to emulate Texas' system. Let's
hope that what results isn't national standards focused on too-low
common denominators. Don't look now, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Recently textbook publisher Harcourt Brace &AMP; Co. was in the news
selling millions of dollars of books to Texas districts based not
just on quality but on the claim that the books offered an inside
track on passing TAAS. Harcourt Brace should know. One of its
subsidiaries writes TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   This angered lawmakers, who attached an amendment to the state
school funding bill, still pending, to prohibit those who write the
TAAS from selling textbooks to the state.
</P>
<P>
   At this point TAAS starts to loom as a viral agent. In the 1980s
the dumbing down of Texas texts based on the challenges of Longview
textbook monitors Mel and Norma Gabler influenced learning across
the country, since Texas is the second-largest purchaser of
textbooks. Publishers adjusted to meet Texas' specifications and
the Gablers' rants.
</P>
<P>
   As much as TAAS has helped improve things for lots of low
achievers, it's not the answer to our nation's ills. In fact, if
you ask some kids, teachers and parents, TAAS is the illness.

   TRAVEL-CAJUNCOUNTRY _ Opelousas, La. _ Cajun country is the Deep
South with a French accent, a larded-up Loire Valley, where a
seven-course meal consists of a six-pack of beer and a link of
boudin, the Cajun sausage. Everywhere is evidence of a heritage not
lost in modernization but rather zealously guarded. That heritage
is being celebrated all year with Francofete, commemorating the
300th anniversay of French influence on Louisiana. (Konigsmark,

fashion has emerged. Chefwear, a line of clothing that used to be

20 percent of their business came from home cooks who wanted to

   TV-VIOLENCE _ Television is both more violent and less violent
than it used to be. Top-rated prime-time shows have very little
violence, yet Extreme TV grows around the fringes: pro wrestling,
Fox's violence-verite, Jerry Springer (they promised to tone down
the violence before, and didn't) and even local TV news and network
newsmgazines. What's causing Extreme TV? The audience
fragmentation, the hard-to-capture but lucrative market of young
men and teenaged boys, and overall social trends. (Kloer, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 40.

   TERRICLARK _ Of all the hat acts that came and went in country
music in the '90s, Terri Clark has survived to become one of
Nashville's hottest rising stars. When she burst on the scene in
1995, she was the only female wearing the costume du jour _ cowboy
hat, tight jeans, big belt buckle and boots. Now that her career is

Chopra, divorce, fame, songwriting and the Shania-like changes
swirling around her in Nashville. Photos taken in Nashville.

   BOOK-NOTES _ If Tom Franklin's short stories seem gritty, maybe
it's because he worked in a grit factory in Alabama before becoming
a writer. Not the eating kind of grits, but grit used in
sandblasting. Franklin, whose title story in his book,
``Poachers,'' won the Edgar Award, is being touted as one of the
South's brilliant new writers. Also, a new novel by a Savannah
podiatrist, ``Delirium of the Brave,'' takes up where ``Midnight in
the Garden of Good and Evil'' left off. The book about family
skeletons and lost treasure is topping local best seller lists and
has attracted Hollywood interest; Anne Rice's son, Christopher, has
signed a deal for a two-book package. (O'Briant, Atlanta

khaki shirts and still lives on Bainbridge Island off the coast of
Washington state in a house he rents for $325 a month. In between
gulps of bottled water at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, Guterson
talked about how his new novel, ``East of the Mountains,'' evolved,

 &HT;    REPEATING TO RESTORE DROPPED WORD IN LEAD
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A field of honor
 &HT;    For release May 29, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tunisia _ Here, a short distance from the remains of
the Carthage that was destroyed by the Romans in the Punic Wars
more than 2,000 years ago, lie 2,841 of our own war dead, those who
never came home from World War II, those whose sacrifices we recall
this Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, most relatives will not be here to place
flowers against the headstones as so many are doing in cemeteries
across the United States. But the men and women enshrined in the
North Africa American Cemetery have been well cared-for by a loving
country.
</P>
<P>
   The rows of crosses and stars of David spread for 27 acres
across land that once was Roman Carthage, the air around it exuding
centuries of history, of war, of carnage, of remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   Here lies a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and three sets
of brothers buried side by side. And here lies Celia Goldberg,
Private, Women's Army Corps, who died on Aug. 29, 1943.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be drawn to Pvt. Goldberg's grave. Her star of
David tombstone interrupts an otherwise geometric array of crosses
that dominates her section near the entrance. That she was a woman
also distinguishes her.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing at the cemetery that tells how she died, or
where it happened. At the time of her death, the fighting in North
Africa had ended. The Allies already had taken Sicily and were into
Italy. But this field of honor is not limited to North African
campaign dead; many from the fighting in Sicily and Italy also are
here.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of loss for any American entering these
hallowed grounds. As you wander through the rows of headstones, you
touch your fingers to your lips either in homage or shock _ I never
can comprehend which emotion it is _ and wonder how they would have
been had they lived, how many children they would have had, how
many would have been teachers or bankers, athletes or clergy,
mothers or fathers and, now, grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   I remain drawn to Celia because there are so few women among
these martyrs. She was from New York, the headstone says. Her age
is not given but, like so many who answered the call in those days,
she likely was unmarried, likely had not yet had a real serious
romance. She was someone's daughter who never lived to have her own
children, to take them to dance recitals or Little League games, to
see them married and have children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   That is the sacrifice Celia and all those others made on our
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever caused her death in 1943 _ bullets, grenades, perhaps
an illness _ deprived Celia of her right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, so that we may have ours.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of a cemetery holding our honored war dead being
in such close proximity to what was Carthage is evident. This is
where one of the world's first great civilizations flourished, only
to be picked apart and destroyed from without, by centuries of
invading armies: the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Phoenicians,
Romans, the Vandals and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage is a lesson to world history; a civilization more
interested in trade and discourse than in conquest devoured by
those who would have it the other way. Centuries later, the
Americans resting nearby fought the same battle that did the
Carthaginians. They may have lost their lives in doing it but they
won the war, repulsing the conquerors and subjugators.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we pause to remember them, we need also to recall their
mission.

 &HT;    Dear Grads: Please pay the $170,625 you owe us soon
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo from: Society
</P>
<P>
   To: 1999 graduates
</P>
<P>
   RE: Your Happy Day
</P>
<P>
   Dear Graduate:
</P>
<P>
   Please accept this as society's sincerest congratulations on
your successful completion of 12 years of school. We know that it
isn't just 12 years of school you have completed, but also numerous
tests that you were required to pass in order to get your diploma.
</P>
<P>
   We're all very, very proud of you. As you well know, not all of
you made it. Some of those who began this journey with you in
kindergarten will receive your graduation notice in, say, the Beto
Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   We realize that it has not been easy to keep on the straight and
narrow course that brought you to this moment.
</P>
<P>
   But as a new graduate, it is necessary that we conduct just a
little bit of business at this time and we hope it does not detract
from the joy you and your family are feeling during your
commencement.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to inform you that it is time to pay Society
back for your 13 years of schooling. Surely, you did not think this
was free?
</P>
<P>
   By our calculations, your bill comes to $170,625.
</P>
<P>
   We realize that this may seem like a great deal of money,
especially when you see it all in one lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Please remember, though, that this accounts for a full 13 years
of schooling at our low, low price of only $75 per day _ which
really does not begin to cover all of our costs. The total is
figured on 175 days for each of the 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard the comment before, dear graduate, that for $75 a
day you could get yourself a cheap motel room and meals. This may
be true, but without a high school diploma, your life will seem
like an endless series cheap motel rooms, and, we might add, will
have the same faint odor.
</P>
<P>
   But, don't worried. It took you 13 years to amass this bill, we
would not expect you to pay it all at once. No way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we are willing to accept payment in three easy
installments, once per month. Of course, you'll understand that
this method does incur 21 percent interest, compounded hourly.
Furthermore, we must insist that you do not go beyond the 90-day
time period. We've been waiting for this money for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, given the fact that you are about to enter college, you
are a bit strapped for money just at this moment. Maybe you don't
have the $170,625 in your checking right now.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, perhaps you'd like to consider our alternative
form of payment that does not include your paying ANY money, at
least not in the traditional sense.
</P>
<P>
   Permit us to explain. You can forego paying the $170,625 if you
agree to become a responsible and involved citizen. To follow this
course of payment you would agree, to wit (now that you're a
graduate, your life will be full of ``to wits.'' You had best get
used to it.):
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To not only register to vote, but to actually vote and to
actually make some effort to be an informed voter;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To volunteer for something in the community. Take your pick.
It doesn't matter to us. It can be with your church, with a civic
club or just on your own. DO SOMETHING. And, by the way, we expect
at least a couple of hours a week to retire a $170,625 debt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To support some worthy cause with your dollars. Support
something. It can be United Way, it can be your high school
scholarship fund, it can be your church, but invest your own money
in doing something worthwhile. This can be pennies a week, just
make some commitment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perform at least one random act of kindness per month. We'd
like to ask for a higher frequency, but we'll settle for once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the most important to wit:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never, not once the rest of your life, ever utter a statement,
or even think it, which conveys the idea that Society owes you
anything whatsoever, not fairness, not a chance, not a meal, not
anything.
</P>
<P>
   We may someday give you something you need, but we don't owe
you. Not at all. It is you who owes us.

   COXNET TRAVEL 0525 -- For a first-time visitor, New York City
can be as intimidating as King Kong on a rampage down Fifth Avenue.
No wonder orchestrating a family getaway can be a daunting
prospect. There's so much to see and do in Manhattan, vacationers
find it hard to know where to start. (Crouch Thrasher, Atlanta

has improved, although the potential still exists for further
violent acts. (Staff, N.Y. Times News Service)

   TRAVEL-CAJUNCOUNTRY _ Opelousas, La. _ Cajun country is the Deep
South with a French accent, a larded-up Loire Valley, where a
seven-course meal consists of a six-pack of beer and a link of
boudin, the Cajun sausage. Everywhere is evidence of a heritage not
lost in modernization but rather zealously guarded. That heritage
is being celebrated all year with Francofete, commemorating the
300th anniversay of French influence on Louisiana. (Konigsmark,

   TV-VIOLENCE _ Television is both more violent and less violent
than it used to be. Top-rated prime-time shows have very little
violence, yet Extreme TV grows around the fringes: pro wrestling,
Fox's violence-verite, Jerry Springer (they promised to tone down
the violence before, and didn't) and even local TV news and network
newsmgazines. What's causing Extreme TV? The audience
fragmentation, the hard-to-capture but lucrative market of young
men and teenaged boys, and overall social trends. (Kloer, Atlanta

 &HT;    FROM MIGRANT WORKER, SHE ROSE TO KEY WHITE HOUSE ROLE
 &HT;    Eds: 8th graf from end inserted to update. Story was originally

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maria Echaveste was talking about patriotism in her
White House office, which is a short stroll from President
Clinton's desk but an odyssey away from the dusty cotton fields of
south Texas where her story began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work in this country to make sure that when you say
the word 'American,' it includes, in your head, all the things that
we are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be that even in Latino communities, if you're
talking among yourselves, you say 'los Americanos' as a shorthand
way of saying 'the other, the white Americans,' even though we're
all Americans? Somehow we've taken in that they're Americans; we're
Mexican-Americans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, excuse me, I'm really proud to be Mexican. I'm
really glad to know where I came from. But I'm American.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the White House deputy chief of staff personifies the
melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   Echaveste, 45, is ``sort of a one-woman band of diversity,'' the
New Republic noted. ``She's a Hispanic woman, a Jew, a corporate
lawyer, a Californian, a Texan, a New Yorker, a marathon runner,
and a gardener. Oh yes, she also knits.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing she's not, though, is a Southern good ol' boy _ which
helped get her hired by Erskine Bowles, the North Carolina
businessman who was serving as Clinton's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have very different backgrounds. That's another reason
why I wanted to bring her in,'' Bowles recalled. ``If you have
people with different backgrounds, people with different life
experiences, people from different cultures, people of different
races and genders, you're going to make a better decision than if
you just have 10 white guys sitting around a table.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of migrant farm workers, Echaveste has reached a
White House position never before attained by a Hispanic woman. In
the past six years, she has risen steadily through the
administration ranks _ from the Labor Department's wage and hour
administrator to White House director of public liaison to deputy
chief of staff. A cabinet position could be next. She has been
rumored to be a contender for secretary of education should Richard
Riley decide to return to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she's at the highest position she's going to end
up at,'' predicted Bowles. ``If she decides to stay in the
administration, I think Maria is destined for a seat at the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Maria was the eldest of the seven Echaveste children. Their
parents had crossed the Rio Grande in the early 1950s to find a
better life, and Maria was born in Harlingen, Texas. Her father
couldn't read or write back then. He was taught by her mother, who
had finished the second grade. But they were bright and ambitious,
hard workers who earned their citizenship and moved to California
in search of higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The children grew up following ripening crops across California,
picking cotton, strawberries, grapes, tomatoes and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived out in the country on farms,'' recalled Rosa, the
middle child of five girls and two boys. ``We did not have a lot of
toys or material things. But Maria was really imaginative. We did
these elaborate shows and plays for each other. And we played
school. She was always the teacher, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost longer than she can remember, books were central in
Maria's childhood. She spent as much time as she could in the
libraries of schools and agricultural communities.
</P>
<P>
   Books would open the door to a life beyond the aching backs and
merciless sun and endless fields and orchards. But her early
academic awareness wasn't the only reason that Maria was always the
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the oldest child and having the responsibility of caring
for all the little ones, she had to grow up fast,'' said Carmella,
the third-born of the Echaveste children. ``Those experiences
interfered with her childhood. The term we use now is 'parentified'
_ a child expected to be a substitute parent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely was a parental figure,'' agreed Rosa. ``If we
did anything wrong, we feared her reaction as well as our
parents'.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarchal household stressed traditional Mexican and
Catholic values. At times, there was a culture clash between the
stern, Spanish-speaking father and his Americanized children. He
did not want his eldest daughter to go off to college, even after
she earned a scholarship to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry,'' said Carmella, now a social worker in
Pasadena. ``My mother told her, 'go, and I'll work on your dad
while you're gone'.''
</P>
<P>
   With Maria leading the way, six of the seven Echaveste children
went on to earn college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the guiding light,'' said Rosa, now an insurance
broker in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the parents followed the example set by their
offspring and became avid readers. Refugio Echaveste advanced to
become a ranch foreman, joining the vast American middle class
before retiring and returning with his wife, Maria, to live in the
Mexican town of Jalisco where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, Maria Echaveste majored in anthropology and might
have gone on to graduate study and an academic career except for a
tight job market in her field. Instead, she spent a year in the
nation's capital interning with the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning a government job, she earned a law degree from the
University of California at Berkeley. But instead of returning to
Washington, she became a corporate attorney in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it immensely,'' she said, describing the challenge
of winning courtroom battles. And the practice was lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've added up how much money I've lost in the last six years
being in government,'' she said. ``It's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she married Stanley Schlein, a Bronx attorney. She
also converted to her husband's religion _ Orthodox Judaism. She
has since divorced but remained Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised a Catholic and had a very hard time with
Catholicism, which was the source of another battle with my parents
when I started not to go to church,'' she said. She considered the
religion _ ``the way it was in my house'' _ to be confining to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very suffocating. You're someone's mother, someone's
sister, someone's daughter. You're not a person in your own
right,'' she explained. ``It's also very focused on the hereafter,
as opposed to now. And especially, I think, in a Mexican household,
there's a lot of resignation. It's 'whatever God wills'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Judasim to be much more life-affirming. This is our
time. It's about what you do every day, about how you use the
blessings that you have every day and what you do with this life
now, not what's going happen to you post-death.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she became active in Democratic politics and served
as president of the city's Board of Elections. During the 1992
presidential campaign, she left her law firm to become the national
Latino coordinator for the Clinton team. Her White House position,
she concedes with a chuckle, is directly attributable to picking a
winning candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the new administration and became wage and hour
administrator, a Labor Department position requiring Senate
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The job is powerful but obscure _ overseeing minimum wage laws,
child labor laws and the newly passed family medical leave act,
said Tom Glynn, a Boston hospital administrator who is a former
deputy secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have been chief of staff for the attorney general,''
Glynn said. ``Given that choice, most people would have gone to the
Justice Department. But she was very committed to the issues
concerning working people. She ended up handling a lot of hot
potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   She led a project that obtained $8 million in back wages for
poor workers who had been illegally underpaid by their employers.
And she pushed an anti-sweatshop crusade to press retailers and
clothes makers to improve the working conditions at the facilities
of their apparel contractors.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of Clinton's second term in 1997, Echaveste moved
over to the White House as public liaison director, responsible for
boosting support for presidential policies and initiatives. She
replaced Alexis Herman, who had been appointed secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Among Echaveste's projects was the presidential initiative to
provoke a ``national dialogue'' on race relations to prepare the
nation for a future without any racial majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have criticized (the initiative) as an issue
that started out big and is going nowhere,'' she said. However, she
predicted that ``some years from now, what the president did by
putting this issue about how we relate to each other across racial
and ethnic and religious lines will be seen as the big deal it
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her involvement with the race initiative led to one big change
in her personal life. According to press reports, Echaveste
recently bought a large apartment in Washington with Christopher
Edley, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a top adviser
to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Echaveste was promoted to deputy chief of
staff. The job entails ``managing the White House,'' she explained.
Her duties have ranged from routine administration _ deciding who
gets raises _ to coordinating the State of the Union speech and
planning the Wye River summit to negotiate Mideast peace and the
50th anniversary NATO conference.
</P>
<P>
   The air war over Yugoslavia forced a drastic revision of the
original plans for a celebratory NATO summit, said Doug Sosnik,
presidential assistant for policy and strategy. At every progress
meeting, Echaveste had to keep pushing for changes, warning,
``people, read the paper,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like turning a huge ship around'' to produce a
successful session that was completely different from the
celebrity-filled gala initially envisioned, Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   Echaveste gets things done, said Bowles, her former boss.
``There are a lot of people in Washington, I found, who understand
policy. But I didn't find many who could translate that policy into
action. She's both a leader and a doer _ again a rare
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Echaveste said she is thankful for the opportunity to
work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to participate in some of the decisions that have
to be made around here is something that I take very seriously,''
she explained. ``It's not about the trappings of, 'Oh, I work in
the White House.' Or, 'Oh, I got invited to some fancy state
dinner'. Or, 'Oh, my goodness, I get to travel on Air Force One.'
It's about, 'Okay, you had a really interesting session on school
violence on Monday. Now how are we going to organize this into a
national campaign?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to work on something that can make people's
lives better,'' she said. ``I hope that doesn't sound too corny.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civilian casualties are as old as war itself.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries before Christ, during three decades of fighting
between Athens and Sparta, the massacre of children, leveling of
entire cities and the selling of captured women into bondage became
the stock-in-trade for combatants in the Peloponnesian War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no length to which violence did not go,'' wrote
Thucydides, one of the world's earliest war correspondents. ``Every
form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by reason of
the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Two millennia later, English poet and novelist George Gascoigne
witnessed ``a pitiful massacre,'' of some 17,000 men, women and
children when Spanish troops sacked the German city of Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was neither man nor means to resist them,'' Gascoigne
wrote in 1576. ``When the blood is cold and the fury over, methinks
that a true Christian heart should stand content with victory, and
refrain to provoke God's wrath by shedding of innocent blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in history, however, can begin to rival the mass killing
brought on by the combination of lethal technology and the clash of
empires and values that the 20th Century has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 million civilians died during World War I, a
figure so appalling that it shocked a generation into believing it
had fought the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of peace were shattered just two decades later by World
War II, which claimed at least 20 million civilians from Moscow to
Shanghai, from London to Dresden, from Okinawa to Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War followed just five years later, leaving an
estimated 1.5 million civilians dead. A decade after that, the
United States began its involvement in Vietnam, a conflict that
killed an estimated 1 million civilians between 1965 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the United States launched air strikes on Iraq in
1991, the global reach of CNN made it clear that President Bush
would pay a heavy price in public support if civilian casualties
got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The use of laser-guided bombs aided U.S. pilots' accuracy in
urban areas, but there were still incidents of civilian deaths, as
when scores were killed in an attack on a supposed military bunker
that turned out to be in use by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to that conflict, the air war against
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia is a full generation ahead in terms of
technology, the most intensive campaign of precision guided weapons
in history.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't ensured that all bombs hit their mark, but it's big

   WASHINGTON _ Civilian casualties are as old as war itself.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries before Christ, during three decades of fighting
between Athens and Sparta, the massacre of children, leveling of
entire cities and the selling of captured women into bondage became
the stock-in-trade for combatants in the Peloponnesian War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no length to which violence did not go,'' wrote
Thucydides, one of the world's earliest war correspondents. ``Every
form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by reason of
the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Two millennia later, English poet and novelist George Gascoigne
witnessed ``a pitiful massacre,'' of some 17,000 men, women and
children when Spanish troops sacked the German city of Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was neither man nor means to resist them,'' Gascoigne
wrote in 1576. ``When the blood is cold and the fury over, methinks
that a true Christian heart should stand content with victory, and
refrain to provoke God's wrath by shedding of innocent blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in history, however, can begin to rival the mass killing
brought on by the combination of lethal technology and the clash of
empires and values that the 20th Century has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 million civilians died during World War I, a
figure so appalling that it shocked a generation into believing it
had fought the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of peace were shattered just two decades later by World
War II, which claimed at least 20 million civilians from Moscow to
Shanghai, from London to Dresden, from Okinawa to Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War followed just five years later, leaving an
estimated 1.5 million civilians dead. A decade after that, the
United States began its involvement in Vietnam, a conflict that
killed an estimated 1 million civilians between 1965 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the United States launched air strikes on Iraq in
1991, the global reach of CNN made it clear that President Bush
would pay a heavy price in public support if civilian casualties
got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The use of laser-guided bombs aided U.S. pilots' accuracy in
urban areas, but there were still incidents of civilian deaths, as
when scores were killed in an attack on a supposed military bunker
that turned out to be in use by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to that conflict, the air war against
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia is a full generation ahead in terms of
technology, the most intensive campaign of precision guided weapons
in history.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't ensured that all bombs hit their mark, but it's big
step in that direction.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Major General Curtis LeMay, commander of the U.S.
air raids that purposefully killed more than half a million
Japanese civilians during World War II, took a succinct view of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what war is about,'' the hard-bitten, B-29 pilot
once said. ``You've got to kill people, and when you've killed
enough, they stop fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   As the American Century staggers toward an unsettling close --
and graphic images of dead civilians invade American living rooms
with increasing frequency -- LeMay's remarks stand chillingly
emblematic of an era that has seen the slaughter of the innocent on
an unprecedented scale.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 100 years, more than 62 million civilians have
been killed in wars around the world. That's more, historians
believe, than in the previous two millennia combined.
</P>
<P>
   Many -- such as the 330,000 civilians killed by U.S. attacks on
60 Japanese cities during World War II and the 200,000 or so killed
by the nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- were
deliberately slain, in hopes of breaking an opponent's will. All
were killed in violation of one of the most basic tenets of
civilization: respect, if not mercy, for the defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   The limited, almost surgically restrained air strikes the United
States and its NATO partners are conducting against Serb forces in
Yugoslavia could hardly be more different from the total war LeMay
was charged with waging against Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, on this Memorial Day, when Americans pause to remember
those who have died in uniform, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia
is taking a mounting toll on that Balkan republic's civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   At least 320 civilian deaths have been documented, and Belgrade
claims more than 1,200 have been killed, a charge that is
impossible to verify or refute.
</P>
<P>
   It's certain, though, that each civilian who dies takes with
them a bit of the righteous authority President Clinton claimed
when he announced the strikes on March 24, citing ``a moral
imperative'' to counter Serb repression of majority ethnic
Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike any other major war of this century, perhaps in
history, the current NATO campaign is centered exclusively around
limited humanitarian objectives, a justification that is sorely
undercut whenever NATO bombs take innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no ordinary conflict. It's not a fight over territory
or money or markets. It's a struggle for the future shape of
civilized society,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday
in commencement remarks to the graduating class at the U.S. Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Md. ``What is convulsing the United States
and our NATO allies is the face of evil, an ethnic and religious
nationalism that has at its core a hatred of everything our great
democracies treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   If civilian casualties are a tragic by-product of the NATO
strikes, they are the very purpose of the campaign of terror Serb
troops and police have waged for the past year and a half targeting
Kosovar Albanians -- civilians as well as armed fighters pressing
for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO strikes began, the repression has escalated into the
single worst rampage of bloodshed and destruction to be visited
upon Europe in 50 years, precisely what the United States and its
NATO allies had hoped to avert through air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, they are now bent on pounding the Serbs until
their leader, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, agrees to
peace on terms he has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, whose military and police forces have executed more
than 5,000 ethnic Albanians, according to State Department
estimates, and forced perhaps 1.5 million others to flee their
homes, has shown little regard for the Geneva Conventions that
protect non-combatants from military force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has systematically and intentionally turned Kosovo into a
killing field,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said earlier this
month, ``and this was no accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign being waged to reverse that, NATO's democracies
aren't likely to tolerate high levels of civilian losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts every time it happens,'' said retired Army Maj. Bill
Stuebner, advisor to the rule of law program at the U.S. Institute
of Peace, a government-backed research group. ``You can only so
many times say, 'I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts believe, moreover, that Milosevic is buoyed by
civilian casualties and errant strikes -- like the inadvertent
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- which he hopes will
wear down support for the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic has ever prayed in his life he's praying for
things like that,'' said Stuebner, who has served in civil
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. ``He wants to show dismembered
mothers and babies on television.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO strikes continue, so does the risk of mounting
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real enemy is time,'' said Army Col. James F. Holcomb,
professor of national security strategy at the U.S. Army War
College in Carlisle, Pa. ``Over time, you're going to see these
images coming out more and more. Milosevic knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize civilian deaths, U.S. and allied military officials
are taking a complex set of precautions -- from a painstaking
target approval process to the bombing tactics pilots employ -- on
a scale never before seen in a major conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon lawyers weigh in to ensure that each target has a valid
military value and is not protected under international conventions
on war or human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Military targeting and weapons experts use sophisticated
computer models to assess the expected blast radius of a specific
type of bomb hitting a designated target, then calculate the
likelihood that such a strike might damage surrounding facilities
or put civilians at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a calculus here that is employed, and you do that for
every target,'' said U.S. Navy Cpt. Stephen Pietropaoli, spokesman
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics mandate further caution. Allied pilots are instructed to
verify their targets before each attack and are under strict orders
not to release bombs if there's the shadow of a possibility of
hitting civilians. In most cases, so-called forward air controllers
in warplanes accompanying the bombers must also sign off on a
target before it's struck, often in communications with yet a third
aircraft flying reconnaissance over the target area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of strike missions have been scrubbed when pilots
feared they might kill civilians, forcing warplanes to return to
aircraft carriers and land-based air fields with their bombs still
hanging perilously from their wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to inflict any more casualties, even on the
enemy, than is necessary, and certainly not among innocent
bystanders,'' said Pietropaoli.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``It will always be a business of risks, to our
side, to the enemy and, unfortunately, to those innocent civilians
caught in between.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true in an environment in which Serb troops
and police intentionally mix with civilians and position armor and
other military equipment near schools, churches and homes as
protection against allied attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping nearly 15,000 bombs in more than two months of
attacks, roughly a dozen have caused civilian deaths, according to
NATO officials, as alliance bombs either went awry or blasted areas
or facilities where children, journalists, diplomats and even the
very ethnic Albanian refugees the NATO strikes are designed to
protect were present.
</P>
<P>
   The record has drawn harsh criticism from some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite NATO's rhetoric, there can be no doubt that these
killings and injuries were perpetrated willfully,'' alleges a
complaint that a group of international lawyers filed with the
United Nations tribunal investigating alleged war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint calls on the tribunal to indict President Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 65 other officials from
NATO countries for violating international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've charged them with willful killing,'' said Michael
Mandel, a party to the proceedings, who teaches law at York
University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is lying to us,'' Mandel said in a telephone interview
with Cox Newspapers. ``It's not taking care. In fact, it's trying
to terrorize the civilian population into bringing down the
Milosevic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon dismisses such charges, insisting that NATO has
never intentionally targeted civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the country early on, however, that the campaign
would carry risks to civilians as well as to NATO pilots, and U.S.
military officials insist that the civilian casualty rate so far --
tragic though it is -- has been well below what planners had
feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an extraordinary record, but it's not a
perfect record,'' Bacon said. ``We never promised a perfect record.
I doubt if there's been a military force in history that has, one,
set as a goal a reduction or a minimizing of civilian casualties to
the extent that this NATO force has, and that, two, has achieved
that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 percent of the bombs being dropped in Serbia are
so-called gravity bombs that simply tumble from warplanes and fall
to their targets. The other 90 percent are precision-guided weapons
steered to their targets by laser beams, global positioning
satellites, infrared sensors, nose-mounted video cameras or other
means.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reverse of the proportions in the Gulf War, when only
10 percent of the bombs dropped were precision guided weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced navigational aides, combined with computerized cockpit
information systems, mean that gravity bombs can be dropped with
accuracy unheard of just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Modern guidance systems, however, a full generation advanced
from the so-called ``smart bombs'' of the Gulf War, enable pilots
to routinely ram 2,000-pound bombs into a target bull's-eye just a
few feet square firing from five miles or more away.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Twenty-four Christian organizations with 31 million members are
launching a new Covenant Marriage Movement with a dream that
millions of married couples will sign pledge cards with this simple
but eloquent statement:
 &HT;    ''Believing that marriage is a covenant intended by God to be a
lifelong relationship between a man and a woman, we vow to God,
each other, our families, and our community to remain steadfast in
unconditional love, reconciliation, and sexual purity, while
purposefully growing in our covenant marriage relationship.''
 &HT;    The Southern Baptist Convention, America's largest Protestant
denomination, will feature the Covenant Marriage pledge at its June
national convention that draws 10,000 ''messengers'' from local
congregations.
 &HT;    The SBC has demonstrated the power of a similar pledge, ''True
Love Waits,'' signed by two million teens, which has been so
successful that for the first time in 20 years, a majority of high
school students say they are still virgins.
 &HT;    Phil Waugh, who is with SBC's LifeWay Christian Resources, the
nation's largest Christian publisher, hopes the Marriage Covenant
will be a similar instrument ''through which God can speak with one
voice to all those trying to strengthen marriage. In signing, a
couple can stand with thousands of couples with one voice and one
heart affirming God's design of one man and one woman for life.''
He is one of the movement's organizers.
 &HT;    The Assemblies of God convention in Orlando this summer will
also spotlight the Marriage Covenant to its 10,000 attendees.
 &HT;    Others doing so are such radio ministries as Focus on the
Family, the Moody Bible Institute, and FamilyLife, an organization
that also sponsors weekend retreats that attract nearly 100,000
people a year.
 &HT;    FamilyLife has also pledged to organize four one-day arena
rallies for married couples called ''I STILL Do.''
 &HT;    Promise Keepers has attracted hundreds of thousands of men, and
Women of Faith events gather many women, but no one has organized
couples to celebrate marriage. FamilyLife will help couples
rediscover the passion of their marriage vows in San Diego on June
19, San Jose on June 26, Washington, D.C. July 10 and Houston Oct.
23.
 &HT;    A number of outstanding speakers will talk about the meaning of
the marriage vows:
 &HT;    --''I Take You'' is a message on commitment how to give and
receive unconditional love.
 &HT;    --''To Love, Honor, Cherish'' will explore what love is, how we
can fulfill the promise to communicate, offer forgiveness and
reconciliation.
 &HT;    --''To Have and To Hold'' is a message on emotional, sexual and
spiritual intimacy in marriage.
 &HT;    --''To Be Your Husband/Wife'' focuses on how we are to
complement and not compete with our spouse and enjoy a more
harmonious marriage.
 &HT;    The rallies will end with husbands and wives restating their
marriage vows. And they will be given a four-week HomeBuilders
Bible study designed to involve other couples.
 &HT;    FamilyLife founder Dennis Rainey says, ''It is no mistake that
the Bible begins with a marriage and ends with a marriage. It is
the first institution that God created.'' To learn more, call
1-800-358-6329.
 &HT;    One of the creators of the movement is state Rep. Tony Perkins,
who persuaded Louisiana's Legislature to pass a Covenant Marriage
Law creating a two-tiered marriage system.
 &HT;    Couples have a choice between a standard marriage certificate
that allows either partner to walk away in a no-fault divorce; or
couples can choose a Covenant Marriage, a fortified marriage
intended to last a lifetime, in which both relinquish the right to
a no-fault divorce. They agree to take premarital counseling, and
if their marriage hits rough waters, to seek professional help.
Divorce is possible, but only if one partner proves a spouse has
committed adultery, been physically abusive, etc.
 &HT;    However, Perkins has found that the ability of government to
promote marriage is limited. Only 3 percent of couples marrying in
Louisiana are choosing a Covenant Marriage. Therefore he urges
America's faith community to ask couples to ''renew their vows to
one another.''
 &HT;    The final organizer is Rev. Leo Godzich, associate pastor of
Phoenix First Assembly, America's largest Assembly of God, and
creator of the National Association of Marriage Enrichment,
churches working to get back to biblically-based, Christ-centered
marriages.
 &HT;    He believes it is important for couples to ''affirm that in this
climate of divorce that their marriage is permanent and lasting.''
 &HT;    Dennis Rainey adds, ''This is the beginning of the end of the
culture of divorce. It is the first time I know of that a number of
denominations and parachurch ministries have joined together to
raise the standard of the Marriage Covenant back to its rightful
place.''

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The tendency to overreact to an

AMERICA CAN'T LEAVE CHINA OUT IN THE COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have a right to expect more of a candidate for the
presidency of their great nation than the kind of blatant, petty
and reckless political demagoguery that Texas Gov. George W. Bush
has spewed out in reaction to the release of the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
   Glossing over the fact that the select House committee on
Chinese espionage, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., found
that the Chinese pilfering of U.S. nuclear and missile secrets
spanned 20 years and four administrations, Bush rushed to blast
``the current administration's failed policies toward China.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Clinton administration's China policy differs in
no substantial way from that of former President George Herbert
Walker Bush, who arguably was the most ardent China lover to have
ever occupied the White House since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, the governor's father who went to the wall
for China to save its most-favored-nation trade status after the
Chinese government's massacre of the demonstrators for democracy in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress passed numerous laws to restrict trade with
China because of human rights violations, Bush the elder vetoed
them all. Even after being defeated in his 1992 presidential
re-election bid, the former ambassador to China continued to be a
staunch advocate for ``engagement'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-day visit to China in 1994, the man who has been
described as the architect of U.S.-China relations since the 1970s
continued to champion Beijing's cause, speaking angrily of the
pressure brought to bear by Congress to prevent China's hosting the
2000 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view that had those games gone to China, that kind of
openness, that kind of contact, that kind of influx of athletes and
interested people from all around the world would lead to more, not
less, to more individual freedoms in China,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bush administration, trade relations with China
blossomed immensely, and major corporations stampeded to gain
access to the world's greatest concentration of potential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonable to assume that during that buoyant period of
Sino-American relations, the opportunities for Chinese espionage
also blossomed. And it is just as reasonable to ask why the Bush
administration did not find out about it and put a stop to it.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be just as pointless at this juncture to point the
finger of blame at former President Bush as it is to assign an
excess of culpability to current President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Both were and are right in their view of the importance of
keeping China engaged. It is, to paraphrase an ancient saying,
better to have the giant panda inside the banquet hall micturating
out than outside the hall micturating in.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, George W. Bush wishes to repudiate the policies of
George H.W. Bush while taking a cheap shot at Bill Clinton, that is
his business. But he can't have one without the other.
</P>
<P>
   It is likewise counterproductive, and probably hazardous to
global security, to demonize China excessively for its espionage.
It did what comes naturally to nations in stealing the nuclear and
missile secrets. Greater vigilance simply should have been
exercised during past decades to prevent the Chinese from being
able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is what to do now that the secrets are out and
China may be able, within the next few years, to develop nuclear
intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the recommendations of the Cox report must be
followed, and more must be done to stop the bleeding of strategic
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, this country must take steps to protect itself
from a Chinese nuclear missile attack. In that regard, research
into and development of an anti-ballistic missile defense system
must be expedited.
</P>
<P>
   The Aegis sea mobile system advocated by the Heritage Foundation
appears to offer the best promise for early deployment, and the
price _ an estimated $3 billion during the next five years _
appears to be right. That would buy time for a more elaborate
ground-based system.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could be done while maintaining friendly relations
with China. In fact, the knowledge that the United States is
developing such a system might improve the climate of Sino-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, utmost care would have to be taken to make certain
that China didn't steal the secrets that would allow it to defeat
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Unless such a nuclear shield is established, this country could
one day find itself in a confrontation with China over Taiwan, with
only the fear of mutually assured destruction to deter them from a
war that could go nuclear.
</P>

Our rating: 2 stars

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coming as it does in the considerable wake of
``The Matrix,'' the virtual worlds of ``The Thirteenth Floor'' can
only feel like a bit of a letdown. Visually stylish with some
striking retro landscapes, this movie and its innumerable
ambiguities are often quite interesting, but never completely
engaging.
</P>
<P>
   What it lacks most is the kind of jaw-dropping moment that made
Keanu Reeves _ and movie audiences _ so memorably murmur, ``Whoa.''
Instead, you'll have content yourself with a ``Huh.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite the same, is it?
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens promisingly enough in a sepia-toned, 1937 Los
Angeles where a tuxedo-clad gentleman named Hannon Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) hands a confidential letter to a hotel nightclub
bartender. Next thing we know, Fuller wakes up in a modern-day
skyscraper, and we learn that the past he was visiting wasn't real
_ he created it on a computer. Everything in it is a virtual
simulation, even the comely chorus girls that Fuller so ardently
enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   This trip was Fuller's last, though. He's murdered right after
placing a phone call to his partner, Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko),
the same man Fuller left the note for at the hotel. Hall is
devastated _ and confused. He can't remember where he was the night
Fuller was murdered, and the fact that Fuller's bloody tuxedo shirt
lies in the top of his hamper doesn't exactly bode well, either.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than call Johnnie Cochran for legal advice, Hall decides
to go back in time and see what his partner was doing. The lines
between fact and fantasy shift back and forth (and back and forth)
when Hall meets a mysterious beauty named Jane (Gretchen Mol) who
may hold the key not only to Fuller's death but to the nature of
life itself.
</P>
<P>
   While all this may sound kind of absorbing and substantial, the
screenplay (credited to director Josef Rusnak and Ravel
Centeno-Rodriguez) unravels once the plot thickens. Other problems:
Wooden dialogue and bad acting (Bierko and Mol being the main
culprits.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, like other science-fiction entries such as ``The Matrix''
and ``The Phantom Menace,'' ``The Thirteenth Floor'' does offer
some arresting visual images, particularly the period scenes in Los
Angeles. We roll down Wilshire Boulevard looking at undeveloped
land and oil derricks _ and no traffic jams. Rusnak can't resist
hammering home the present-day contrasts, inserting a shot of the
city's modern, concrete-and-steel skyline nearly every five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the movie's landscapes seemed as authentic as its
washed-out 1930s world, ``The Thirteenth Floor'' might feel a
little more genuine itself. But the film's existential noodlings
simply don't hold up. And here, too, it suffers in comparison with
``The Matrix,'' a movie that actually improves with a second
viewing. Here, once (if that) is quite enough, thank you. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ If, average guy, you have ever dreamed of Julia
Roberts falling in love with you, ``Notting Hill'' may give you
some second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   A measurably witty, amusingly narcissistic romp that's, yes,
about dating someone very much like Julia Roberts, ``Hill''
actually boasts a semblance of emotional reality whenever our hero,
an unsuccessful London bookstore owner played by Hugh Grant, must
confront his new girlfriend's celebrity. It's almost always a
degrading, dismaying experience, and it gives this frothy fantasy a
solid basis even as it threatens to undercut Roberts' dreamgirl
status forevermore.
</P>
<P>
   While most contemporary romantic comedies _ take a Sandra
Bullock movie, any Sandra Bullock movie _ employ idiotic plotting
and abject slavery to convention to prevent their stars from
coupling up until the end, ``Hill'' throws a barrier of genuine
feelings in their path. Mostly his feelings; why Roberts'
world-famous movie star, Anna Scott, falls for sweet loser William
Thacker is never really clarified beyond the fact that he's played
by Hugh Grant. Still, it's nice to see relationship complications
that are at least half-based on character rather than on sheer
contrivance and moronic misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   The story's niceties should not be overstated, though. ``Hill''
is formulaic as all get-out, with the same kind of cast of sad,
supportive friends and mild eccentrics that populated the last
romantic comedy Richard Curtis wrote, ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral.'' There are many wry lines and even a good number of
perceptively written whole sequences. But Noel Coward it ain't.
</P>
<P>
   What it quite delectably is, however, is a media-age satire on
the travails of being, well, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Her Anna
is in London promoting some dreadful-sounding space movie. She
wanders into William's shop during a break from press rounds, he
winds up spilling orange juice on her, she changes her clothes at
his modest flat across Portobello Road and, although understandably
miffed, she plants a big one on his lips before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing William knows, he's faking his way through a
movie press junket (lampooned wonderfully I say, and I've been to a
thousand of them) to get a little one-on-one time with his new
favorite star. Anna's receptive and happily accompanies him to a
small dinner party where William's friends' varying reactions to
her are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   But as love blossoms, the weeds of Anna's celebrity lifestyle
grow around it. She's always coming and going, and not just out of
town, out of continent. Other romances intrude (the surprise star
cameo could've been bigger, but it's still a scream). And when Anna
hides out at William's from a tabloid mob that's just discovered
old porno footage of her, well, the resulting paparazzi frenzy
could not have been comfortable for the gossip-generating Roberts
or scandal-blasted Grant to play _ nor easy for Grant to play
innocently.
</P>
<P>
   Anna's self-absorbed whining is often poignant but sometimes
sounds like the special pleading of a poor little
$15-million-a-picture superstar. But at least the basically
diffident William busts her on it, indicating that, nice schlub
though he may be, there's backbone under the doormat. In fact,
Anna's sporadic brattiness also gives the film another realistic
obstacle to true love _ and bravo to Roberts for playing it without
vanity.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Grant and Roberts ooze charm as
lavishly as their heads grow spectacular hair. You not only want
them to be together, you want to be together with at least one of
them, which is a necessary effect if this art-reflects-life comedy
is to work at all.
</P>
<P>
   The other characters in the film, mostly William's
acquaintances, blend into a kind of Keystone Kops emotional rescue
squad. But Rhys Ifans has his moments as Spike, William's gangly
Welsh roommate, a dumb slob who, predictably if paradoxically,
always has the best advice for his confused friend.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Roger Michell, a British stage and TV veteran.
He likes to let actors take their time with one another, and that
provides a great balance to the cutesier, more sitcomish elements
of Curtis' screenplay. He makes sure ``Notting Hill'' accommodates
the specifics of two people growing together as well as hitting all
of the standard love story marks.
</P>
<P>
   For a film about loving someone who makes Hollywood movies these
days, that's romantic fantasy of an unusually high order. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coming as it does in the considerable wake of
``The Matrix,'' the virtual worlds of ``The Thirteenth Floor'' can
only feel like a bit of a letdown. Visually stylish with some
striking retro landscapes, this movie and its innumerable
ambiguities are often quite interesting, but never completely
engaging.
</P>
<P>
   What it lacks most is the kind of jaw-dropping moment that made
Keanu Reeves _ and movie audiences _ so memorably murmur, ``Whoa.''
Instead, you'll have content yourself with a ``Huh.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite the same, is it?
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens promisingly enough in a sepia-toned, 1937 Los
Angeles where a tuxedo-clad gentleman named Hannon Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) hands a confidential letter to a hotel nightclub
bartender. Next thing we know, Fuller wakes up in a modern-day
skyscraper, and we learn that the past he was visiting wasn't real
_ he created it on a computer. Everything in it is a virtual
simulation, even the comely chorus girls that Fuller so ardently
enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   This trip was Fuller's last, though. He's murdered right after
placing a phone call to his partner, Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko),
the same man Fuller left the note for at the hotel. Hall is
devastated _ and confused. He can't remember where he was the night
Fuller was murdered, and the fact that Fuller's bloody tuxedo shirt
lies in the top of his hamper doesn't exactly bode well, either.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than call Johnnie Cochran for legal advice, Hall decides
to go back in time and see what his partner was doing. The lines
between fact and fantasy shift back and forth (and back and forth)
when Hall meets a mysterious beauty named Jane (Gretchen Mol) who
may hold the key not only to Fuller's death but to the nature of
life itself.
</P>
<P>
   While all this may sound kind of absorbing and substantial, the
screenplay (credited to director Josef Rusnak and Ravel
Centeno-Rodriguez) unravels once the plot thickens. Other problems:
Wooden dialogue and bad acting (Bierko and Mol being the main
culprits.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, like other science-fiction entries such as ``The Matrix''
and ``The Phantom Menace,'' ``The Thirteenth Floor'' does offer
some arresting visual images, particularly the period scenes in Los
Angeles. We roll down Wilshire Boulevard looking at undeveloped
land and oil derricks _ and no traffic jams. Rusnak can't resist
hammering home the present-day contrasts, inserting a shot of the
city's modern, concrete-and-steel skyline nearly every five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the movie's landscapes seemed as authentic as its
washed-out 1930s world, ``The Thirteenth Floor'' might feel a
little more genuine itself. But the film's existential noodlings
simply don't hold up. And here, too, it suffers in comparison with
``The Matrix,'' a movie that actually improves with a second
viewing. Here, once (if that) is quite enough, thank you. &QL;

REVIEW: `KEEPERS OF THE FLAME'

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Keepers of the Frame'' is an informative and
comprehensive documentary about the effort to save what's left of
our disintegrating film heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In understandable though hardly dumbed-down terms, preservation
experts from the continent's top film archives (UCLA, Eastman
House, the Museum of Modern Art, the Library of Congress) explain
how chemical decomposition already has wiped out some 90 percent of
silent movies and is reducing many of the later, color productions
to pink mush.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the technical aspects of this underfunded race
against time inevitably gets a bit dry at times. But director Mark
McLaughlin keeps things moving along at an agreeable clip with
examples of crumbling and preserved footage and comments from an
assortment of celebrities (Debbie Reynolds, Alan Alda, the late
Roddy McDowall, critic Leonard Maltin).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most effectively, McLaughlin gives us arguments for
saving art, ethnographic and even home movies for their priceless _
albeit uncommercial _ historical record of the ways people acted,
looked and thought through the decades. ``Keepers of the Frame''
not only shows us how dedicated men and women are struggling to
preserve as much as they can of the first film century; it also
shows us many aspects of that legacy we may never have otherwise
considered. &QL;

REVIEW: `LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE'

Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As its title unintentionally warns us, ``The Loss
of Sexual Innocence'' revels in pretentiousness. It's the kind of
movie most people are talking about when they say art films are
stupid. Don't expect critics to offer many counterarguments this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   A (gulp!) ``non-narrative'' piece written by its British
director Mike Figgis, ``Innocence'' is, as far as can be
ascertained, an impressionistic collection of thoughts and personal
experiences the filmmaker perceives as formative. Many of these are
related to, well, sex, coupled more often than not with some kind
of growth trauma.
</P>
<P>
   These free-form psyche doodles are interspersed with a
self-conscious Adam and Eve parable (he's black, she's anorexic,
and their Eden features a symbolic white horse as well as the usual
serpent population). This is presumably meant to add philosophical
significance to such scenes as a chubby kid who doesn't want to go
to gym class getting beat up in his underwear. Then again, it could
just be an excuse to show people naked.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Figgis' genuine gifts for visual poetry and
atmospheric intensity are showcased best when he works with a solid
plotline (``Internal Affairs'') and richly developed characters
(``Leaving Las Vegas''). A musician and composer who also creates
his own film scores, he's going for a purely lyrical image flow in
``Sexual Innocence.'' But the best thing about that approach is
that it limits dialogue to an absolute minimum, which must be a
blessing. It's better to hear music, including some nice Chopin and
Mozart piano sonatas, accompany the painfully artsy pictures than
windy verbiage explaining the significance of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Figgis' gauzy eroticism isn't all that hard to
decipher; it's just resoundingly trite when you do. His idea of
revealing sexual fantasies runs along the lines of trains entering
stations and negligees worn to jazz clubs. Figgis' visual metaphor
for a tense marriage? Nic (Julian Sands) fondles his
reluctant/receptive wife (Johanna Torrel) while she chops carrots
in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about twins (both Saffron Burrows, who was the
posh girl in ``Circle of Friends''), separated at birth and
encountering each other briefly, that plays like one of Krzysztof
Kieslowski's afterthoughts. And as long as we're talking
derivative, why does every shot in the second half of this
supposedly personal film look like something out of a 35-year-old
Italian movie?
</P>
<P>
   We jump around from Nic's Kenyan childhood to his ardent
adolescence (when he's played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) to his
adult, Sands-played incarnation as some kind of filmmaker pursuing
some kind of vision _ and one of the Burrows twins _ in the
Tunisian desert. Between how that adventure dreadfully concludes
and our pals Adam and Eve's fallen encounter with a ravenous pack
of paparazzi, Figgis seems to believe the main culprit in our
collective loss of sexual innocence is the camera.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting through what he's shot here, you'll be inclined to
agree. &QL;

THE STIFF UPPER LIP QUIVERS, AFTER ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When writer-director David Mamet decided to direct a new version
of ``The Winslow Boy,'' he knew what he was doing. The material, a
warhorse of a play that has been performed at many a high school,
is about the troubles that befall a privileged London family when
its honor is assaulted. Winslow, 13, has been expelled from the
Naval Academy because he's accused of stealing. The family gives up
everything _ its money, its future _ to combat the attack on its
reputation that this charge becomes.
</P>
<P>
   This premise doesn't sound like something that would attract a
talent like Mamet. But Mamet embraces the squareness of playwright
Terence Rattigan's drama and improves upon it, in part by pulling
off a thoughtful trick. He doesn't play up the trial, which could
have been given the whooping adrenaline rush of ``A Few Good Men.''
Mamet knows we can handle the truth, especially the theatrical
parading of morality that passes for truth in a courtroom
melodrama. Instead, Mamet has chosen to go deep. He fixes his
sights on the rigidity of the upper class and the emotions under
all those waistcoats and corsets.
</P>
<P>
   The formalism of the staging corresponds to the bearing of
Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne), the smug patriarch who rules the
roost. When his son comes home and has to reveal what has happened,
the tension simmers in the room. But then an odd moment
materializes. Arthur looks his son square in the eye and asks,
``Were you so afraid to tell me the truth?'' Suddenly ``Winslow''
becomes as much about the love of a family as it is the pursuit of
what's right as compared to justice. This flinty-eyed old prat is
also revealed as a fierce papa bear who will do anything for his
children.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Winslow Boy'' moves forward, we can't help but feel
contemporary resonance. It seems remarkably similar to the
publicity and eventual impeachment trial surrounding the President
Clinton/Monica Lewinsky situation. This connection couldn't have
been planned. Yet Mamet's intent to strip away the stiff-backed
manner of the upper-class Brits gives this old chestnut new life.
</P>
<P>
   And a play that seemed like a joke takes on a whole new life.
Incredibly, its power intensifies when lawyer Sir Robert Morton
(Jeremy Northam) takes on the case. We're shocked that this frigid
barrister is capable of feeling; he's not just an imperious prig.
He's also not the forward thinker he seems to be, as Arthur's
daughter (Rebecca Pidgeon), who's part of her brother's fight as
well, finds out. A withered, beaten man by the time the trial comes
to its conclusion, Arthur has been forced to ask some questions.
When his wife asks, ``Why are you doing this? He'll never remember
it,'' we wonder, too. But by that point, Mamet's cool, elegant
direction has pulled us deeply into what might have seemed
frivolous on the surface: an examination of Old World heroism and
sacrifice.

Y2K OBSESSION: MILLENNIUM BUG WILL CAUSE SEVERE ECONOMIC WOES,
AUTHOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's that stockpiling going?
</P>
<P>
   For many, that question is a serious reference to gathering the
water, food, generators and other things needed to survive when the
mother of all computer glitches, known as Y2K, causes societal
chaos come Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the Y2K scare is a joke. They scorn the doomsday
predicted for the first day of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planner John Mauldin of Arlington, Texas, suggests a
middle-of-the-road approach. He says the Y2K bug will cause severe
economic woes worldwide, but he stops short of suggesting that you
stockpile toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin predicts a serious economic downturn _ at least in the
short term. He predicts that the Y2K problem will cause the first
significant recession in the United States in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries even less prepared for the changeover than the
United States will face massive unemployment and depressions, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin's predictions and suggestions are in his book, ``How to
Profit From The Y2K Recession ... By Converting the Year 2000
Crisis into an Opportunity for Your Investments and Business,''
(St. Martin's Press, 352 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   When I first glanced at the book title, I thought it read ``How
to Profit from The Y2K `Obsession.''' With all the outrageous
survivalist products and land deals out there, this book seemed a
natural. After learning that Mauldin publishes a Year 2000 Alert
monthly investment newsletter, lectures at Y2K investment
conferences and is a self-appointed ``expert'' on investment issues
regarding Y2K, I think my misread title may still be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer industry consultants say that the bulk of Y2K
problems are being addressed and that most of the glitches will be
fixed in time to avert a catastrophe. Mauldin even quotes a survey
by Ziff-Davis, a media and marketing company that publishes trade
magazines such as PC Week and Interactive Week. The survey
indicates that 150 small and medium-sized U.S. business are
optimistic about meeting their Y2K deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin, whose budding media empire depends on fueling Y2K
concerns, discounts the Ziff-Davis survey results. ``Of all the
reports, studies, surveys and stories about Y2K that I have read,
this survey amazes me the most. It boggles my mind ... If those of
you who are in business get nothing else from this book, I hope
that you will come away with an understanding that this is a
serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He then quotes numerous articles, congressional speakers,
professors and others to build his case for the seriousness of the
Millennium Bug. It is destined to be, Mauldin suggests, ``the cause
of the mother of all traffic jams on the information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin then addresses multiple areas of Y2K concern _ from
utilities to banks to businesses _ and devotes a chapter to each,
focusing on the big troubles that he says await key sectors of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among his economic predictions for the United States within the
first 18 months of 2000:
</P>
<P>
   _Double-digit unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   _Stock market declines of 50 percent below its 1999 highs.
</P>
<P>
   _Billions of dollars in deficits.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that electricity, phone service and other
infrastructure elements may be down for a time but should be up and
running efficiently by the third week of January. As for the
stockpiled food, he suggests donating it to food banks and homeless
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   But by the second quarter of the year 2000, the strains of Y2K
will begin affecting the economy in general, Mauldin predicts. More
businesses will go bankrupt than normal because of the ripple
effects of Y2K, unemployment will reach the highest levels in 25
years and the stock market will ``get ugly,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin offers financial advice _ such as hedge funds _ to
counter the economic downturn. He also has advice for businesses
that may not have looked at this issue or its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And the good news is that Mauldin sees a bull market after the
Y2K recession. He offers ideas on how to capitalize best on that as
well.

are myriad newer companies, including Internet book distributor
amazom.com and coffee shop chain Starbuck's. Author Thomas Wilson

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, Italy _ In a working-class neighborhood near the Coliseum,
the writing is on the wall regarding NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``No to the American War,'' reads the graffiti scrawled on a
public building. ``Clinton the assassin. D'Alema (the Italian prime
minister) the accomplice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the sentiment is the same. A message spray-painted
along the NATO supply route from Greek ports to the Macedonian
border reads: ``Adolf Clinton, call off your dogs and stop the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Few thought it would last this long -- the two-month-old war
over Kosovo, or the unity of the 19-country NATO coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Italy, Germany and Greece -- NATO countries
vital to the air war or to the effort to build up ground forces in
Macedonia and Albania -- have faced intense pressure at home to
halt their support for the campaign. Their governments,
particularly in Italy and Greece, have maintained their qualified
support for the bombing despite fierce public protests from the
outset of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Their task may have been made easier by the announcement
Thursday by the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal of indictments
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the ethnic
cleansing of the Kosovo province's Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the indictments reinforce the NATO argument that
the war is necessary and serve to authoritatively rebuke the
strident anti-war rhetoric from pacifists, Communists and Serb
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Rome, some agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO should go through with this until Milosevic is kicked
out,'' said Morelli Pasquale, 63, a barber who initially opposed
the war. ``I don't want war. I don't like this war. But sadly the
behavior of Milosevic requires it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Germany, Italy and Greece, the leaders are on shaky
political ground. They are seeking on the one hand to remain loyal
NATO partners and on the other to maintain their ruling center-left
coalitions, which include factions vehemently opposed to the NATO
action.
</P>
<P>
   Those domestic strains have had a direct effect on NATO policy
as the alliance has searched for an end-game to force Milosevic's
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO military planners have eyed the possibility of a
ground troop invasion of Kosovo, the option has effectively been
shelved, for the time being, because of the political realities for
key NATO states.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called the possibility
of a NATO ground offensive ``unthinkable.'' Italy has said it could
only take place if sanctioned by a United Nations Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Greece have pressed for a temporary suspension of the
air war in order to allow Serb forces the opportunity to withdrawal
from the province. The United States, Britain and France have
refused to consider a bombing pause.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, there was no disagreement on a NATO decision to
boost forces in the region to 50,000 troops for future peacekeeping
duty. There is no quarrel on the need for a secure means to return
the more than 1.5 million displaced Kosovo refugees to their homes.
The tough question is whether NATO soldiers would go in before or
after a negotiated end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems arise more toward the way the war is being conducted
by the NATO military rather than to its end purpose,'' said Cesare
Merlini, head of the Rome-based Institute for International
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   How the coalition has remained intact despite the political
differences reveals much about European politics today. At stake in
NATO's war against the Serbs is the very definition of European and
trans-Atlantic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Failure could have far-reaching implications on the future
effectiveness of European unity at a crucial time as the continent
seeks to implement a single currency and other steps to political
and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be the model of the way the new Europe
works -- security cooperation, economic unity -- and to divide
would be to lose all credibility for this new order,'' said Patrick
McCarthy, a professor of European studies at Johns Hopkins
University in Bologna, Italy(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, NATO's credibility, perhaps its very existence, has
become intertwined with the war against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans are trying to keep their act together. But they
won't be able to do it if they set themselves up as patsies to be
had by a two-bit dictator such as Milosevic,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Most combat sorties against Yugoslavia are flown from NATO bases
in Italy, whose left-wing and Communist parties have been vocal
opponents of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American sentiment in Italy is high and U.S. forces here
have been targets of death threats and street assaults. Security
has been tightened at bases and military personnel have been warned
to keep a low profile and wear civilian clothes when traveling in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is not the sheriff of the world,'' complained Moresco
Vittorio, an airline clerk who lives in the predominantly
left-wing, working-class neighborhood of Testaccio in Rome. ``We're
just being used. We must make our own decision to do what is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiment reveals what political analysts say is
double-edged discontent with the war: First, that NATO is bombing
Yugoslavia, a sovereign country and longtime Communist friend. And
second that Italy, because of its NATO obligations, is powerless to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian perception of its role as America's pawn was further
fueled recently when Italian fishermen protested because they have
been snagging unexploded NATO bombs in their nets. NATO jets, upon
returning to their bases in Italy, routinely jettison their
undelivered bombs in the Adriatic Sea before landing. The U.S. and
NATO failed to notify Italy of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, meanwhile, presides over a precarious left-center
coalition that includes Greens and Communists opposed to NATO's air
campaign. Further significant pressure in Italy comes from the
Vatican, where Pope John Paul II has spoken out against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet NATO's five original demands for a halt to the airstrikes
remain the basis of Italy's policy. These include a verifiable
cease-fire; the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo;
the unconditional return of all refugees; deployment of an
international peacekeeping force in the province; and the
acceptance by Belgrade of a political process that will restore
broad autonomy to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Alema is under tremendous pressure and he has played it very
well so far. He has remained very loyal to NATO while allowing
people to speak out against the bombing. It leaves the impression
within the coalition that there's nothing to worry about, it's just
the Italians being the Italians. But the pressure is very real and
I don't know how long the government can last,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of the air campaign, Greece has demanded a
48-hour bombing pause as public opinion there remains
overwhelmingly opposed to the airstrikes. Many Greeks feel sympathy
for their fellow Christian Orthodox Serbs and fear conflict in the
Balkans could spread south and shatter Greece's current political
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit this week to Washington, Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou said a temporary suspension could promote
diplomacy and eventual approval of a U.N. Security Council
resolution on a settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His government also expressed disappointment with the indictment
of Milosevic, the only NATO member to do so. ``This move is
politically wrong because it will not help the peace process,''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters in Athens.

CHEVRON TO TRIM ITS SAN FRANCISCO PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 and RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the latest blow to San Francisco's corporate
image, the Chevron Corp. says it will its Market Street
headquarters and move as many as 1,000 employees to other Bay-other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting move, which is expected to be completed by the
end of next year, will leave about 500 workers, including the
company's top executives, in the city, which Chevron will continue
to name as its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Well over 7,000 Chevron workers will be based throughout the
East Bay. No jobs are expected to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made as part of cost-reduction efforts that
will save more than $500 million this year, said Dave O'Reilly,
vice chairman of the nation's fourth largest oil company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidating many of our San Francisco employees into our
offices in the East Bay makes good economic sense,'' O'Reilly said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which has been based in San Francisco for more than 75
years, said it would put its two office towers on Market Street on
the market immediately. Following the sale, the company plans to
lease back office space for its corporate suite.
</P>
<P>
   The two high-rise buildings, totaling 750,000 square feet, could
sell for as much as $225 million, according to Jay Seiden, manager
of research services at Marcus &AMP; Millichap, a San Francisco-based
real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron employees were notified of the company's plan Wednesday
afternoon, after the move was approved Tuesday by the company's
executive committee and Wednesday morning by the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Most employees now working in San Francisco will be transferred
to the corporation's San Ramon and Concord offices.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of several high-profile acquisitions of San
Francisco-based corporations by out-of-state and foreign companies,
the moves could be seen as another dent in San Francisco's
reputation as a premier city for corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Transamerica Corp., BankAmerica Corp., Pacific Telesis Group,
AirTouch Communications Inc., Montgomery Securities Inc. and
Robertson Stephens Inc. all have been swallowed up in such deals in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the press secretary for Mayor Willie Brown,
noted the city's successful efforts to lure multimedia companies,
film industry business and a new University of California at San
Francisco campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's jobs in, jobs out,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, however, was less
phlegmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me to be a pretty ungrateful act,'' Ammiano said
of Chevron's plan. ``San Francisco has bent over backwards for
Chevron. It's not like there's a bad business climate here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano noted that Chevron had recently received several tax
rebates and credits and had historically been very successful in
lobbying the board on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron has extensive operations in the East Bay already. Some
6,600 workers are spread over four major sites in Richmond,
Concord, San Ramon and Walnut Creek.

THE FORCE OF `STAR WARS' SPARKS VIDEO GAME SPINOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GLENN RUBENSTEIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace'' breaking box office records, and Episode 2's release still
three years off, many Star Wars fans need an outlet for their Force
hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are action figures, story books and the Taco Bell
meets KFC meets Pizza Hut ``Feel the Force'' sweepstakes, but what
does a fan do when all this is still not enough? Short of seeing
the movie again and again, many die-hard fans will be left cold by
what most Star Wars-related products have to offer (Jar Jar Binks
throw pillow anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars creator George Lucas hopes to fill that void with
video games. Among the hundreds of licensed Phantom Menace
products, the most interesting (and interactive) are the related
video games, two of which were released last week in conjunction
with the opening of the film. The games are part of Lucas' overall
licensing and marketing strategy for the film.
</P>
<P>
   LucasArts Entertainment, which develops games, is an especially
profitable part of the Lucas business empire. With software titles
based on Star Wars characters, Indiana Jones and original
properties like the Monkey Island series, the company consistently
has top-ranked computer game titles. In addition, through an
alliance with video game giant Nintendo, games that LucasArts has
developed _ like ``Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire'' _ have moved
more than a million units in the video game cartridge format.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has looked to start publishing its
own games for console systems like the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation,
just as it has for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Forbes magazine placed Lucas on its annual list,
``The World's 200 Working Rich,'' estimating his fortune at $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Lucas struck when he made the original Star Wars movie
for 20th Century Fox allowed him to keep both the sequel and
merchandising rights for the film. Since 1977, the Star Wars
trilogy has generated an estimated $4.5 billion in product sales.
</P>
<P>
   When the films were released as a special edition in 1997, the
licensing blitz for all things Star Wars heated up again, and
``Phantom Menace'' would appear to have more licensed products and
promotional tie-ins than any other movie in history. The formula
has worked in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single
biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of
the Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to
``Phantom Menace'' could exceed those of the industry's
merchandising champion, ``The Lion King.'' Brochstein estimated
that the Disney film had sold about $1.5 billion worth of toys,
mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (`Phantom Menace')
didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally remains to be seen, but the two video games
currently available are sure to help the bottom line. The two games
are ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' (LucasArts for
PC; PlayStation version available shortly) and ``Star Wars: Episode
I Racer'' (LucasArts for PC and Nintendo 64).
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars fans can look forward to at least two more titles this
year. In June, LucasArts plans to release one for the PC that looks
at the making of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
Also planned is a PC game called ``Star Wars: Episode I _
Obi-Wan,'' which is similar to ``Star Wars: Dark Forces,'' an
earlier game that is a first-person adventure in the style of
``Doom'' or ``Quake.'' It's scheduled for release in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   LucasArts also has just released ``The Gungun Frontier,'' a
hybrid CD-ROM (it will run on both PCs and Macs). Players try to
help Jar Jar Binks establish a new colony on a nearby moon.

 &HT;    `Notting Hill' an honest and funny look at the attraction of
opposites
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time a friend reminds bookseller William Thacker (Hugh
Grant) of the troubles that befall mortals who ``get involved with
the gods,'' it's too late. William has fallen for that '90s version
of Olympian allure, movie star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), who one
day wanders into his shop.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Notting Hill,'' writer Richard Curtis (``Four Weddings and
a Funeral'') mines this unequal pairing for comedy, megawatt
romance and some delicate shades of melancholy. William and Anna
are opposites drawn to each other through different kinds of
isolation. She lives in a flashlit fishbowl of fame, he in the
anonymous, workaday grind. Curtis and director Roger Michell
(``Persuasion'') present this unlikely mating dance with sly, funny
observations. That's especially true in the movie's best scene:
William takes Anna, unannounced, to his sister's birthday dinner,
resulting in wildly different reactions from family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But as the on-and-off romance unfolds, ``Hill'' sags into screen
cliches. (You can be sure, in stale Hollywood tradition, that if
Henry James novels and a Chagall painting are mentioned, they will
reappear for a tidy payoff in the final reel.) It's disappointing,
considering the ways Curtis tweaked romantic-comedy conventions in
``Weddings.'' The supporting cast in ``Hill'' isn't as defined as
in that movie. In one case, a character is a cartoon. That's
William's flatmate, the Welsh flake Spike (Rhys Ifans), who pads
around with his pasty flesh hanging out for easy laughs. He's this
movie's equivalent of Jar Jar Binks in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the stars' charisma rides over the occasional flat
patches. For Roberts, this is a savvy career move, a chance to cast
a sympathetic light on her real-life existence as paparazzi target
and water-cooler fantasy figure. (A scene where Anna tlenhaal) and
three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and shoot off model
rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which could help them
escape a future of working in the coal mine of their small town.

   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his

   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)

plays Greg, a high-school senior whose plans for college keep
getting waylaid by his fantasies of living the phat life,
surrounded by gorgeous women whose sole goal in life is to show him

stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care, thoughtfulness and even
a theatrical spark to the material. Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy

   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly

leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    Image, extremes of Vietnam today
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winner of three awards at the Sundance Film Festival _ the grand
jury prize, the audience award and best cinematography _ ``Three
Seasons'' also holds the distinction of being the first U.S. film
shot in Vietnam since the war. Twenty-six-year-old Tony Bui, a
Vietnamese-American born in Vietnam but raised in California, has a
natural eye for beautiful images and a naif's predilection for
emotional epiphanies. Thus, his feature debut is narratively facile
yet visually rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons'' interweaves several obliquely connected
stories into a tenderly appealing pastiche. In one, a simple
country girl, Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep), hired to pick lotus
flowers for a reclusive master poet (Tran Manh Cuong), dares to
penetrate the floating temple that's become his self-appointed
floating tomb. In another, Hai (Don Duong), a kindhearted cyclo
driver _ a cyclo is like a rickshaw-bicycle combo _ is smitten with
an ambitious call girl (Zoe Bui) who works Saigon's posher hotels.
Frequenting those same lobbies, though with considerably less
success, is Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc), a street urchin who hawks
lighters and chewing gum from his tattered merchandise case.
Finally, there's James (Harvey Keitel), a Vietnam vet looking for
the daughter _ and the inner peace _ he left behind two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company that helped produce ``Three Seasons'' is Open City
Films. So if there's a whiff of Italian neorealism in the film's
simple, unadorned style, it's probably intentional. Yet Bui has his
own voice. While he acknowledges the scars left by the war and the
disastrous Western residue that's turning Saigon into a place full
of Coca-Cola signs and artificially scented plastic lotuses, he
also shows us a Vietnam that's not just killing fields or steaming
jungles in which a Stallone can play out foolish retro-macho
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he presents a country in transition, caught between a
conflicted past and an uncertain future. The pace is slow
(sometimes irritatingly so) and the stories are predictable
(ditto). But there's an omnipresent lyricism that's seductive. And
when Bui tosses off a shot of Kien An and her fellow lotus-pluckers
floating serenely in the otherworldly embrace of giant waterlily
pads, you know you're in the good hands of a born filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harvey Keitel, Nguyen Ngoc Hiep and Don Duong. Directed
by Tony Bui. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo. With
subtitles. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This Sundance fave is an appealing pastiche of
stories set in postwar Vietnam.

 &HT;    Subliminally, director was drawn to native Vietnam
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was born in Vietnam, but from the age of 2 grew up in
Sunnyvale, Calif. When he was 19, writer-director Tony Bui returned
for the first time to his birthplace to visit his grandparents. He
hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four hours I wanted to go back home,'' he says during a
recent Atlanta visit to promote ``Three Seasons,'' his feature
debut which won three awards at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
``I'm sure I insulted everyone around me. It was too hot, it was
too humid. Where I was staying, there was no running water, no
electricity. There was an outhouse in back. I'd never left the U.S.
before, and I'd grown up in the suburbs, so it was a real culture
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   He experienced another kind of shock when he returned to
California two weeks later. He realized he couldn't wait to return
to Vietnam. ``I felt very sad and embarrassed because I'd wanted to
leave, and I couldn't understand why I was being drawn back,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Consciously, he'd recoiled from the alien sounds, smells and
tastes of the country. But on a subliminal level, those very things
had begun to haunt him: The morning cries of women in the streets,
hawking porridge and bread; the tinkling of bells on passing
bicycles. ``All the different textures and sights and sounds would
be in my head every morning when I woke up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So Bui returned several times to Vietnam, staying with family
and becoming fluent in the language. That came in handy when he
decided to write ``Three Seasons'' and shoot in Ho Chi Minh City
(formerly Saigon). It became the first American film shot in
Vietnam since the war, and the first to be acted in Vietnamese by
native actors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for Harvey Keitel, who plays an American vet
looking for the daughter he sired during the war. His is only one
of four interwoven story lines. The movie includes the tale of a
young woman who befriends a reclusive, dying poet; a cyclo driver
who falls for a brash prostitute; and a street urchin trying to
make ends meet by selling trinkets. The characters and much of the
dialogue derive from people whom Bui, 26, met in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was going to focus on one story,'' he says. ``But I
liked them all so much, I decided I would create this fabric, and
each story would be a thread.''
</P>
<P>
   Keitel's participation helped Bui secure funding, though at
their first meeting, Keitel told the filmmaker that he was ``99.9
percent'' sure he couldn't take the role. Even so, he promised he'd
read the screenplay within seven days and make a decision. Bui
remembers, ``I left the meeting and thought, `Yeah, right. I bet he
gives that line to everyone.' I couldn't even get my mom to read it
in seven days. But he did.''

IN SOCCER, THEY AGE GRACEFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Walter Zenga's friends and former teammates are moving
on, retiring, being eased out from their playing careers. Or, they
are reinventing themselves as coaches, player-coaches, and elder
statesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Zenga and Lothar Matthaus helped Inter win the
Italian Serie A championship, the climax of a brief return to glory
for the Milan club.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zenga and Matthaus are involved in other projects. Zenga is
attempting to transform the Revolution, who have earned only seven
points in nine games going into their visit to the MetroStars
Saturday. Matthaus is on a bigger stage, playing Wednesday for
Bayern Munich against Manchester United in the European Champions
League final in Barcelona before 80,000 spectators and a 500
million-plus television audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthaus shows what the mentality of soccer is,'' Zenga said.
``If you feel strong, if you have pride and courage, you can play
when you are 38. If you lose that passion, you can't do anything,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also luck and having someone believe in you. If I
lose a game and only have seven points I can be angry. But I am
only angry when we lose. On Monday, I am thinking only about New
York. And after New York I will be thinking only about Chicago,''
the Revolution's next opponent June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has attempted to restore the Revolution's confidence after
three successive losing seasons. His formula is to provide
consistency in game preparations, defensive organization, and
world-class goalkeeping. The methods appeared to be working at the
beginning of the season, but now the team is nearing a crossroads,
with only one point and without a regulation-time victory since
April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``One point in a month can be a nightmare,'' Zenga said. ``By
the end of the season I am 100 percent sure we will have a good
team. But if we don't continue to work, if we don't continue to
believe, we will have a graph that goes up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has helped keep the Revolution in contention in most games
this season. Their only two-goal defeat occurred at Columbus two
weeks ago. So, the team has been able to retain some self-belief,
despite a 340-minute goal drought. Last season, the Revolution's
credibility was shattered after it began surrendering five and six
goals in games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution might be depending too much on Zenga's
goalkeeping, much as Bayern Munich needed Matthaus Wednesday. After
Matthaus was substituted, Bayern surrendered two last-minute goals
in a 2-1 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have not settled into a coherent attacking
formation, partially because of a lineup unsettled due to injuries.
Neither of their two most creative midfielders, Edwin Gorter and
Jair, have had an impact. Gorter did not travel to Los Angeles
because of a groin strain, but he has been practicing at near full
speed and said he expects to be on the bench against the
MetroStars. Jair has been playing on the right side of midfield,
minimizing his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A change in formation might change the team's fortunes, but
Zenga plans to stay with a 4-4-2 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the coach who makes the formation, but the qualities
of the players,'' Zenga said. ``My mentality is a 4-4-2, we want to
have two forwards and a No. 10. Anyway, a 4-4-2 will become a 3-5-2
as soon as one of the outside backs moves into the midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is not about numbers, but about mentality,
pride, and courage. The only difficult thing in soccer is when you
lose, because then it is easy to think you are bad. We have to
continue to follow our philosophy, not change just because we lost
a game.''

TIME FOR BUSINESSMEN TO PICK UP THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A month ago, Bob Kraft did the right thing. A week
ago, the Massachusetts legislature did the right thing. Twenty four
hours ago, the NFL did the right thing. Now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   Now the businessmen and businesswomen of Boston have to do the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Kraft did what he always promised he would, turning
his back on a pile of money so high it is difficult to fathom and
coming home to Massachusetts on a promise and little more. Kraft
walked away from a free stadium and guaranteed revenue in Hartford
that could have totaled more than a billion dollars because he
never wanted to go there in the first place and proved it in the
only way a businessman can. They showed him the money and he showed
them the door.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Kraft peeked through the door a few times and looked
at the pile but in the end one of the pet phrases of Kraft's mortal
enemy, Bill Parcells, speaks truthfully of this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go by what I see,'' Parcells often says and if you look in
Foxborough today and for many years to come, you will see the New
England Patriots there. You have Bob Kraft and no one else to thank
for that because he did not do what the Harvard Business School
taught him. He didn't take the money.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't take it in part because all those stories he used to
tell about the Boston Braves leaving town really were in his heart
and partly because local pols and business leaders promised they
would help him solve his stadium financing problems. A week ago,
against all odds if you know their history, the hacks in the
legislature came through on their end, doing what they said they
would by approving $70 million in funding to build roads, sewars,
and off-ramps even though they insisted on extracting a pound of
flesh by making Kraft the only owner in American sports history to
have to pay back infrastructure money, making him repay half that
sum over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday, NFL owners voted 28 to 1 with two abstentions to
grant Kraft a ``loan'' of slightly more than $141 million to cover
half the cost of building what he projects to be a $277 million
stadium ($250 million for the stadium and $27 million in land
acquisitions). The Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos received
similar financial assistance with their stadium projects but far
less total cash because both have more than double the public
funding Kraft received.
</P>
<P>
   That ``loan'' will be repaid from the 40 percent share visiting
teams receive of stadium income generated by the 9,000 club seats
the Patriots' new home will have; that is where Boston's business
leaders have a rare opportunity _ the opportunity to put their
money where their mouths have been.
</P>
<P>
   They promised to buy those seats, seats your average Patriot fan
could never afford, if Kraft came home from Connecticut. Now we'll
see if they do what Kraft, the legislature, and the NFL has done.
Now we'll see if they deliver or if their words prove to be more
empty than their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   If he builds it, will they come?
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, before he builds it, will they buy club seats
so critical to the financing plan?
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue spoke briefly about that
Wednesday, saying he will return to Boston next month to try to
coax business leaders into coming through on what both he and Kraft
view as a pledge to buy those 9,000 club seats.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, a second provision takes the ``loan'' money off
the top of the league's television revenue but one of the
abstaining voters, Raiders owner Al Davis, said he is not happy
about that provision and questions its legality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I didn't want to do anything to hurt Bob,'' Davis said
Wednesday. ``I'm glad he got what he needed to stay in Boston. But
this is a tax on all the teams that are not doing as well (as the
teams with new stadiums).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of owners didn't want to see Bob move out of Boston to
Hartford. They got him back to New England so they had to make him
promises. But never before in the history of the league have the
poor given to the rich for them to do well. When they destroyed us
at Hollywood Park, they didn't talk about TV revenue (as a form of
financial assistance).'' Hollywood Park is where the then Los
Angeles Raiders hoped to build a stadium in 1995 before the league
refused to grant Davis all the help he believed was necessary and,
he says, began to work against the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of TV revenue to cover a shortfall may not even be
legal,'' Davis said. ``We don't think it is. But a lot of them have
stadium problems and it's tough to get them to change their minds.
They can only think of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Davis's doubts and the lone no vote of Cincinnati
Bengals owner Mike Brown, Bob Kraft got what he needed Wednesday.
He got help from his partners, even though he still will end up on
the hook for between $150 million and $200 million in new loans to
cover his end of the project.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't have yet is help from his friends. If the
Patriots' stadium deal is going to work, it's time for the FOBs
(Friends of Bob) to do what they asked Kraft and the legislature
and the NFL to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for them to spend some money. Their own.

DON'T LET DANCE FEVER HIT TOO SOON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tricia Tanner has a date, a shimmery new blue dress, and an
appointment for a manicure and hairdo. ``This is going to be a lot
of fun,'' she says about the dance June 18 that will mark the end
of her years at Chenery Middle School in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Middle school.
</P>
<P>
   Kids call the dance ``the semi,'' as in semiformal, even though
the Parent Teacher Organization which sponsors it calls it simply a
dinner dance. Last year, three limos delivered students to the
school, at least one boy wore a tux, and some girls had corsages.
This year, principal Deborah Alexander has sent out a letter to
discourage such grown-up and extravagant gestures for 14-year-olds,
especially having dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the messages we're giving our kids when we let
them do things that are not age appropriate,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to tone the dance down are controversial. Robin
Gabrielle Moore, cochair of the PTO committee in charge, doesn't
see what the fuss is about. ``It's just a fun night,'' she says, a
conclusion she came to after attending the dance last year and
determining that behavior didn't get ``out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say it's not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents, the Tanners included, feel pressured by a culture
that encourages children to try on inappropriate grown-up behavior.
At the same time, they don't want to be so rigid that they create
barriers to communication. For them, a dance like this is the
perfect, albeit unintended, symbol of the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' says Tricia's mother, Shawn, ``this whole thing has
been the largest issue we've ever had with her.'' Their solution
was to compromise: Tricia wanted to shop in December, they held her
off until February; she paid for the dress with baby-sitting money,
but her parents bought the bolero jacket they insisted she wear to
cover its skimpy top. They'll split the cost of hairdo and
manicure.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Voce, also an eighth-grade Chenery parent, wishes the
event to end the Chenery years was not a dance. ``We need something
more inclusive,'' she says. ``Something that appeals to a wider
range of kids, so every child can feel good about sharing the
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A meaningful recognition
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with marking the end of middle school;
the problem is how it's done,'' agrees psychologist and author
David Elkind, a professor at Tufts University. ``You need to look
at this in a context of what children this age are capable of
appreciating. Of what has meaning for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when they are feeling small and vulnerable because of
the looming transition to high school, what has most meaning is an
event that acknowledges their growth and links it to how well
prepared they are for what's next, says developmental psychologist
William Damon, director of the Center on Adolescence at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   His preference is an achievement dinner, where everyone is
recongized either individually or in a group, as well as some
social event, preferably a field day off-site. He counsels against
anything that looks like a graduation _ ``They're not leaving their
community; they're not making choices about their path in life;
they're going on, most of them together, to another school,'' he
says _ and against anything that adds pressure or stress, such as a
dance.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why:
</P>
<P>
   --It's developmentally inappropriate. Eighth graders typically
like to do things in threes, fours, and fives, not in pairs, says
Robert Spear, executive director of the New England League of
Middle Schools. An activity that even tacitly encourages coupling
is not relevant or fun for them. ``They may push for it because
they're mimicking behaviors they see in older siblings, but it
doesn't mean they're comfortable or ready for it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a risk that parents inadvertently send a message
that translates to some children as pressure to do something they
aren't ready for and to other children as license to do something
they shouldn't: ``If Mom and Dad think I'm old enough to get all
dressed up, wear makeup, have a date, or go in a limo, just like
18-year-olds, what else can I do like 18-year-olds?'' In other
words, says middle school consultant Joan Lipsitz, ``You are
sending powerful signals about exclusive relationships, provocative
dress, sex, and alcohol.'' Lipsitz is the founder of the Center for
Early Adolescence at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   --It's divisive. Eighth graders are so incredibly
self-conscious, it's as if they have an imaginary audience. ``They
assume people are watching,'' says Elkind. ``They feel
excruciatingly visible if they don't wear, sound, and act like
everyone else.'' By the time of a junior or senior prom, they will
be developmentally better equipped to tolerate differences in dress
and style. For now, however, a girl whose family can't afford a
dress like her friends' or a boy who thinks he can't dance as well
as his peers can be miserable. Not only does a dress-up dance
exacerbate differences and inadequacies, but the differences become
the basis for teasing and discrimination, says Elkind. His most
recent book is ``All Grown Up and No Place to Go: Teenagers in
Crisis'' (Addison Wesley).
</P>
<P>
   --It's how kids get jaded. ``Finishing eighth grade is not
enough of an achievement to warrant this kind of celebration,''
says Damon. ``It leads to a sense of entitlement and
self-importance. It also cheapens the real prom, three years
later.'' Indeed, an eighth-grade quasi prom may be what ups the
ante for The Prom. ``If you have a semiformal in the gym in eighth
grade, a senior prom in the gym isn't special enough,'' says Spear.
``You have to go to a hotel. You have to have the limo.''
</P>
<P>
   Spear's desire to abandon a dress-up, adultified event is not
only a developmental issue but also one of safety. ``There is more
alcohol use among eighth graders than parents realize,'' he says.
``A semiformal encourages kids to strut their stuff, to emulate
older behavior. That means drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ephraim Curtis Middle School in Sudbury, Mass., principal
Kevin Thomas Plodzik has scaled back what was once a formal
eighth-grade dance to a dance-buffet. In a letter to parents, he
writes, ``This is not a mini-prom.'' He discourages dates, formal
wear, and limos. The students plan the menu and put together a
lighthearted awards and achievements ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner-dance is the last night of school. The next morning,
there's a ``Moving On'' ceremony, where Plodzik entrusts the class
to the principal of the regional high school, telling students, ``I
know you are prepared for the continuation of your education.''
Wrapping the two events around each other, says Plodzik, gives
eighth graders more of what they need: a balance of academic and
social interests, as well as closure for the past and a nod to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Belmont, Tricia Tanner's brother, Troy,
remembers his experience last year attending the eighth-grade dance
at Chenery Middle School. He had a date, but no tux or limo. He had
a good time, and he hopes his sister will, too, but, looking back,
he also remembers, ``There were some kids who felt left out, you
could tell. They were on the sidelines, just kinda sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Children need to reflect on accomplishments before they can
look forward. Reflect as a family on your child's growth and
accomplishments during middle school.
</P>
<P>
   --The end of middle school raises anxieties in students: Will I
have friends? Will I look as good as other kids? Will my study
habits be good enough? Am I going to have to drink to be cool? Will
I be safe? Am I weird to be thinking about sex?
</P>
<P>
   --Expect and show understanding for your child's tears, sadness,
or moodiness. Even though he knows he will be with the same kids in
high school, he also knows that friendships, interests, and
activities will change.
</P>
<P>
   --Many eighth graders worry about getting bullied, teased, or
even beaten up in high school. Researchers say there is some truth
to this, so don't pooh-pooh the fear. Just providing the chance to
talk can help. So can some coping skills: ``Maybe it's a good idea
to walk to classes in a group.''
</P>
<P>
   --Although youngsters will protest when you take a stand against
a skimpy dress or impose a curfew that's earlier than friends',
etc., they typically secretly appreciate it because it shows you
care and are able to tolerate their anger and frustration. However,
be sure to have reasons: Not ``Because I said so,'' but: ``This is
not safe for a 14-year-old to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ A study released last month by the University of
New Hampshire says that children whose child-care providers share
positive emotions, respond to their vocalizations, and offer
physical contact will have improved school readiness skills.

TAKING THE COMICS SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what some angry readers inferred from Monday's Ombudsman
column, I had nothing to do with those recent changes in the
Globe's comics. Nobody asked me if I thought Over the Hedge, Stone
Soup, and Kudzu should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth _ and it's not worth much, obviously _ I
don't think any of the strips should have been eliminated. They
were among my favorites. But I had no part in those decisions. As a
member of the now infamous (in some quarters) Globe ``comics
jury,'' my task is to review new comics submitted for
consideration. That's all. Decisions about which comics will run
and which won't are made at a much, much higher _ one might even
say rarefied _ editorial level.
</P>
<P>
   I sympathize with readers who've been calling and writing to
excoriate me for my supposed part in all this. I'm one of those
childish people ombudsman Jack Thomas complained about in his
column, a reader who is devoted to the comics, who more often than
not turns to the comics first. Some may consider this a character
flaw, but I don't think it makes me any more intellectually
depraved than readers who turn first to sports, or Ann Landers, or
Names &AMP; Faces, or the horoscope, or even the op-ed page. Most of us
go on to read the rest of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Furious comics fans have mercilessly attacked Thomas in the wake
of Monday's column. I won't join in. I will even say in his defense
that he isn't as lacking in humor as his critics imagine. His is a
thankless job, by and large. In his column he describes how,
returning from vacation, he had to read more than 700 e-mails from
readers. Clearly he wasn't thrilled to receive hundreds more from
disgruntled comics readers. Since he confesses that he dislikes
comics, perhaps the paper should have a comics ombudsman, a person
who knows and likes comics and can represent readers' interests.
(Note to Editor: I'm not volunteering for the job.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wrote of the comics: ``More often than not, they are
merely recycled vaudeville gags that were not funny the first time
around.'' But there is a great deal more to the comics. On any
given day, individual strips may be lame. But overall, the Globe's
collection is of a high order. There's some very sophisticated
humor on the page. Robotman. Zippy. Sylvia. Dilbert. Rhymes With
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   The comics are not just a collection of cheap laughs. They
reflect the world we live in. Those who don't follow the comics
choose to ignore one of the great repositories of popular culture,
and may find themselves out of touch with social currents and
attitudes. Nothing strikes more sharply than humor. George Bernard
Shaw and Mark Twain knew it; Scott Adams, Nicole Hollander, and
Garry Trudeau, among others, know it. In recent years, few
editorial commentators have been as consistently effective as
Trudeau has been in ``Doonesbury.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every other newspaper, the Globe wants to attract younger
readers. One way to do it is with comic strips. A recurring reader
criticism of the Globe's comics has been that not enough of them
are aimed at children. Perhaps by adding The Boondocks, the paper
is trying to provide another strip that will appeal to kids. But
then why cancel Over the Hedge?
</P>
<P>
   Reading a daily newspaper is a habit. I was hooked at a very
early age, before I could read, by comics. At 11, I discovered Walt
Kelly's Pogo in the old Boston Herald. That comic strip changed my
life. I'm sure some people find that laughable. If they do, they're
unfamiliar with Kelly's work. He was a brilliant, humane social
satirist, as well as an inspired artist. Pogo led me to love
newspapers, and that led me here, I might say For Better or for
Worse. Which is another good strip. Let's hope they don't cancel
it.

STARS OF FIRST MAGNITUDE TURN OUT FOR RUSSELL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How's this for a team?
</P>
<P>
   Centers: Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton,
Dave Cowens, Willis Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards: Bob Pettit, Julius Erving, Rick Barry, Jerry Lucas,
Dolph Schayes.
</P>
<P>
   Guards: Oscar Robertson, Tiny Archibald, Hal Greer, Dave Bing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the Hall of Fame,'' decided Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, him, too.
</P>
<P>
   When you're Bill Russell, the heaviest of the heavy hitters show
up for your time. And then you get videos from the likes of Michael
Jordan, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Bill Bradley, Lenny Wilkens,
Magic Johnson, Kevin McHale, and a major politician who lives in
Washington, D.C., and who described himself as ``a fellow
lefthander.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aretha Franklin said it best,'' explained Dick Ebersol, a TV
fellow of note. ``It's r-e-s-p-e-c-t.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. Guess who sang the national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   This is without even mentioning the other Celtic alumni. You
know, the Cousys, Heinsohns, Havliceks, Ramseys, Embrys,
Loscutoffs, Sanderses, Whites, Sharmans, Risens, and Joneses (both
Sam and K.C.). This is what Bill Russell deserved, and this is what
Bill Russell got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know how to play if it weren't for him,'' declared
Abdul-Jabbar, whose adolescent tutorials came both at the old
Madison Square Garden and at Power Memorial High School. ``NBA
teams used to practice at our gym, and from 1960 through 1965 I
must have gone to every doubleheader. The Celtics played in many
opening games. I would have to say I saw them play 25 times and the
man I studied was Bill Russell. I learned so much. The next day my
coach would say, `How many of those guys scored 20 points?' and the
answer would be `none.' But everybody would have had something to
do with it, most of all Bill Russell. Watching him I learned the
dynamics of the game, and how to win. Being a Knick fan in those
days was agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles away, a tall, skinny redhead was studying
his Russellology in La Mesda, Calif. ``Most players play in spite
of their teammates,'' said Walton. ``Russell's sole purpose was to
make the rest of them the stars, and in so doing win the game. He
was my favorite player of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that the charity that is currently near and dear
to Bill Russell's heart is the National Mentoring Partnership.
Russell operated on both sides of that relationship, and in each
case the party of the second part was here to pay his respects.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Bill Russell was not a finished product when
he entered the league in December 1956. He was talented beyond
measure, but he didn't know the NBA. That is where Arnie Risen came
in. Arnie was then in the penultimate year of what would turn out
to be a Hall of Fame career, and it didn't take long for him to
learn that his primary function on the team would be shifted from
being its starting center to the professor for this new kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel flattered when I hear Bill Russell say I was his
mentor,'' said Risen. ``I'm not sure that isn't just an old friend
boosting a teammate. If I did anything for him, it was tell him
what to expect from the other players in the league, and to help
him with our offense. But I never thought of it as mentoring. In
those days we all helped each other. It was the natural thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Bill Russell was at the zenith of his career,
seven titles and four Most Valuable Player awards in hand. The new
backup center was a kid out of Providence by the name of John
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me,'' said Thompson. ``Very much so. I just felt so
safe with him. On and off the floor. When I was in his presence I
knew I had nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that no other great player gets talked
about in those terms. There was something very different and very
special about Bill Russell, as speaker after speaker made clear at
the well-attended (12,000-plus) and well-run (how can you go wrong
when you've got Bill Cosby at the throttle?) and long overdue
tribute to Bill Russell at the FleetCenter Wednesday night. It was
such a blissful evening a case can be made that if you've got to
wait 30 years in order to get it right, then maybe that's what you
should do.
</P>
<P>
   The point of it all was to do the right thing by the greatest
team sport athlete in American history, and the point within the
point was to see his No. 6 properly raised. It's been up there
since 12:55 p.m. EST March 12, 1972, when the Celtics ambushed
Russell by hoisting the number when he was in town on a broadcast
assignment for a Sunday afternoon ABC telecast of a Celtics-Knicks
game. A very grudging Russell would only allow the number to go up
if no fans were present, and so the big 6 was raised with only Red
Auerbach, Celtics players, local writers, Garden personnel, and ABC
techs watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red knows how I feel about this,'' Russell said. ``I'm not
that type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and this was now, and thus at 10:07 p.m. EDT
on May 26, 1999, the number was re-raised, this time before an
appreciative crowd that numbered a roster of NBA luminaries whose
combined 1999 market value would be in the billions, with a capital
B. And Bill Russell looked pleased.
</P>
<P>
   He talked team, as he always did and always will. ``Red's theory
was that there were 10 players, two referees, 13,000 people, and
one basketball,'' Russell explained, ``and we decided what to do
with the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   This was one time Bill Russell was not in control of anything.
The time had come for him to be properly honored, and that was
that. There were all those people in that building, and they were
the ones who made sure Bill Russell went to bed Wednesday night
aware that everything he has done for his team, the game, and his
country was completely appreciated.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Thirty years and three weeks to the day after Bill
Russell played his last game for the Celtics, a game that fittingly
ended in a world championship, the town, the team, the fans, and a
glittering list of celebrities and players paid homage to the man
and his career.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly three-hour ceremony that featured lighthearted
moments and moving tributes, the 65-year-old Russell, an intensely
private man who called the whole affair ``totally and completely
embarrassing,'' had his uniform No. 6 re-retired in a very public
ceremony Wednesday night at the FleetCenter. The number originally
was retired March 12, 1972, in a private ceremony, which was
Russell's wish at the time.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was anything but private. Organizers of the event,
a benefit for the National Mentoring Partnership, expected a crowd
of about 10,000. The event was held on the 30th anniversary of
Russell's last season and last title, won May 5, 1969, in Los
Angeles against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates from his Celtics days were there, ranging from Bob
Cousy to John Havlicek to Bill Sharman to Sam Jones to Arnie Risen.
Celtics players who followed him and won titles, Larry Bird and
Dave Cowens, were there. Wilt Chamberlain decided at the last
moment to be a part of the night and took a red-eye flight from Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby and Bryant Gumbel were the masters of ceremonies.
Johnny Mathis and Aretha Franklin sang. President Clinton, would-be
president Bill Bradley, and Michael Jordan were among several who
offered taped tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's former coach and Celtics icon Red Auerbach helped him
raise the banner to the rafters to the music of ``Summon the
Heroes.'' Russell then spoke for about 20 minutes, telling stories
of his parents, thanking the fans, and saying, simply, ``The life I
led was the life I thought I should lead.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Russell again said it was overwhelming to be
the subject of so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think of myself as Charlie Russell's kid,'' he said.
``This kind of stuff is foreign to me. I really don't understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ceremony was ``fantastic, almost like another
(championship) banner up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The stands were half-full, much like they were when Russell was
leading the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years. Sixty-five tables
were scattered on the floor, each with a basketball centerpiece,
green and white napkins, and a chocolate dessert with a white
shamrock and green No. 6 on top. (Most went uneaten, except at the
Globe table.)
</P>
<P>
   Much like Russell's career, the evening got off to a late start
and lasted a little longer than expected. (Russell did not join the
Celtics as a rookie until December due to an Olympic commitment.)
The highlight for the fans was the joint appearance of Bird (also a
late addition), Bill Walton, Cowens, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
offer their thoughts on Russell and winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Bill Walton doing up here?'' Bird cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Walton went on to explain how Russell was his hero and role
model, then took a shot at some conservative blacks, mentioning
Clarence Thomas and J.C. Watts. ``Somehow,'' said Walton, ``things
got turned around.'' But, he also said, ``no one in the history of
sports did a better job of making people's life better than Bill
Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird noted that Russell set the bar so high ``that if you put on
a Celtic uniform and didn't win a championship, you have no game.''
Bird also took a shot at Jordan, who, in his video tribute, noted
Russell had won all his titles in an eight-team league. NBA
commissioner David Stern also took note of Jordan's remark, adding
that all the good players in the league in Russell's time were on
eight teams.
</P>
<P>
   When Russell made his first appearance on stage, the crowd gave
him a five-minute standing ovation, which brought him to tears. He
took a seat on the stage, looking almost as if he would rather be
anywhere else, comforted by a couple of Cosby wisecracks.
Eventually the crowd quieted to hear Auerbach present his franchise
center with a piece of the parquet floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby noted how Russell started as a champion, ended as a
champion, and won most of the time in between. He then admitted he
had trouble with all the adulation ``because I'm from
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell also was praised on tape by Clinton, Bradley, Jordan,
Kevin McHale, Magic Johnson (who was thought to be coming), Jerry
West, Elgin Baylor, and Lenny Wilkens. Tom Brokaw, Jim Brown,
George Plimpton, and writer Frank Deford offered tributes.
Russell's daughter, Karen, broke into tears when she referred to
her father as ``the greatest daddy in the whole wide world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino presented Russell with a Paul Revere
bowl, which apparently was misinscribed. (Russell's middle name is
Felton. The bowl had the name spelled Fenton.) Celtics
coach/president Rick Pitino _ who got some boos _ presented Russell
with a small replica of the banner with Russell's number on it. He
said the highlight of this past season _ and admitted there weren't
many _ was the night when Russell addressed the team.
</P>
<P>
   Six teammates from Russell's first title team, 1956-57, were in
attendance. Cousy, on behalf of the squad, presented Russell with a
watch. ``You should have had this years ago because you were late
to every practice Arnold (Auerbach) ever called,'' Cousy said.
</P>
<P>
   Four teammates from the championship teams from the 1960s _
Havlicek, Tom ``Satch'' Sanders, K.C. Jones, and Sam Jones _
presented Russell with two wooden seats from old Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen opponents from Russell's years _ Jerry Lucas, Rick
Barry, Willis Reed, Bob Pettit, Oscar Robertson, and Dolph Schayes
_ offered their thoughts on playing against him. That, in turn, led
to the introduction of Chamberlain, who good-naturedly played the
role of villain.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby talked about the dinners Russell and Chamberlain would
have on Thanksgiving at Chamberlain's home in Philadelphia. The
Celtics and 76ers would play that night. ``He ate the dinner and
then he ate you,'' Cosby said to Chamberlain. Russell not only ate
at his house, but took a nap in his bedroom, too.
</P>
<P>
   The two then engaged in a toy game of pop-a-shot and Chamberlain
won, 1-0. ``I finally won a game in Boston,'' he cracked. Russell
earlier had said he was fortunate to have had Chamberlain as a
rival; it had made both players better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to improve,'' he said, ``and if I didn't improve, I'd be
embarrassed every night.''

STRANGERS IN THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many of his chat pals nationwide, he stumbled onto the
universe of on-line sex with the most innocent of intentions.
Lonely and bored at work one day, the 37-year-old analyst began
clicking the mouse and discovered the Yahoo! cosmos of personal
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he was talking dirty to dozens of women on the
Internet and becoming so aroused that he would masturbate in front
of the computer screen on line for four to five hours a night. Soon
he was having one-night stands with women he had met in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   By March of this year, James, who is now 40 and asked that his
last name not be used, had become so addicted to the X-rated
pleasures of the Net that he broke up with his girlfriend because
he preferred cybersex to real sex with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell her why I was breaking it off _ I was too
embarrassed,'' says James, who describes himself over the phone as
tall (6 feet 2 inches), dark, and good-looking. ``But I would
rather go on the Net and talk to people in chat rooms than be with
her. It's more exciting. When I made love with her, the pace was
too slow.''
</P>
<P>
   James's behavior may be an extreme example of how the Internet
can become ``the crack of sexual compulsivity,'' as San Jose
psychologist Alvin Cooper puts it. But according to Cooper and
other specialists, an increasing number of Americans are drawn to
the lure of on-line sex _ chat rooms, personal ads, pornography _
because it is affordable, accessible, and usually, anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many of these people, cybersex is becoming hazardous to
their health, psychological and otherwise. Consider the fate of
Ronald F. Thiemann, the former dean of Harvard Divinity School.
When Harvard officials discovered last fall that Thiemann had
compiled an extensive pornographic collection from the Internet on
a Harvard-owned computer, they demanded his resignation as dean.
</P>
<P>
   While on-line kinkiness does not usually exact such a drastic
toll on participants (most are not divinity school deans), new
research indicates that an excessive diet of on-line sex can cause
problems, even when it takes place in the privacy of one's home,
with one's personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recently published study of 9,000 on-line users found a direct
correlation between the amount of time people spent on line for sex
and the psychological problems they were grappling with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the more time people spent on line for sex, the more
problems they reported in their work lives or social activities,''
says Cooper, who spearheaded the study as director of the San Jose
Marital and Sexuality Center.
</P>
<P>
   While people who logged on for 11 hours or more each week seem
to lose themselves (as James has) in compulsive, and some would
say, destructive sexual activity, those who went on line for less
than one hour a week ``seemed to be using Internet sex in a way
that was more recreational than sexual, in the same way that people
read Playboy and watch `Baywatch,' '' Cooper says.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how deeply individuals become enmeshed in on-line
smut, Internet experts agree on one thing: cybersex, a behavior
continuum that ranges from occasional dirty talk in chat rooms to
spending hours viewing erotica from adult Web sites and
masturbating five to six times a night in front of the computer, is
big and getting bigger every day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least 9 million people visited a sexually oriented adult Web
site every month of last year, according to one survey. In
addition, there are 250 sex-related bulletin boards on the Net
where users can post illicit messages, and hundreds of chat rooms,
many full by midday, where people with the nicknames Hornyman,
PurEvil, SexiLady09, and Busty68 chat around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   According to social scientists, the popularity of cybersex can
be boiled down to one simple reality: a surprisingly large number
of Americans have difficulty maintaining healthy sexual
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of people who comprise 90 percent of the
people on the Internet: those who are not in a relationship and
those who are dissatisfied with the relationship they're in,'' says
Dr. David Schnarch, director of the Marriage and Family Health
Center in Evergreen, Colo. and author of ``Passionate Marriage:
Keeping Love and Intimacy Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnarch points to a national study published in February in the
Journal of the American Medical Association that found that 43
percent of women and 31 percent of men report having sexual
difficulties. ``Cybersex is the trough to which these relationship
problems are now channeling themselves,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are starved of real intimacy, sex chat,
euphemistically called romance chat, is a way to connect with
others. It provides a sense of belonging, an online ``Cheers''
where everybody knows your nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Net, people feel like they belong, like someone misses
them,'' says Maressa Hecht Orzack, a psychologist and founder of
the Computer Addiction Service at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
``These people are not in good relationships to begin with and they
don't feel like anyone cares about them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Orzack says she counsels dozens of people every year that become
so addicted to sex chat that they flunk out of school, jeopardize
their job or marriage, and in some cases neglect their children.

 UNDATED: ... their children.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's a woman I'm working with right now who neglects her
child,'' Orzack says. ``She resents the fact that she has to get
offline and feed him dinner; she doesn't want to miss anything.
She's divorced and there are custody issues and she might lose her
child. Yet she tells me, `I'm not giving up the chat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Pershica, 26, of Oklahoma, says she turned to the Internet
while recovering from a difficult divorce. She lives in an area
where there are few places to meet people, and chat rooms, she
says, allow her to screen people and explore her sexual desires in
a relatively safe context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybersex lets me get to know a person and avoid the crazies I
might not recognize in person,'' says Pershica, who cleans houses
for a living. ``Sure, I've run across some perverts, but I've also
met gentle, caring people who, like me, were going through rough
times and needed someone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch at the Cottonwood Cafe in Boston, Ben, a 24-year-old,
also says he prefers to meet people on line rather than go to
nightclubs. The risk of rejection is somehow less acute. And he
finds the sex talk titillating and at the same time benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to a club, the women kind of look at you funny and
if they're not interested, they make it clear they want you to go
away,'' says Ben, a computer technician who works during the day
and takes night courses at University of Massachusetts at Boston.
``I find that tiring.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ben, who asked that his last name not be used, says
he corresponds regularly with a lot of female friends on the Net,
and they're more than willing to talk dirty with him. And on line,
he can fib about his height _ ``I'm short for a guy,'' says Ben,
who is 5 feet 6 _ and no one is the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lying is quite common on the Net. According to the San Jose
cybersex study, about 60 percent of the 9,000 participants
acknowledged that they lied about their age; 14 percent reported
lying about some other detail of their persona, and 5 percent
admitted they lied about their gender.
</P>
<P>
   And in what specialists say is possibly the most pernicious
aspect of cybersex, 70 percent of respondents said they keep their
on-line activities a secret from other people in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of working to improve the intimacy in their
relationship, many people are a lot more revealing about themselves
to perfect strangers'' on line, says Margaret Strauss-Black, a
marriage and family therapist. ``That takes the energy away from
their real relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Black and other therapists in the Boston area say they
treat a growing number of couples whose marriages are threatened
because one spouse can't stop himself or herself from logging on in
the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   I. Scott Cohen, past president of the Massachusetts Association
for Marriage and Family Therapy, says that with one couple he is
treating, the woman accidentally discovered that her husband was
involved in sexual chat on the Internet; he had saved a bunch of
X-rated e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt very betrayed, very violated,'' recalls Cohen, a
family therapist. ``The husband claimed that he was just playing
around, that it was all a joke. But to her, it felt like he was
having an affair.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving a professional couple, the woman
discovered that her husband was using cybersex to explore his
sexuality with other men. She confronted her husband and the man
with whom he was having cybersex (by e-mail) _ and then dragged her
husband into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created big-time problems for them,'' says Strauss-Black,
who treated the couple. ``The wife was most upset about the fact
that her husband was not being upfront with her about what he was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many people, specialists say, are ashamed of their sexual
fantasies and afraid to share them with their significant other.
Many men, for instance, don't want their wives or girlfriends to
know that they fantasize about cross-dressing or having sex with
another man. Similarly, some women fantasize about sex with another
woman and don't want their husbands to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to confide your secret fantasies to somebody
you're going to see day after day,'' Dr. Schnarch says. ``What the
Internet offers is the instant gratification of a fantasy without
the vulnerability and personal exposure of a real relationship. You
don't have to grow up to have sex on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   James, the cybersex addict, says he is just beginning to realize
that he has problems with the way he views women and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view of women is really low and I think that comes from
childhood, the way my father treated my mother, as a secondary
person,'' says James, who works for a high-tech company in
Metrowest and is in therapy. ``There are times when I'm driving
home from having sex with someone I've met on the Net and I say,
`Why the hell did I do that again? But I can't seem to stop; I have
no control over it.''

CRACKED DOOR PANEL NEEDS CAULKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My new paneled wood front door gets lots of sun and is
painted black, under a storm. A panel cracked, and I can see
daylight through it. How can I fix it, and keep the door black?
</P>
<P>
   LESLIE HAUSMAN, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The wood in the door contracted when it dried out, and the
panel, set too tightly in the frame, cracked when it shrank. It
wasn't supposed to do that, but it was so tight in the frame that
it could not move with the shrinkage. Result, a crack. Panels in
such doors are free-floating in their frames, so they can expand
and contract without cracking. But yours was too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Short of replacing the panel (a horrendous job in itself), you
can do this: Caulk that crack with a flexible caulking material;
put a bead of this caulk on the crack and press it in with your
fingers. Avoid splinters by wearing gloves. Do the same on the
other side, and scrape and wash off any residue that remains.
Repaint. The caulking, being flexible, will expand and contract
with the movement on the panel, and it should look good for years.
</P>
<P>
   The black paint and the storm make the door hotter from the sun
than normal, and the hotter the wood gets, the more it can dry out
and shrink, so don't expect a perfect performance. But hope springs
eternal, and you will get some years out of the repair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My cedar deck was installed two years ago. I was told to
apply Thompson's Water Seal, but it wore off. I pressure-washed it
and applied Clear Wood Finish (CWF). I later pressure-washed this
in an attempt to clean it, and now the deck is an ugly gray. And,
the boards are creaking when I walk on them. How can I stop the
creaking and make the cedar look good for at least longer than in
the past?
</P>
<P>
   KAY CARLEY, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. We have been brainwashed into thinking that we should apply
sealer or other finish such as Clear Wood Finish to protect the
wood and keep it looking new. There is some truth to the fact that
such sealing will make the wood water resistant (the water beads
up, doesn't it?) to prevent spalling (little flat chips of wood
coming out of the boards), splintering, and cracking. This
waterproofing usually works, especially with pressure-treated wood,
but cedar doesn't always need such sealing, and no one tells us
that the sealer and CWF will wear off in a year or two and must be
applied that often. So much for a maintenance-free deck.
</P>
<P>
   The ugly gray is the result of weathering that all wood will
undergo, even sealed. The CWF is designed to make the wood new
looking, and will restore weathered wood to look new. Red cedar,
the wood of your deck, will weather, but sometimes cedar weathers
to a blotchy, multicolored mess.
</P>
<P>
   The best answer is a semitransparent stain. Colors are limited,
but such stains will last three to five years. Only one coat is
needed at a time. While semitransparent stains are designed to go
on wood siding (clapboards and shingles), they will work quite well
on a deck floor. Avoid paint and solid stains; they do not work on
floors.
</P>
<P>
   For the creaking, drive an extra deck screw through the boards
into each joist, using a power driver. If that does not work, the
superstructure is loose. It would be difficult to reinforce the
superstructure, so unless the frame is racking or swaying, live
with the creaks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an arched passageway 30 inches wide and 80 inches high
between my living room and dining room. I would like to close it
off while one of the rooms is being used temporarily as a bedroom.
I want to keep the arched passageway. What can I use?
</P>
<P>
   PHYLLIS ANDELLA, Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could hang a wide drapery rod above the opening and
install a heavy velvet curtain. Anything else, such as a door,
would require a framework on one side of the opening. A door made
to fit the curved top would be expensive. You could cut 3/4-inch
plywood to fit the opening but it might be difficult to hang,
because the sides of the opening are plaster, not wood.
</P>
<P>
   I think the velvet curtain is your best bet. It would look good
while providing privacy and a small measure of soundproofing as
well, particularly if the velvet is secured against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea: Secure a window quilt against the opening. This
requires a frame in which the quilt rides. The frame is lightweight
and can be secured to the wall with a minimum of fasteners. When
you are ready to take it down, just fill the holes with joint
compound, sand smooth, and repaint. Window quilts are sold in home
centers and specialty stores.

<P>
   Q. My gutters are loose, at least I think they are because there
is a gap between the fascia and the gutter. The long nails seem
loose. When I drive them back into position they come out again
before long. How can I keep the gutter tight against the fascia?

<P>
   A. You can buy long gutter screws; they are like the nails only
spiral-shanked like a screw, and are likely to hold better. You can
order them from the Improvements catalog: 800-642-2112.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida _ It was a darkness tinged with red.
</P>
<P>
   Every June 4, I remember the flags and the flames, flickering
and red; the warm summer darkness filled with screams and sobs and
gunfire, the firelight playing over the enormous vermilion walls of
the Forbidden City in the heart of Beijing, the odor of sweat and
gasoline and burning rubber, the blood on people's faces, chests,
arms, hands.
</P>
<P>
   But each year the memory grows more phantasmagoric, outlandish,
unreal. Now, at a decade's distance, I have trouble believing it
ever happened, more trouble making up my mind what it actually
meant. I was there, but today in an era when Chinese students are
throwing rocks and bottles at our embassy in Beijing and Chinese
spies are apparently ferreting out our nuclear secrets, I am not
really sure where THERE was.
</P>
<P>
   Tiananmen seemed mythical, even during the moments it was
unfolding. It was like living inside a movie whose screenplay was
being written off-camera, someplace else. The actual shooting
script came to us minute by minute.
</P>
<P>
   We all had our parts to play: demonstrator, rabble-rouser,
impassioned bicyclist-messenger, trishaw ambulance-puller,
diplomat, foreign journalist, evil prime minister, People's
Liberation Army officer, obedient soldier with semi-automatic rifle
...
</P>
<P>
   Detainee. Counterrevolutionary Traitor. Prisoner for Life.
</P>
<P>
   Exile, expelled from the Motherland forever.
</P>
<P>
   Shooter, target, corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Planetary alignment
</P>
<P>
   Tiananmen came about almost astrologically, by a unique
alignment of events. First, the moderate former secretary of the
Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, dropped dead of a heart attack
on April 15, 1989. Students began laying huge bundles of wreaths
honoring Hu at Tiananmen's Monument to the Revolutionary Martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 70th anniversary of the May 4, 1919 Movement, when
students had demonstrated angrily over Japan's being given
territorial concessions in China at the end of World War I. A
massive demonstration was held in the heart of Beijing, and
students called for ``Mr. Science'' and ``Mr. Democracy'' to lead
China into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The third alignment was the visit of popular Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in mid-May. As long as Gorbachev was in town, the
authorities were loath to create an ugly incident.
</P>
<P>
   Things snowballed. By mid-May, there were over a million people
in Tiananmen Square. The center of Beijing looked like a wild,
anarchic carnival. Flatbed trucks with huge banners, jammed with
wildly exuberant students, were careering up and down the wide
Avenue of Boundless Peace (Chang An), and thousands of people,
young and old, from all over China were camping out at the square.
You could bicycle right down the middle of Chang An, into the
forecourts of the Forbidden City, right under the huge portrait of
Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
   No one who saw them can forget the chaotic, exhilarating
atmosphere of those days. The square was a jumble of tents and
blankets and sleeping bags. The students danced to Western rock 'n'
roll. Plastic soda bottles were underfoot in millions.
</P>
<P>
   Young people crawled up into the arms of gigantic stone statues
and sat there like babies cradled in stone. Silk flags fluttered
everywhere, everywhere there was a racket of bullhorns.
</P>
<P>
   The city was placed under martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Led by charismatic students like Wuerkaixi, Wang Dan and Shen
Tong, the demonstrators went on a hunger strike. When Premier Li
Peng agreed to meet with them in the Great Hall of the People, it
was a disaster. Dragging their IV tubes, the students shouted at
the uncharismatic premier, and Li lost his temper, live, on
national TV.
</P>
<P>
   As June drew near, there was a sense of weariness with the
standoff. Crowds at the square were thinning out. The piles of
garbage reeked in the heat of summer. The star student leaders were
no longer there; they were giving interviews to foreign reporters
in air-conditioned hotel rooms. The hunger strike was over. Given
time, the whole demonstration might simply have wound down on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, students from the Beijing Art Institute set up a
30-foot-high statue made of plaster and styrofoam, called Min Zhu
Zhi Shen, the ``Goddess of Democracy.'' She carried a torch and
seemed to breathe life back into the demonstrations. Thousands came
to be photographed in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   The weather continued warm and hazy. A muggy stillness hung over
the city. It hadn't rained since May 23. The square positively
stank. Only a few thousand people hung on there.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the night of June 2, a column of about 8,000 unarmed
soldiers came jogging down Chang An from the east. It may have been
an attempt to reoccupy the square without force, but it backfired
badly. Thousands of angry people swarmed into the streets and
physically blocked the column by sheer force of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Units got separated. Exhausted, they flopped down beside the
road. Pitying them, some people brought them water. The next
morning, in the glorious light of northern China, a huge triumphant
cavalcade of bicyclists streamed through the city, shouting ``Ba
Gong! Ba Gong!'' (``Strike! Strike!'') They were urging workers to
lay down their tools.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the evening of June 3-4, the army struck back.
This time they were armed and had orders to shoot to kill.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:14 a.m., a maverick armored car came swerving madly down
Chang An, west to east. It was being pursued by hundreds of young
men on bicycles and by crowds running on foot, like hounds in full
cry after a steel fox. ``Xia lai! Xia lai!'' (``Come down! Come
down!'') they shouted at the driver. He did a U-turn and headed
back up the avenue toward Tiananmen with the crowd in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out this armored car had run over a bicyclist and
crushed his skull. His body lay on the Jianguomenwai overpass, the
bicycle a knot of steel, the young man with his head flattened, his
face pressed into the asphalt in a sickening bulge of hair and
brains. When the crowd caught up with the armored car, they set it
on fire, pulled out the soldiers and beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Another soldier in the southern suburbs of the city was killed
and disemboweled by the crowd, his intestines strung from a
pedestrian overpass, after he opened fire on a crowd and shot an
old woman.
</P>
<P>
   As the armored car roared away into the night, I decided to
approach the square by a roundabout way, through alleys that snake
through eastern Beijing, to the Dong Hua Men or East Flowery Gate
of the Forbidden City, to the lordly Nan Chi Zi archway.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, the armored car was on fire and its flames lit
up the scarlet plaster of the palace walls. There was a sound of
thousands of loud, angry voices coming from the avenue. They were,
of all things, singing!
</P>
<P>
   They were singing the Internationale, the hymn of worldwide
socialism. They were moving like an unstoppable river of flesh
toward ranks of soldiers drawn up at the northern extremity of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   I joined them, without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then the soldiers opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: `Blood of the people'
</P>
<P>
   The fusillade lasted about half a minute. There was a tremendous
shriek and the crowd began fleeing wildly. I was pedaling a Flying
Pigeon bicycle, a sturdy old steel thing, and trying not to get
thrown off. Some people were running just as fast as I was pedaling
at nearly full tilt. The bicycle seemed airborne at seconds. Willow
fronds slapped my face and stung my eyes from trees beside the
avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The headlong retreat paused outside the old Beijing Hotel. Then
the crowd re-formed and began to sidle back westward, toward the
army. When they were about 200 yards away, they halted. Some sat
down cross-legged on the pavement, daring the troops to come on. In
an insanely stubborn show of bravado, one bicyclist in a white
T-shirt zig-zagged back and forth across the avenue, well in front
of us, shaking his fist at the soldiers, daring them to shoot. I've
never seen such lunatic bravery.
</P>
<P>
   The first wounded were now being brought out. A white ambulance
whizzed by. Wiry-legged trishaw drivers carried those who had been
shot, pedaling their bikes madly. I glimpsed the face of a young
man, horribly pale, riding in the back of one limply. His whole
chest looked as if it had exploded. It was sopping with blood.
</P>
<P>
   One man in pajamas had been helping the wounded. When he handed
over his dying charge to a trishaw man for transport, he looked at
his hands and held them up, screaming tearfully in his pajamas:
``See the blood of the Chinese people on my hands!'' Of all the
sights I saw that night, those bloody hands have lingered longest.
</P>
<P>
   Fear turns your eyes to telescopes. I imagined I could not only
see the soldiers, but make out the buttons on their uniforms, even
see the muzzles of their rifles, staring at us with the dark
sincerity of an eye-pupil.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:13 a.m. the crowd began marching again toward the soldiers,
unrepentant. They behaved as if they were immortal and bulletproof.
Their anger carried me along. I remember thinking how crazy this
was, how we were going in the wrong direction!
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' response was lethal. A horrible burst of
machine-gun fire, thousands of rounds, loosed continuously over
more than a minute, drove us back like a whip-crack, like a flail
in the night. We all fled again, I bending over, hump-spined,
shrinking into myself, head low, legs flung wide for balance on the
bicycle, tree fronds slapping me in the face all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2:52 a.m. and 3:13 a.m., I saw 13 people carried out of
the crowd, two women, 11 men. Some of them surely died. (The
official government death toll from Tiananmen was 236. But other,
unofficial sources, relying on blood requests to the International
Red Cross and collected eyewitness reports, put the figure as high
as 2,700.)
</P>
<P>
   At least three army corps fought their way into the city that
night, and the next morning the killing went on briskly in
daylight. Day after day, the crowds formed, advanced. The soldiers
fired. The crowds fled, re-formed, advanced again.
</P>
<P>
   June 4 was the morning of the famous confrontation between the
solitary man and the tank, outside the Beijing Hotel. The man's
name has never been learned. It is said he was captured and put to
death shortly afterward, safely off-camera.
</P>
<P>
   That night, however, the battle's outcome still seemed in doubt.
Distant loudspeakers were blaring, telling the last few people
huddled on the Martyrs' monument to vacate.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the square, overlooking Mao's darkened mausoleum,
a crowd of about 50 older people was standing in the dark, oddly
calm, discussing the siege as if it were a spell of unusual
weather. They didn't seem frightened at all, only curious.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by their boldness, I glided down a concrete ramp and
out into the vast, jumbled rectangle of stone.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed floored with glass. I worried about a flat tire.
Several gasoline fires burned here and there, the oily flames
reflected in the glass shards, which lay everywhere, like crushed
ice.
</P>
<P>
   At the northern end of the square there was an unnatural peace.
Mao's portrait was smiling tranquilly down on about 1,000 soldiers,
many of them seated on the pavement. Just before 4 a.m., I heard an
order barked out and the soldiers stood up.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to be carrying silver batons, not rifles. Something
was going to happen. I bicycled to the southern end of the huge
square, past Mao's mausoleum, and scribbled a few notes by the
light of a burning bus.
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard cadenced singing. A vast detachment of soldiers was
marching up Qianmen Dajie in the dark. It looked ominous. The
square was going to be pincered, north and south.
</P>
<P>
   I fled. I managed to make my way back to our office around 5
a.m. and called The Miami Herald. Then I sat down to write what I'd
seen.
</P>
<P>
   I got part of it wrong. I assumed, having seen so much
indiscriminate slaughter on Chang An, that the final assault on the
square was going to be equally bloody. It wasn't. Elite commando
units were sent in to clear the square of its last stubborn
resistance. The last demonstrators were allowed to march away,
singing. Some were arrested, but none was shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Goddess of Democracy was bulldozed in the blue light of
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   June 4 was a Sunday. Resistance and killing continued for the
rest of the week. Tanks were deployed at intersections, troops were
stationed all over the city. For months and months afterward, when
you drove down Chang An avenue, your tires hummed as they rolled
over the corrugations in the asphalt left by the tank treads.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing more exhilarating than living through a battle
without a scratch. In the weeks after Tiananmen, I seemed to walk
on air. History had turned on its hinge, I had seen it all. Nothing
would be the same from here on.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: On its own clock
</P>
<P>
   I was, of course, wrong. The great thing about China is its
perpetual power to confound you.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tiananmen, it was hard for Westerners to grasp just how
furiously dissatisfied millions of Chinese were with their
government. Things had been loosening up for years, people were
bustling, the whole country was opening up to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Tiananmen, one felt certain the government
couldn't last much longer. Communism was falling worldwide _ East
Germany, Romania, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Pursy-mouthed Li Peng, the Bela Lugosi lookalike premier who
ostensibly ordered the massacre _ the man whom the angry students
shouted should be dismissed, decapitated and deep-fried _ would
surely never finish out his term, we predicted. He would be the
scapegoat for Tiananmen, we thought.
</P>
<P>
   China would pay a heavy economic price, we believed. Foreign
businessmen would refuse to clasp the bloody hands of butchers.
China would become an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't turn out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, McDonald's cut a lucrative deal to open up a
hamburger joint near the fateful square. Li Peng finished out his
full term quietly. President Jiang Zemin, who as communist party
boss in Shanghai had nine people shot when they set fire to empty
trains in the aftermath of Tiananmen, is the president of China
today. He has shaken hands with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people who took part in the ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion,'' as the government calls it, are still in prison, some
of them sick, some of them reportedly driven insane by ill
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and other foreign businessmen, after a lull of some months,
flocked back to China, and there are more than 50 McDonalds in
Beijing today. The U.S. was running a $3 billion trade deficit with
China in 1989, the year of Tiananmen. Today it is $40 billion. Just
this month, other students were pelting the U.S. Embassy with
firebombs, rocks and excrement in the wake of the accidental
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over the past 10 years, one simply has to conclude
that China moves by its own clock. Tiananmen was just one of many
massacres and mischances, one more event to be absorbed by the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   The fire and blood of that far-off evening have not been
forgotten _ the Chinese never forget anything _ but they have been
internalized. Calls for the government to apologize for Tiananmen
have gone unheeded. The great square is fenced off, ostensibly
being refurbished, as the 10th anniversary approaches _ a
convenient closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt of June 4 must be repaid in blood,'' was a common
graffito in Beijing after Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Beijing, a gory exhibit opened, full of photos of
the bombed Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Tens of thousands of people
have already visited it and some have signed the guest book: ``The
debt should be repaid in blood.''

2000 AUDI TT: A SMOOTH, SULTRY SCAMPERER

<P>
   She stood at the edge of the road on her small suburban street
as the sleek silver sports car slid by; stood in a narrow patch of
fresh-turned black soil where her lawn met the street and where she
had been working on her flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   In one hand, she held a silver trowel, and in the other, a hose,
set to light spray and aimed at the flowers. As the car passed you
could see her slowly and purposely mouth the words: ``nice car,''
and then give it two thumbs up, the trowel catching late afternoon
sun in one hand, the light spray from the hose now misting unaimed
and back over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Audi TT coupe, a low-slung, exquisitely designed little
sports car, got attention everywhere it went last week. Stop for
gas and the woman pumping beside you would stop, walk over, and
ask, ``What is that car?'' Traveling salesmen would emerge from
convenience stores when you parked to get the newspaper, wondering
if this was the car for them. Other Audi drivers, recognizing the
four silver rings that mark the brand but not the model itself,
flocked to its presence.
</P>
<P>
   That is because this is a beautiful little rounded creature of a
car. The most hackneyed expression in auto writing may be to say
that a car ``looks as though it's ready to pounce.'' I'll avoid
that, but will say _ and allow you the inclusive phrase _ that from
its rounded paws of fenders at the front, to its arched, taut rear
fenders, this car sits there crouched.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing extrudes from its exterior with any sharpness. All is
roundness. The gas portal is silver and ringed with inset fasteners
that make you feel as tthough you are pumping fuel into an aircraft
rather than a car.
</P>
<P>
   Step back, and it looks just a bit like the Volkswagen New
Beetle _ though one that has been lowered, just so, to look like a
Porsche Speedster with its top up. In fact, this is a hybrid. Its
platform is derivative of both the New Beetle and the Golf. Its
name _ TT _ comes from the Tourist Trophy class of motorcycle races
in which some long ago permutation of the Audi company raced bikes.
</P>
<P>
   At $31,000, Audi has positioned it somewhere between the Honda
Prelude SH and BMW M coupe and Z roadster. Audi is looking for its
niche among these and the upcoming Honda 2000S and reincarnated
Nissan Z.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1.8-liter, turbocharged and intercooled, 4-in-line, 20-valve
engine sends it scampering subtly over hill and dale _ though its
throaty exhaust announces its presence at every downshift or
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   It is reminiscent of the 1980s Saab Turbos _ but without the
turbo lag or whine.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the BMW M coupe is all harnessed violence, the TT is
bottled and sultry snarl.
</P>
<P>
   Stomp the accelerator and there is a steady surge of power. No
kickbacks into the seat or sucking you toward the floor. Instead,
just straight ahead, subtle, but building acceleration. With the M
coupe, you knew where you were going as soon as you stomped the
accelerator, and at the same moment realized you were already
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the TT, there is the stomp, the time to gather bearings, and
then the realization _ surprise _ of how fast you are suddenly
going.
</P>
<P>
   The TT does 0-60 in 6.9 seconds _ almost a second slower than
the M coupe, but not bad given that it is a litre smaller and costs
about $10,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   The factory sets its top speed at 130 miles per hour and warns
drivers to call if the governoring system breaks. It is nimble in
commuter traffic, sure-footed on winding country roads, owing to a
stiff suspension that the turbocharged New Beetle ought to have.
</P>
<P>
   While the M coupe clings to corners as if it were on a rail, the
TT instead adheres as if it has been glued there. There is some
chatter from the front-wheel drive, turbo-torque that is inevitable
in cars of this design when they accelerate rapidly with the front
wheels turned sharply, but its ABS and antislip system perform so
well that even a rank amateur would be hard-pressed to lose control
or do damage in this or any other maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   If this car is rounded and eye-catching on the outside, inside
it is even finer. Its scrunched windshield and very low side
windows are true 1950s Porsche. It is all leather, aluminum, and
stainless steel. There is wonderfully strong thigh support at the
front of its seats (New Beetle designers try these out!) though for
the life of me I cannot understand why they would run stainless
supports from the dash to the console just ahead of the shift. A
few hundred miles of my right leg rubbing against this moderately
padded structure and my leg was sore to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   This sharp and painful angulation is odd because everywhere
else, everything is rounded, from the glinting cupholders that look
like they were pilfered from some trendy trattoria in SoHo to the
gauges and instruments themselves. Most are surrounded by the same
silver-dimpled rings you noticed on the gas cover outside. And most
are functional. Turn the air vent rings to open and close; turn the
console panel rings for seat heat, rear-window defogger, emergency
lights, antislip control.
</P>
<P>
   Climate control is handled by two simple ringed switches that
are clicked plus or minus for more heat or less, more fan or less.
The main instruments are analog-in-silver-circle just behind the
wheel and showing speed, rpms, fuel, and temperature. At their
center is a computerized trip guide that shows the outside
temperature, your radio frequency, time until next service, your
average speed, average fuel consumption, and how many miles to the
next fillup _ among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Airbags ahead of front seat passengers and beside them protect
them in crashes. This is billed as a four-passenger car, though in
truth the back seats are best suited for small children. I'd put
them down and use all that storage space between there and the
trunk. Even the front seats take some maneuvering to enter because
you truly wear this car once you are in it.
</P>
<P>
   But that is comforting at night when red lights bathe the
cockpit, and the Bose sound system _ revealed when you push and
raise an aluminum cover _ can be fine-tuned to the sharpest ear.
Crank it up to your favorite sounds, don't be afraid to push the
gas, push the car, and challenge those corners and this is truly a
fun car to drive.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, that fun may be amplified: Audi plans a
Quattro version of this car, and with all wheels powered, it should
be even better. And, just as VW plans for the New Beetle, Audi will
power this with a six-cylinder, 225-horsepower engine by 2002.

Annoyances:

<P>

</P>
<P>
   --Blind spots created by the rear-window pillars of the low
roofline. You have to be very cautious about what you cannot see.
</P>
<P>
   --A trunk lid that doesn't always close completely. It could use
the power-close option so prevalent these days.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The aluminum and rubber foot pedals, which most people buy
only after-market. Great sports-car touch.
</P>
<P>
   --The aluminum and rubber footrest for the left foot. While the

WITH AN SUV, THE KEY IS RESPONSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (l and f coding)

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of testing autos, what a difference a day makes, to
coin a phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Climb down from the sprawling cab of the rumbling Ford F-250
Supercab pickup truck and wiggle straight into the tight cockpit of
the 2000 Audi TT, a whistling little sports coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a change in perspective. You go from looking down
onto and into virtually every passenger vehicle encountered to
looking up at all of them. The first time the Audi pulls up beside
a Ford truck, what you see is the truck's tires, right there at
window level.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrapuntal clash in the world of motorized steel. You
go from driving with an awareness of what the big truck you had
been driving might to do smaller vehicles to driving fully aware of
what some other large vehicle might do to yours _ and to you.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings up thoughts of the distaste _ or, in some cases,
shrill hatred _ with which many folks these days look at sport
utility vehicles. (A digression here to fine-tune our nomenclature:
Despite whatever manufacturers tell us, if an auto does not have
low-range four-wheel-drive _ as opposed to simple all-wheel drive _
and if it does not have hefty ground clearance, and if it does not
also have a certain bulk, it is not an SUV. In other words, Subaru
Forester owners, breathe easy for this debate.)
</P>
<P>
   The Ford F-250 Supercab that was just parked fits into this
debate because it is from this F-Series' platform that Ford will
build the biggest of all SUVs: The 2000 Ford Excursion. And because
it will be 226.7 inches long, weigh nearly four tons (2,000 pounds
more than the Chevrolet Suburban) and, in V-10 form, get around 10
miles per gallon, it is being dubbed the Ford Valdez by those who
are appalled by its creation and threat to the earth.
</P>
<P>
   So the Excursion will soon be walking straight into the
minefield of debate over the moral propriety of owning an SUV. And
for many folks, myself included, it truly is a moral debate because
it raises questions about safety (at least for those in smaller
vehicles) and environmental issues because of exhaust emissions and
fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any motorized vehicle or craft we drive, moral
issues can be answered with a simple word: responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long after I'd pulled away from the light at which
I'd sat in the Audi beside that big Ford truck that I encountered a
vehicle that frightened me far more: It was a mid-'80s Oldsmobile,
coming up on me fast, right up to my bumper, it seemed, before it
careened out to pass me, swaying on spongy suspension, hurtling on
what I was sure were bad tires, spewing black smoke from an engine
on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure a big pickup truck doing the same thing would have been
just as unnerving, though its engine would have been running
cleaner and its suspension would have been more agile, but in both
cases, it would have been the driver, not the vehicle, putting me
at risk. And that is where responsibility comes in.
</P>
<P>
   If you drive a big SUV, you have to drive it with an awareness
of just how big you are out there; how your headlights look in
someone's rear-view mirror; how your tires look to someone seated
in a low-slung car; how imposing your gleaming bumper can look.
Don't race up on people at high speed. Don't let the inevitable
feeling of invincibility that comes with driving an SUV turn you
into a bully.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs have their place on our roads, but it is fair to ask which
roads and what we use these big rigs for.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the city and own a big SUV, you're out of bounds
unless you keep it parked in private space and use it only for
family-filled trips into the country. It is not a city car because
it is at its most inefficient, space-hogging, and polluting worst
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In an insightful letter to the editor in this paper last week, a
gentleman discussed how much more efficient it is to haul an SUV
filled with as many as nine people on an outing, as opposed to two
or three smaller cars splitting the same load.
</P>
<P>
   An SUV filled with skiers or young soccer players is a good
thing. An SUV being driven by one person out to fetch milk or
papers or commute to work is a bad thing. That is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Do they pollute more than small cars? Certainly, because their
engines are bigger. But the government is continually tightening
emissions limits and there is no reason even the largest SUVs can't
be reined in as time passes. Already, many of them are far below
government emissions standards and as the line continues to blur
between car and truck and SUV, those numbers will naturally go down
even further. I just had a quick spin in the new Toyota Tundra
pickup truck, a V-8 powered four-door that is the first foreign
challenge to America's big trucks, and while it has the power of
the big rigs, it runs as clean and quiet as most cars.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, we should be environmentally conscious about what and
how we drive, and compared to where we were 10 and 20 years ago we
are far along that road.
</P>
<P>
   But it is humorous, sometimes, to read letters to the editor
from those who feel morally superior because they hate SUVs so
much; those who write in to say they are saving the earth because
they drive little Hondas or Subarus to and from their homes in the
suburbs around Boston. I always wonder how many of them go home
each night to a sprawling, restored Victorian or other house that
is arguably far larger than what their family requires, but is
instead what they want, and whose multiple rooms they gladly heat
all winter from a dwindling global fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when things are big. A big economy, big
houses, big cars and trucks. What is truly fascinating is that we
have had this expansion of jobs and homes and transportation and
still, somehow, managed to do it all even as we steadily have
cleaned our environment.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't had to ban big trucks any more than we have had to
ban big homes or big industry. Instead, we have set standards of
performance for all these things _ from insulation in our homes to
fuel standards for our vehicles to pollution from our factories _
and, though it may seem too gradual a process for some (or not
Draconian enough for others) it is working.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just the framework that's been laid out for us.
Within that framework, we can all live in as big a house as we can
afford and drive as big a truck as we want, but any one of us who
fails to approach these opportunities with responsibility is simply
a jerk. Heat that 12-room Victorian that is home to a family of
four to 72 degrees through the winter and you make the list.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a near-empty, gas-guzzling SUV around town for small
errands or to and from work and you make the list. Use it to
tailgate or intimidate smaller vehicles, you go to the top of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that responsibility, common sense, and courtesy are
often lacking on our highways, but when they are present there is
plenty of room out there on the road for all our automotive tastes
and the wonderful and ever-evolving array of the vehicles we get to
drive.

A WAKE-UP CALL FOR FUND TITANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mutual fund industry has long lived by the slogan made
popular by Greyhound: Leave the driving to us.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying premise of mutual funds is that managing money is
a job for professionals. They know when to buy, what to buy, and
how much to buy. Entrust your money to them, the thinking goes, and
you can sit back, enjoy the ride, and reach your destination
safely.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, thanks to the rise of the Internet, many people have
decided they would rather drive themselves. This group prefers to
buy and sell their own stocks, relying on their own instincts and
their own information. For the moment at least, these investors
seem willing to take more risks for the chance to reap greater
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the day: How worried should the mutual fund
industry be about all this?
</P>
<P>
   The flow of new money into mutual funds has slowed sharply this
year. According to Financial Research Corp., a Boston firm, stock
and bond funds attracted $63 billion in new investment in the first
four months of 1999, down from $118 billion in the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the year was a strong one for the stock
market, so the dropoff cannot be attributed to some general
skittishness on the part of investors. In fact, trading volume was
extremely high during the period; on-line brokerage firms saw their
business grow 30 to 35 percent in the first quarter, according to a
report by CS First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious explanation for the decline is that some of the
money that typically would have gone into funds instead went into
direct purchases of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat skeptical of that idea at first, but I've come
around,'' says Burt Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant based in
Philadelphia. When you go to cocktail parties these days, he says,
everyone is buzzing about buying stocks, especially Internet
stocks. ``Someone says, `Joe made money in stocks. How come we
didn't?' So they go out and buy stocks too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenwald is not convinced that the shift to stock-buying
represents a real threat to mutual funds. Once the Internet bubble
bursts, and people start to lose money, he predicts, investors will
once again appreciate the safety and security of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar, a local consulting firm,
makes the same point. ``These days people feel they can do no
wrong,'' says Harvey. ``Once they feel the pinch of losses, they
may feel differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund executives generally pooh-poohed the stock-buying
boom when they gathered last week in Washington for their annual
convention. They talked about the false sense of security investors
have developed and warned people against being seduced by the lure
of quick riches. Their message seemed to be: When you come to your
senses, you will realize we are the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   But what if that doesn't happen? What if some percentage of
investors find they like the do-it-yourself model better?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet in general is an empowering medium. It eliminates
the need for middlemen and puts the consumer in the driver's seat.
In the financial world, the Internet has leveled the playing field,
giving investors access to tools and information that once were the
exclusive domain of the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gazala, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
doesn't expect to see mass defections from mutual funds. For a
great many people, they are a perfect fit. But he predicts that a
certain segment of investors, having ventured off on their own, may
``be very hard to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember now that mutual funds weren't always
the investment vehicle of choice. Until 20 years ago, the vast
majority of people kept their money in the bank. They moved into
money-market funds in the late 1970s, bond funds in the 1980s, and
stock funds in the 1990s. Once they left the banks, they too didn't
go back.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies cannot afford to be complacent. Times
change, technology changes, consumer preferences change. People who
once thought the bus was the only way to travel can find new ways
to get from here to there.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS PICK TO WRONG TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ David Brower is revered by many in the
environmental movement, but I am glad he didn't win the Sierra Club
presidency in last weekend's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Had he won, he told reporters, he would have considered
resurrecting immigration as an environmental issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, one of the nation's best known environmental
groups, was obliged by petition to hold a divisive vote of the
membership last year on whether to support increased restrictions
on immigration to the United States. The proposition didn't get
enough votes to change the neutral position of the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Brower and other dissidents favor another
confrontation on the issue. As I noted at the time of the first
Sierra Club vote, targeting immigration as a way to improve our
environment was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been a slight lessening of anti-immigrant
fever in California since its height five years ago when then-Gov.
Pete Wilson, desperate for re-election, exploited poor immigrants
to win another term in office.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year California voters approved Proposition 187,
which sought to take away public services from undocumented
immigrants, including schooling for their children.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. and California economies have soared, immigrant
bashing has receded somewhat. But there are exceptions, such as the
focus on Chinese-American scientists who work in U.S. weapons labs
because of reports that Chinese spies have been stealing secrets of
American weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Brower's decision to drop his challenge of Chuck McGrady
for the Sierra Club presidency, it is worth reviewing why it's
wrongheaded to blame immigration for degrading the U.S.
environment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief culprits in environmental damage is our
unbelievable level of consumption of natural resources. By ``our,''
I mean Americans, not foreigners coming here to better their lives
(and, in many cases, contributing to the betterment of the United
States). I still find it remarkable that Americans _ only about 4
percent of the world's population _ consume about 40 percent of the
world's fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans do not realize just how wealthy _ and
materialistic _ we are. We take our exalted economic status for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know we still have an aching poverty problem in this
country, but it is nothing compared with the poverty in developing
countries. The wealth gap is a reason why people from other nations
want to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Without conscience, many of us lust after bigger and more
environmentally damaging vehicles like the status symbol of the
1990s, the sport utility vehicle. Few owners take these monstrous
light trucks into the backwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Even much higher gasoline prices have not deterred many of us
from seeking out the modern gas guzzler. Hey, what's a few extra
bucks for the privilege of driving a privatized tank?
</P>
<P>
   The never-ending rise in our standard of living is also driving
our desire for bigger homes that consume more water, electricity
and natural gas. A 2,000-square-foot home is now considered a
closet by many affluent Americans, who think nothing of buying
abodes with 3,000 or more square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Given the insatiable consumption patterns of the U.S.
population, I would suggest the Sierra Club focus on doing what it
can to reduce our materialism and not waste its time picking on
immigration as an environmental scapegoat.
</P>

APACHE PILOTS PRACTICE IN CASE OF REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>

the pilot.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS, Albania _ Lieutenant Matthew ----, an Apache helicopter
pilot with the earnest manners and easygoing grin of a war movie
ace, doesn't know what it feels like to fire rockets at real
people.
</P>
<P>
   And with Washington and NATO still debating when, and even
whether, to employ the lethal, low-flying Apaches against the
Yugoslav Army in Kosovo, he's wondering if he'll go home without
finding out.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew, 25, did know one thing Monday: He wasn't planning
to be up in time for breakfast this morning. He was scheduled to
fly another training mission Tuesday night _ just in case his
ground-hugging, heavily armed aircraft ever does get sent into
combat. With post-flight analysis and the possibility of another
good video (the Vietnam classic ``Deer Hunter'' was Sunday's
choice), he knew he might not get to bed until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're busy, but we're not exactly in a hurry,'' Matthew said,
only half-joking. ``We wait for the mail. We wander around. We do
whatever needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew and the other Army pilots' lives have been like that for
nearly a month. Sent to Albania in the glare of publicity, they
have been left to wait in the heat for a decision, along with
everyone else. Just Monday, NATO's supreme commander, General
Wesley K. Clark was on the sprawling Rinas base saying that more
live-fire exercises are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 24 Apaches mostly sit idle on a runway at the
airport just outside the Albanian capital of Tirana, on farmland
and property that has been leased or purchased by the military.
Intended to strike close up at Serbian targets in Yugoslavia,
unlike the high-flying Navy or Air Force planes, the Apache was
initially heralded as the war machine to halt Serb-led Yugoslavia's
war on the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon and President Clinton appear reluctant to test
the Apache's prowess in combat and put American lives at risk. Two
Apaches have crashed in nighttime exercises in Albania, the last
time killing two pilots. Matthew, who flew over Bosnia but has
never directly engaged the enemy in combat, says he is in no hurry
to find out how he and his aircraft would do in Serbian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the military is going to tell you they want to go
into a situation where they may get killed,'' he said. ``But that's
my job and I don't have any qualms about doing it. I don't want to
shoot anyone. But I do want to make sure this is over as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Matthew explained between running a pre-flight check _
kicking the tires, he called it _ and practicing a hop over to
Belgrade on a flight simulator that resembles an advanced video
game, each Apache is assigned two pilots. One sits in back and
flies the chopper. The front-seater fires the rockets. Matthew is
the one who sits up front and does the shooting, though only over
water during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew, who grew up in Flint, Mich., was 17 when he went to a
West Point. He went on to major in civil engineering and insisted
that building bridges wouldn't bore him if he decided to put his
degree to use after his Army stint ends.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he owes the military at least 3 1/2 more years
and, despite the boredom at the Rinas base, he said he has no
complaints. Unlike some other pilots and crew members who have
expressed frustration at their stalled status, he even said he was
having fun. He is, however, a bit envious of pilots from other NATO
nations, who can drink liquor on base and go off-base for
recreation _ both taboo for the American military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to fly, ever since I went to my first air
show,'' said Matthew, the grandson of a Navy pilot who flew in
World War II as well as a ringer for Tom Cruise in the movie ``Top
Gun.'' ``I'm getting to do what I want to do, and it really doesn't
matter where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stationed in Germany when he isn't stuck on the ground outside
Tirana, Matthew described days that might be maddening to someone
unfamiliar with the small routines of military life. Grab a banana
and orange after opting for sleep instead of breakfast; shower,
shave, pick up the day's mission order. Attend a briefing, study
satellite imagery, cadge cookies from a buddy's care package from
home, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache pilots and ground crew members are using the down
time to make sure the aircraft are in flawless working order and to
improve their knowledge of what and whom they may be up against.
During each training mission, Matthew said, he studies the terrain,
notes previously unseen transmission wires, hovers over anything
unfamiliar to take a closer look. By now, he has seen the entire
Albanian coast and is conversant with local architectural styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots are constantly updating maps,'' said Captain Martin
Downie, an Army spokesman and a Springfield, Mass., native. ``Each
time they go up, they're maximizing their knowledge and making it
safer and safer for the day they have to fly'' into enemy
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew's regular helicopter is back in Germany, since the Army
brought only half the Apaches stationed there. Fortunately, most of
his friends from that relatively small base of 600 or so came, too.
Now, he said, they keep one another company.
</P>
<P>
   They also try to remember how much money they are saving, since
they are living tax-free while all of their expenses are covered.
Still, he'd rather return to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we got back in time for Oktoberfest in October, and
I've got my fingers crossed now,'' Matthew said. ``Just imagine it.
Guys who have been stuck in Albania for four months. Guys who have
had to go that long without beer.''

DANIEL YURMAN: JEWELRY DESIGNER TO THE WORKING WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 3:30 p.m. on a rainy Thursday in Boston, and New York
jewelry designer David Yurman is strolling casually _ and
anonymously _ through Saks Fifth Avenue. Already, he's checked out
the jewelry department (of course) and menswear. Now he's quietly
headed to shop colognes when, alas, his cover is blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're David Yurman!'' says an awe-struck Marsha Primack, of
Sharon, who intercepts him at the escalator. ``You're my favorite
de-
</P>
<P>
   signer. I love your work. I have your ring. Look!'' she says,
holding up her hand for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Andrea Primack, Marsha's daughter, ``I live in Houston and
everybody is dripping with David Yurman down there. You're a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Winston Inc., eat your heart out. To become a famous
jewelry designer today, you don't need glittering diamonds and a
celebrity clientele. You need designs that working women can wear
every day and night.
</P>
<P>
   A former dishwasher, truck driver, and dry-cleaning delivery
man, Yurman found success with a simple bracelet. Fourteen years
ago, he twisted silver strands into a cable-coil design that
quickly became a classic and earned him millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Women love the open-ended design (the bracelet isn't a complete
circle) because it's a look that can be worn to work or dinner. And
the style _ often seen with jewels or gold adorning the tips _ is
so recognizable that it's now considered a prestige brand. (Yurman
says the style originates from ancient Egypt. He modernized it by
making the metal lighter and easy to wear with a hinge in the
circle.)
</P>
<P>
   Yurman _ who gave up studying economics at New York University
years ago _ advertises his work in magazines such as Vogue, Vanity
Fair, and Forbes. He has expanded his collections to include men's
and women's watches, cuff links, rings, belts, necklaces and, soon
to be introduced, home accessories like cutlery and vases. In
November, he'll open his first store on New York's Madison Avenue.

   ``We're bridging the gap between fashion and fine jewelry,''
says Yurman. ``Part of my job as a designer is to sense the mood in
fashion and look for what isn't there'' in jewelry. With that in
mind, Yurman recently introduced a collection featuring chalcedony
stones (periwinkle blue) to match all the gray clothes of last
winter, and pink tourmaline to coordinate with all the trendy pink
items of spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yurman, a New York native, is the son of a belt maker. He began
his career as a sculptor in the 1960s, apprenticing with artists
such as Jacques Lipchitz and Theodore Rozack. ``I learned about the
ritual of art,'' he says. ``To center yourself, you establish a
living pattern and do the same thing everyday. That way, you don't
have to think about it. You only think about your work.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Yurman began making accessories _ mostly sculpted belt
buckles _ when a friend suggested he could sell the goods at
accessory and craft shows. ``I borrowed $500 from the Jewish Free
Loan Society,'' he says. ``I made a belt for my wife (Sybil) and we
walked into an art gallery where the owner gasped and wanted to
know if the belt was for sale. I said no and my wife said yes. . .
. I was thinking, `I made that belt for you!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Yurmans ended up leaving the belt at the store and the owner
took four orders for it in one hour. ``My motto the last 15 years
has been, be careful what you wish for, you may get it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Yurman's customers grew from craft and art
galleries to include stores like Neiman Marcus and Saks. In 1985,
he introduced his cable collection, which really established his
name. ``I remember showing it to Cartier. They said it would never
sell,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   These days Yurman _ who runs his company with his wife _ employs
150 people, including 12 product developers. ``I sketch. They
execute. . . . I relish a weekend when I can listen to music and
skim through art and architecture magazines, and then sketch,'' he
says. Yurman produces thousands of sketches a year, but only about
200 to 250 new products.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good jeweler, Yurman has to worry a lot about
knockoffs. ``We have three legal situations in the fire now,'' he
says. In 1996, the company successfully sued discount outlet Price
Costco Inc. for promoting unauthorized Yurmans in its holiday
catalog. Now the firm employs an in-house counsel and a paralegal.
``We're protecting the brand,'' he says, but also concedes that
``if you're not successful, they're not going to copy you.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Yurman isn't for everyone. His prices range from
$600 for a ring or bracelet to a whopping $19,000 for a new line of
diamond and 18-carat-gold watches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Primack, ``When you're looking for the right
bracelet, he's a great modern artist. His things are classic. They
won't go out of style.''

THE LOVE THAT GROWS ON TREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does your breath catch when you come upon a tree gloriously
crowned with sunlit blossoms? Does your heart stop at the sight of
glowing green weeping willow buds? Does your head whirl at maple
tree flowers?
</P>
<P>
   Mine does. I've been having a love affair with trees ever since
my husband and I went to Newport, R.I., for a wedding last summer.
</P>
<P>
   We'd been invited to visit the bride's parents before the
ceremony, but our bed and breakfast was at one end of town and
their inn was at the other, several miles away. Around 11 on
Saturday morning, Jack and I set off on foot to visit Pat and Fran,
his college roommate.
</P>
<P>
   It was perfect wedding weather _ brilliant blue sky, a sea
sequined with glints of sunshine _ but it was very hot, especially
since I wasn't wearing a hat or sunglasses. With the sun directly
overhead, buildings didn't offer much shade, so Jack and I took to
pausing under trees.
</P>
<P>
   It was remarkably cool under their leaves. We'd sweat our way
through air hot as a sauna, then sigh with pleasure as we entered a
magical shaded realm where the air was cool and the brilliance of
the day no longer hurt our eyes. The air smelled sweeter. The
leaves of certain large trees I shamefully cannot identify formed a
whispering canopy above us. I felt intensely grateful. I began to
feel as if trees had been offering human beings shelter in their
shade all my life, but that for some reason I had never before
noticed their generosity of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   It's embarrassing, but I confess that I walked over to the
twisted, yet graceful, trunk of one lovely tree, put my arms around
it and laid my cheek against its smooth gray surface. For a brief
moment I had the distinct feeling that the tree was aware of my
presence, that within my arms something was responding to my rush
of gratitude with pleasure. If I had been alone and without a
destination, I swear I would have settled down among its roots and
read a book, just to keep it company.
</P>
<P>
   Jack takes these passions of mine in stride, but I never told
anyone lse until last night, when, in a discussion of spirituality
at our church, a woman named Sandra mentioned in passing that
during a lunchtime walk she had kissed every magnolia tree she
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What possessed you?'' I said to her after class. ``I thought I
was the only one carrying on a love affair with trees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' she replied. ``Trees were one of the first
objects of worship in human history. Don't you know about the
druids?''
</P>
<P>
   I do now.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand years ago, the druids practiced an earth-based
religion rooted in a profound attunement to nature. The druids
revered the yew, which can live for 3,000 years, as the sacred tree
of death and rebirth. Its longevity, combined with its being an
evergreen, gave the yew power as the tree of eternal life. The
druids also revered beech trees, symbolizing tradition, learning,
and wisdom, in part because they produce a plentiful harvest of
nourishing beech nuts. Each of these trees was traditionally
planted at each side of the gate to stone circles still standing at
ancient druidic sites in Britain. Nearby, in North Salem, N.H., we
have our own site called ``America's Stonehenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience comes when we allow ourselves to follow the voice
of the yew, to die and be reborn. Knowledge comes when we allow
ourselves to be fed by the beech _ the accumulated wisdom of the
past,'' writes Philip Carr-Gomm in his book, ``The Druid Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Camping one night upon an artificial hill built by the druids
for reasons we can only surmise, Carr-Gomm writes, ``I must sleep
here. Here on these sacred mounds we are at a place lifted up _
close to the sky, close to earth. The two meet and mingle, make
love, move together. And if we are quiet we can hear the earth
breathe and sigh, and we feel the pulse deep within.'' Ah, here's a
man after my own heart.
</P>
<P>
   When something changes inside, the external world also shifts.
That probably is why this spring for the first time I seem to be
stumbling upon so many instances of people in similar communion
with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what retired rabbi Everett Gendler says of the objects of
his passionate encounters: ``There have been a few of these, not in
their vastness, but in their intimacy, which have seemed to pulsate
with subtle, subdued life. I felt an awareness beyond my
comprehension, insisting, `Hey, that life force is right here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   You think it's far-fetched for me to believe that trees have
souls?
</P>
<P>
   Gendler's talking about rocks.

WITH MAY NEARLY SPENT, SO MUCH TO DO REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's so much to do and so little time. Nature has its
timetable which cannot be ignored. If you love gardening and have
all sorts of wonderful ideas, spring can sometimes seem
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   But don't despair; just tackle a little at a time and eventually
enough gets done, for a garden is a never-finished
work-in-progress. No matter what lovely flowers my eyes may alight
upon, I find a chore awaiting beneath the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's even a nice surprise, like volunteer perennial
plants that can be moved to expand and grow. Prices being what they
are, perennials that renew themselves are a treasure indeed, as
long as they don't spread too vigorously. (Incidentally, if your
local garden club has a plant sale, you can often find varieties
with old-fashioned reseeding genes from members' gardens.)
</P>
<P>
   I was amused that Gertrude Jekyll, the Victorian doyenne of
perennials, always carried her garden shears to nip an errant shoot
or spent flower head (while her gardener did the digging and
planting). I, too, always carry my shears as well as a big
container for errant weeds that need pulling (by me).
</P>
<P>
   Tempting photographs in gardening magazines have fed the craving
for gorgeous, lavish flower displays. Horticultural fatigue can
easily set in when our eyes are bigger than our time, so here are
some time-saving tips. Don't expect to do them all, just what you
can, and enjoy gardening as a pastime, not a contest.
</P>
<P>
   --Mulch. It looks neater, keeps the weeds down and the soil
moist. About 2 inches deep is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   --Replace difficult perennials with types that are easier to
care for.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, consider peonies, iberis, coral bells, columbine.
</P>
<P>
   For summer, try perennial phlox, day lilies, coneflower,
rudbeckia, and coreopsis.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, use Sedum spectabilis and buy nursery-forced
chrysanthemums each year.
</P>
<P>
   --Consolidate flower beds so they are fuller and more effective.
Lots of skinny borders take more care and don't make such a
colorful spash. I have my main flower bed just outside the window
where I eat my breakfast so that I can see and enjoy it each day.
</P>
<P>
   --Combine plants by maintenance requirements, especially
watering.
</P>
<P>
   --To make beds look neat, edge the beds with a deep, crisp cut.
It does visual wonders.
</P>
<P>
   --Before you mulch, put down some granular or organic
fertilizer, and lime as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the month ends, test some of the new three-month slow
release pelletized fertilizer on part of the garden. (June will be
too late.) Don't use the six-month or eight-month fertilizers
because they will cause soft growth too late in the season, and
then trees, shrubs and perennial plants would not harden off before
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Pelletized fertilizer is fine anytime for pots of annuals
though.
</P>
<P>
   --Do away with poor grass, especially under trees. Replace it
with ground cover or just plain mulch, architecturally designed in
a perfect circle or an interesting shape. If you must have grass,
seed with shade-tolerant fescue the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   --Try a string trimmer although it's another added neatness
chore. Caution: Don't hit tree trunks or shrubs with the nylon
string because it gouges the bark. Messy looking ground covers
(myrtle, ivy, pachysandra, euonymus, ajuga, lamium) can be
string-trimmed to 2 inches, which encourages neater, new growth.
</P>
<P>
   --Protect transplants from sun and wind for a few days with
upside down flower pots, milk containers with tops and bottoms cut
out, newspaper hats secured with rocks, or staked paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   --Set up permanent hoses with sprinkler heads in just the right
place, then turn on the water when it's needed. You can even hide
the hoses under mulch or in shrub beds. It's worth the investment
in all-season time-saving. There are double and even triple hose
adapters, with shutoffs, that can be screwed onto a water spigot so
that more than one hose can be attached. Also available are
shape-adjustable sprinkler heads.
</P>
<P>
   --Hire a company to mow or fertilize the lawn, or both. Just
make sure to inquire about what is being put on the lawn, and that
it is mowed at least 2 inches high. If you don't fertilize too much
and you aren't a green-carpet perfection person, mowing every two
weeks during July and August is plenty. By mid-September, though,
the lawn usually needs weekly mowing again.

APACHE PILOTS PRACTICE IN CASE OF REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Papers planning to use the May 25 transmission of this story
are advised to use this substitute version, which deletes the full
name of the pilot.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS, Albania _ Lieutenant Matthew ----, an Apache helicopter
pilot with the earnest manners and easygoing grin of a war movie
ace, doesn't know what it feels like to fire rockets at real
people.
</P>
<P>
   And with Washington and NATO still debating when, and even
whether, to employ the lethal, low-flying Apaches against the
Yugoslav Army in Kosovo, he's wondering if he'll go home without
finding out.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew, 25, did know one thing Monday: He wasn't planning
to be up in time for breakfast this morning. He was scheduled to
fly another training mission Tuesday night _ just in case his
ground-hugging, heavily armed aircraft ever does get sent into
combat. With post-flight analysis and the possibility of another
good video (the Vietnam classic ``Deer Hunter'' was Sunday's
choice), he knew he might not get to bed until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're busy, but we're not exactly in a hurry,'' Matthew said,
only half-joking. ``We wait for the mail. We wander around. We do
whatever needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew and the other Army pilots' lives have been like that for
nearly a month. Sent to Albania in the glare of publicity, they
have been left to wait in the heat for a decision, along with
everyone else. Just Monday, NATO's supreme commander, General
Wesley K. Clark was on the sprawling Rinas base saying that more
live-fire exercises are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 24 Apaches mostly sit idle on a runway at the
airport just outside the Albanian capital of Tirana, on farmland
and property that has been leased or purchased by the military.
Intended to strike close up at Serbian targets in Yugoslavia,
unlike the high-flying Navy or Air Force planes, the Apache was
initially heralded as the war machine to halt Serb-led Yugoslavia's
war on the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon and President Clinton appear reluctant to test
the Apache's prowess in combat and put American lives at risk. Two
Apaches have crashed in nighttime exercises in Albania, the last
time killing two pilots. Matthew, who flew over Bosnia but has
never directly engaged the enemy in combat, says he is in no hurry
to find out how he and his aircraft would do in Serbian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the military is going to tell you they want to go
into a situation where they may get killed,'' he said. ``But that's
my job and I don't have any qualms about doing it. I don't want to
shoot anyone. But I do want to make sure this is over as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Matthew explained between running a pre-flight check _
kicking the tires, he called it _ and practicing a hop over to
Belgrade on a flight simulator that resembles an advanced video
game, each Apache is assigned two pilots. One sits in back and
flies the chopper. The front-seater fires the rockets. Matthew is
the one who sits up front and does the shooting, though only over
water during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew, who grew up in Flint, Mich., was 17 when he went to a
West Point. He went on to major in civil engineering and insisted
that building bridges wouldn't bore him if he decided to put his
degree to use after his Army stint ends.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he owes the military at least 3 1/2 more years
and, despite the boredom at the Rinas base, he said he has no
complaints. Unlike some other pilots and crew members who have
expressed frustration at their stalled status, he even said he was
having fun. He is, however, a bit envious of pilots from other NATO
nations, who can drink liquor on base and go off-base for
recreation _ both taboo for the American military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to fly, ever since I went to my first air
show,'' said Matthew, the grandson of a Navy pilot who flew in
World War II as well as a ringer for Tom Cruise in the movie ``Top
Gun.'' ``I'm getting to do what I want to do, and it really doesn't
matter where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stationed in Germany when he isn't stuck on the ground outside
Tirana, Matthew described days that might be maddening to someone
unfamiliar with the small routines of military life. Grab a banana
and orange after opting for sleep instead of breakfast; shower,
shave, pick up the day's mission order. Attend a briefing, study
satellite imagery, cadge cookies from a buddy's care package from
home, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache pilots and ground crew members are using the down
time to make sure the aircraft are in flawless working order and to
improve their knowledge of what and whom they may be up against.
During each training mission, Matthew said, he studies the terrain,
notes previously unseen transmission wires, hovers over anything
unfamiliar to take a closer look. By now, he has seen the entire
Albanian coast and is conversant with local architectural styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots are constantly updating maps,'' said Captain Martin
Downie, an Army spokesman and a Springfield, Mass., native. ``Each
time they go up, they're maximizing their knowledge and making it
safer and safer for the day they have to fly'' into enemy
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew's regular helicopter is back in Germany, since the Army
brought only half the Apaches stationed there. Fortunately, most of
his friends from that relatively small base of 600 or so came, too.
Now, he said, they keep one another company.
</P>
<P>
   They also try to remember how much money they are saving, since
they are living tax-free while all of their expenses are covered.
Still, he'd rather return to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we got back in time for Oktoberfest in October, and
I've got my fingers crossed now,'' Matthew said. ``Just imagine it.
Guys who have been stuck in Albania for four months. Guys who have
had to go that long without beer.''

FOR LUXURIOUS BEDDING, COUNT THE THREADS

<P>
   Thread count. Thread count. Thread count.
</P>
<P>
   Once the concern of European royalty, the obsession with thread
count _ or the number of threads in a square inch of fabric, which
indicates how tightly they are woven _ filtered down a few years
ago to the very, very rich. Now, it has entered the realm of the
masses _ or at least of those middle-class Americans who have a
little extra spending money and want kingly comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High thread count equals comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And comfort is what people want when they are buying sheets.
After all, we spend one-third of our lives in
</P>
<P>
   bed, so why not spend it in beautiful, luxurious, soft bed
clothing? Bed linens are our second skin _ or third, if you count
pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend more than $2 billion a year on sheets. Of that
total, 48 percent is on sheets with a 180 thread count and 38
percent with a 200 to 250 thread count, according to the trade
publication Home Furnishing News.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a continuing interest in accelerated thread counts,''
says Kim Lanciloti, Filene's home fashion director. ``The thread
count game has translated into the department store,'' rather than
remaining the exclusive province of specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want anything under a 200 thread count these
days,'' Lanciloti says. ``Cotton is also important. A couple of
years ago, people were still buying blends'' of cotton and
polyester. ``But today they want 100 percent cotton. So cotton plus
a higher thread count gives consumers the desired softness.''
</P>
<P>
   And it can be a good deal, too. This is one instance, Lanciloti
says, where product improvement does not mean soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Bruno, director of public relations at Bloomingdale's, sees
the same shift in the market. When it comes to comfort, Bruno says,
``Customers know what they want when buying sheets. High quality is
a must, and anything less than a 200 thread count is undesirable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charisma by Fieldcrest begins at 310, while (Calvin) Klein and
(Ralph) Lauren start at 200,'' says Bruno. ``But once customers
have slept on Charisma sheets, it's difficult to buy anything under
a 300 thread count.''
</P>
<P>
   A Charisma flat sheet in queen size with a 310 thread count
costs around $112.
</P>
<P>
   While the older customer buys a traditional brand such as
Charisma or Ralph Lauren's blues and beiges, younger folks lean
toward the trendier Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   A flat queen sheet in Lauren's Brooke line with a 200 thread
count costs around $40. A 280 thread count in Egyptian sateen in
Lauren's Kathleen &AMP; Emily line is around $60 at Filene's.
</P>
<P>
   For the really hip and young, there's Tommy Hilfiger. And for
teenage girls, Laura Ashley remains popular with her traditional
floral prints in lavender, sage, and gray. Both designers use 100
percent cotton, and their prices are in the $50 to $60 range.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Luxury detailing
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are not only gravitating toward more luxury fabrics,
but they also want luxury detailing,'' says Filene's Lanciloti, who
points to Croscill as another popular line. ``They are looking for
hemstitching, embroidery, and lace. Some of our solid sheets have
grosgrain ribbon detailing that customers seem to like.''
</P>
<P>
   And the most popular colors? Deep purple and lilac, blues and
beiges. The hottest ``in'' color, retailers say, is yellow.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a bit more money to spend on luxuries, there are
several specialty linen shops with top-of-the-line offerings in
bedding.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular higher-end sheet lines is Palais Royal,
made by a French company that has been selling its line of 100
percent Egyptian cotton prints, embroidered cottons, and jacquards
in the United States for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Linens on the Hill in Boston carries this line exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palais Royal is high-end but affordable,'' says owner Lynne
Wolverton. ``They make such beautiful designs that fit my taste.
And they have expanded their embroideries in the last few years.''
Queen sets range from $300 to $600, she says.
</P>

   Palais Royal is also a top seller at Bonsoir in Wellesley and
Lexington, Mass. Other popular lines, according to owner Jennifer
Berg, include Nancy Koltes, an Italian manufacturer of luxurious
bedding whose Eleanor's Ribbon, with a thread count of 320, runs
$220 for a queen flat sheet; and Sferra, another Italian maker,
whose Celeste line, with a 406 thread count, is very popular (a
queen set is $370). Other lines of note are Malabar Grove, Bonjour
of Switzerland, Lisa Galimberti, and Angel Simick. All their linens
are made from Egyptian cotton, reportedly the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street in Wellesley is Periwinkles, a decorating
store for children that started out with hand-painted furniture for
infants, young children, and teenagers and has moved into bedding
and custom bedding. Again, Palais Royal is a big seller here too.

   Another small store, the Linen Closet in Boston, carries such
basic lines as Wamsutta, Springmaid, Esprit, and Hillcrest but also
has some unusual linens by less universally known European
designers.
</P>
<P>
   Souleiado of France, for example, makes a 100 percent percale
cotton with a 220 thread count called Maussane Fleurs. A queen flat
sheet costs $64.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plaid and floral print combination makes it appealing to
both males and females,'' says store owner and buyer Ilana Jerome.
``It's not too fussy. The thread count is 220, but the sheets are
very soft because the thread is spun very tightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another up-and-coming designer, says Jerome, is Anki Spets of
Sweden. The store carries only her duvet and shams, in a softly
colored and classic line called Blocks, but hopes to have sheets in
the pattern in the near future. They do carry sheets in her Tape
line, with sea-green and silvery gray stripes. A queen flat sheet
costs $69.99.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular lines for the under-30 crowd is Pen and
Ink by Esprit. The colors are sage and stark white, in a floral and
plaid combination, so ``guys and girls can share the same bed,
because it's both feminine and masculine and has a nice
flat-finished edging.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratesi linens, a 90-year-old Italian firm known for providing
linens to monarchs, wealthy businessmen, sheiks, and popes, has a
Boston shop. Pratesi, according to store manager Connie Chinaglia,
is the highest-quality linen line sold in the United States (their
only competitor being France's Porthault). The thread count of
Pratesi linens tops out at 880. The price for a set of flat and
fitted sheets with two pillow shams begins at $1,080.
</P>
<P>
   In a published interview, the head of Pratesi is quoted as
saying: ``Our sheets are sun-dried in Italy and, therefore,
perfumed in sunshine.'' Athos Pratesi goes on to describe his
flower prints as ``bringing the charm of a medieval garden to your
home. Nothing is more regenerating for a person than slipping
between fresh sheets so sweet and soft to the touch. Silk is the
best because it maintains the temperature of the body. It's like
having another skin. I become a poet when I think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such poetry and perfume were not always so costly. Sun-dried
sheets only cost the price of a clothesline, clothespins, and a
housewife's time during my childhood. But, alas, my children have
never known the delicious smell and soothing comfort of sheets that
had hung on a clothesline all day _ they crawled into bed with
sheets that had spent 40 minutes in the basement dryer.

divided, and that the Jewish vote will be swayed more by her stands
on such issues as education, health care and Social Security. By

ADD FUN AND FLAVOR TO SALADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are only two times a year when I crave salads: in the
middle of winter, when I'm on the verge of catching a cold, and the
beginning of summer when all produce seems fresh and new.
</P>
<P>
   Those are times when I eat salads almost constantly. To keep
this grazing from becoming boring, I've learned to add a few things
to your basic lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber:
</P>
<P>
   _ Meats and fish turn a simple salad into an entree. Try topping
green salads with leftover steak, chicken or tuna.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheese. If you put steak on that salad, add a little blue
cheese. Have just a green salad? Top it with a bit of parmesan or
feta. A small amount of a highly flavored cheese can go a long way
toward making the bland better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nuts and seeds. Whether it's sesame seeds for an Asian touch
or sunflower seeds topping fruit and cottage cheese, seeds add
texture and flavor. Nuts do, too. Have you ever had a Waldorf
without walnuts?
</P>
<P>
   _ Dried fruit. Raisins, craisins and bits of dried apricot will
add a ``chewy'' component.
</P>
<P>
   _ Herbs. Finely chopped fresh herbs can add complexity to your
salad. Add mint to a light fruit salad, parsley to a green salad or
basil to a salad with tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salt and pepper. Sometimes it's the simplest things that are
the most effective. A bit of salt and a few grinds of fresh pepper
can make even iceberg lettuce seem flavorful.

THERE'S MORE TO JAM THAN BREAKFAST TOAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jellies, preserves and marmalades are more than bread spreads.
Try a few of these ideas to get the most out of a jar of jam:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use any flavor as a topping, spooned over ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Swirl into plain yogurt for a low-calorie snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place a dab in the middle of batter before baking muffins or
cupcakes for a surprise inside.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add orange marmalade and rehydrated bits of dried fruit to
wild rice for an interesting side dish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread on grilled chicken just before serving to add a
slightly sweet glaze.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a quick appetizer, spoon dabs of jelly over cream cheese
and serve with crackers or toasts. (Burgundy wine jelly is
particularly good for this.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread a layer of apricot jam between layers of white cakes.
Frost with fluffy white icing and top cake with flaked coconut.
Other good combinations are strawberry jam with chocolate cake and
whipped cream for frosting, and lemon cake with raspberry jam and
buttercream frosting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stir jam to thin. (Use apricot if making yellow cake, or
raspberry if making chocolate cake.) Brush on cooled cake layers to
prevent crumbs from mixing into frosting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Combine a jar of peach jam with one envelope onion soup mix.
Use mixture to marinate chicken breasts before grilling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Melt currant jelly over warm heat and use to glaze the tops of
strawberry or blueberry tarts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Combine 1 cup apricot preserves and 2 tablespoons dark rum or
cognac to glaze the tops of apple or pear tarts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Combine 1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam, 1/2 cup mayonnaise and
4 tablespoons Dijon mustard in a large bowl. Add 2 cups diced,
cooked chicken breast, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1 cup chopped
celery, 2 cups chopped apples, salt and pepper. Toss to coat well
with mayonnaise-jam mixture. Garnish with fresh raspberries. (From
Smuckers)
</P>
<P>
   _ Combine 1 cup apricot preserves, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1
teaspoon chili powder and 1 clove minced garlic. Serve as a dipping
sauce with cooked chicken wings or chicken tenders. (From Smuckers)
</P>
<P>
   _ To make sweet and sour sauce, melt 1/2 cup currant jelly, 1/4
cup cider vinegar, 3 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 tablespoon
cornstarch in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook 3 minutes
until mixture is clear.
</P>
<P>
   JAMMY BISCUITS
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 8 servings)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter plus more for the pan
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peach jam
</P>
<P>
   1/8 cup minced crystallized ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 425 degrees. Grease an 8-inch square pan liberally
with butter.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 1/2 cup butter in a small saucepan. Pour 1/4 cup butter out
of pan and reserve. Add the jam and ginger to pan and stir, over
very low heat, until mixed. Pour into bottom of greased pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt. Make a
well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the remaining
melted butter and milk. Use a wooden spoon to quickly mix until the
dough holds together in a rough ball.
</P>
<P>
   Turn out dough onto a floured surface and roll into a
12-by-8-inch rectangle. Combine the brown sugar and pecans and
sprinkle over the dough. Roll, starting with short side, into a
log. Cut into 8 biscuits. Place biscuits into pan snugly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 15 minutes, until the tops of the biscuits are golden.
Allow to cool for 3 minutes then invert onto a serving plate. Serve
warm.

Students like Meersman, who plan to return to academia as

`BLUE HOUR' IS MYSTERY WRITING AT ITS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's usually the kiss of death to say of a new book, ``I
challenge anyone to sit down with this novel and get up without
having finished it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Elizabeth George, author of ``Deception
on His Mind,'' says about T. Jefferson Parker's new mystery, ``The
Blue Hour'' (Hyperion. $23.95. 359 pages).
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there isn't a book that's been written by anyone,
anywhere, that you can't put down _ most of them for long periods
of time. If you finish a book in one sitting it usually says more
about the time you have on your hands than it does about the
quality of the writing.
</P>
<P>
   But give Parker his due. ``The Blue Hour'' comes real close to
being a one-sitting page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Hour'' centers on a retired detective, dying of
cancer, teamed with a brash, ambitious homicide deputy to find a
vicious killer of women. It starts with a portrait of 67-year-old
Tim Hess, brought out of the routine of watching TV and undergoing
chemotherapy to investigate a murder _ a portrait that has you
plugging for Hess from the first paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to live to be 75, he tells himself _ is that too much
to ask? He's surprised at what he remembers, what he forgets, and
at all times he has the reader's sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, author of ``Where Serpents Lie'' and ``Little Saigon,''
isn't as kind to Merci Rayborn, the daughter of an Orange County,
Calif., sheriff's detective who draws Hess as her partner in a
search for a deranged killer. Initially tough, Rayborn becomes more
likable as the book picks up speed from page to page.
</P>
<P>
   Parker has you hooked by the second chapter, as Hess drives out
to the crime scene. After his study of some oak trees and the dirt
underneath them, leading to the grotesque image of victims being
gutted like deer, it becomes harder and harder to put down the
book.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are the key. In addition to sharp images of Hess
and Rayborn, Parker draws the murdered women in fine detail _ a
letter written by the first victim as she sits alone in her Newport
Beach home is especially strong. Parker's portrayal of the killer
is just as impressive, though somewhat cliched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Hour'' has some flaws, including its assumption that
a news station would devote 24 hours a day filming a building in
which a sex offender lives. Parker also insists on vivid, gruesome
violence committed by an increasingly insane murderer, as if he
feels a need to trump contemporary suspense writers such as James
Ellroy.
</P>
<P>
   Parker handles the chemotherapy scenes with a minimum of
mawkishness: ``They said he'd lose his appetite during the sessions
and he did. They also said his hair would probably fall out and it
hadn't. Hess felt a secret pride in this. The sessions were three
days in a row, one session per month, for four months if you could
take it. If it killed off too many blood cells you had to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable May-November romance is handled as well as can be
expected, and Parker's depiction of Hess sitting on a bench at the
end, talking to a stranger about the three lives he saved in his
career, is honestly moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Hour'' is Parker's best work, impressive enough to
read in one sitting. Almost.

MIRREN CAPTURES THE PASSIONS OF AYN RAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three famous writers, two cable movies, one bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   The direct hit is scored by Helen Mirren as the steely novelist
and philosopher Ayn Rand in ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' (showing
Sunday on the Showtime pay cable channel).
</P>
<P>
   Mirren's is one of four astonishing performances in the year's
best made-for-TV movie. Peter Fonda plays Rand's self-sacrificing
husband, Frank O'Connor. Eric Stoltz is Nathaniel Brandon, Rand's
intellectual heir and lover. Julie Delpy is Barbara Brandon,
Nathaniel's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The other movie? It's ``Dash and Lilly'' (Monday on A&AMP;E), a sour
effort directed by actress Kathy Bates and starring Sam Shepard and
Judy Davis as Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dash and Lilly'' is Hammett and Hellman from A to M _
alcoholism to McCarthyism, as it forlornly chronicles the 30-year
love affair between the famous crime novelist and the celebrated
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm not mistaken, the movie itself is 30 years long.
</P>
<P>
   Best to stick with ``The Passion of Ayn Rand,'' in which Mirren
plays a complex woman who's capable of losing her temper, but never
an argument. Not even when she avers that it's logical to have sex,
openly and on a regular schedule, with her closest friend's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, who died in 1982, was the author of ``The Fountainhead''
and ``Atlas Shrugged,'' and the founder of Objectivism, a
philosophy that binds egotism, logic and capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a book by Barbara Brandon, the movie lifts the curtain
that surrounds Rand, peeking at her inner circle and private life.
</P>
<P>
   The Brandons were college students who met Rand in 1951 and
built their own lives and marriage on an altar of admiration for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' is an unabashedly adult movie with
plenty of sexual sizzle. Mirren provides much of the pleasure as an
imperious woman whose brilliance only partially conceals her
contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair dyed dark and her voice drenched in the accent of
Rand's native Russia, Mirren finds in Rand an intimidator who can
be as tender as she is brusque _ sometimes. She's a romantic,
perhaps as only a Russian or a French woman could be; yet she
seemingly rules her tightly controlled roost with a constant
barrage of dispassionate reason.
</P>
<P>
   Rand is so strong that everyone else unavoidably becomes a
tragic figure. Stoltz is scorchingly corrupt as Nathaniel Brandon,
cast out after he cheats on Rand as well as his own wife.
</P>
<P>
   Delpy (``Before Sunrise''), successfully taming her French
accent, wins sympathy as a scorned woman who breaks down under the
tug-of-war between her intellectual and emotional lives. Fonda is
magnificent _ a quiet, long-suffering hero who knows he's too old
and too unemployable to take a stand against his famous wife.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Christopher Menaul (``Fatherland''), ``The Passion
of Ayn Rand'' benefits from a big-screen visual texture and a jazzy
score, by Jeff Beal, that fits the movie snugly.
</P>
<P>
   The movie wasn't necessarily made for small-screen release.
Showtime is approving deals that allow filmmakers to shop first for
a theatrical distributor. ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' apparently
didn't latch on with a distributor, and so it reverts to Showtime
for its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   When you see some of the brain-dead special-effects
extravaganzas that are getting plastered across theater screens,
you've got to shake your head slowly. Ah, well, it's television's
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dash and Lilly,'' sad to say, would fizzle on any screen.
</P>
<P>
   Give credit to Bates for trying to pin down substantive
characters in her directorial debut, but her film is an enervated
and sometimes overacted (by Davis) piece of business that never
rises above mundane. Jerry Ludwig's script, like so much about the
movie, is sort of OK but lacking in any exciting rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of it is that Hammett, creator of ``The Maltese
Falcon'' and ``The Thin Man,'' and the aspiring writer Hellman meet
in 1930 and then drink, smoke and torture each other for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's Bates' job to make us feel there's an overriding reason to
care about their famous love affair, as opposed to their literary
careers. She doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   And it's Davis' and Shepard's hope, presumably, to convey the
chemistry between the two writers. They don't. Shepard's drawling,
slow-moving style and Davis' red-eyed intensity don't seem a match
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Davis and Shepard, ``Dash and Lilly'' features David
Paymer as Hellman's first husband, Arthur Kober, and Bebe Neuwirth
as Dorothy Parker.
</P>
<P>
   None of the movie takes place in Hammett's creative home turf,
San Francisco, and Hammett's family in San Francisco is barely
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to promote the A&AMP;E movie with an event at John's Grill, a
repository of Hammett lore in downtown San Francisco, were called
off when it was learned that Hammett's daughter, Josephine,
disapproves of the film.

 &HT;    Savannah aflutter with gentry-filled `Delirium'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Savannah gets ready to celebrate the long awaited paperback
publication of ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' on July
6, another book about old families and buried secrets is creating a
buzz in the coastal city. ``Delirium of the Brave'' (Frederic C.
Beil, $24.95), a debut novel by Savannah podiatrist William C.
Harris Jr., has become a local best seller and set the city's
gentry speculating about some of the thinly disguised families in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   While John Berendt's Gothic tome focused on a contemporary crime
and a bevy of colorful characters, Harris' novel covers the period
from the end of the Civil War to World War II. The story begins
when a Confederate officer and his slave companion bury a chest of
family valuables on Raccoon Island. Both are killed before they can
reveal the hiding place. Harris then follows the fortunes of old
Savannah families through the post-Civil War years and the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Savannah is predicting ``Delirium'' will be as big as
``Midnight,'' but some Hollywood producers have shown an interest.
The publisher has sold out of four printings and won't have any
more books until June 21.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRUE GRIT: If Tom Franklin's stories seem gritty, maybe it's
because he worked in a grit plant before he became a writer. Not
the edible kind of grits, but grit used in sandblasting.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in a style that echoes the raw energy of Cormac
McCarthy, the Alabama native is making waves in the publishing
world. The title story in his debut collection, ``Poachers''
(Morrow, $22), won the Edgar Award for best short story and was
selected for inclusion in ``New Stories From the South 1999,''
``Best American Mystery Stories 1999'' and ``Best Mystery Stories
of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the stories in ``Poachers'' reflect a dark side of
the South populated with working-class types living close to the
edge. It is a world Franklin knows intimately. Born in Dickinson,
Ala., he barely survived a bad marriage and divorce and worked his
way through college with jobs in a hospital morgue and a chemical
plant.

   ``It wasn't until I went to graduate school that I began to
realize how strange my childhood was,'' Franklin says. ``Not just
living in the woods, but being raised in a religious environment
that was very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unusual'' may not be the right word. Franklin's parents formed
their own rural church in a tin building where the congregation
spoke in tongues, burned books and practiced faith healing.

   ``I'd tried religion and I'd tried hunting,'' Franklin says.
``Neither seemed to come naturally, so I went to writing.''

   The Miracle of Castel di Sangro
</P>
<P>
   by Joe McGinniss
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $25).
</P>
<P>
   When we think of McGinniss, we usually think of the determined
reporter who worked his way into the mind of a convicted killer in
``Fatal Vision'' (1983) and dissected the Kennedys in ``The Last
Brother: The Rise and Fall of Teddy Kennedy'' (1993). For his
latest book, though, this obsessed soccer fan moves to a small town
in Italy and devotes nearly a year to following the fortunes of the
village team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miracle of Castel di Sangro'' is a passionate _ and funny
_ portrait of a town gone berserk over a ragtag collection of
soccer players. Despite coming from a poor region, the team has
managed to move up to Serie B, the second-highest professional
league in Italy. For a town of 5,000 to field such a team is truly
a miracle. The question is, can they keep the dream alive against
stiff competition from Genoa, Venice and Padua?
</P>
<P>
   After moving into a seedy hotel that shuts down completely on
Wednesdays and never has heat until October, McGinniss chronicles
every heart-stopping victory and every heartbreaking loss. He makes
friends with the colorful players (one is designated the official
cheese smeller before every meal) even though he speaks very little
Italian. He has less success with the team's owner, Signor Rezza, a
Godfather figure who travels with bodyguards and lives in a remote
mountaintop estate. Rezza is a man used to getting what he wants,
even if it means bulldozing a mountain to improve his view, or
refusing to pay a star player who would guarantee a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The author, as usual, injects more of himself into the story
than is necessary. But his celebrity-size ego is overshadowed by
the personalities of the players and the dream that is ultimately
shattered by corruption. Even readers who have never seen a soccer
match will find McGinniss' story compelling.
</P>

   The Last Innocent Year: America in 1964,
</P>
<P>
   the Beginning of the Sixties by Jon Margolis
</P>
<P>
   (William Morrow, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Someone once said if you can remember the '60s, then you
probably weren't there. Most of us who are old enough, though,
certainly remember 1964. As Margolis notes in his excellent
cultural and historical flashback, it was indeed a watershed year:
Lyndon B. Johnson pushed civil rights legislation through Congress
and launched the war on poverty as he escalated the conflict in
Vietnam. Three civil rights workers died in the South's ``Freedom
Summer.'' The Beatles and the Rolling Stones landed in America and
revolutionized rock 'n' roll; Tom Hayden and his friends gathered
on college campuses to formulate their counterculture attack on the
establishment; and women who were content to stay at home while
their husbands worked felt the first stirrings of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963
and ending with LBJ's election the following November, Margolis, a
former reporter for the Chicago Tribune, uses short, insightful
vignettes to masterfully re-create the mood and substance of a
pivotal year. For those of us who were there, it is a wonderful
memory-jogging book. For the younger generation, it is an
entertaining history lesson _ sort of like ``Forrest Gump'' without
the soundtrack.

   Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United States by
Cindy Sondik Aron
</P>
<P>
   (Oxford University Press, $35).
</P>
<P>
   At most job interviews, the issue of how much vacation time the
company allows is second only to salary in terms of importance. It
wasn't always like this, as Aron reveals in her detailed, scholarly
study of leisure time. In the early 19th century, she writes, only
wealthy Americans traveled to resorts for health reasons. Southern
planters headed for the cooler climes of the North Carolina
mountains and Newport, R.I., or the healing waters of Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., or Hot Springs, Va. It was only by the 20th century,
with the rise of the middle class, that companies began to
routinely offer time off to their employees. Americans gladly took
the vacations, but they never truly felt comfortable being away
from work, the University of Virginia professor says. The old
Puritan guilt hung over them like a suffocating mist. Since Aron's
book covers only until 1940, it is not clear (although quite
doubtful) that such anxieties still exist. Although it has a
somewhat academic tone, ``Working at Play'' offers some fascinating
insights into American attitudes toward leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine Greer: Untamed Shrew by Christine Wallace (Faber &AMP;
Faber, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized biographies are written all the time, but rarely
does the subject refer to the author as a ``brain-dead hack.''
Despite Greer's objections, Australian journalist Wallace still
managed to find sources to talk freely about the author of 1970's
``The Female Eunuch.'' Slogging through this solidly researched but
tedious tome, one wonders why Greer fought its publication _ other
than the fact that it would compete with her new book, ``The Whole
Woman'' (Knopf, $25).
</P>
<P>
   There are few revelations in Wallace's book that Greer has not
already disclosed. Wallace details Greer's childhood as the
daughter of an abusive mother and a weak father, her rape in
college and her later denials that her mother beat her. She traces
Greer's academic career (her doctoral thesis at Cambridge dealt
with ``The Taming of the Shrew'') and her foray into the feminist
movement with ``The Female Eunuch,'' a book that called for women
to embrace sex rather than sisterhood. The portrait that emerges is
that of a complicated, untamed woman who is still struggling to
reconcile her views on the war between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Friedan: Her Life by Judith Hennessee
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   The best biographies deal with the mind of the subject and the
ideas that made that particular person unique. The worst are
laundry lists of dates, details and accomplishments cobbled
together without form or reason. Hennessee's biography of Friedan
falls somewhere in the middle. Hennessee, a free-lance journalist,
chronicles Friedan's career from her years as a labor union
activist through the writing of ``The Feminine Mystique'' in 1963
and the founding of the National Organization for Women in 1966. In
her groundbreaking book, Friedan dealt with her own frustrations as
an educated woman relegated to the role of housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessee finds that the woman behind the activist is a bundle
of contradictions. She was a feminist who didn't like most women, a
champion of equal rights who hired a black maid to serve
refreshments at a gathering of female organizers and an advocate of
the family whose marriage ended in divorce. Friedan's main
strength, Hennessee says, is her ability to focus on a goal and
ignore any barriers in her path. In an anecdote that is a metaphor
for Friedan's life, the author describes how Friedan would swim
across a channel at Sag Harbor, N.Y., through a narrow inlet that
was well-traveled by boats. ``She always swam straight across and
back,'' Hennessee writes, ``never dipping her head, never watching
for the boats, because Betty thought the boats should look out for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming of Columbus: A Boyhood in the Bronx by Michael Pearson
(Syracuse University
</P>
<P>
   Press, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs are all the rage now, primarily due to the success of
books such as Mary Karr's ``The Liars' Club'' and Frank McCourt's
``Angela's Ashes.'' But usually, unless someone has led a
compelling life, nostalgic memories are meaningful only to the
writer, his family and his friends. Michael Pearson, director of
the creative writing program at Old Dominion University, makes up
for the lack of drama in his Catholic-school childhood in the Bronx
with stylish prose and vivid descriptions of people and places.
Growing up with an abusive and mostly absent father, Pearson drew
his strength to survive from his mother. While his father read
about the latest murder on Mott Street, his mother read
Dostoyevsky. ``She believed that stories could change a person's
life, so she paid attention to people and their stories. In a house
and in a culture that seemed aware of only newsprint, she loved
books.''
</P>
<P>
   That love helped propel Pearson, like his hero Columbus, into a
new world. Years later, when Pearson returned to the old
neighborhood with his wife and children, he learns, as Thomas Wolfe
did, that you can't go home again. Or can you? Home, Pearson
decides, ``is a thing that moves and shifts. It is memory and
experience and desire. It is place and no place. It is crowded with
faces and filled with voices, and it is as mute as a dream.''

 &HT;    Nation writer Christopher Hitchens finds an audience with
Clinton haters
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We arrived under cover of darkness and a light patter of rain.
Christopher Hitchens got out of the Toyota Camry, surveyed the
suburban expanse around him and said, ``Good heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the hotel bar downtown, he had fortified himself
with a belt of Scotch. If he was wondering whether the dosage had
been sufficient, that would be remedied presently.
</P>
<P>
   The British are intrepid travelers, famous for roughing it in
far places and cabling home riveting dispatches while rifle shots
echo in the distance. But Hitchens had been posted to Dunwoody, a
destination he would later tell his publicist, Nils Hooper, was
``the sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been some curiosity about the place even before
Hitchens arrived. He was to read from his new book, ``No One Left
to Lie to: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton''
(Verso, $19), at Borders Books &AMP; Music in the Perimeter Village
shopping center, and no one in New York or Washington _ where
Hitchens lives and works _ quite knew where or what Dunwoody was.
By some misunderstanding, Verso had thought Hitchens was being
booked for the better-known Borders on Peachtree Road, but, alas, a
book club was gathering there that night and so here was Hitchens _
ex-friend of Clinton loyalist Sidney Blumenthal, unapologetically
leftist writer for The Nation and Vanity Fair, scourge of a
president he calls a crook, a war criminal and a rapist _ in
precincts where the Republican Revolution of 1994 lives on as an
incandescent memory of national honor.
</P>
<P>
   But first some more Scotch.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Hitchens entered the store than a hostess thrust
into his paw a pint of Johnny Walker Black, wrapped in a ribbon and
accompanied by a card signed by fans. The thirsty Hitchens was
grateful. The hostess asked what he preferred with his Scotch, and
Hitchens said soda. It may be the suburbs, but ``you have to like a
place that invites an alcoholic and a chain smoker,'' Hitchens told
me. The rush-hour drive to Dunwoody was beginning to seem worth it.
</P>
<P>
   A quick smoke outside in the rain and Hitchens was ready to get
started, a vase of irises on the table before him and his tumbler
standing by. Fans sat on folding chairs like congregants, about two
dozen. (Later, checking in with his wife on the car phone, he
reported that they were ``fanatic but there weren't enough of
them''). None was more devout than a woman with frosted hair and
toenails painted tomato red. She had the habit of nodding in
smiling assent at every word, sometimes anticipating the word even
before it left Hitchens' lips, others times corroborating Hitchens'
confident judgments with her own. ``That's right, that's right,''
she'd say, and then look with wide blue eyes at a man alongside her
as if to ensure the point hadn't eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   You could understand the fascination _ some of it anyway. He may
not have been completely sober, but he was plainly brilliant. And,
of course, he hates Bill Clinton, and that was the glue that bound
this unlikely assemblage together _ an Oxford-educated literary
man, an acolyte earnestly recommending to Hitchens' audience
Plato's ``Republic,'' a middle-aged, self-confessed conservative
trying to make common cause and, frankly, a handful of nitwits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cult out there,'' Hitchens said afterward, hungry
for ribs but having to settle for a Reuben sandwich, more Johnny
Walker Black and two glasses of Merlot at a sports bar. Even there
he did not go unrecognized. While the televisions blared from all
directions, two young patrons spotted him on their way to the men's
room and wanted to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   He would not seem, at first glance, a recognizable figure. If he
is 6 feet tall, it's only with his shoes on, and he has the
moderate paunch of many 50-year-old men. His fingers and feet seem
too small for the rest of his body, and his brown hair flops over
his ears and collar without apparent effort to do much with it. His
eyes are an ordinary blue-gray, although on this particular night
they were becoming bloodshot from travel and fatigue. It's a face
with no particular definition. Only when he speaks would you
notice. Words spill out effortlessly, the familiar word used in an
interesting way, the unfamiliar word used with an exacting
precision. He calls himself glib, as if to deflect attention. But
there is no deflecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, appearing on C-SPAN's ``Booknotes'' with Brian
Lamb, Hitchens said his writing had always been fueled by contempt
for fools and wrongdoers. ``For a lot of people,'' he said, ``their
first love is what they'll always remember. For me it's always been
the first hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The same animus, he told his audience at Borders, went into the
writing of ``No One Left to Lie to.'' ``I wrote the book for two
reasons,'' he said. ``One was to revive the idea of the pamphlet as
a literary form, and the other was to whip up hatred and
contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter were securely in place when he arrived. If he also
rekindled in some of those bourgeois minds a desire to become
reacquainted with Addison and Steele, William Hazlitt, Thomas Paine
and George Orwell, then the evening was an unqualified success. But
one wondered if Hitchens' first aim really resonated with this
audience _ whether, for example, they might have relished the same
verbal dexterity had its target not been Bill Clinton but the
smaller figure of Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   For these listeners, there was no incongruity, no irony in
rumpling the bedsheets with a man of the Left. And a leftist, for
that matter, who assails Clinton for his ``personal crookery'' on
one hand and his ``cowardice and conservatism'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant writer,'' one woman said, and no one would
deny that. Since moving to the United States in 1980, Hitchens has
been singularly admired by other journalists for his easy
erudition, lacerating wit and unflinching willingness to say it
outright. He's a virtuoso, able to move from mention of Montesquieu
in one paragraph to Bill Clinton's ``rust-free zipper'' in the
next. Of Clinton's relationship with Kathleen Willey, he writes in
his book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Willey, some may recall, had been an admirer of President
Clinton, had been the wife of a Democratic fund-raiser, had been a
volunteer worker at the White House, had suddenly become a widow,
had gone in distress to the Oval Office for comfort and for a
discussion about the possibility of a paying job, and had been
rewarded with a crushing embrace, some cliched words of bar-room
courtship, and the guiding by the presidential mitt of her own hand
onto his distended penis.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not been his prose that has lost him so many friends.
Rather, it was his willingness to sell out a one-time friend,
Blumenthal, in print and then with an affidavit. It was Blumenthal,
Hitchens both wrote and testified, who told him that Monica
Lewinsky had been stalking the defenseless president in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens thought this a craven ploy to disgrace Lewinsky and
exonerate the president. Moreover, he now had become ``hostage to a
piece of information,'' and his conscience did not permit him the
luxury of silence. ``I did not move to Washington in order to keep
quiet,'' he writes, ``and, as a matter of fact, nobody has yet
asked me to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is on the outs with almost everyone he once was friendly
with. ``The consequences in my own life,'' he writes, ``have made a
literal truth out of what I had once written only metaphorically:
Clintonism poisons everything it touches.''
</P>
<P>
   And here he was, in Dunwoody, looking a bit dissipated but at
least among friends. One had driven all the way from Kennesaw, and
she wore an American flag as a lapel pin. Tomato Toes was in
rapture the whole time. Later, asked if she were Republican, she
looked almost ashen with shock. And then she said: ``Of course. Any
thinking person has to be Republican _ not the present Republican
Party but the party as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She meant, she said, the Republican Party that rebuilt the
military, and now her face was glowing again.
</P>
<P>
   As she was saying this, Hitchens was busily signing books and
chatting with his new friends. He had betrayed everyone else, and
this was what he was left with.

WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG, WE ASK IF THERE'S SOMEONE WE CAN SUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The tendency to overreact to an accident or some
other tragedy is as American as talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as a story breaks, the collective reflex is: Who's fault
is it? Is there someone we can sue? And, how many laws can we pass
to make sure this will never, ever happen again?
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, our knee-jerk tradition produces useful reform.
</P>
<P>
   Often, it produces a lot of headlines and political posturing
and kicks up of a ton of dust that blinds us to reality and our own
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   So seems the case locally with the death of Julie Day, a
24-year-old administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Day got into a taxicab after a night of drinking with friends in
one of San Francisco's popular watering holes. She ended up dead in
a shallow grave in a neighborhood here called China Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Although police say an autopsy may yet show that Day's death was
accidental, the driver of the cab, Jehad Baqleh, has been charged
with rape, robbery and murder. The district attorney says he will
seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following Baqleh's arrest late last week, city cab
drivers reported that they were being yelled at and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic and print media interviewed dozens of women who said
they now felt uneasy about ever taking a cab again. Business at the
company that employs Baqleh was down by two thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Supervisor Leslie Katz made the hyper-reaction official
by proposing that the city look into installing 911 alarm buttons
and surveillance cameras in every licensed cab.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said she did not want her proposal to be interpreted as
``an overreaction to a very obscure, yet horrific incident,'' but
she reasoned: ``This tragic incident highlights the need for added
protection, but it is something that should have been a long time
coming. We want to ensure the safety of residents, city workers and
tourists. We want people to feel safe in taking taxis.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Julie Day's awful death, did scores of residents, city
workers and tourists equate hailing a taxi with crossing a six-lane
freeway on foot at rush-hour? Based on such a dramatic and
expensive proposal (and the logic behind it), one could only assume
that San Francisco has a chronic and dangerous cab crisis on its
hands.
</P>
<P>
   If it hasn't, then the reflexive public negativity and Katz's
proposal are precisely an overreaction to a very obscure incident.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gavin Newsom, who has operated as a go-between for
the board and the taxicab industry, has taken a thoughtful
approach. He's asked the police department for a statistical
snapshot of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   How many cabbies, he wants to know, have been convicted of
felonies and violent crimes? How many have been accused?
</P>
<P>
   The cops say a preliminary survey of the numbers indicates that
only about five to 10 allegations of assaults by drivers on
passengers are logged each year. Meanwhile, we know for certain
that six cabbies have been killed on the job in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Before the people of this supposedly sophisticated city condemn
5,000 cab drivers and their industry _ or before we go to the
trouble and expense of outfitting every taxi with security systems
worthy of Fort Knox _ wouldn't it be nice to know just how big of a
problem we really have?
</P>
<P>
   It may be the American way to want to do something in the wake
of any tragedy or to craft sweeping legislation from the aberrent;
that doesn't make it wise.

<P>
   PHOENIX - Corey Thomas O'Neil, then 18, died quietly in a
hospital bed on Aug. 21, 1994. But his mother was so sad, the loss
she felt was so severe, he only stayed away a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son came back to me,'' Pat O'Neil says, ``and through a
series of miracles, he's never left.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for Corey's mother to speak about the days and
weeks her son was gone.
</P>
<P>
   That was the summer after he'd graduated from Trevor Browne High
School in west Phoenix. Corey spoke then of becoming an architect
or a draftsman. He was young and strong and as close to invincible
as a person gets, which is not close enough.
</P>
<P>
   After a family gathering that summer, a friend of Corey's came
to pick him up on a motorcycle. The two of them drove off into the
night, happy and untroubled. Not far away a car pulled out in front
of them and the motorcycle driver lost control. Neither young man
was wearing a helmet. Corey's friend survived. Within a few days,
doctors told Pat and her husband, Jay, that Corey was brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to have him disconnected from the life-support
systems that kept him breathing and, if he passed away, to donate
his organs.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened on Aug. 21. &QL; 
SEARCH FOR CHANGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The days after Corey's death are a blur to his family, like
sitting in front of a television set but not really watching,
having no idea what the actors just said or what the story is
about.
</P>
<P>
   As fall turned to winter, and signs of Christmas began appearing
in all the stores, the dark days of August became even more
difficult for Corey's parents and his sister, Amy.
</P>
<P>
   Pat, who was searching for a way to take her mind off the loss,
got a job in the salon of a local department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first miracle,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Lois Cousten walked in one day. Some of the other
women got excited when they saw Lois, asking how she was doing and
if she was healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   She was, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She'd had a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   It was Corey's.
</P>
<P>
   They knew for sure after Lois described the thank you letter
she'd written anonymously to the donor family, the one in which she
described the healthy heart beating in her chest as ``Sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the chances are of a transplant recipient
like me running into someone from a donor family,'' Lois says,
``but in a city this large it has to be astronomical. That had to
be God's idea.'' &QL; 
LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pat sees it that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   She figures Corey asked the Big Fella if it would be OK to have
Lois run into Pat, and he went along with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a scary thing to meet the person who received your
son's heart,'' Pat says. ``I can see why that is kept anonymous.
But, in our case, it worked out beautifully. Lois and I hit it off
right away. She's a good, good person. It made me feel like Corey
was really with her, in all ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The transplant wasn't without some complications for Lois. She
had a few setbacks early on, and was told she had to cut back on
her physical activity. This wasn't easy for a woman who'd spent
part of her life as a paramedic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know what to do with myself,'' she says.
``And, if you'd have asked me back then, just about the last thing
I'd have come up with was studying for the ministry. But, somehow,
that's what happened. Of course it had something to do with the
heart, with being given this second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois stayed in touch with Pat's family, studied the Bible and
eventually became a minister. Not long after that, Pat's daughter
Amy asked Lois if she would officiate at her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Pat says, ``Corey was there. Through Lois, he was
there for his sister. Becoming friends with Lois has done that for
us. It's made it easier to accept what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows now, with absolute certainty, that where ever her son
may be, his heart is in the right place. &QL;

LAWMAKER DROPS BILL AFFECTING CHARTER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A bill that set up a showdown between charter
school supporters and state teachers' unions has been killed as
California lawmakers seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Democrat from San Francisco, said
Wednesday she had agreed to withdraw her proposed legislation to
require charter school teachers to become members of the union in
their district.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she is offering a watered-down bill that would merely
allow charter school teachers to take their complaints to a state
labor board.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's original bill caused an outcry among charter school
proponents, including Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, who said it was
not aimed at helping charter school teachers, but at increasing the
power of the California Teachers Association, the state's largest
union representing teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Charter school supporters also said Migden's bill would hinder
the schools' flexibility to have longer school days and years and
to hire and fire teachers based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   The unions argued that the bill was the only way to guarantee
that charter schools pay teachers a minimum salary and protect
employees' rights in disciplinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's decision to table her bill was a significant retreat by
the strongly pro-labor lawmaker and chairwoman of the
Appropriations Committee. But after sensing strong opposition in
the Democrat-controlled state Senate, she realized the bill would
never become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crafting legislation is an art of compromise,'' Migden said
Wednesday. ``We believe the bill will garner more support in its
present form. I myself could have stomached a stronger bill, but I
am not a solitary voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted that her new bill would still provide a measure
of protection for teachers at charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new bill, AB631, charter school teachers with labor
grievances could go before the Public Employment Relations Board.
Without the bill, charter school teachers with complaints would
have to take their employer to court, Migden said.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's sudden shift surprised charter school advocates, who
were studying the details of the new legislation late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who heard about Migden's decision while attending a
conference in Las Vegas, was suspicious of the new bill.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor suggested that the Public Employment
Relations Board could force restrictions on charter schools that
strike at their very reason for existing: to be free of government
mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true objective (of the new bill) is to force charter
school teachers into the collective bargaining agreement of another
institution _ the school district,'' Brown said. ``The whole reason
for charter schools is to create separate, flexible and innovative
learning environments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly could consider the bill as soon as next week.

NOT UNLOVABLE: SWEET ROMANTIC COMEDY PAIRS GOOD-NATURED ROBERTS,
GRANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' is a meeting of the archetypes. Even though
it's supposed to be about a man (Hugh Grant) falling for a woman
above his station, a movie star (Julia Roberts) _ like a fable in
which a mortal tumbles helplessly into love with a goddess and then
learns how dangerous such an act can be _ Grant plays it like a
movie star. A very mannered movie star, perhaps, but anyone who's
seen him in ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' or any of the other
comedies, won't be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Notting Hill'' is like a fight for a big title; in this
case, the honor goes to the person with the biggest, boldest
persona, the contestants being an American and a Brit.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts steps into the ring ready for battle. She plays Anna
Scott, who's trying to play it on the down-low while making a movie
in London. She wanders into the failing travel store that William
(Grant) runs in the now-trendy Notting Hill section of London.
William is wed to his store; his marriage fell apart years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Opening ``Notting Hill'' as competition for ``The Phantom
Menace'' is a very smart piece of counter-programming. This
meticulously beveled and sanded romantic comedy has a glorious
conceit, because although it plays on a common fantasy _ what would
it be like to romance a movie star, and would such a person be
interested in a normal person _ the fact is that Grant has arrived
as a star already. There's nothing ordinary about him, really. In
fact, he seems to match up with Roberts because his wrists are as
skinny as hers. Together, they're a pair of slender, striking,
concave-of-cheek androgynes _ a match made in Vogue. They belong
together.
</P>
<P>
   The movie itself is about the inevitable genteel superiority of
the English that has become a staple, thanks to the films of
Merchant Ivory. (In fact, it's a film full of conceits; if a
bookstore devoted to travel would do well anywhere in London, it
would thrive in yuppie-ridden Notting Hill.)
</P>
<P>
   William's witty, askew group of friends _ who fall in love with
the ideal that Anna presents _ have the merciless, self-deprecating
breeziness that ``Four Weddings'' resuscitated, a cliche that many
of us thought had passed from view. The most vivid of William's
group is his ratty Welsh lunk of a roommate (Rhys Ifans) who, in a
key moment, gets to show exactly how cheeky he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' is a more enjoyable trifle than ``Four
Weddings'' because it's better-looking. The difference between the
two films is almost like the evolution of Notting Hill itself from
chic slum to full-blown moneyed enclave. And it plays with
perception vs. reality. When William is summoned to see Anna, it
turns out that he's been invited to a junket _ a situation where a
slew of journalists are given brief interviews with stars promoting
a new movie: like when you see a local TV entertainment reporter
sitting in the same room with _ oh, let's say Julia Roberts _ and
sucking up to her.
</P>
<P>
   Anna turns out to have a streak of bratty temper; she's not
always the likable, backlit dream-come-true. ``Notting Hill'' also
has a lovely idea, a twist on the moment when a lover has dumped
you and you seem to see her face everywhere. In this case, it's
ridiculously true: William sees her soulful, sultry face gazing
back at him from the sides of buses and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' is a confident confection, the kind of movie
that people from Notting Hills around the world will fall in love
with. And in case you're wondering who wins the title match for the
most lovably mannered, well ... when Julia Roberts turns on that
smile, and a tear reddens her big, brown eyes, let's just say that
America is still the champ _ though the fight goes right up to the
final bell.

THE CASE FOR _ AND AGAINST _ `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, there was much wringing of hands and gnashing of
teeth when Steven Spielberg's WWII epic ``Saving Private Ryan''
didn't walk home with a Best Picture Oscar earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the film's well-deserved statues in five categories,
including Best Director, the coveted Picture award was considered
by most critics to be a lock. I'm of two minds on the subject,
disappointed in some ways but ultimately happy with the way things
played out.
</P>
<P>
   My argument why it should have won:
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's portrayal of the D-Day invasion of Normandy is the
most horrifically wrenching depiction of war ever captured on film.
This isn't your father's war movie. These aren't a bunch of
anthem-singing GI Joe's picking off Nazis, then kicking back for a
communal drag on a Lucky Strike. These are terrified kids watching
their buddies ripped to pieces in a hail of bullets and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The film is packed with unforgettable moments that will sear
themselves into your memory. The scene with a Nazi soldier slowly
sliding a knife blade into the chest of the struggling Adam
Goldberg while whispering into his tear-streaked face is one of the
most haunting film images ever.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's top-notch cast including Tom Hanks (in a
delightfully nonshowy performance), Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi,
Jeremy Davies and Matt Damon, couldn't have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's my argument why it shouldn't have won:
</P>
<P>
   Like Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning ``Platoon'' or even
Spielberg's own ``Schindler's List,'' these images, however
powerful, are not the kinds of things you want to relive. ``Ryan''
is a film you see once, are tremendously moved by, and then plan
never to experience again. This year's Best Picture, ``Shakespeare
in Love,'' is something that gets better with every viewing. Does
that make it a better movie? No. But it's certainly a more
watchable one. And that's worth something.
</P>
<P>
   For those who missed ``Ryan'' in theaters, by all means, rent
the video. It holds up well on the small screen, especially if you
have a good sound system. Watch it with your children when they're
old enough.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I'm still trying to shake the sight of Goldberg's
dead stare.

`THIRTEENTH FLOOR' IS THE SAME OLD STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Question reality,'' urge the ads for ``The Thirteenth Floor,''
and you have to fight the temptation to respond, ``Again?'' People
in this movie talk about deja vu a lot, and deja vu is what its
virtual-reality story inspires after a season of similarly themed
films. A reviewer has to remember, though, that not everyone has
seen ``The Matrix'' _ much less the smaller-budgeted ``eXistenZ''
or ``Open Your Eyes'' _ and try to judge ``Floor'' on its own
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, on its own terms, ``Floor'' is merely an OK
time-killer, hurt by rote direction and a story arc so familiar
that the movie's surprises aren't very surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Daniel Galouye's novel ``Simulacron 3'' (a much more
intriguing title), ``Floor'' feels held back by its literary
origins. It's less a science-fiction thriller than an old-fashioned
whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery begins in 1937, as sad-eyed old man Hannon Fuller
(Armin Mueller-Stahl) drops some bills on the dresser while his
younger lover lies sleeping, then tells a surly bartender (Vincent
D'Onofrio) to deliver a letter to a guy named Douglas Hall. Fuller
goes home, lies in bed with his wife, and the next thing you know,
he's going through a tunnel of squiggly blue lines and he wakes up
in the present. Turns out he's jacked in to a virtual-reality
device that he helped create, and that even in the present, he has
a message for Douglas Hall, who happens to be Fuller's assistant.
Too bad someone fatally stabs Fuller before he can deliver the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Hall (Craig Bierko, whose reality apparently doesn't include
razors that shave very closely) becomes a suspect in the slaying;
he even suspects himself, since he had a strange memory lapse
around the time Fuller was killed. So he decides to investigate,
hopping between the present and the alternate reality. Naturally,
all is not what it seems.
</P>
<P>
   You can see what drew the people involved in ``The Thirteenth
Floor'' to the material. It's no wonder that filmmakers are so
fascinated with alternate realities, because in a sense movies
``are'' alternate realities _ imagine making entertainment so
convincing that the audience lives it (anyone who's seen the
obsessive fans in ``Trekkies'' or the people who camped out for
``Phantom Menace'' tickets knows that this has already happened).
And the principal cast gets a chance to stretch its acting chops,
each playing dual roles in the parallel universes. Their
performances are so muted, though _ the always interesting
D'Onofrio is particularly wasted here _ that you have to wonder how
they reacted to the end result.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws in ``The Thirteenth Floor'' fall squarely on the
shoulders of director Josef Rusnak, who handles the film in the
most journeyman way. Movies like this need a sense of panache or
mood, and Rusnak can't even provide a strong period atmosphere for
the 1930s scenes. Curiously, the scenes in the present have more of
a retro feel, thanks to a weird bluish tint, Bierko's noirish
detachment, and the appearances of Dennis Haybert as a dogged,
hat-wearing detective and Gretchen Mol as a Chandleresque ``femme
fatale.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're at all interested in ``The Thirteenth Floor's''
themes, it should be the fourth movie on your to-see list. It
should come after the razzle-dazzle of ``The Matrix,'' with its
lofty attempts at myth-making; after David Cronenberg's
``eXistenZ,'' with its mixing of existential philosophy and
celebrity culture; and after the Spanish ``Open Your Eyes''
(opening this week in Fort Worth), with its deep sense of sadness
and its commentaries on vanity and shallowness. All these movies
are flawed, and in a way, they're less successful than ``Floor.''
But they're only less successful because they try to do much more,
and that makes them much more intriguing.

S.F. NEIGHBORHOOD BEING SQUEEZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Mission District here is being squeezed, and
squeezed hard.
</P>
<P>
   Families are being crushed between low-lifes and those who live
the high life.
</P>
<P>
   This most vital of working class neighborhoods, the heart of San
Francisco's Latino culture, is being overrun with prostitution and
drugs, bringing with them crime and degradation of all
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the neighborhood is being gentrified by
hipsters and programmers, bringing with them coffeehouses, trendy
restaurants and sky-high rents.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hear complaints and cries for help, all you have
to do is go to one of the monthly community meetings at the Mission
police station.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Tuesday night started with Gina Lynn Luna, one of
the regular cast of characters, having to yell, ``Quiet!''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing on the agenda was discussion of a proposed
ordinance to seize the cars of those who solicit drugs or hookers.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, there was an uproar about possible abuse of police
power.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Greg Suhr, who leads these meetings, used his
considerable powers of personality and humor to keep the debate on
track. He knew everyone, even the anti-cop dissidents, and called
them by their first names.
</P>
<P>
   Only in San Francisco could you have a ruckus on a first- name
basis.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow said he works with prostitutes and he was afraid he
would have his car seized. He complained that the computer of
someone he knew had been seized by police and it was never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Suhr waved a copy of an anonymous broadsheet headed ``Mission
Yuppie Eradication Project'' at the man. The flier targeted a
half-dozen upscale bars and coffeehouses as ``soon to be
picturesque rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the guy whose computer was seized had something to do
with the broadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people know who you are,'' Suhr said. ``This isn't right.
This is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just for openers.
</P>
<P>
   Later Suhr was asked what this Yuppie Eradication Project is.
</P>
<P>
   He said its alleged leader had claimed it was a group of ``about
three, which leads me to believe it's a group of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Let it be said, though, that it's hardly the biggest threat
facing the Mission. Just for starters, consider the recent invasion
of hookers from the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   According to Suhr, the prostitutes and their pimps and johns
have swamped Capp and Shotwell streets because of vehicle-seizure
laws on the other side of the bridge. Suhr said he'd just like to
``level the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, the cops have arrested dozens of hookers and
johns (and one pimp), but it doesn't stop the flood of
prostitution. ``It's like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic,''
said Suhr.
</P>
<P>
   At these community meetings, which take place at most of the
district stations, various officials speak on various topics and
residents grill them _ more thoroughly than a team of investigative
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bevan Dufty of the mayor's Office of Community Services, brought
the residents a high-powered lineup of officials to rake over the
coals.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Grove, local head of state parole, and Armando Cervantes,
head of county probation, were asked if they were dumping clients
in the Mission. They said a quarter of their clients end up there,
but mainly because there are many residential hotels.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make anybody feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Gallagher, director of planning, talked about new
limitations on the Mission's upscale-loft infestation. Someone
asked how long the limitations will last. She said they'd be
reviewed in 18 months. It's good to know.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dave Faingold talked about his new assignment trying to
control crime in the shooting gallery of the 16th Street corridor.
He said he was shocked at the amount of heroin use by all types of
people _ and he came from the narcotics division.
</P>
<P>
   No residents put him on the griddle. He was new at an important
job. He also was very big.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy of the city attorney's office outlined the proposed
vehicle-seizure ordinance. He said the city would use civil
proceedings to take cars from those accused of soliciting drugs or
prostitutes _ even if they're acquitted in criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said, ``The fact that I can be acquitted in court, and
you still have access to my property, that sends a very frightening
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Suhr assured her that seizures would be done with discretion.
</P>
<P>
   She said that was putting a lot of trust in the police, and in a
Latino neighborhood that hasn't always trusted the authorities.
Then a grandmother who lives on Capp Street started talking about
her loss of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they have to come here from the East Bay to my
neighborhood?'' she said of the prostitutes, pimps and johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to hear these conversations outside my window at four
in the morning, and not one word of them would be allowed to be
spoken in my house,'' she said. ``I have a young grandson, and you
wouldn't believe the anatomy he has seen in car windows in front of
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   I understood why people would support vehicle seizure, even if I
didn't like it. Their neighborhood had been seized.
</P>
<P>
   As I left the meeting, an attractive woman with a lot of makeup
in an old Camaro asked how to get back to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   I told her there were a bunch of people inside who would tell
her where to go.

AN ON-LINE LOUVRE OF THE ART OF WEB DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where do you go when you're suffering brain cramps? You could
stare at a wall, but you feel like you need something a little bit
more, well, artistic. The Museum of Web Art is the perfect
antidote, an on-line gallery that is the visual equivalent of
ambient music. Its displays are easy on the eyeballs yet
entertaining. There's even an exhibition of wallpaper. Yes,
wallpaper. Not the stuff you hang in parlors, but the stuff that
decorates your computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of a California graphic artist named Amy Stone,
the museum (http://www.mowa.org) is a showcase for Web design
elements, used mainly in commercial art. The wallpaper gallery
features stripes, swirls, and slithery snakes. Another gallery,
devoted to things that work, features different designs for
click-on buttons; another section features page counters.
</P>
<P>
   Strange stuff for a museum, that. But Stone, and her partner
Mark Kaproff, set out to create a site that is both utilitarian and
artistic. ``I got on line about two years ago, and as a designer, I
was looking to find good examples of Web elements,'' Stone says.
``I had to surf constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   She started to collect examples and launched the museum in
January. Originally, the ``collection'' featured graphic design
works, but now some of the exhibitions straddle the line between
fine and commercial art. In ``Millennium Diary,'' for instance, one
artist designs a new page for each day of the year leading up to
2000; poetry and multimedia images mark the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed to emulate a physical museum, with arrows
pointing to a visitors' center, various galleries, and the main
entrance. It's quirky, yet fascinating. Web art is an emerging
form, and nobody has really defined it beyond saying that it can
exist only in cyberspace. But like Stone, other designers are
looking for resources; the site showcases work by more than 50
artists and receives about a million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a friendly collection of things that can be
useful, whether that be the design or the technology that drives
it,'' Stone says. ``Whenever there's a new technology, you're going
to have more things that are mediocre than excellent. That's why
you have to have institutions that call attention to what is
excellent.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   An eye for an eye? Is it a publicity stunt or a political
statement? Last week, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore (``Roger
and Me'') set up a Web cam outside literary agent Lucianne
Goldberg's New York apartment. Goldberg set off the scandal we're
all trying to forget by urging Linda Tripp to tape a certain former
White House intern. ``Lucianne, it seems, does not respect the
privacy rights of others,'' Moore writes on the site,
www.iseelucy.com. ``She believes in keeping an eye on persons who
are a threat to the country. So do we.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no state secrets revealed: All you learn is that
Goldberg keeps the place cool in the summer and that she's staging
a low-tech retaliation by hawking the National Enquirer in her
windows. ``It's an unfunny stunt,'' says Goldberg, who claims she
is selling ad space in her windows for $2,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has said that he set up the camera to make a statement
about the invasion of privacy _ and to promote his television show,
``The Awful Truth,'' which debuted last month on Bravo. Moore's
leftist ``guerrilla video'' style was effective when he was taking
on General Motors, but here the line blurs between plain old
publicity and in-your-face politics. No doubt, this will happen
again; campaign 2000 is not far away.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   There used to be a guy in this office who referred to himself as
``The Encyclopedia of Useless Information.'' With minimal
prompting, he could tell you how to harvest echinacea or give an
impromptu lesson in the physics of flight. Alas, our human resource
is now pursuing a doctorate in something useful, so we're stuck
when we need answers to such pressing questions as ``Why is a
rabbit lucky?'' But now we've found the answer on line at an
entirely useless site, www.uselessknowledge.com.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in November by Web designer Joe Edelman, the site
offers a wealth of information that could come in handy when you're
caught in awkward situations. For instance, if you're ever stuck in
an elevator, you can break the tension by informing your fellow
riders, ``Most lipstick contains fish scales.'' We found that one
in the random factoid section; the site also includes a database of
useless quotations, vocabulary words, and inexplicable phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, who lives near Philadelphia, says he is a trivia nut
whose son once called him a ``Master of Useless Knowledge.''
Apparently, he's not alone. The site gets 240,000 user sessions a
month, and its newsletter has a subscription base of 34,000, says
Edelman, who also seems to be a master of statistics. With its
5,000 factoids and 2,000 quotations, the site offers a great way to
justify time spent doing something totally useless.

_ADVICE ON HEART ATTACKS: EXPERIENCE DOES COUNT  
 _AMA OFFERS OLIVE BRANCH TO ITS NEXT JOURNAL EDITOR
 &HT;    _FURTHER NOTES: DIABETES, AND A CAUTION ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Advice on heart attacks: Experience does count
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At risk for a heart attack? Here's what a study says: Find out
which hospital in your area treats the most heart attack patients,
and get there at the first sign of chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported to be the first of its kind, has found that
hospitals with the most experience gave elders a 17 percent better
chance of surviving heart attacks for a month than hospitals with
the least experience.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen percent translates to 2.3 fewer cardiac deaths for
every 100 heart attack patients _ a benefit that exceeds the rule
of thumb used to determine if a new drug or surgical procedure is
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice makes perfect,'' said Dr. David R. Thiemann of Johns
Hopkins University, who led the study of nearly 100,000 Medicare
heart attack victims. It is published in the current New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann added that the health care system ``isn't designed to
deal with'' heart attacks in the most effective way. ``Heart attack
patients, in most cases, are taken to the nearest hospital, and not
much regard is given to whether it's a low-volume or high-volume
hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of high-volume hospitals has nothing to do with
whether they are teaching hospitals or can do open-heart surgery or
angioplasty. The finding ``raises questions about the benefit of
the proliferation of technology at smaller hospitals,'' Thiemann
and his colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that one-third of the survival difference
at high-volume hospitals was related to more use of aspirin and
other drugs, such as clot-busters. But mostly it was attributed to
``an experienced health care team.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that ``in some sense we don't take heart attacks
seriously,'' Thiemann said. ``There's a sort of
take-your-anti-clotting-medicine-and-call-me-in-the-morning
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; AMA offers olive branch to its next Journal editor
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To heal the wounded reputation of the Journal of the American
Medical Association, the AMA said Wednesday that it would set up a
committee to ``buffer'' the journal's next editor against
organizational politics.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is the latest development in a brouhaha
precipitated in January when the AMA fired its veteran journal
editor, Dr. George Lundberg. His offense ostensibly was publishing
a finding, on the eve of President Clinton's impeachment trial,
that most college students do not consider oral-genital contact to
be ``having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg later complained that he had fended off AMA officials'
attempts to interfere with his editorial judgment for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg's successor will report to a seven-member panel with
only one member on the AMA payroll, and that person may not be the
panel chairman. Any move to oust the editor will have to go through
the new panel and win approval from two-thirds of the AMA's
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMA management recognizes and fully accepts the necessity of
editorial independence for the editor-in-chief at all times,'' the
organization declared.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, editor of the rival New England Journal
of Medicine, said the AMA's plan ``sounds good on paper,'' but
added: ``If I were a candidate for the editor's job, I'd want to
know who is going to be on that committee and I'd want to meet with
them to explore their point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Further notes: Diabetes, and a caution on AIDS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In other medical news, a new drug for Type II diabetes called
rosiglitazone (brand name Avandia) has won federal approval amid
hopes that it will not cause the rare but potentially fatal liver
problems seen with its cousin, called troglitazone. The drug is
expected to cost about $900 to $1,200 a year. . . . The AIDS virus
``cannot be eradicated with current treatments,'' a team from
Northwestern University has reported for the current New England
Journal of Medicine, on the basis of new evidence. Another group,
from New York's Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, similarly found
AIDS virus replication in two of six patients treated for up to
three years. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health
said the studies underscore the need for better drug treatments
``as well as novel strategies to purge residual virus from the body
and boost the immune system.''

FALLEN WRESTLER'S LIFE ENDED WHERE IT BEGAN

 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Owen Hart came to the mat as a birthright,
the baby boy of the legendary ``first family'' of professional
wrestling. The ascent of Canada's Hart dynasty stretches over much
of the century and the modern history of a sweaty contest that has
devolved from sport to freakish entertainment worth billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the tale took a tragic twist Sunday when Hart, 34, died in a
60-foot plunge as he readied to swoop down on the wrestling ring on
a cable-and-hook contrivance suspended from the ceiling of a sports
arena in Missouri. The flying entrance had been meant to wow the
bellowing audience at a sold-out ``Over the Edge'' World Wrestling
Federation event in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Death was an unnerving deviation from the hyperviolent spectacle
called professional wrestling _ whose theatric duels offer fans
lots of thrills, but few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the looniness of the stunt that killed Owen Hart.
Most shocking in the minds of many was that he was the good guy,
fighting under the monicker ``Blue Blazer,'' the clear-eyed champ
who before bouts sternly enjoined kids to ``say your prayers, eat
your vitamins, and never ever swear.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martha Hart, his high school sweetie and wife of 10 years:
``Owen really lived like that, as clean as they come. He loved his
family, he loved our children. We had a storybook life. . . . He
was not a reckless person.''
</P>
<P>
   In the costume pageant of professional wrestling, good guys
seldom come to bad endings. And, if lose they occasionally must,
they most surely aren't supposed to be brought low so pointlessly,
slammed to the mat by mere gravity instead of a masked
supervillain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Blue Blazer was a Hart, and the Harts are winners
fabled across the wrestling world. ``Harts are supposed to be
invincible,'' said Paul Jay, the producer of a documentary film,
``Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows,'' about Owen's older
brother, Bret. ``The family is a living legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret ``Hitman'' Hart remains the most famous of eight brothers
and four sisters, all of whom followed their domineering dad, Stu _
now 84 but still presiding over the Calgary-based family empire _
into the tawdry realm of pro wrestling, either as fighters,
trainers, referees, or spouses of wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Owen was the plucky baby brother, the come-from-behind kid who,
after years in the ring, had finally wrassled out a low-key
reputation in his own right. He was the stolid, stubborn strongman,
never quite at ease with the flamboyant stagecraft of a career he
followed mainly because his father told him there could be no other
for a Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a phys ed teacher. I wrestled only to appease
my father,'' he told the magazine Saturday Night in a 1993
interview. ``I was compelled to get into the ring. Once I started,
there was the pressure of my family name.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no business quite like pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sport that is not a sport but a series of performances
stretching contest to contest, season to season, into a long drama
_ albeit one with plot lines simple enough to put comic books in a
league with Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys sneer, curse, and strut villainously while
employing cruel kicks, hellish holds, and sneaky jabs. They also
give the middle finger, fondle their crotches, and pretend to
urinate on their opponents or ringside fans.
</P>
<P>
   Referees gaze blankly into the middle distance as female
accomplices of the wrestlers suggestively straddle ropes and flaunt
their breasts to distract their guy's opponent. The good fellows,
meanwhile, seem not to have a clue _ but cheerfully wreak vicious
mayhem as they grapple with their sinister foes.
</P>
<P>
   It's all show, and some critics say it's a sick show. But if
professional wrestling is condemned, dismissed, or ridiculed by
many, it is also followed by millions of passionate fans across
North America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laugh all you want, but lots of people love this sport,'' said
Calgary sportscaster and family friend Ed Whelan. ``And they love
the Hart family.''
</P>
<P>
   That was plain this week as thousands of fans descended on
Calgary in an outpouring of grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to show the Hart family how deeply we're going
to miss Owen,'' said Bethany Gill, 27, of Taunton, Mass., who with
her boyfriend and sister drove nonstop across the continent to
place flowers near Hart House, the family's landmark residence in
this oil boomtown on Canada's western prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Hart House lies ``The Dungeon,'' where older Harts
trained younger Harts in the arcane arts of legholds and headlocks.
The school became notorious for its emphasis on ``submission''
wrestling, in which the idea is not just to defeat an opponent
through greater strength or dexterity but to inflict pain. The
Harts' academy turned out many of the top grapplers of recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The family's ascent to wrestling's sweat-soaked stratosphere
started with Stu Hart, born in 1915 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. An
all-around athlete, the patriarch-to-be played pro football with
Alberta's Edmonton Eskimos in the 1930s, but really shined as an
amateur wrestler, becoming Canada's national champion in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered a contender for an Olympic gold medal, but
World War II forced cancellation of the games. After the war, Stu
Hart headed for New York, where he wrestled professionally and, in
1947, also found a bride, Helen Smith, daughter of track star Henry
J. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Canada, settling in Calgary, where the senior
Hart launched a career as sports promoter by creating ``Stampede
Wrestling,'' a hugely popular road show that staged bouts across
Western Canada from the late 1940s until 1988. Stampede Wrestling
made the leap to television in 1957, a time when pro wrestling
still had vestiges of real sport.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Helen despised wrestling from the start, according
to family friends. But she had a flair for numbers, and she
shrewdly handled the financial side of the business while her
husband stuck to flashier stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Hart mercilessly drilled his eight boys in wrestling
technique, while the girls were encouraged to date wrestlers or
bodybuilders. The father hoped his sons would become amateurs of
Olympic caliber, but the money was on the pro side _ and that's
where they all drifted with varying degrees of renown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted every one of those kids to follow in his
footsteps,'' recalled Whelan, the family friend who served as
announcer for Stampede Wrestling events.
</P>
<P>
   Owen was thrust into the ring at age 4 and never found his way
out. ``He was definitely getting concerned about safety, and
planned to retire in two years,'' said Martha, who said her husband
doted on their two children, Oje, 7, and Athena, 3. ``We were
planning to move to a dream home in Elbow Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the theatrics dominating professional wrestling, the
Hart boys were trained to be serious athletes and bodybuilders, not
just grandstanders. If Owen was happy enough to dress up in silly
suits and mug for TV cameras, he also possessed genuine skills.
``He grew up with a certain style of wrestling, the art form of
wrestling,'' Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer magazine,
told Canada's National Post newspaper. ``He recognized that
wrestling was a business and more popular than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Frank Ashley, professor of sports at
Texas A&AMP;M University, televised professional wrestling captures a
weekly worldwide audience of 40 million people. More than 70
percent are adults over age 18, and 30 percent have middle-class
incomes of more than $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling industry earns $1.1 billion a year, much of it

FILMS TAKE A DIM VIEW OF WHAT LIES AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPPS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We have seen the future _ and it stinks.
</P>
<P>
   In recent science-fiction movies like ``The Matrix'' and
``eXistenZ,'' tomorrow's earth is a desolate, disturbing and
thoroughly unpleasant place where virtual reality rules and free
will has been shunted off to some far and distant corner. Then
there's ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' arriving in theaters today, where
the future is OK (except for some tacky high-rise developments
along Southern California's coastline), but stupid humans still
muck everything up by creating virtual worlds with their computers.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying message: Get real. Because if it's not real, it's
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that the hard-core fans watching these movies
generally don't share that world view. All those people who went
back to see ``The Matrix'' again and again generally feel
comfortable with technology and confident about the future. And
yet, they can't seem to get enough of the film's ground-breaking
special effects and its heady (but ultimately dour) mix of
symbolism and cyber-technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interesting tension there,'' says Wired magazine
columnist Jon Katz. ``I don't think I've ever seen a technological
film that doesn't see the future as a dark, menacing place. I think
it's going to take a brave producer _ someone who isn't so cynical
about our world _ to wake up and finally make a movie that's both
hip and forward-looking and not so bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Katz didn't like the movie. The author, whose
books include ``Virtuous Reality,'' a spirited defense of
cyberspace and youth culture, has seen ``The Matrix'' three times.
His loyalty _ and that of moviegoers like him _ is one reason the
film has made more than $150 million since its release in late
March. A sequel is already in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The themes explored in this crop of virtual reality movies are
hardly new to the science-fiction genre or, for that matter,
television and popular movies. Rod Serling's anthology series ``The
Twilight Zone'' often had episodes in which characters examined
their surroundings with a suspicious gaze, believing they were part
of some kind of cosmic practical joke. (Usually they were.)
</P>
<P>
   Science-fiction writers such as Harlan Ellison and Philip K.
Dick also explored the blurring of reality and illusion in their
stories. Last year, ``The Truman Show'' successfully captured that
queasy feeling that life, as we know it, is a fake, staged exercise
in futility. It was one of the year's most successful movies.
</P>
<P>
   Technology only enhances the level and quality of the fakery. In
``The Thirteenth Floor,'' there are multiple virtual worlds and its
denizens are never quite sure whether their society is the original
or a computer copy. That kind of guessing game fuels the audience's
interest, much as it did in ``The Matrix'' and the excellent
Spanish movie ``Open Your Eyes,'' which opened in the United States
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted to keep the audience just a little bit in the
dark so they'd be wondering what's going to happen next,'' says
Larry Wachowski, who wrote and directed ``The Matrix'' with his
brother Andy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the film's hodgepodge of biblical and mythological
references and its bleak view of the future, Wachowski declines to
go into too many specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the audience to use their brains while they're
watching the movie,'' he says. ``The idea of `The Matrix' is that
it's too easy to live the unexamined life and not be aware of
what's going on in the world. And that can lead to a sorry state of
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in ``The Matrix,'' involves humans being kept awash in
amniotic fluid, blind and mute from birth to death, existing only
so their brain currents can power the machines that run the
universe. Meanwhile, the humans think everything is OK, living in a
virtual world that masks their dire plight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common motif in these virtual reality movies: Unaware
people blissfully plugged into illusory worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Which, say some social critics, is kind of like the Internet
and, to a lesser degree of involvement, television and movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already live in a kind of virtual reality,'' says author
Neal Gabler, whose latest book is ``Life the Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Littleton. There was kind of a seamless transition
between the video games Doom and Quake and the actions of Eric
Harris and Dylan Kleibold. When you live inside giant fantasies,
you are essentially living in first-stage virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz blanches at the correlation between video games and acts of
murder, but admits that he often feels a ``jarring sensation'' of
living in a parallel universe when he goes online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you do have to pinch yourself to know what is
real,'' Katz says. ``Going online is very empowering to some people
because they can assume personalities much different than their
own. And now you have people paying thousands of dollars on e-bay
for virtual personalities that they can use in games like Ultima
On-Line. The lines between fantasy and reality have definitely
blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's actually good news for studios making
technology-driven movies since a little familiarity with the
subject matter can go a long way at the box office. Witness ``The
Matrix'' or ``Open Your Eyes,'' a big hit in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``The Thirteenth Floor'' are keeping their fingers
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scripts for virtual reality movies have been floating around
for five or six years now,'' says ``Thirteenth Floor'' director
Josef Rusnak. ``We're seeing them now because people have caught up
with the technology. They understand it better. And that makes it
easier for them to connect with the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Centropolis Entertainment, the film's producers, decided to take
that audience know-how to the next level and hosted a ``virtual
premiere'' of ``The Thirteenth Floor'' Monday night. It all
followed to form _ movie stars walked down the red carpet, the
paparazzi shot their pictures and fans sat in the bleachers and
cheered for their favorites. There were even celebrity guests _
Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt among others.
</P>
<P>
   And none of it actually happened outside of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point these premieres begin to feel redundant,'' says
producer Dean Devlin, who partnered with director Roland Emmerich
on ``Independence Day'' and ``Godzilla'' and spearheaded the
cyberspace gala.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all these movies about virtual reality in the air right
now, it's weird that nobody has ever staged a virtual premiere.
Being uncharted territory, it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the next step? Virtual moviegoing?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Devlin laughs. ``Not profitable enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What the future might hold, if technophiles have their way, are
movies that depict virtual reality in a manner that isn't so
destructive and despairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These movies, particularly `The Matrix,' operate within a
convention that essentially says that happiness of a virtual
reality sort comes at the expense of free will,'' Gabler says.
``But that assumes we don't want those things, and I think we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy humming and with drugs like Prozac, we're
already on the road to purging a lot of the qualities _ anxiety,
loneliness, depression _ that make us human. Virtual reality will
probably take us to the next level. Yet you don't see any movies
that imagine the future that way. It's always the machines, not the
humans, who are in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Katz: ``We'll see one someday. Maybe it will take the `Star
Trek' people to go where no film has gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it lives long and prospers (in theaters), maybe others
would follow. &QL;

THE RIGHT WAY TO SUBSIDIZE ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1968, Americans donated (in dollars corrected for inflation)
$2.5 billion to organizations involved in arts and culture. In
1998, they gave more than $10.5 billion. The American nation has
become the most generous patron of the arts the world has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion in arts and culture philanthropy has been matched
by an explosion in arts and culture enjoyment. Tyler Cowen, an
economist at George Mason University, points out in a recent essay
that between 1965 and 1990, ``America grew from having 58 symphony
orchestras to having nearly 300, from 27 opera companies to more
than 150, and from 22 nonprofit regional theaters to 500.
Contemporary Western culture,'' Cowen declares, ``especially in the
United States, is flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   With all heavy weather in recent years over the National
Endowment for the Arts, it has been easy to forget that the
mountain of private-sector support for the arts towers over the
molehill of government arts funding. The NEA budget is $98 million,
less than one-100th of the amount that private individuals,
foundations, and corporations will donate in 1999. The warning that
American art would be devastated if the NEA were cut back or
eliminated has always rung false, especially when it comes from the
likes of Barbra Streisand or Alec Baldwin, who would not find it
outlandish to spend $98 million on a single movie.
</P>
<P>
   The chief objection to government funding of the arts is not the
funding but the government _ not the number of dollars but that
those dollars are being distributed by agents of the state, which
has no business meddling in the marketplace of ideas and
expression. The process of judging art _ like the process of
creating it _ is highly subjective, even eccentric. Government is
no more qualified to choose the best artists than it is to choose
the best churches. Suppose Tom loves Haydn performed on period
instruments, Dick thinks Webern's 12-tone bagatelles are sublime,
and Harry has every song Smashing Pumpkins ever recorded, but the
NEA spends their tax dollars on opera at the Met. Why is that a
system any of them should favor?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if the NEA had stuck to funding opera it would never
have become a focus of controversy. What triggered the war over
government arts funding was the discovery that federal grants were
directly or indirectly promoting ``art'' that most Americans would
find tasteless or stupid. Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix
submerged in urine was only the most infamous example; there was a
long parade of others, from the video of dancing lesbians costumed
as vaginas (``We're Talking Vulva'' at the Hallwalls center in
Buffalo) to Kate Millet's ``The American Dream Goes to Pot'': a
toilet stuffed with a US flag.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the NEA, myself included, never challenged the
artists' right to create such works. What galled so many of us was
that taxpayers were compelled to subsidize them. Make all the nasty
shock art you like, we said; just don't force the rest of us to pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Comes now the Creative Capital Foundation to take up that
challenge. Some two dozen private arts patrons, The New York Times
reported on May 3, ``have joined forces to support artists who
challenge convention.'' Their intention is to raise $40 million
with which to finance artists whose work ``upsets people,'' as
Archibald L. Gillies of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts puts it. ``In this organization's absolute principles, one
comes first and that is funding experimental, challenging art on
its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure everyone understand what kind of art Gillies and his
colleagues are talking about, the Times article spelled it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative Capital's executive director . . . said contributors
knew that the group would seek out and not shrink from artists like
Karen Finley, who often performs in the nude and famously smears
her body in chocolate; Robert Mapplethorpe, whose homoerotic
photographs offended many, and other artists who caused
headline-making conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times describes the new endeavor as ``throwing down the
gauntlet to conservatives,'' but here is one conservative who
wishes the new foundation every success. For its approach is
exactly the right one: They are supporting the art they find worthy
by digging into their own pockets. Private patronage is how artists
should be supported.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Creative Capital will not simply hand out checks with
no strings attached. It will require its grantees to work with
marketing experts on building audiences for their work. And grant
winners will have to agree to pay back to the foundation a 10 to 15
percent share of any proceeds their art projects earn.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the foundation's trustees are going to take market
potential into account when deciding which artists to underwrite.
My hunch is that they will therefore fund less of the vulgar fringe
stuff than the NEA did. It is easier to subsidize rudeness
masquerating as art when Congress writes you an annual check. But
when next year's budget depends on this year's decisions, those
decisions tend to get made more responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I'm wrong about that, the birth of Creative Capital is
good news. It opens yet another tributary into the great river of
American arts philanthropy. And it shows more clearly than ever how
little we need the NEA.

TIM MCGRAW/``A PLACE IN THE SUN'' (Curb)
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can be hard to resist McGraw's insidiously well-crafted new
disc, which recently sprinted to the top of the pop albums list for
a week in the sun. Unless, of course, you prefer music that isn't
designed as a lifestyle accessory. The sometimes engaging blend of
rock and slick balladry found on the Nashville singer's fifth album
often seems freeze-dried, processed so the drums and vocals are so
upfront in the mix they're almost shrill. But, then, the aim is to
score a hit, and in order to do that you've got to target pop radio
dead on. Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   While the award-winning McGraw doesn't write, he attracts the
cream of Music Row, as evidenced by the hit single ``Please
Remember Me,'' penned by Will Jennings and Rodney Crowell, and
that's the standout tune here. The rest could easily be the latest
from Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson or George Strait. Generic sounds
for generic times. 2 stars

DIANA ROSS/``EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY'' (Motown)
</P>
<P>
   She's a star, dahling, and if you don't believe it, check out
the hysterical diva poses in the booklet accompanying Ross' first
album in five years. Actually, thanks to a host of top producers
and some spectacular hairstyling, ``Every Day Is a New Day'' isn't
as unbearable as you'd expect. The best thing here is the
techno-dance ditty ``Got to Be Free,'' played and produced by r&AMP;b
hitmaker Malik Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   The second-best reason to pluck this disc from the rack for a
moment is the photo of Ross in a sheer black dress splayed out on
the back of a horse, which is wearing a ``she's gotta be kidding''
expression on its face. We know the feeling. 1 1/2 stars

AFRO CELT SOUND SYSTEM/``VOL. 2: RELEASE'' (Real World)
</P>
<P>
   Afro Celt Sound System leader Simon Emmerson's fusion of African
drums, Irish pipes, flutes, accordions and Gaelic voices has gotten
him labeled barking mad in his native Britain. But there's much to
enjoy on the second album from this imaginative and quirky outfit,
which is a perennial favorite on the European summer festival
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the album's memorable moments is the opening cut
``Release,'' featuring a furious rhythm section and vocals from
Sinead O'Connor. The tune is later reprised as an instrumental at
the end of this fully enchanting disc. 3 stars

   The original Mr. Hat dredges up previously released stuff from
the '90s, plus a few newly recorded tracks like the pointless cover
of Queen's ``Crazy Little Thing Called Love'' that's all over
country radio now. The best songs, including the bittersweet ballad
``The Heart That You Own,'' come from Yoakam's 1990 career peak,
``If There Was a Way.'' That's the album to get. 2 stars

MONTY ALEXANDER/``STIR IT UP'' (telarc)
</P>
<P>
   Jamaican jazz pianist Alexander goes home with this rewarding
tribute to reggae legend Bob Marley. Using a six-piece Jamaican
rhythm section as well as his own four-piece jazz combo, Alexander
creates 13 songs that flow nicely between reggae and jazz grooves.
The results should please fans of both camps.
</P>
<P>
   Trombonist Steve Turre memorably solos on ``Running Away'' and
``I Shot the Sheriff,'' while Alexander nicely embellishes classic
Marley melodies on standards like ``Could You Be Loved'' and
``Jammin'.'' The pianist's imaginative playing (with wide-spanning
references that include George Gershwin and the Beatles) makes this
album more than a rote tribute. 3 stars

   Mambo and cha-cha from Havana filled the world's dance floors 40
years ago. Here's a top-notch compilation of Afro-Cuban treats from
our least-favored neighbor nation, which has maintained a vibrant
and influential music scene despite economic and political woes.
</P>
<P>
   Featured are stalwarts such as Jesus Alemany's Cubanismo!, the
great Los Van Van and the always marvelous Cachao, but it also
spotlights more obscure offerings from up-and-comers in both Cuba
and the U.S. Excellent liner notes give a solid context for the
music, which never stops simmering. ``Cuba Si!'' indeed. 3 1/2

   Like pro wrestling, Marilyn Manson and the Jerky Boys, Detroit's
horror-rap duo Insane Clown Posse offer an empty, violent show
built for undiscriminating 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   On this ridiculous record, which naturally is selling like hot
cakes, the brothers under the big top spew all the usual foul rap
cliches while fellow entertainment geniuses Snoop Dogg and the
Jerky Boys join the good times. ``The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' is
so insipid it makes fellow Fun City native Eminem sound like
``Sketches of Spain.'' 1 stars

KRUDER AND DORFMEISTER/``THE K&AMP;D SESSIONS'' (Stud!o K7)
</P>
<P>
   The German mixing and production team of Kruder and Dorfmeister
know how to spin an implacably cool groove and make it stretch
compellingly over two fat discs. A highlight of this slinky remix
collection, culled from an offbeat array of ambient, techno, rap
and other sources, is a spooky remake of Depeche Mode's
``Useless.'' This is all-night move and groove stuff _ smooth,
silky and sexy with a dangerous edge. Highly recommended. 3 1/2

ROBERT CRAY BAND/``TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF'' (Rykodisc)

   On his 11th album, urbane Bay Area bluesman Cray again tips his
hat to the revered Hi/Stax branch of Southern soul. The Al
Green-style ``Love Gone to Waste,'' boasting a sizzling Willie
Mitchell horn arrangement, is the favorite, while ``24-7 Man'' and
``It's All Gone'' replicate the formula down to a visit from the
Memphis Horns. Vocally, though, while Cray's heart is in the right
place, he's no O.V. Wright. 2 1/2 stars

DANGEROUS LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a first-time presidential candidate, he lied about how he
avoided military service, lied about drug usage, lied about his
extramarital affair with a former state government employee, lied
about his role in Arkansas real estate transactions, lied about his
accomplishments as governor and lied about what he would do if
elected president. But that was OK because things would be
different when he took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   The day before he was sworn in as president, Clinton told New
York Times columnist Thomas Friedman that he planned to change US
policy toward Iraq. The very next day, he denied saying any such
thing, which was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   He lied when he took the oath of office (saying that he would
see to it that the laws were faithfully executed) and there
followed a torrent of lies, half-truths and outright falsehoods
that have since made it impossible to take anything the president
says at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over the last 6 1/2 years, the collected lies of
William Clinton test the hard drive of memory.
</P>
<P>
   He lied about Whitewater. He lied about Castle Grande. He lied
about the firing of the White House travel office personnel. He
lied about his staff's mishandling of FBI files. He lied about the
circumstances surrounding the suicide of White House counsel Vince
Foster. He lied about a vast White House effort to hush up former
assistant attorney general and convicted felon Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   He lied to his friends, and he told lies about his adversaries.
He lied on policy matters big and small. He lied on political
matters big and small. And when it came time to gear up for his
reelection campaign in 1996, he lied with renewed and reckless
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   He lied about Democratic Party fund-raising efforts in 1995-96.
He lied about his own fund-raising on behalf of the Clinton-Gore
Committee. He lied about the involvement of the Riady family and
Chinese operatives in these fund-raising efforts. He lied about the
damage done to the national security as a result of those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After he was reelected in 1996, he lied about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. He lied about his efforts to cover up that
relationship. He lied to his wife, his daughter, his staff, his
Cabinet, and his constituents and authorized a vast public
relations campaign to slander duly appointed officers of the US
Department of Justice charged with investigating many of the lies
listed above.
</P>
<P>
   He lied in a federal civil suit, and he lied to the federal
judge who presided over that case. He lied, repeatedly and under
oath, to a grand jury in a federal criminal investigation. And
along the way he engaged his minions to lie about Kathleen Willey
and Paula Jones, who accused him of sexual harassment and about
Juanita Broaddrick, who accused him of rape. He brushed the rape
charge aside, using his lawyer as a mouthpiece, but the charge
stands uncontested on any important detail.
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that Clinton's contention that
``to the best of my knowledge no one has said anything to me about
any espionage, which occurred by the Chinese against the labs,
during my presidency'' is a lie. Or that ``I can tell you that no
one has reported to me that they suspect such a thing has
occurred'' is also a lie. These lies concern the largest spy
scandal since the Rosenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, New York Times columnist William Safire expressed
puzzlement as to why the president would lie about something he
really didn't have to lie about.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Chinese espionage at US nuclear weapons facilities
began during the Carter administration and continued through the
Reagan, Bush, and Clinton presidencies. Surely there was enough
blame to go around. Surely the national security interests of the
United States superceded the presidents need to prevaricate.

   It was a wonderfully naive column, assuming as it did that
Clinton could make the distinction between lying about unimportant
matters (as his lying was characterized during the impeachment
hearings) and lying about matters of state. But there is no
distinction. Clinton lies because he is a pathological liar.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Cox Report, which details the wholesale theft
of America's most precious nuclear secrets and the Clinton
administration's stunning indifference to its discovery, nothing
will change. No one will resign in disgrace. No one will be fired.
And the president and his handlers will continue to lie about what
happened, when it happened, and why it was allowed to continue to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   All these lies, and hundreds more like them, have made liars of
us all. We have allowed them. We have accepted them. We are now
complicit in them.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Clinton's lying was his problem, but that
time has long passed. Clinton's lying is our problem now. We ignore
it at our peril.

DUB REGGAE HAS LOST AN INNOVATOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the recent death of influential reggae
instrumentalist Augustus Pablo, the Jamaican production technique
called dub lost another pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo, whose original name was Horace Swaby, was known for his
``Far East sound,'' with its reliance on haunting minor chords and
sparse melodica lines over deep, throbbing bass and echoing
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo, 46, died May 18 in Kingston, Jamaica, of a nerve
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   His most consistent and creative period was in the mid-'70s with
the release of such albums as ``King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown,''
a collection of instrumentals remixed by the late engineer and
producer King Tubby, and ``East of the River Nile,'' a reflective,
self-produced instrumental set.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the cornerstones of dub reggae.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the enormous interest in Pablo's work over the years,
most of his back catalog has been re-released. One to look for is
``This is Augustus Pablo,'' an impressive debut with a simple
approach: over a dozen rhythms, Pablo improvises on what was
previously a child's toy _ the melodica, a harmonica with a
keyboard attached.
</P>
<P>
   Although the word dub is currently used in dance circles to
describe a remix, it stems from Jamaica, where experimental
producers like Pablo, Tubby and Lee Perry removed the vocal from a
record leaving the raw rhythm track to be manipulated in the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first dub albums was Perry's ``Blackboard Jungle
Dub,'' in which rhythms were saturated in delay and reverb effects
while snatches of vocals, guitar and organ seemed to be coming
across vast spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Pablo's ``Rockers Meet King Tubby Ina
Firehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo hardly ever toured, preferring to remain in the studio
creating instrumental recordings into the '90s and employing
digital technology in the last years. &QL;

PALM VII PRICEY, LIMITED, BUT COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The critics are right. The new ``Star Wars'' movie features
wooden acting and bad dialogue. I should know _ I've already seen
it twice.
</P>
<P>
   The critics are also right about 3Com Corp.'s new Palm VII
pocket data device. It's too expensive and offers a limited set of
features. But 3Com will sell heaps of them, regardless of the
critics.
</P>
<P>
   I won't shell out the necessary $600 _ 37 times the cost of my
two trips to the planet Naboo. I've a reputation for stinginess to
maintain, and I'd just as soon wait for the inevitable price drop.
Besides, the Palm VII is presently for sale only in the New York
area. Still, it's the first palm-sized machine that's actually
tempted me to spend some money.
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers know that I'm not a fan of personal digital
assistants. They have some value as electronic address books,
letting you store hundreds of phone numbers and a list of
appointments. But for this you don't need the pricey, heavy boxes
from 3Com or its rivals. The $99 credit-card-sized Franklin Rex is
quite good enough. Larger PDAs can also double as electronic
note-takers, but what's wrong with a pencil and paper?
</P>
<P>
   But the Palm VII transcends the limits of its predecessors by
adding a smidgen of interactivity. 3Com has crammed a radio
transceiver into a package almost exactly the same size as the
original Palm devices. With the cute plastic antenna extended, my
test unit worked perfectly, even inside the steel-and-concrete
walls of The Boston Globe. It snatched Internet data right out of
the air, and let me fire off brief messages to anybody with an
e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII uses a wireless data service that's available in
Boston and 259 other US cities. Users get access to a heap of
valuable on-line services _ news headlines from USA Today and the
Wall Street Journal, for instance. There's a nice applet from the
E-Trade on-line brokerage service that'll let you quickly check the
performance of your stock portfolio. The MapQuest driving
directions service, which can display the best route between point
A and point B, will delight newspaper photographers and others who
live on the road. And ``Star Wars'' buffs can use the Moviefone
applet to plan next weekend's viewings of ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also assigns you an address on Palm.net, 3Com's own
e-mail service, so you can send and receive messages. Writing on
any of the Palm PDAs is a tiresome business. You must either use a
special stylus to peck at the image of a keyboard, or you must
master Graffiti, a special writing method that enables the device
to recognize the human scrawl. I've never understood why anyone
would bother with all this just to jot down a phone number. But add
the ability to e-mail your notes, and it all makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the unseemly price tag to consider _ and not just
for the device itself. You'll pay $10 a month for basic Palm.net
service, which limits you to a measly 50 kilobytes of data per
month. Extra kilobytes cost 30 cents each. A single downloaded
article from USA Today burns up one kilobyte, so heavy users will
burn through a small fortune in transmission costs. An ``extended''
service offering 150 kilobytes for $24.99 isn't much better.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of specialized programs that run on Palm
devices, but with a mere 2 megabytes of memory, the Palm VII won't
let you run too many of them. In this era of cheap memory chips, I
wonder why 3Com didn't squeeze in a few more.
</P>
<P>
   And why won't the Palm.net system let me check the contents of
my other e-mailboxes? There's a feature to gladden the heart of any
traveler. But it's not to be found here. You'll only get mail sent
to the Palm.net address. Maybe you can set up your office e-mail
system to forward your messages. If not, the Palm VII offers no
help.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Palm VII is too expensive, too limited _ and too
cool. Its ability to send and receive data from almost anywhere
makes it the first such device that I'd consider a serious business
tool. The Palm VII's faults are like that floppy-eared alien in the
``Star Wars'' movie _ annoying, but not annoying enough to keep the
customers away.

`STAR WARS': ANIMATION MAY IMPRESS, BUT HUMANITY INSPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A close friend of mine saw the new movie, ``Star Wars Episode 1:
The Phantom Menace.'' She wasn't very impressed. ``It's a pretty
movie,'' she said, ``but it's not very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   I left the theater last weekend with much the same reaction. Too
much effort, I thought, went into the computer graphics and the
merchandising. Not enough forethought went into the plot or
character development.
</P>
<P>
   But, the problem with ``The Phantom Menace'' isn't just the lack
of high drama. Much of the movie's weakness lies with the computer
graphics themselves, and the reliance upon them to the exclusion of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it's hard not to be impressed by the
computerized prowess that director George Lucas has brought. There
are animated armies of 'droids and reptilian creatures, playing out
an exquisitely choreographed battle. There is a major character
that is completely computer-drawn.
</P>
<P>
   And the animation covers the spectrum of what is possible with
today's technology. The animated robots are rendered with
incredible detail and move with deft precision. The animated Jar
Jar Binks walks around, jumps, and drops things as if he is truly
under the influence of gravity. But most convincing is the way
these characters share the screen and interact with the
flesh-and-blood human actors. Lucas has certainly bought the
world's best animation with his millions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, alas, with this computer-generated tour-de-force is
that it ultimately lacks meaning and emotional depth. Animated
characters can't act. They can only follow choreographed motions.
You can look at the screen and marvel at the eye candy, but
subconsciously your heart discounts the difficulties or deaths that
befall animated creatures. They don't feel real, because they don't
act as if they are alive.
</P>
<P>
   The first Star Wars movie was successful, in part, because
moviegoers could identify with the main characters and with the
battle. True, no one in the audience had ever been on a space
station the size of a small moon. But people could relate to the
idea of soldiers in uniform, battleships at sea, and atomic
weapons. The Imperial storm troopers were human beings wearing
white body armor, and despite their face masks, you could read
their emotions in their body language. The destruction of the Death
Star, although necessary, was still a tragedy because of all the
people that the ship carried. The movie was psychologically
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace,'' by contrast, feels like a Saturday
morning cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' now in theaters, does a much better job
integrating computer graphics with live action. That's because the
moviemakers used computer graphics to augment the storytelling and
the action, rather than replace it.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``The Matrix'' takes place inside a massive
computer. The twist is that the computer is running a simulation of
the world in which we live, Earth circa 1999. The movie's
underlying theme is that people who understand the world's true
simulated nature can manipulate reality to suit their needs.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for the creators of ``The Matrix'' to
have used the simulated nature of their world to justify the
creation of computer-generated bad guys. Instead, the movie had
villains that were human _ and thus all the more terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Storm troopers, psychopaths, and invincible demons make for
successful movies because we understand the dangers that they
present. 'Droid armies, on the other hand, are so alien that they
can't get the adrenalin going. And without fear, there is no
excitement.

COURTS PONDERING AS IDS ARE FOUGHT ON RACIAL BASIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Is the eyewitness identification of a black robbery
suspect by a white bank teller less reliable simply because he's
black and she's white?
</P>
<P>
   Dueling experts couldn't agree in Boston recently, and neither
could a federal jury, which late last week said it was hopelessly
deadlocked, unable to reach a verdict in the bank robbery trial of
a young black man whose chief accuser was an elderly white woman.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Nancy Gertner, breaking new legal ground, had
allowed expert testimony on the reliability of cross-racial
identification, a rare and controversial move in Massachusetts
courts, which have hesitated to allow such testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, the state judge presiding over the murder trial
of Jeffrey Bly, the man accused of gunning down gang prosecutor
Paul McLaughlin in 1995, refused a request by Bly's lawyers to
present an expert witness to undercut the testimony of a white
woman who testified that she saw Bly, who is black, near the
commuter rail stop the night McLaughlin was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who identified Bly in court, said she noticed him
because it was unusual to see a black man in predominantly white
West Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing the request for expert testimony, Superior Court
Judge James D. McDaniel Jr. said there may be times when jurors
should hear such expert testimony, ``but this is not one of them.''
Some of the most incriminating evidence against Bly has come from
his former associates.
</P>
<P>
   But Gertner allowed two psychologists to testify in federal
court about the accuracy of eyewitness identification when it
involves people of different races.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the accused robber, Johanna Hines, contended that
the arrest of Hines was a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's expert cited experiments that indicate people have
difficulty identifying someone of another race. The prosecution's
expert, meanwhile, countered that the experiments could not be
applied to real-life situations, like a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Saul Kassen of Williams College, who testified for the
defense, said studies show a witness is wrong 13 to 15 percent more
often when he or she is asked to identify a suspect of a different
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not overwhelming, but it is there,'' Kassen told jurors
in the Hines case. ``And it's true whether it's white on black,
black on white, white on Hispanic, Asian on white. It makes no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of prejudice, not a `those people all
look alike' type of thing,' '' Kassen testified. ``It is an
innocent mistake. It is simply more difficult for people to
identify members of a race other than their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassen said there is no firm explanation for the difference in
reliability but added that ``the best reason seems to be the lack
of exposure to the other race.''
</P>
<P>
   But a witness for the prosecution _ Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a
psychology professor at the University of California in San Diego _
said the results of controlled laboratory experiments cannot be
automatically applied to real-life situations, such as a bank
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of a bank teller being robbed at gunpoint, Ebbesen
said, cannot automatically be equated with ``an experiment with a
group of college students, who are not the victims of crimes,
looking at photographs, students who are, perhaps, getting paid or
(receiving college) credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know how people react in a real-life robbery,
whether they focus more intently or less so,'' Ebbesen said. ``The
problem is taking research that's been done and applying it to the
real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts courts have resisted efforts to admit expert
testimony on eyewitness identification because it may confuse or
mislead the jury or prolong a trial unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. The US Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit in Boston has yet to consider the issue of cross-racial
identification. But in a 1995 opinion upholding a lower court's
refusal to allow an expert to testify about the reliability of
eyewitnesses in general, the court noted that courts in other parts
of the country were beginning to rethink the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door that was once largely shut is now somewhat ajar,''
the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court recently set aside a rape
conviction of a black man accused of raping a white woman, saying
the jury should have been instructed that it can be difficult for
people of one race to identify people of another.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent case in federal court here, a white teller, Jeanne
Dunn, identified Hines, 39, as the man who robbed her at gunpoint
of $10,982 at the Broadway National Bank in Chelsea on Jan. 27,
1997. The teller picked Hines out of a lineup seven months after
the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A Hispanic customer who was in the bank at the time of the
robbery could not identify Hines.
</P>
<P>
   Although the robber was photographed by a bank surveillance
camera, the image was blurry. According to court papers, Hines
allegedly told a government informant that he applied Vaseline to
his face during bank robberies to distort his image.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Elizabeth Loftus of the University of Washington and
Boston lawyer James M. Doyle, who have both written extensively on
eyewitness identification, suggested the reason for
misidentifications may lie in the way we process the faces of
people of different races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on different features,'' Loftus said. ``Showing a
white person photos of Asians, for instance, they might focus on
the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said recent studies of cases in which DNA evidence cleared
defendants who had been wrongfully convicted found that in a large
number of cases, eyewitness testimony was a key factor in obtaining
the faulty conviction.

MANY KOSOVARS BALK AT MOVING TO ALBANIA

   CEGRANE, Macedonia _ Father and son have heard the buzz. They've
read the flier. All that's left are the one-on-one pitch and maybe
a sneak peak at what they're being offered.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hetemis have no intention of falling for the hard sell.
After a month in Macedonia, they say they're not budging, certainly
not to move to southern Albania. Germany maybe, since they have
family there. Kosovo, sure. Albania, no way, even if it is their
ancestral home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard about people who left, we know they want us to
leave, but we are not leaving this place,'' Lutfi Hetemi, 52, said
as his 22-year-old son, Lulzim, trimmed his hair at one of the
outdoor barber shops that have sprung up in the refugee camp.
``They can try all they want, but we are staying if we are not
accepted to go to Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   UN officials hope to persuade him otherwise. In a campaign
befitting time-share condominiums in Florida or Arizona retirement
communities, southern Albania is being pitched to Kosovo refugees
as the place to be. Open spaces, warmer winters, and better
security all figure into the campaign aimed at the earliest
arrivals, who have settled into their second homes and are loathe
to leave for a third.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Kosovo community leaders and elders have been
flown to Cegrane from overcrowded Kukes, located along Albania's
northern border with Yugoslavia, to tour the camps and try to
persuade their inhabitants. Brochures touting the merits of
southern and central Albania are being distributed. The United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is preparing a video to show
in Cegrane and other Macedonian tent cities, where refugees are not
in danger of shelling by Serb-led Yugoslav forces but of being
evicted by Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the campaign has fallen on stubborn ears.
</P>
<P>
   The commission hopes to relocate at least 33,000 Kosovars who
were forced to flee their homes when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched his ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign and NATO
responded with airstrikes. But barely 500 refugees have accepted
the UN agency's offer in Kukes, according to figures released
Wednesday. The first group of 204 headed south on Monday onmilitary
trucks; Tuesday's convoy carried 301 on the 24-hour journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still very much undecided,'' said Melita Sunjic,
the spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the
Albanian capital of Tirana. ``They sign up and change their minds
and don't go. We understand that they're sick and tired of moving,
so we're doing everything we can to convince them it's for the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovars say they feel otherwise, especially those in
Macedonia, where the sound of distant shelling does not regularly
interrupt sleep. Refugees there can also apply to emigrate to other
countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through interpreters, refugees in Kukes say they want
to stay where they are, too _ close to home and on hand for family
members still making their way into Albania. Even the ethnic
Albanians living in the relatively pristine camps in southwest
Albania sound unhappy to be so far from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in Kukes, even though it was dirty and they
said it was dangerous,'' said Lumturije Benisha, 33, who was
separated from her husband and 12-year-old son by Serb police and
was forced to turn over most of her money and jewelry in exchange
for safe passage for her and her 6-year-old daughter. ``I wanted to
stay until my family came over. I haven't heard anything from them
and I'm afraid I never will if I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Benisha, Mustaf and Nazife Maksutaj could not quite explain
who made them leave Kukes and why. As they tell it, they were
ordered onto a bus headed to the southern Albania city of Fier,
where the United States recently opened Camp Hope and will soon
open Camp Eagle. UNHCR officials explained that newcomers _ and all
three were _ are being spread throughout Albania. Only those
already settled into camps are being given a choice.
</P>
<P>
   On the Kosovo-Albania border ``the police said we must go to
Albania; in Albania someone said we must go here,'' said Nazife
Maksutaj, 62, who is sharing a spotless, spacious tent with eight
relatives and four members of another family who were strangers
until a week ago. ``They did not say please. They said go. But we
don't want to be in this camp. I want to be in our home.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mustaf Maksutaj, 70, who each day dons a knit vest, pocket
watch, and traditional cream-colored Kosovo hat known as a plis,
``They burned our house. . . . But we will get back to Kosovo even
from here. We have money for the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Carol A. Miller, an Army reservist who is Camp Hope's
spokeswoman, said refugees continually ask when _ and how _ they
will get home to their farms and apartments in Kosovo. Yet new
arrivals keep coming, most from Kukes, some from nearby Fier where
they had been sleeping in city parks and on front lawns, still
others from camps in bordering Greece. Among refugees, there are
good words on the $40 million camp that will eventually hold almost
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming officially and unofficially, some in
mini-vans on their own, other in buses from the border,'' said Paul
J. Giannone, deputy director of the emergency group at
Atlanta-based CARE, the relief agency running Camp Hope. ``People
don't even have directions, but somehow they know to get here.
People just show up at the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the camp in Fier never fills up, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees says its policy is to ask, not force,
ethnic Albanians to relocate. Still, the tent camps in Kukes will
eventually be closed and those in Macedonia could be closed if that
country ever makes good on its since-rescinded threat to ship at
least some of the 96,000 refugees now living in tent camps to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not like to use the word forcing and at the same time we
intend to step up the movement of people,'' Sunjic said. ``We are
against involuntary movement, because refugees are refugees by
definition because they were involuntarily moved. We don't want to
do that to them again.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the UNHCR must persuade them to move. So relief
workers talk up water shortages in Kukes, overcrowding in Cegrane.
Refugees who relocate may also get free daytrips back to the
border: at least some are expected to be asked to return to tell
others how much better life is in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Hope, Hava Hajrizi said she would be happy to testify on
her new home's behalf. After learning her brother had been killed,
after watching her house burned, after walking a week to the
border, after being robbed by Serb police, after spending two
nights in a park in Kukes, she said she gladly climbed aboard a bus
headed south.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place has got some problems, but we're happy here, as
happy as we can be,'' said Hajrizi, 50, who shares a 20-person tent
with relatives. ``It's better here. It's risky near the border. I
feel bad saying so, but conditions up there are so much worse.''

`THE NEWSROOM' SERIES SMART, WICKEDLY FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the Canadian television series ``The
Newsroom,'' George Findlay (Ken Finkleman), the self-absorbed
producer of the nightly ``Toronto News,'' decides during a staff
meeting that in a story about a killer virus in Zaire it should be
added that ``sources speculate the virus may be airborne.'' Of
course, those sources are all in George's head.
</P>
<P>
   When challenged by an intern that no one has made such a
statement and the network would be lying if it were put on the air,
George corrects her: ``There's a big difference between saying
sources speculate and lying. One is lying, and one is journalism.''
In ``The Newsroom,'' Finkleman, who wrote and directed the 13
episodes of the series, has fashioned a wicked satire of the news
business and one of the smartest shows ever produced on television.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most Americans missed it. The series played
briefly on public televison last year (KCET aired it late Friday
nights) with little fanfare. A few critics picked up on it. Time
magazine hailed it, saying it had ``brilliant moments of deadpan
humor. Imagine `Broadcast News' meets `Spinal Tap.''' Entertainment
Weekly called it ``the show `Murphy Brown'' should have been.'' And
Vanity Fair glowingly profiled Finkleman last August. The only
problem was that few people had gotten to see ``The Newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Acorn Media, all 13 episodes of the show are
available on home video in a four-volume set. Even better, they are
the director's cut, which means racier language than you would hear
on network television. Call it the cable cut.
</P>
<P>
   (If you can't find it in your video store, they should be able
to order it, or you can check out Acorn's Web site, acornmedia.com.
The set goes for $59.95, or $19.95 individually.
</P>
<P>
   There are two things that make ``The Newsroom'' unique. First,
Finkleman, a former Hollywood screenwriter (he wrote and directed
``Airplane 2'') who fled Tinseltown, conceived the series as a
finite run. So, the episodes build to a grand and hilarious
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it goes beyond the mere idea that the news business is
rotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always this need to impose a narrative,'' Finkleman
has said about journalism. ``That's what I find very destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's his character, George, who is always punching up the
news in his quest for bigger ratings, never letting facts _ or
morality _ paint him into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode titled ``The Kevorkian Joke,'' George finds out
about a tape being passed around the newsroom on which a failing
screenwriter threatens to commit suicide. George decides to invite
the screenwriter to air his reasons each night during ratings week,
cumulating _ it is hoped _ with an on-air suicide. George is quick
to counsel the screenwriter that he's not allowed to encourage the
screenwriter to kill himself, but that it would look pretty bad if
he spent the week talking and didn't follow through. The segments,
of course, are a hit, helped by the jokes written by the newsroom
staff. By the fifth day, the screenwriter has an agent, offers from
Hollywood and is demanding $50,000 for his final appearance.
</P>
<P>
   He's thwarted. George already has won the ratings war, so he
cancels the segment. But Finkleman has one more twist.
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter was going to kill himself over his girlfriend,
who comes to George and asks that she not become part of the story.
He agrees. Not out of the goodness of his heart, but because George
is a 40-something lothario and within minutes is subtly hitting on
her. Later, when the screenwriter comes to thank George for saving
his life, deeming the experience positive after all, guess who he
finds together.
</P>
<P>
   The newsroom itself is a Fellini-esque world, ruled by
Machiavellian, if comical, characters. The news is secondary to the
story, the story to the images. During a possible Chernobyl-like
meltdown outside Toronto, the crisis is barely reported while
George tries to add more pizazz to the promo, including scenes from
Hiroshima, the O.J. trial and the Sistine Chapel. But all this is
secondary to George's real obsessions _ bran muffins and his BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Are newsrooms really like this? Let's just say this: They're not
as funny. &QL;

TIM MCGRAW/``A PLACE IN THE SUN'' (Curb)
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can be hard to resist McGraw's insidiously well-crafted new
disc, which recently sprinted to the top of the pop albums list for
a week in the sun. Unless, of course, you prefer music that isn't
designed as a lifestyle accessory. The sometimes engaging blend of
rock and slick balladry found on the Nashville singer's fifth album
often seems freeze-dried, processed so the drums and vocals are so
upfront in the mix they're almost shrill. But, then, the aim is to
score a hit, and in order to do that you've got to target pop radio
dead on. Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   While the award-winning McGraw doesn't write, he attracts the
cream of Music Row, as evidenced by the hit single ``Please
Remember Me,'' penned by Will Jennings and Rodney Crowell, and
that's the standout tune here. The rest could easily be the latest
from Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson or George Strait. Generic sounds
for generic times. 2 stars

DIANA ROSS/``EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY'' (Motown)
</P>
<P>
   She's a star, dahling, and if you don't believe it, check out
the hysterical diva poses in the booklet accompanying Ross' first
album in five years. Actually, thanks to a host of top producers
and some spectacular hairstyling, ``Every Day Is a New Day'' isn't
as unbearable as you'd expect. The best thing here is the
techno-dance ditty ``Got to Be Free,'' played and produced by r&AMP;b
hitmaker Malik Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   The second-best reason to pluck this disc from the rack for a
moment is the photo of Ross in a sheer black dress splayed out on
the back of a horse, which is wearing a ``she's gotta be kidding''
expression on its face. We know the feeling. 1 1/2 stars

AFRO CELT SOUND SYSTEM/``VOL. 2: RELEASE'' (Real World)
</P>
<P>
   Afro Celt Sound System leader Simon Emmerson's fusion of African
drums, Irish pipes, flutes, accordions and Gaelic voices has gotten
him labeled barking mad in his native Britain. But there's much to
enjoy on the second album from this imaginative and quirky outfit,
which is a perennial favorite on the European summer festival
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the album's memorable moments is the opening cut
``Release,'' featuring a furious rhythm section and vocals from
Sinead O'Connor. The tune is later reprised as an instrumental at
the end of this fully enchanting disc. 3 stars

DWIGHT YOAKAM/``LAST CHANCE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS'' (Reprise)
</P>
<P>
   The original Mr. Hat dredges up previously released stuff from
the '90s, plus a few newly recorded tracks like the pointless cover
of Queen's ``Crazy Little Thing Called Love'' that's all over
country radio now. The best songs, including the bittersweet ballad
``The Heart That You Own,'' come from Yoakam's 1990 career peak,
``If There Was a Way.'' That's the album to get. 2 stars

MONTY ALEXANDER/``STIR IT UP'' (telarc)
</P>
<P>
   Jamaican jazz pianist Alexander goes home with this rewarding
tribute to reggae legend Bob Marley. Using a six-piece Jamaican
rhythm section as well as his own four-piece jazz combo, Alexander
creates 13 songs that flow nicely between reggae and jazz grooves.
The results should please fans of both camps.
</P>
<P>
   Trombonist Steve Turre memorably solos on ``Running Away'' and
``I Shot the Sheriff,'' while Alexander nicely embellishes classic
Marley melodies on standards like ``Could You Be Loved'' and
``Jammin'.'' The pianist's imaginative playing (with wide-spanning
references that include George Gershwin and the Beatles) makes this
album more than a rote tribute. 3 stars

VARIOUS/``CUBA SI!: PURE CUBAN FLAVOR'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Mambo and cha-cha from Havana filled the world's dance floors 40
years ago. Here's a top-notch compilation of Afro-Cuban treats from
our least-favored neighbor nation, which has maintained a vibrant
and influential music scene despite economic and political woes.
</P>
<P>
   Featured are stalwarts such as Jesus Alemany's Cubanismo!, the
great Los Van Van and the always marvelous Cachao, but it also
spotlights more obscure offerings from up-and-comers in both Cuba
and the U.S. Excellent liner notes give a solid context for the
music, which never stops simmering. ``Cuba Si!'' indeed. 3 1/2

INSANE CLOWN POSSE/``THE AMAZING JECKEL BROTHERS'' (Island)
</P>
<P>
   Like pro wrestling, Marilyn Manson and the Jerky Boys, Detroit's
horror-rap duo Insane Clown Posse offer an empty, violent show
built for undiscriminating 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   On this ridiculous record, which naturally is selling like hot
cakes, the brothers under the big top spew all the usual foul rap
cliches while fellow entertainment geniuses Snoop Dogg and the
Jerky Boys join the good times. ``The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' is
so insipid it makes fellow Fun City native Eminem sound like
``Sketches of Spain.'' 1 stars

 &QL; 
KRUDER AND DORFMEISTER/``THE K&AMP;D SESSIONS'' (Stud!o K7)
</P>
<P>
   The German mixing and production team of Kruder and Dorfmeister
know how to spin an implacably cool groove and make it stretch
compellingly over two fat discs. A highlight of this slinky remix
collection, culled from an offbeat array of ambient, techno, rap
and other sources, is a spooky remake of Depeche Mode's
``Useless.'' This is all-night move and groove stuff _ smooth,
silky and sexy with a dangerous edge. Highly recommended. 3 1/2

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROBERT CRAY BAND/``TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF'' (Rykodisc)
</P>
<P>
   On his 11th album, urbane Bay Area bluesman Cray again tips his
hat to the revered Hi/Stax branch of Southern soul. The Al
Green-style ``Love Gone to Waste,'' boasting a sizzling Willie
Mitchell horn arrangement, is the favorite, while ``24-7 Man'' and
``It's All Gone'' replicate the formula down to a visit from the
Memphis Horns. Vocally, though, while Cray's heart is in the right
place, he's no O.V. Wright. 2 1/2 stars

FAITHFUL PILGRIMS TURN TO JERUSALEM AS THEY PREPARE FOR 2000 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, May 29-30) 
 
By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Blaine Schrag, a 61-year-old church bus driver from
Florida, swings his hoe at an archaeological dig near Nazareth,
voluntarily helping chip away centuries of debris and rubble to
uncover the village of Jesus' childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the working-class, mainly Muslim neighborhood of Bethany near
Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, Sister Sharon, a 53-year-old
grandmother from northern California, stacks giveaway clothing for
the poor as she awaits the Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the Rev. Ed Young of Second Baptist Church urges the
faithful of his affluent megachurch to worship and evangelize, even
though no one ``knows the day or hour'' Jesus will come back.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, the year 2000 is a magnet of fear and hope. Many
find themselves drawn to Israel to welcome the new millennium and
celebrate the anniversary of Jesus' birth.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 6 million tourists may come to the Holy Land next
year _ almost double the usual number. About 1.5 million of them
are identified as religious pilgrims. Texas Gov. George W. Bush
visited this year. Even the frail and ailing Pope John Paul II may
go for the first time next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most destinations, the millennium means the biggest New
Year's party in history. For us, it means playing host for a year
or more to a celebration of worldwide importance,'' says Arie
Sommer, Israel's tourism commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pilgrims, such as Schrag and Young, are mainstream
believers who see the trip as the opportunity of a Christian's
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But a visible minority, such as the Colorado group recently
expelled from the country, have a scarier vision. As many as 100
millennial Christians, who believe the end is drawing nigh, have
trickled in already. Believers predict more will come next year.
</P>
<P>
   Compounded by heavy tourism and a possible papal visit, the
presence of the millennialists promises even greater media
attention and monumental security risks for this nation of 6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, who uses no last name, came here on a one-way ticket
seven years ago, becoming a mainstay in the 30-member millennial
community known as the House of Prayer. She met the group's
gregarious leader and founder, Brother David, a week after
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's life and work focus on a pastoral village near the
Mount of Olives. Hot, dry and dusty, it is where many believe Jesus
began his journey on a donkey to Jerusalem for the first Palm
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where Jesus spent a lot of time,'' Sharon says.
``There were several miracles in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tiny apartment overlooks some of Christianity's most famous
landmarks. During Jesus' ministry in Jerusalem, he made his home in
Bethany. His friends Mary, Martha and their brother, Lazarus, lived
there. Tradition says Bethany is where Jesus went after his
resurrection to ascend to heaven, and many interpret Old Testament
prophecies to mean the Messiah will return to the Mount of Olives.
</P>
<P>
   David arrived in 1980. He believes it was God's will; he has no
passport. Members of their small group live in 14 houses and
apartments leased by the House of Prayer. Some apartments house
group members; others are leased to visiting pilgrims for $5 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   The timeless voice of the lion of Judah, an Old Testament
metaphor for God, roars in their ears, alerting them the end is
near, they say.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharon describes her ministry, a rooster crows outside her
apartment. A Muslim chants midday prayers to Allah. A baby cries.
Traffic roars by on a nearby thoroughfare. Yet she remains focused,
telling her story in a strong, quiet voice. She has grown used to
the city noise and the media attention. A Wednesday night House of
Prayer service drew three TV crews one night this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, whose easygoing nature and flowing reddish-brown hair
mask the strength of her convictions, became a Christian 30 years
ago. Biblical prophecies linked to Israel always fascinated her,
she says, but she didn't pursue her interest until the last of her
seven children left home. One of them, Brother Raymond, has moved
to Israel and joined the House of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever God has given me to do, I do,'' she says. ``I do all
of our communication, all our letter-writing. I write, by hand,
approximately 2,500 letters a year. I have about 80 families in the
area that I deliver clothes to. They're donated by pilgrims and a
couple of churches in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities keep a wary eye on end-time groups such as
the House of Prayer, but tourist dollars remain important in the
nation's economy. About 10 percent of Israel's gross national
product comes from tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the land where time began,'' trumpets Israeli tourism
in a $5 million U.S. national advertising blitz. Galilee.
Bethlehem. Nazareth. Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A direct-mail campaign, bolstered with ads in local U.S. papers
and radio stations, targets the nation's 60 million Roman Catholics
and 100 million evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's state airline, El Al, is offering a free stopover in
Rome, another pilgrimage city, en route to Jerusalem. This spring,
tourism officials courted travel agents in a campaign that included
an enormous dinner and trade show in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You love Shakespeare, go to England. You love Christianity, go
to Israel,'' advises Haim Gutin-Golan, director of Israel's
Southern U.S. tourism office.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel is drawing the fearful as well. Fundamentalists and
end-timers are among the most worried, anticipating widespread
disruption and panic in the wake of the Y2K computer bug that some
predict could shut down airlines, banks and other services at
midnight Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Other believers are preparing for Jesus' imminent return. Some
Americans are selling all their belongings, as Sharon did in 1992,
and buying one-way tickets to Israel to await the Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has laws protecting freedom of religious expression, but
authorities will not tolerate violent extremists, perhaps fearing
incidents like the one in 1969 when an Australian fundamentalist
Christian set fire to the El Aksa Mosque, seeking to replace it
with the predicted Third Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials avoid discussing security. But new police
sub-units have been set up in the Old City of Jerusalem. Concern
for pilgrims' safety is high, as is attention to major Christian
shrines, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, traditional site
of Jesus' tomb.
</P>
<P>
   At all costs, Israelis want to avoid the sort of standoff that
ensued in 1993 in Waco, Texas, between David Koresh's Branch
Davidian sect and agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   While people such as Brother David of the House of Prayer
technically may remain in Israel only as visitors, a few insist on
staying. The more belligerent risk being arrested and deported.
That is what happened this spring to 14 members of Concerned
Christians, a Colorado-based group. Authorities suspected the group
of planning dangerous activities to bring on the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should anyone be foolish enough to openly declare their
intentions and to gather in large numbers, I don't think the police
would hesitate to act decisively,'' says Rueven Hazan, a professor
of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials emphasize the lack of crime in Jerusalem,
and the nation's readiness to welcome visitors. They hope a tourism
boom will bring in 50,000 jobs. Projected income from tourism next
year could reach $5 billion. Millions have been spent repairing
roads, building hotels and increasing parking.
</P>
<P>
   Tzion Evrony of Houston, consul general for Israel's
southwestern region, says pilgrims may expect ``an unforgettable
cultural and spiritual'' visit.
</P>
<P>
   Others warn of long lines, water shortages and other problems.
One experienced Catholic tour guide in Jerusalem suggests that
pilgrims not come next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HISTORICALLY, the land that is Israel and its capital,
Jerusalem, played a key role in the world's three great
monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. God
brought Abraham here to become the father of many nations. Jesus,
born to Jewish parents in Bethlehem, ministered here. His
crucifixion and his followers' account of his resurrection spawned
a worldwide church. Muhammad, Islam's prophet, is believed to have
traveled to Jerusalem on a winged horse with the angel Gabriel.
From Jerusalem, he ascended to meet God.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Israel and Jerusalem are indelibly linked to millennial
hopes. Both have difficult, controversial histories laced with
high-minded ideals and mystical religious power, and burdened by
power struggles and blood baths.
</P>
<P>
   Fast, savvy and in many ways Americanized, Israel struggles to
bridge the religious and ethnic differences of its polyglot
culture. Created in 1948 in the aftermath of the Nazi Holocaust
that claimed 6 million lives, Israel brought together Jews from 102
countries speaking 74 languages. Compounding the stress and strain
of this cultural mix in the last 10 years has been the advent of
900,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union and 70,000 from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   That growth and the establishment of controversial Jewish
settlements on what some claim were formerly Palestinian lands
breed success and failure. Away from business and political centers
in Palestinian-controlled areas, people are poorer, roads rougher
and modern conveniences harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   But a new millennium brings hope even in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of church and interfaith leaders see this as a time for
rejoicing, bridge-building and peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 is a useful peg to assist us in focusing on why
we have the church at all,'' says the Rev. Maxwell Craig, head of
the Church of Scotland's Jerusalem office. ``The question I would
ask is: Why is God giving us a new millennium? The answer is to
build Christ's kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also calls for making peace. That calls for peace in
the Balkans, for peace in Northern Ireland. It calls for peace in
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the millennium is a complicated matter in Israel,
where politics often compete with prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, Palestinian Christians working with Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat hope to restore the village of Jesus' birth
with adequate hotel accommodations, water, parking and other
services in time for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns include offering enough access to the Church of the
Nativity, the traditional site of Jesus' birth. Entrance is
possible only through a low doorway, according to legend, designed
so that nonbelievers could not ride into the church on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, restoration in time for 2000 is still being heavily
promoted by Israel, despite local tensions between Muslims and
Christians. At issue is whether the town of Nazareth should build a
public plaza for millennial celebrations on a half-acre near the
famous Church of the Annunciation or devote that land to a huge
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   And the country is coming off a wrenching election that brought
a new prime minister to office.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural tensions plagued this region as long ago as the first
century. But for early Christians, these worries paled in the wake
of spiritual concerns. The Apostle Paul believed Jesus would come
back soon, and he warned Corinthians, Ephesians and other Christian
communities to settle their petty squabbles, forsake sinful
pleasures and live as though the risen Christ lived among them.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of 2000, many Christians around the world feel
the same urgency today.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Texas, the Rev. John Hagee of Cornerstone Church
challenges Christians to heed biblical prophecy, back Israel and
forsake the church's historical anti-Semitism. Raising Christians'
awareness that they are ``rapidly approaching the end of the
dispensation of grace is critical,'' says Hagee, who has led
regular pilgrimages to the Holy Land for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Such leaders as the pope, the Dalai Lama and the Rev. Billy
Graham long for such reconciliation as well. The pope has asked the
Jews for forgiveness. The Dalai Lama, esteemed among Tibetan
Buddhists, argues in his newest book that fewer poor people would
suffer if the world's better-off lived more responsibly. Graham,
famous for his global ministry, asserts that evangelism must change
with the times. He is inviting 10,000 evangelists from around the
world to a one-time conference in July 2000 in Amsterdam,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared 2000 a ``jubilee year,'' urging his
worldwide flock to prepare prayerfully. With the Archbishop of
Canterbury, titular head of the world's Anglicans, the pope is
asking the United States and the world's other richest nations to
forgive the staggering $200 billion debt of the globe's poorest
countries. A cross section of European nations, including Germany,
is endorsing similar moves, as have religious leaders from Sikhs in
India to Christians in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has even reinstituted ``indulgences,'' an ancient form
of church-granted amnesty that releases penitents from certain
forms of punishment in this life or the next. Medieval Catholicism
sold indulgences, a habit that led Martin Luther to protest,
spawning the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   The pope announced last year that, for the duration of the
millennium celebration, penitents who perform a charitable deed or
give up cigarettes or alcohol for a day can earn an ``indulgence,''
eliminating the time they must spend in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   In a distinctly modern development, embattled Middle Eastern
Christians of 19 denominations, minorities in a troubled region,
assisted the builders of Jesus2000.com, a Web site offering a
``virtual pilgrimage to the Holy Land.'' Once signed on, Christians
can send their prayers and blessings to Christian holy sites,
including Bethlehem and the Sea of Galilee, for a fee of $15 plus
$3 postage and handling.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes links to a ``mall'' that offers Holy Land
videos, books on decoding biblical prophecies and, for $39.95, a
gold-plated cross with crystals ``filled with Jordan River water
and Holy Land earth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WOVEN through the history, scriptures and traditions of
Christianity is the virtue of waiting. Waiting in prayer for God's
guidance. Waiting in the wilderness to make it to the promised
land.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, as today, millennialism sprang from the seed
of fear _ or hope _ of a great final battle between the Antichrist
and the Messiah. Prophets since Daniel in the Old Testament had
predicted a final accounting, an ultimate confrontation. The
Revelation of St. John, the final book in the New Testament,
explores that conflagration in glorious and often frightening
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Like their predecessors, the people drawn to today's Jerusalem
believe God calls them there. The journey is less taxing and
dangerous than 10 centuries ago. Earlier pilgrims had neither the
luxury of interfaith understanding nor the extravagant welcome
promised by Israeli tourism. But the goals of such pilgrimages are
similar.
</P>
<P>
   If there is such a thing as a ``millennial mentality,'' it mixes
optimism and pessimism. On the one hand is a real hope, a desire
for a new start, the promise of a better age. On the other is a
desperate fear that the end may come and one may not be ready.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, alternative spirituality gurus are
advertising millennial events in a spring issue of New Age
magazine. They are inviting their followers to Kaua'i, Hawaii, Dec.
21, 1999, through Jan. 2, 2000, to ``join kindred spirits as we
create a sacred celebration to bring in the new millennium in the
true spirit of aloha!''
</P>
<P>
   Televangelist Robert Schuller of Garden Grove, Calif., is
preparing for a grand millennial event. His ``Hour of Power'' show
will broadcast from Jerusalem on Christmas Eve, where he is asking
the faithful to join him on a tour.
</P>
<P>
   And Ed Young, pastor of Houston's Second Baptist Church, plans
to ring in the millennium with his wife, Jo Beth, and several
hundred members of his church on an eight-day trip to Israel. Young
has reserved Caiaphas' house, the home of the high priest who
helped convict Jesus, in Jerusalem for a special service Dec. 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a spiritual standpoint, I think the whole world revolves
around Jerusalem,'' Young says. ``It is an international city, full
of people of every nationality, every creed, every religion. It's
sort of a melting pot. As a Christian, it's home for me. Everyone
wants to go home at Christmas. I'd like to be `home' in Jerusalem
for this date.''
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentalist Christians view the coming days as a time of
battle. Most believe genuine Christians will be ``raptured,''
literally vanishing from their posts in offices, fields and
factories, being taken to heaven by Jesus Christ. Those left on
Earth will suffer through ``the tribulation,'' seven years of wars,
social and political chaos, a devastating earthquake and the
miserable rule of the Antichrist. After the battle of Armageddon,
when Jesus and the angels defeat Satan's minions, Christ will
return to reign for 1,000 years, presiding over a glorious age of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   So ingrained in Christian consciousness is this chain of events
that fictional books depicting such an apocalypse have become
best-sellers. Sales of the ``Left Behind'' series, by Tim LaHaye
and Jerry B. Jenkins, have been robust. Even secular readers are
snapping them up, along with many end-times novels being published.
Others have been written by big Christian names such as television
broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe apocalyptic traditions need to be taken very
seriously, but not literally,'' says Bernard McGinn, a University
of Chicago historian and one of the editors for the three-volume
Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism. ``These symbols are important in
our culture and are ways of understanding our past.''
</P>
<P>
   Human beings mark time in anniversaries, birthdays, New Year's
Eve parties and Fourth of July barbecues. And, notes McGinn, ``We
observe the end of centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is especially important at the end of the millennium,''
he says. ``One in three generations see the end of a century. But
only one in 33 see the end of a millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   At such moments, humanity looks backward and forward. Some
entertain the possibility of miracles; others see clouds of doom.
In truth, commemorating Jesus' birth at 2000 celebrates an
inaccurate date. Experts believe he was born between 4 B.C. and 1
B.C., depending upon how one dates the rule of Herod the Great.
</P>
<P>
   So Jesus wasn't born in the year 1, but before. And the new
millennium doesn't begin until 2001 because there is no zero in the
Christian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't deter the millennialists converging on Jerusalem,
or people who plan to celebrate in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though many people know rationally that the year 2000 is
arbitrary in terms of when the actual millennium should be
celebrated, it becomes a convenient hook on which to hang all the
anxiety, all the fear, all the hope and all the speculation,'' says
Diane Winston, of New York University's Center for Media, Culture
and History.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Christians have looked to Israel for spiritual
sustenance. This is the Holy Land to Jesus' worldwide flock of 2
billion. They want to walk where Jesus walked.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the number of Christians living in the Holy Land _
many of them Palestinian or Arab _ continues to decline. An
estimated 52 percent of the population of the Old City of Jerusalem
was Christian in 1922; today, Christians make up only 2.5 percent.
Thousands of Palestinian Christians emigrated following the
withdrawal of British troops from the region in 1948 and the
founding of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the reference in the Psalms to the `peace of
Jerusalem,' the Holy City has probably seen more rapine and
pillage, more regularly, than any comparable patch of ground on the
planet,'' says Scottish travel writer William Dalrymple.
</P>
<P>
   Politics are secondary concerns to most pilgrims. Pain, hope and
a desire for renewal bring them to the Holy Land. Here,
Christianity is in evidence from the stark watchtowers of Mar Saba
monastery in the wilderness of Judea to the quiet confines of the
Garden Tomb, outside the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions, Blaine Schrag came to Israel for spiritual
renewal. He retired as an accountant and general contractor after
being diagnosed with bone cancer in 1991. Since then, the lanky,
blue-eyed Floridian has put his energy where his faith lies _ in
doing for others.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Schrag raised $50,000 for a housing ministry by
riding his bicycle from Pensacola, Fla., to San Diego, Calif. This
spring, he paid $2,000 to volunteer with a Gulf Breeze, Fla.,
church group that went to Israel to work in Nazareth Village.
Located on a grassy knoll in the shadow of Nazareth Hospital, the
village is a multiyear restoration of 20 acres. Experts say the
land may be the same ground farmed by Jesus and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Underwritten by the Miracle of Nazareth Foundation, the project
is an interdenominational effort to resurrect the town where Jesus
grew up. Archaeologists are working with volunteers, clearing
trash, digging for artifacts and planting vineyards and olive
groves. They hope to open a model village by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors would take ``a parable walk,'' based on one of Jesus'
famous stories, and interact with village workers in First Century
attire and character.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth Village director Mike Hostetler compares the concept to
Colonial Williamsburg. The project, to develop in stages, is the
dream of Dr. Nakhle Bishara, an Arab Christian and ninth-generation
Nazarene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where people once saw dusty stones and open meadows, we hope
they'll now see the mustard plants, vineyards and olive trees of
Jesus' childhood that he used to illustrate spiritual truth,'' says
Bishara, medical director of Nazareth Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For Schrag, digging in Nazareth is like his cross-country bike
trip: a way to fight pain, fatigue and depression. In the winter,
he drives truckloads of clothing and blankets to needy Indians in
South Dakota. He has served on church boards, worked with the men's
club, built houses with Habitat for Humanity. All his life, the
church has been a path to ways to live as Jesus lived. That matters
more than ever now.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Israel in May, he helped put up two terrace walls
in Nazareth Village and planted a vineyard. Looking out over the
craggy hillside, he has a distant look in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is spiritually uplifting,'' he says. ``After a
couple of days, I forgot my pain. Just knowing that Jesus walked
through that land is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're here, you feel it.''

JURY RULES IN FAVOR OF COP WHO PROTESTED POLICE POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal jury has awarded $500,000 to an officer
who said his patrol unit was told to harass surly-looking
teen-agers and soiled derelicts lingering around the downtown
tourist area.
</P>
<P>
   After some eight hours of deliberations on Wednesday, seven
jurors found that Police Department officials retaliated against
Officer Onofre Serna for protesting the heavy-handed tactics that
the Downtown Foot and Bicycle Patrol was encouraged to use in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Serna was transferred to overnight squad-car duty in 1996 after
an internal inquiry into the downtown unit described the officer as
``disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the nine-day trial, Serna sat subdued as U.S.
District Judge Edward C. Prado read aloud the verdict, which was
less than half the compensation and damages the police officer had
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Once the court adjourned, Serna said spotlighting police abuses
was as important as the $500,000 award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's still going on right now, to this day,'' he
said. ``I believe it has a long way to go before it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers on both sides, however, testified that the department's
problems in the downtown tourist district diminished with the
transfer of Serna and several other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Al Philippus said the city may appeal the verdict.
Philippus insisted, as he did on the witness stand, that the
department never targeted anyone based on income, race or any other
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We target problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found that Philippus, who was named as a separate
defendant, didn't maliciously single out Serna when he approved a
recommendation to transfer five officers and supervisors from the
downtown beat.
</P>
<P>
   Serna filed the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court saying that
the Police Department retaliated against him because he objected to
the orders. He also contended that the transfer violated his civil
rights and laws protecting whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other officers who were transferred then have filed similar
lawsuits against the city. One is slated for trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   Because the jury's verdict focused on Serna's retaliation, it
did little to answer clearly the question that dominated testimony:
Were officers told to snatch bandannas and other gang-related
regalia, to demand identification from patrons in certain bars, and
to drive homeless people from the heart of San Antonio, with or
without provocation?
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trial, eight officers asserted that the patrol
supervisor encouraged illegal searches and seizures and other
heavy-handed methods aimed at keeping the downtown
tourist-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other officers said the complaints originated from
disgruntled officers who resented their strong-willed supervisor
and twisted his words against him.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Mery, the lawyer representing Serna, said the police
policies or targeting certain people put civil liberties were at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When has the freedom to walk the streets of San Antonio become
an issue you can call a petty squabble?'' he asked the jurors.

   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GACHET-FORGERY (Undated) _ Western attitudes to forgery have
changed over the centuries. In the 16th century, Vasari admired
Michelangelo for faking antiquities. The most famous forger in this
century, Hans Van Meegeren, went to jail for painting fake
Vermeers. Fakery thrives when people are beginning to understand an
art that they therefore prize unquestioningly, a situation akin to
new love. History being full of odd coincidences, it happens that
Van Meegeren was born right around the time when Van Gogh was
moving to a village called Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he
was to be under the care of a homeopathic physician, art collector
and amateur painter named Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. I mention Van
Meegeren because the Gachet legacy, which is the subject of a new
exhibition at the Met, ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Dr.
Gachet,'' for decades has been vexed by questions of deception and
fakery. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   IMPRESSIONISTS-WINTER (New York) _ Think of the Impressionists
and chances are you think green (or possibly pink, or lavender, or
bluebird-blue in the case of Monet). They were painters of lawns,
hedges, and fertile fields, of a deciduous nature caught at full
leaf. But like artists anywhere with rents to pay and mouths to
feed, they were year-round workers. And inevitably winter
landscapes, rendered in the frosty open air or through the glass of
a studio window, figured in their repertoire. ``Impressionists in
Winter: Effects de Neige,'' which opens Friday at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, brings together some 60 such paintings. And if ever
a show were tailor-made for summer viewing, this one is. By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS (Undated) _ During rehearsals for ``I Married an
Angel,'' a 1938 musical comedy about a Hungarian banker, the show's
lyricist, Lorenz Hart, a quick-witted master of the last-minute
fix, decided to add a new number called ``At the Roxy Music Hall.''
When Joshua Logan, the director, asked anxiously how a number
filled with allusions to contemporary New York personalities could
possibly be made to fit into a comedy set in old Budapest, Hart
answered airily: ``Well, just bring up the subject of New York. You
can't sing about Budapest all night. We've got to give people a
little fun.'' To Hart's mind, no musical comedy, whatever its
putative locale, could be inhospitable to a mention of New York.
Dependent on a lavish flow of cash and illusion, too loud and
fast-moving for introspection or tragic denouements, the city is
not only the birthplace of the musical comedy form but also its
primary exemplar. By Ann Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-NY (New York) _ Let's say you have no functional knowledge
of jazz. You've heard that its history can teach you something
about the evolution of American culture. You've heard that its
range of expression _ from rhythms based in Afro-Caribbean models
to harmony and structure grounded in 20th-century European music,
from intellectualism to dance bands to the art/pop fusions in
between _ is unparalleled in other contemporary music. You're
intrigued. Since Jazz is a performance medium, albums are a shadow
world of the real thing. So you should go out in New York during
June. You'll see how the music is made; you'll grasp the
personalities behind the art. You will catch the plot much faster.

 &HT;    BILL WOULD GIVE EMPLOYERS A TAX CREDIT FOR CHILD CARE
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing in a playground at a federal office
building Thursday, a pair of senators unveiled legislation making
it easier for businesses to offer on-site child care for their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many businesses are trapped,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
``They understand that companies who help employees with child care
enjoy a significant competitive advantage, but they can't afford to
provide that care.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was joined by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, to
announce a bill that would give businesses a federal tax credit for
providing on-site child care for employees.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, estimated to cost the federal government $800 million
over five years, would give employers a 50 percent credit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to $100,000, for start-up costs of an on-site facility,
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to $25,000 annually, for operating costs of the facility,
and
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to $50,000 each year for employers who help pay for child
care outside the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   As the work force has changed over the past several decades, the
need for child care has increased, Graham said. In 1947, nearly
one-fourth of all mothers with children between 6 and 17 were part
of the labor force. Currently, two-thirds of all women with
children under 18 are in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill puts families first,'' Hutchison said. ``For
two-parent families working to make ends meet, and for the many
parents who are unable to find affordable day care, it offers
incentives to employers to set up on-site child care.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Hutchison expect the legislation to be included as
part of a tax reduction bill that will be considered later this
summer.

   GACHET-FORGERY (Undated) _ Western attitudes to forgery have
changed over the centuries. In the 16th century, Vasari admired
Michelangelo for faking antiquities. The most famous forger in this
century, Hans Van Meegeren, went to jail for painting fake
Vermeers. Fakery thrives when people are beginning to understand an
art that they therefore prize unquestioningly, a situation akin to
new love. History being full of odd coincidences, it happens that
Van Meegeren was born right around the time when Van Gogh was
moving to a village called Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he
was to be under the care of a homeopathic physician, art collector
and amateur painter named Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. I mention Van
Meegeren because the Gachet legacy, which is the subject of a new
exhibition at the Met, ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Dr.
Gachet,'' for decades has been vexed by questions of deception and
fakery. By Michael Kimmelman.

   IMPRESSIONISTS-WINTER (New York) _ Think of the Impressionists
and chances are you think green (or possibly pink, or lavender, or
bluebird-blue in the case of Monet). They were painters of lawns,
hedges, and fertile fields, of a deciduous nature caught at full
leaf. But like artists anywhere with rents to pay and mouths to
feed, they were year-round workers. And inevitably winter
landscapes, rendered in the frosty open air or through the glass of
a studio window, figured in their repertoire. ``Impressionists in
Winter: Effects de Neige,'' which opens Friday at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, brings together some 60 such paintings. And if ever
a show were tailor-made for summer viewing, this one is. By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS (Undated) _ During rehearsals for ``I Married an
Angel,'' a 1938 musical comedy about a Hungarian banker, the show's
lyricist, Lorenz Hart, a quick-witted master of the last-minute
fix, decided to add a new number called ``At the Roxy Music Hall.''
When Joshua Logan, the director, asked anxiously how a number
filled with allusions to contemporary New York personalities could
possibly be made to fit into a comedy set in old Budapest, Hart
answered airily: ``Well, just bring up the subject of New York. You
can't sing about Budapest all night. We've got to give people a
little fun.'' To Hart's mind, no musical comedy, whatever its
putative locale, could be inhospitable to a mention of New York.
Dependent on a lavish flow of cash and illusion, too loud and
fast-moving for introspection or tragic denouements, the city is
not only the birthplace of the musical comedy form but also its
primary exemplar. By Ann Douglas.

   JAZZ-NY (New York) _ Let's say you have no functional knowledge
of jazz. You've heard that its history can teach you something
about the evolution of American culture. You've heard that its
range of expression _ from rhythms based in Afro-Caribbean models
to harmony and structure grounded in 20th-century European music,
from intellectualism to dance bands to the art/pop fusions in
between _ is unparalleled in other contemporary music. You're
intrigued. Since Jazz is a performance medium, albums are a shadow
world of the real thing. So you should go out in New York during
June. You'll see how the music is made; you'll grasp the
personalities behind the art. You will catch the plot much faster.

`NOTTING HILL': LOOKING FOR A BOOK AND FINDING A MAN'` 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most romantic notion in ``Notting Hill'' is that a Hollywood
star of Julia Roberts' wattage would be out alone browsing for a
book. That's what Ms. Roberts' Anna Scott is doing when she notices
that the store's bashful proprietor is actually the most
camera-ready sight on Portobello Road in London. So Anna takes a
shine to Hugh Grant's William Thacker (a character perhaps named by
a bookseller in a hurry), and ``Notting Hill'' throws together two
beaming if oddly matched leads. The movie has lots of glossy charm
even if Ms. Roberts and Grant seem less like lovers than members of
a support group for the desperately attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The pedigree of ``Notting Hill'' promises intelligent panache.
Directed by Roger Michell, whose ``Persuasion'' was the best of the
Jane Austen cycle, it reunites Grant with Richard Curtis, the
writer whose smart, sidelong witticisms are so well suited to the
actor's artful bumbling. Curtis reworks his ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral'' to create another hapless dreamboat for Grant to play,
another band of eccentric friends and another impossible crush to
keep him charmingly flummoxed. To this, ``Notting Hill'' adds the
been-there, done-that knowingness of two stars who can play a story
about the outrages of celebrity without a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   According to the screenplay, it is Anna who is extremely famous.
And it is William who has been in the bookstore long enough to
think Leonardo DiCaprio might be the name of an Italian director.
(As in ``You've Got Mail,'' the picturesque neighborhood bookstore
is presented as that oasis of gentility, the pop-culture-free
zone.) But both Ms. Roberts and Grant rise to the chance to
satirize the woes of international notoriety. If these two can't
create an illusion of mad ardor, they do something almost sexier:
confide in the audience about the burdens of answering
interviewers' idiotic questions, embarrassing tabloid headlines and
other occupational hazards of being a great-looking star.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, both actors obviously enjoy a sequence in which
William gets trapped at a press junket for Anna's apparently
terrible new film, which he hasn't seen. He is forced to
impersonate a reporter from the first publication he catches a
glimpse of, Horse and Hound. And he is able to parrot the same
kinds of questions that really get asked under such circumstances.
(``Did you enjoy making the film? Any bit in particular?'') After
squirming his way through this with a delightfully funny deadpan,
William solemnly tells Anna: ``Thank you. You are Horse and Hound's
favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts is conspicuously dressed in a man's suit and necktie
during this sequence, for her role is that of a power player, not a
blushing ingenue. The film makes her a strong-minded movie queen
well aware of her ability to call the shots. It's she who sizes up
William appraisingly, and it's she who makes the first move; it's
he who looks a little alarmed during that first clinch. It's also
she who has a stellar personality that she can turn on or abandon
at will. This role gives Ms. Roberts a lovely opportunity to poke
fun at her own situation, even if it also supposes that a famous
star would like nothing better than the chance to smile wordlessly
at a dinner party full of ordinary people. Unfortunately, it also
saddles her with: ``The fame thing isn't real, you know. And don't
forget: I'm also just a girl. Standing in front of a boy. Asking
him to love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, ``Notting Hill'' doesn't often strain that hard. Nor
does it force its funny supporting cast into the annoying
ubiquitousness that would have given it a sitcom flavor. Popping up
just often enough to steal much of the movie is Rhys Ifans (who
played a much more conventional role in ``Dancing at Lughnasa'') as
William's disaster of a roommate. A close-knit gang of William's
chums is colorfully played by Gina McKee, Tim McInnerny and Hugh
Bonneville (as the yuppie who says to Anna, ``I'm active in the
stock market myself, so. ... really similar fields.'') Emma
Chambers plays William's giddy sister, the kind of fan who has
never met Anna before but just knows they could be best friends.
And in a brief, hilarious cameo, Alec Baldwin plays Anna's
Hollywood boyfriend and makes it oh so clear why Notting Hill looks
great by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Notting Hill'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes jokey profanity and one brief, very
strained bedroom scene.

`ETERNITY AND A DAY': THE TOPOGRAPHY OF ONE MAN'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Eternity and a Day'' won an overdue Palme d'Or at last year's
Cannes International Film Festival for the Greek director Theo
Angelopoulos, whose style of drifting metaphysical reverie is at
its most accessible here.
</P>
<P>
   All things being relative, this is a dreamy, lulling film but
also a more concise and straightforward one than the magnificently
grandiose ``Ulysses' Gaze,'' the Angelopoulos opus that directly
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eternity and a Day'' is simpler, the haunting poetic
valedictory of an artist whose memory leads him across the
landscape of his life during his last day on earth.
</P>
<P>
   This filmmaker's eloquent, abstract, trance-inducing work so
eschews the mundane that it can barely be watched in any earthbound
way. So at the screening I attended, a man who had shown signs of
vigor as he entered the theater began conspicuously fighting sleep
as the film got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Take that as an indication of the film's method, not its merit:
Angelopoulos' meditation on the meaning of one man's life is
genuinely hypnotic in its way of transcending ordinary narrative.
The camera casts a spell as it wanders gravely through the central
character's most essential thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The main role in ``Eternity and a Day,'' that of a soulful,
weary pilgrim named Alexandre who has deep ambivalence about his
past, was meant to be played by Marcello Mastroianni, who grew too
ill to undertake the film. Instead, it is played by Bruno Ganz, who
gives it a palpable sense of the weight of this man's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Language is so secondary to image and memory here that it makes
little difference to learn that Ganz's performance was delivered in
German and dubbed into Greek. He brings the quiet authority of a
man patiently, fearlessly searching for his life's final meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Angelopoulos erases all temporal and spatial
boundaries as Alexandre roams through the film. His long-dead wife
appears as a young woman; she is about the same age as Alexandre's
grown daughter, who has just decided to sell his family's ancestral
home where so many of Alexandre's most primal experiences occurred.
</P>
<P>
   His mother is both a fading wraith and a strong voice speaking
to Alexandre in his boyhood. His work as a writer remains
unfinished, just as his links to loved ones now seem incomplete,
yet Ganz projects the character's deep acceptance of what he has
done and been. In the course of his wanderings, he is joined at
times by a young Albanian boy whose more political exile mirrors
Alexandre's spiritual condition.
</P>
<P>
   Figures appear unexpectedly in the light gray mist that cloaks
part of the film, or at the seaside where its more joyous, distant
memories come to life. Like Ingmar Bergman, whose sense of an
intricately interwoven present and past is echoed in such a fluid,
liberating way here, Angelopoulos gradually turns the whole of his
protagonist's life into something far greater than the sum of its
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Alexandre is ready to ask, ``Tell me, how long does
tomorrow last?'' And the filmmaker is ready to conjure one last
transcendently beautiful image of love and farewell.
</P>

`THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE': 15 MINUTES (COUNT 'EM) OF INFAMY

<P>
   The abysmal state of comedy glares with all the subtlety of a
mandrill's rump off any screen unfortunate enough to display ``The
Underground Comedy Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of sketches built around subjects like masturbation,
defecation, alienation, urination, necrophilia, voyeurism, casual
brutality and mockery of the unfortunate, this exercise in arrested
adolescence comes with the subtitle ``guaranteed to offend.''
</P>
<P>
   It does, but not because of its utter tastelessness.
Tastelessness and funniness need not be incompatible. But Vince
Offer, who accepts responsibility for this wretched film by
arrogating the writer's and director's credits, makes the common
mistake of equating the recognition of comic potential for comedy
itself. For the successful, talent bridges the gap, but here it is
absent.
</P>
<P>
   As a typical result, ``The Godmother,'' a dismal attempt at
parody of ``The Godfather,'' goes nowhere, especially in the
moments when Joey Buttafuoco, better known for his off-screen
sexual exploits, tries to make something of an endless exchange
involving milk and cookies for a guest of the don.
</P>
<P>
   Buttafuoco's presence in ``The Underground Comedy Movie'' gives
some indication of the heights of stardom and thespian prowess to
which the film aspires, although Karen Black, who has known far
better times, also lends herself to this sorry enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Underground Comedy Movie'' stands as a monument to
ineptitude and self-delusion.

Udall, who has staunchly defended the airstrikes in the past, and

   A Record on Attendance
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Friday or Saturday, a Broadway ticket taker will rip
someone's ticket and set a record.
</P>
<P>
   With that ticket, Broadway attendance will top last year's
record 11.5 million. The record for yearly box office is already
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the week the total attendance figure for the
year was 11,406,930, according to the League of American Theaters
and Producers, with weekly attendance averaging about 250,000. That
means that by Sunday, the final day of Broadway's fiscal year, the
old record should be shattered.
</P>
<P>
   As for money, last Sunday the yearly box office figure stood at
$575,468,742, already $17 million more than last year's record.
With a weekly average of about $12 million, the league estimates
that the total yearly take will be $588 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, president of the league, said the attendance
figures were especially encouraging because of the large number of
straight plays in smaller houses on Broadway this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another barometer of the strength of a type of live
theater that maybe wasn't that strong four or five years ago,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy industrywide news, not everybody is smiling.
Five shows played to less than half-capacity last week. ``Ring
Round the Moon,'' produced by the nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater,
is a limited run; but the four others _ ``Side Man,'' ``The
Lonesome West,'' ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' and ``The
Civil War'' _ are open-ended commercial runs, and their numbers
were distressing.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive of the bunch is ``The Civil War,'' which cost
$7 million to produce, and which lost about $130,000 last week.
</P>
<P>
   An agent connected to the show said its producers were looking
for a ``name'' country-and-western singer like LeAnn Rimes or Amy
Grant as a possible replacement for a departing cast member, Irene
Molloy. Norman Zagier, spokesman for the show, said he could not
comment on any potential casting. ``The producers are working
assiduously to market the show,'' Zagier said, ``to the widest
possible audience.''
</P>
<P>
   `Riverdance' Redux
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical trend spotters, consider this: The first musical
project of Broadway's next century will likely be ``Riverdance.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya Doherty, the producer of the enormously successful Irish
dance spectacle, said this week that the production had signed a
deal to play the Gershwin Theater, Broadway's largest, with
performances beginning in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-member company will be made up of dancers in the
production's three touring companies, which have been raking in a
hefty profit. Ms. Doherty said the production would probably be
open-ended, though it would probably be initially offered for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement's significance can be read in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, ``Riverdance'' offers another example of
producers aiming for a tourist audience with a show that needs
little English or highbrow theatrical savvy to enjoy. Shows from
``Cats'' to ``Footloose'' have employed this tourist-friendly
formula, and Ms. Doherty said that out-of-towners were expected to
be a large part of the ``Riverdance'' crowd. Its international
appeal has been proved, Ms. Doherty said, by successful runs across
Europe and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   The booking could potentially take the Gershwin out of the mix
for an extended period just as many producers are complaining about
the lack of large musical houses. Until this month, the
Nederlanders had offered the theater for a fall revival of ``The
Music Man,'' to be produced by Dodger Theatricals, but that show
has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Riverdance'' may work in a theater that has
bedeviled many productions before it. The theater's large size,
1,935 seats, has always challenged commercial producers. ``On the
Town'' lost $6 million last fall; before that ``1776'' fared better
but it did not make a profit. ``Peter Pan,'' its current tenant, is
doing fair business now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Riverdance'' may well break that streak. Since first
arriving in North America in 1996, ``Riverdance'' has toured
worldwide and maintained remarkable box office figures. According
to a report published in Variety, the show's two North American
companies had combined gross sales of nearly $2 million for the
week ending May 16, leading all other road companies.
</P>
<P>
   Luck of the Irish
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Brian F. O'Byrne has had a charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   An Irish native who took up acting in college, O'Byrne came to
the United States in 1988 after inadvertently winning a green card
in an immigration lottery; his uncle had entered his name without
telling him. After arriving, he said, he got his first professional
acting job because the director's brother was married to O'Byrne's
aunt. Several years later another twist of fate earned him a part
in the play ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' by Martin McDonagh,
after an actor dropped out because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``I've made no decisions about
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his role in ``Beauty Queen'' earned him a Tony
nomination for featured actor. And this year O'Byrne, 32, has just
earned another nomination, this time for leading actor in a play,
for his performance as a brawling rustic in McDonagh's ``Lonesome
West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hilarious,'' O'Byrne said, laughing, ``to be
included at the end of that list.'' The other nominees include
Kevin Spacey and Brian Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has a clue who I am,'' O'Byrne said. ``They always kind
of mumble out my name.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he think of his chances? O'Byrne broke into a big
smile, and said, mock seriously: ``I'm lobbying very hard. I've
secured two votes. Both took weeks of drinking to secure, but they
finally came around.''
</P>
<P>
   In true seriousness, O'Byrne said he was honored, if a little in
awe of his luck. So, what will he do next?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the master plan,'' he said. ``And I have no
idea.' &QL;

`TWICE UPON A YESTERDAY': A DAYDREAM OR A CHANCE, WITH ECHOES OF
BUNUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, for the chance to go back and relive the past and not make
the same mistake twice. How sweetly tormenting such a fantasy can
be when applied to love. If only, if only, if only.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the movies it's possible to go back and imagine
getting it right the second time. Or is it? That's the teasing
question that's skillfully drawn out in ``Twice Upon a Yesterday,''
a Spanish film made in London with a mostly British cast.
</P>
<P>
   Toying with romantic possibility in somewhat the same way as
``Sliding Doors,'' ``Twice Upon a Yesterday,'' which opens Friday
in New York City, is far less symmetrical than its forerunner and
lacks the star power of Gwyneth Paltrow. But it is a more
psychologically penetrating exploration of the
grass-is-always-greener syndrome and other pitfalls of the romantic
life. Think of the movie as ``Sliding Doors'' darkened with a swirl
of Alan Rudolph's moody introspection.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky man who is given a romantic second chance is Victor
Bukowski (Douglas Henshall), a struggling actor whose live-in
girlfriend Sylvia Weld (Lena Headey) leaves him after he confesses
to having had an affair. As played by Henshall, Victor suggests a
younger, better-looking Dudley Moore in one of his libidinous,
tippling buffoon roles.
</P>
<P>
   The man Sylvia leaves Victor to marry, Dave Summers (Mark
Strong) is a tall-dark-handsome environmentalist who has everything
going for him except the goofy, vulnerable charm that Victor
effuses in hysterical gushes.
</P>
<P>
   Once he's been abandoned, Victor mopes around London, literally
crying in his beer. He finds an especially sympathetic ear in Diane
(Elizabeth McGovern), a redheaded barmaid who exudes a supernatural
empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after meeting her, he is discovered in the trash by two
jovial sanitation workers who may be the reincarnated Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza. The pair escort Victor to a garbage dump, where
they whirl him around until he is magically transported back into
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Reliving the same scene in which he confessed to Sylvia, Victor
lies about the affair and smothers his beloved with avowals of
eternal devotion. She seems pleased, if a little bewildered, by his
sudden enthusiasm. Their future seems rosier when Victor succeeds
in preventing Sylvia from visiting the gym where she first met
Dave.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so easy. And Dave enters Sylvia's life on the arm
of her best friend. Now that Victor has reformed and become
everything Sylvia wanted him to be, the lovers will live happily
ever after, right? Wrong. Sylvia still succumbs to Dave's charms
and the two begin a clandestine affair. And then what happens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' is a bit like retracing your steps
backward through a maze. Eventually you get so confused that you
find yourself lost in a strange new place. Revisiting the bar where
he met Diane, Victor finds her predecessor, a beautiful Spanish
woman, Louise (Penelope Cruz), and the two begin a passionate
affair. Meanwhile, Sylvia realizes there's something missing in her
relationship with Dave.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Maria Ripoll from a screenplay by Rafa
Russo, has a surreal undertone that suggests a pop echo of Luis
Bunuel. As its story branches out, the possibility of Victor's
retracing his steps once again seems increasingly remote.
</P>
<P>
   As the characters create a different future from the one they
lived before, the movie begins to lose its narrative grip and to
feel like a meandering daydream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' is far too cagey to tell us if this
alternate history is a dream. If it is, it is one from which Victor
never awakens. In the movie's happy-sad ending, Don Quixote and
Sancho Panza reappear in time to whirl another tear-stained loser
in love into a world of second chances.
</P>
<P>

   WASHINGTON _ In the personal ways that matter on Capitol Hill,
the ``two Bills'' have already been approved by Congress, before
any votes have been cast on legislation to fund their populist
views of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ivey, chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts, has
chatted about country music with Rep. Dick Armey of Texas and Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina _ conservative Republicans who tried
to abolish his agency in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ferris, the chairman of the National Endowment of the
Humanities, has turned a Mississippi drawl into a political asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the leadership on both sides of the aisle are
Southerners,'' said Ferris. ``There is a deep bond that Southerners
have. It's kind of a tribal world in that they like to see their
own do well _ whether it's a professional football player, a
musician or a political figure.''
</P>
<P>
   But along with soft-spoken charm, the ``two Bills'' have brought
substantiative change to endangered agencies. Under orders from a
hostile Congress, they broadened their agencies' notion of culture
to touch more Americans, and tightened controls to prevent federal
grants for controversial works like Robert Mapplethorpe's
homoerotic photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Ferris and Bill Ivey have renewed each agency's
commitment to serving the American people in a way that recognizes
and respects the wealth of culture that exists in every
community,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which has
oversight over the NEA and NEH.
</P>
<P>
   One result: After suffering budget cuts for several years while
fighting for their very survival, the agencies may actually receive
an increase in funding this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had unanimous commitment to increases from all of the
congressional leaders with whom we have been speaking,'' said
Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has requested $150 million for each
agency for the fiscal year 2000 _ a sizeable increase over the $98
million NEA budget and the $110 million NEH budget for FY 1999. The
budgets of both endowments were slashed by over one-third four
years ago and have remained at around $100 million apiece since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing education and community projects, the two Bills have
changed the perception that the endowments are elitist and the fact
that grants were skewed toward cultural centers like New York and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional reaction has been heartening, said a staffer on
Jeffords' committee. He recalled how committee member Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., almost came over the dias in outrage after
former NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander implied that Arkansas didn't
get a proportional share of grants because the state lacked worthy
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The new chairmen have the endowments ``moving in the right
direction,'' said Hutchinson. ``I'm pleased with their progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   A sense of place is important in folklore, and both Bills are
folklorists. Their place in Washington is the Old Post Office
Pavilion, a handsome building with a clock tower on Pennsylvania
Avenue. Built in 1899 as a headquarters for the U.S. Post Office,
it was nearly demolished during the Great Depression but renovated
in the early 1980s into a center for private shops and restaurants
and for federal offices. It serves as headquarters for the NEA and
NEH.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent 27 years as director of the Country Music
Foundation in Nashville, Ivey is not a native Southerner. He grew
up in a copper mining community in upper Michigan. On his
conference table, he keeps a wooden form used to make a cast iron
pipe fitting for a mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me back to my days in high school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On his desk is a small sculpture of a young Bing Crosby at a
recording session. Created as part of an exhibit for the Country
Music Hall of Fame, it was left over when Bing was replaced by a
figure of Ernest Tubb. On his wall are photos of Minnie Pearl and
the Ryman Auditorium from a 1946 Life magazine piece on the Grand
Ol' Opry.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable number of country music fans have votes in
Congress, said Ivey, who was confirmed as NEA chairman a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   His background ``provides me with a basis for conversation with
many members,'' he said. ``It also grounds me in a grassroots
American arts form that is based in middle America and is connected
with America's folk art heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his definition of the arts, he explained that defining
is not what his job is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of things agency tries to do, perhaps its primary goal, is
to help communities and organizations and citizens realize their
dreams through the arts,'' said Ivey. ``We spend a lot of time
supporting what other people think is art, not trying to impose
what we think is art.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ivey, Ferris has a spacious office with high ceilings. The
NEH is located on the fifth floor, two above the NEA. Ferris has
been chairman for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   An antique electric fan stirs the air. Behind his desk is a
painting of dirty dishes in a sink _ the work of a former student
at Ole Miss. There is artwork by his daughter when she was 4 years
old and a painting by his sister of the farm where they grew up.
There are photos of Eudora Welty, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Alice Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring your family with you'' with such mementos, he
explained. ``Paintings and plants kind of give you a feeling that
you're building your little nest here.''
</P>
<P>
   The former director of the Center for the Study of Southern
Culture at the University of Mississippi, Ferris believes his job
now is not about some ``distant kind of ivory tower kind of
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I define the humanities as the many voices that we hear.
Voices over the dinner table at night, of parents and grandparents.
Voices from the past: Plato. Shakespeare. The great history of
literature, philosophy, music. Our American voices: Abraham
Lincoln, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, William Faulkner,
Herman Melville, Robert Frost,'' said Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all voices in our ear _ some of which we discover in
classrooms and the media, some of which we listen to daily. Those
are all a part of the sound that helps us have a richer and fuller
and more secure life.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from Congress, Ivey has changed the NEA. Grants to
individual visual artists were abolished, as were seasonal grants.
Geographic distribution is now considered in making grants. There
are special grants for states and communities that have been
slighted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The changes ``basically put us in the position of knowing in
advance what funds will be spent on,'' Ivey said. ``There is less
uncertainty about what outcomes will be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey moved quickly to tamp out the only controversy during his
tenure _ a $7,500 grant earmarked for the Texas publisher of a
bilingual children's book. The author turned out to be
Subcomandante Marcos, the leader of the Zapatista guerrilla
movement in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have subjected the agency to criticism had the grant
been made,'' he said, recalling that he received ``phone calls and
letters from members after the decision was made saying they felt
it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``two Bills'' have received bravos from the nation's
cultural community for helping save the agencies. But there are
also a smattering of boos for some of the changes, especially in
the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   Archibald Gillies, director of the Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts, is among many critics of the policy abolishing NEA
grants for individual artists. Before the cutbacks began, these
grants totaled about $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fault the Clinton administration for not standing up for
artists during that battle as much as they could have,'' said
Gillies. ``As a political tactic, I comprehend it. But I don't
accept it. I would have preferred the fight to have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Roberto Bedoya, executive director of the National
Association of Artists' Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The agency ``no longer supports individual artists. That's had a
very dramatic effect,'' said Bedoya. ``There's been a shift toward
audience development and arts education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, Congress demanded that the agencies become more
conservative in order to stay alive. So they did. But they are no
longer committed to supporting new artists and new ideas and forms
in art. I don't like that. Other people are content to live with
this compromised agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey did only what Congress demanded, countered Jan Denton,
director of the American Arts Alliance, an advocacy group for 2,500
non-profit arts associations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My observation is that Congress definitely needed to be calmed
down for, particularly, the NEA to survive,'' said Denton.
Lawmakers ``needed to feel more comfortable with funding
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this was necessary before he could rebuild the agency
back to what it was in the glory days,'' said Denton. ``Our vision,
in time, is that (the agency) will be able to fund individual
artists. We have to have a long view.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar view was expressed by Ruby Lerner, director of the
Creative Capital Foundation, an organization recently formed to
make private grants to individual artists. Some cast the foundation
as reactive to the NEA ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not courting controversy. We're here to support
individual artists,'' said Lerner, who formerly headed Image
Film/Video Center and Alternative Roots in Atlanta. ``But we
realize some of work will end up challenging convention.''
</P>
<P>
   She said both endowment chairmen are ``very smart strategically.
If given the time, they will take the agencies in as interesting a
direction as possible in these funding circumstances.''

 For release: May 23 or thereafter  
 &HT;    Maybe they should have just stenciled it in large letters on
Andrew Goldstein's forehead: ``TICKING TIME BOMB. SUFFERS
SCHIZOPHRENIA. IF OFF MEDICATION, RUN FOR COVER!''
 &HT;    The news accounts of his arrest for pushing Kendra Webdale under
a subway train in New York that first Sunday afternoon in January
must have sent a cold shiver through the hundreds of psychiatrists,
therapists and social workers who had treated this seriously
mentally ill man.
 &HT;    They knew he was dangerous. In the two years before Webdale was
instantly killed on the tracks, Goldstein attacked at least 13
other people. The hospital staff members who kept treating and
discharging Goldstein knew that he repeatedly attacked strangers in
public places. They knew because he had attacked them _ two
psychiatrists, a nurse, a social worker and a therapy aide in two
years' time.
 &HT;    Over and over, his hospital charts carried warnings: ``5/6/98:
High risk for violence. 7/31/98: Last 6-12 months patient has been
acting aggressively and impulsively by striking out unprovoked.''
 &HT;    They knew. Long before this subway push and another one last
month, the state of the nation's shattered mental-health system all
but assured such calamities.
 &HT;    Yet for each hospitalization _ there were 13 in 1997 and 1998
alone _ Goldstein was given medication, then discharged, often
after just a few days, to live on his own in a basement apartment.
 &HT;    And now the consequences were front-page news: ``Horror on the
Tracks,'' read the tabloid headlines, ``The Face of a Madman.''
 &HT;    They knew. He was hospitalized after assaulting a psychiatrist
at a Queens clinic. ``11/14/97: Suddenly, without any warning,
patient springs up and attacks one of doctors, pushing her into a
door and then onto the floor.''
 &HT;    He was hospitalized after threatening a woman at a Waldbaum's
supermarket; after attacking two strangers at a Burger King; after
fighting with an apartment mate. ``3/2/98: Broke down roommate's
door because he could not control the impulse.''
 &HT;    And particularly chilling, six months before Kendra Webdale's
death, he was hospitalized for striking another woman he did not
know on a New York subway. ``6/20/98: Brought to E.R. by E.M.S.
after patient lost motor control and punched a girl on the
subway.''
 &HT;    Sometimes he was delivered to the hospitals by well-meaning
police officers trying to get him treatment. More often, Goldstein
walked into the psychiatric ER on his own, seeking help. This
29-year-old Jewish male (as the records describe him), who before
schizophrenia set in had been so bright that he graduated from
Bronx High School of Science, one of the city's elite public high
schools, now was repeatedly explaining to ER doctors that he was
confused or couldn't remember how to get home or that his brain had
stopped working.
 &HT;    Six weeks before Webdale, on Nov. 20, 1998, he arrived at
Jamaica Hospital in Queens, again asking to be hospitalized.
``Walked in the E.R. complaining of hearing voices, people
following him and being inhabited by people. ... ``They removed my
brain, I don't know why. I am hearing these voices telling me
something will happen. ... I cannot cope.''
 &HT;    How psychotic was Goldstein when he was off his medicine? At
various times, he has told psychiatrists that he was turning
purple, that he had shrunk six to eight inches, that he had lost
his neck, had developed an oversize penis because of contaminated
food and that a homosexual man named Larry was stealing his
excrement from the toilet ``through interpolation,'' then eating it
with a knife and fork.
 &HT;    The voices seemed so real, so relentless, that on Nov. 24 a
psychiatrist wrote, ``He requested eyeglasses so that he will find
the people talking to him.''
 He Wanted Help  
 &HT;    When a mental patient kills, there is often an outcry for
tougher commitment laws, but this was not the problem in
Goldstein's case. He signed himself in voluntarily for all 13 of
his hospitalizations. His problem was what happened after
discharge.
 &HT;    The social workers assigned to plan his release knew he
shouldn't have been living on his own, and so did Goldstein, but
everywhere they looked they were turned down. They found waiting
lists for long-term care at state hospitals, waiting lists for
supervised housing at state-financed group homes, waiting lists for
a state-financed intensive-case manager, who would have visited
Goldstein daily at his apartment to make sure he was coping and
taking his meds (medicine).
 &HT;    More than once he requested long-term hospitalization at
Creedmoor, the state hospital nearby. In 1997 he walked into the
Creedmoor lobby, asking to be admitted. ``I want to be
hospitalized,'' he said. ``I need a placement.''
 &HT;    But in a cost-cutting drive, New York has been pushing hard to
reduce its patient census and to shut state hospitals. Goldstein
was instead referred to an emergency room, where he stayed
overnight and was released.
 &HT;    Again, in July 1998, Goldstein cooperated with psychiatrists,
this time during a monthlong stay at Brookdale Hospital, in hopes
of getting long-term care at Creedmoor. Brookdale psychiatrists had
a well-documented case. In a month's time, Goldstein committed
three violent acts: punching the young woman on the subway;
attacking a Brookdale therapist, a psychiatrist, a social worker
and a ward aide; striking a Brookdale nurse in the face. This time,
Creedmoor officials agreed in principle to take him, but explained
that there was a waiting list, that they were under orders to give
priority to mental patients from prison and that they did not know
when they would have an opening. Days later, Goldstein was
discharged from Brookdale.
 &HT;    Another reasonable alternative would have been a supervised
group home or single-room-occupancy hotel staffed by counselors
around the clock. Goldstein repeatedly asked for such a placement,
but openings are rare, since Gov. George Pataki financed no new
supervised community residences for the mentally ill during his
first four-year term and just 200 SRO beds statewide.
 &HT;    ``Working on getting him a residence in Manhattan within the
next three to six months,'' says a Dec. 16, 1998, note, 18 days
before he pushed Webdale.
 &HT;    At the very least, Goldstein should have had an intensive-case
manager, a state-financed caseworker whose job would have been to
visit him daily at his apartment. On Dec. 11, 1998 _ 23 days before
Webdale _ a North General Hospital social worker wrote that an
intensive-case manager was needed, because ``patient is unable to
manage his money, does not take care of himself and becomes
noncompliant with meds.'' But that waiting list was months long
too.
 &HT;    Goldstein's last hospitalization before Webdale was at North
General, from Nov. 24 to Dec. 15. Because of cost-saving measures
mandated under managed care, hospitals that operate short-term, or
``acute-care,'' psychiatric units are under great financial
pressure to discharge patients within three weeks.
 &HT;    So two weeks into his stay, on Dec. 9, even as Goldstein was
still being described by North General's psychiatrist as
``disorganized, thought-disordered . . . talking to himself . . .
very delusional,'' the discharge team had already set his release
for the next week.
 &HT;    Sure enough, on Dec. 15, North General discharged Goldstein with
a week's supply of medicine and a form advising him to report to
Bleuler Psychotherapy Center for counseling. This was like a bad
joke _ that a man so sick, with his history, would be sent into the
community with so little support.
 &HT;    At clinics such as Bleuler, state financing is minimal. Social
workers have large caseloads with no time to visit clients. Since
September, Bleuler had supposedly been treating Goldstein, but he
had missed most of his appointments and had repeatedly gone off his
meds.
 &HT;    It happened again: He missed two clinic appointments in late
December. He stopped taking his medication. If he had had an
intensive-case manager or a group-home counselor, or both, it would
have been their job to find him and see what was wrong. At Bleuler,
it wasn't anyone's job.
 &HT;    Instead, on Dec. 26, a Bleuler worker mailed a form letter
requesting that Goldstein phone the clinic by Jan. 6, 1999, or else
his case would be closed.
 &HT;    On Jan. 3, 1999, at 5:06 p.m., the N train pulled into the
station at 23rd Street and Broadway. Kendra Webdale was a vivacious
32-year-old who had come to the city three years before from
upstate and was working as a receptionist with dreams of landing a
big job in the music industry.
 &HT;    To Andrew Goldstein, she was another stranger. He never saw her
face. As he later wrote in his confession: ``I felt a sensation,
like something was entering me. ... I got the urge to push, shove
or sidekick. As the train was coming, the feeling disappeared and
came back. ... I pushed the woman who had blond hair.''
 A Confidential Case  
 &HT;    Because of patient confidentiality laws, Goldstein's 3,500-page
psychiatric file will never become public, even when he goes to
trial on the murder charge. But it was given to me by people who
see his treatment record as a harrowing testament to the failures
of the mental-health system.
 &HT;    There is a long list of institutions and individuals who should
be held accountable for what happened to Goldstein and Webdale, but
at the top of that list belong Pataki and the State of New York,
for it is the states that, for the last 150 years, have had primary
responsibility for citizens who are seriously mentally ill, and it
is the states, beginning with deinstitutionalization in the 1950s,
that have persistently shirked that responsibility.
 &HT;    With the introduction of antipsychotic medication, state
hospitals nationwide began releasing patients into the community.
There was a good deal that was hopeful about this; by then, many
state hospitals had become snake pits. Yet the states never created
the outpatient services that were supposed to replace those
hospitals, landing many of the seriously mentally ill on the
streets.
 &HT;    In 1953 there were 93,000 patients in New York's state mental
hospitals; today, the number is 6,000 and dropping. And while these
last patients are often very troubled (about one-quarter have
criminal backgrounds), the state's special discharge teams continue
to push them out the door _ even when there's no place for them to
go. The New York State Office of Mental Health provides only 21,000
supervised community beds. And during Pataki's first term, the
state financed just 200 new beds with 24-hour supervision.
 &HT;    The problems in New York are the problems in virtually every
state. Fewer than half of the Americans with schizophrenia receive
adequate care, according to a 1998 national study. The Bazelon
Center for Mental Health Law estimates that spending by the 50
states on treatment for the seriously mentally ill is a third less
today than it was in the 1950s (once numbers are adjusted for
inflation and population growth).
 &HT;    While this is a danger primarily to the mentally ill and their
families, who bear the brunt of the states' neglect, it is also a
danger to the public. From the many studies on mental illness and
violence, we know that treated mentally ill people living in the
community are no more a risk than the general population. But if a
person is off medication and psychotic, he becomes a greater risk
for violence. If you add substance abuse to that psychosis, the
risk grows significantly.
 &HT;    And one of the strongest predictors of whether a mentally ill
person will be violent is whether he has been violent before.
 &HT;    It is the most sensational cases of the untreated-turned-violent
that make headlines: Russell Weston Jr., ruled incompetent to stand
trial for killing two U.S. Capitol police officers; Sergei Babarin,
who murdered a man and a woman at a Mormon library in Utah; John
Salvi III, who shot to death two abortion-clinic workers in
Brookline, Mass.; Mark Bechard, judged criminally insane for
killing two nuns in Maine; and in April, another New York subway
case, Julio Perez, charged with attempted murder for pushing a
father of three in front of a rush-hour train, severing the man's
legs.
 &HT;    There are now far more mentally ill in the nation's jails and
prisons (200,000) than in state hospitals (61,700). With 3,000
mentally ill inmates on Rikers Island, the New York City jail is
now, in effect, the state's largest psychiatric facility. In a
year's time, according to a study by the Urban Justice Center,
15,000 prisoners in Rikers are treated for serious mental illness.
 &HT;    Some, such as Goldstein, are awaiting trial on violent crimes.
But far more have been too sick to cope alone in the community and
were arrested for shoplifting, disturbing the peace, public
lewdness, intoxication, drug use, fare-beating. Many would never
have landed behind bars if there were adequate community care.
 &HT;    And that is the larger, quieter scandal behind the states'
failure. While some of the untreated are dangerous, far more suffer
unnecessarily from their own illnesses. After years of declining
numbers, the population of homeless adults is rising again in New
York City shelters. It is estimated that of the 7,200 homeless,
2,200 to 3,000 are mentally ill.
 &HT;    In 15 years of reporting on mental health, I have never seen the
system in such disarray. Unprecedented cost-cutting measures are
undermining safety valves that had long been in place. What I found
most haunting about Goldstein's 3,500-page file was his repeated
pleas for services that had no vacancies. There was no room at the
inn.
 &HT;    Last month at a court hearing, Goldstein's lawyers, Harvey
Fishbein and Jack Hoffinger, argued that he was not fit to stand
trial. Judge Carol Berkman disagreed, finding him competent. But
she also hinted that she understood the larger scope of the crime.
 &HT;    ``I have no doubt,'' she said, ``that someday, probably after we
are all gone, people will look back at our treatment of mental
illness under the law and be shocked and appalled.''

 &HT;    They knew. Long before this subway push and another one last
month, the state of the nation's shattered mental-health system all
but assured such calamities.
 &HT;    Yet for each hospitalization _ there were 13 in 1997 and 1998
alone _ Goldstein was given medication, then discharged, often
after just a few days, to live on his own in a basement apartment.
 &HT;    And now the consequences were front-page news: ``Horror on the
Tracks,'' read the tabloid headlines, ``The Face of a Madman.''
 &HT;    They knew. He was hospitalized after assaulting a psychiatrist
at a Queens clinic. ``11/14/97: Suddenly, without any warning,
patient springs up and attacks one of doctors, pushing her into a
door and then onto the floor.''
 &HT;    He was hospitalized after threatening a woman at a Waldbaum's
supermarket; after attacking two strangers at a Burger King; after
fighting with an apartment mate. ``3/2/98: Broke down roommate's
door because he could not control the impulse.''
 &HT;    And particularly chilling, six months before Kendra Webdale's
death, he was hospitalized for striking another woman he did not
know on a New York subway. ``6/20/98: Brought to E.R. by E.M.S.
after patient lost motor control and punched a girl on the
subway.''
 &HT;    Sometimes he was delivered to the hospitals by well-meaning
police officers trying to get him treatment. More often, Goldstein
walked into the psychiatric ER on his own, seeking help. This
29-year-old Jewish male (as the records describe him), who before
schizophrenia set in had been so bright that he graduated from
Bronx High School of Science, one of the city's elite public high
schools, now was repeatedly explaining to ER doctors that he was
confused or couldn't remember how to get home or that his brain had
stopped working.
 &HT;    Six weeks before Webdale, on Nov. 20, 1998, he arrived at
Jamaica Hospital in Queens, again asking to be hospitalized.
``Walked in the E.R. complaining of hearing voices, people
following him and being inhabited by people. ... ``They removed my
brain, I don't know why. I am hearing these voices telling me
something will happen. ... I cannot cope.''
 &HT;    How psychotic was Goldstein when he was off his medicine? At
various times, he has told psychiatrists that he was turning
purple, that he had shrunk six to eight inches, that he had lost
his neck, had developed an oversize penis because of contaminated
food and that a homosexual man named Larry was stealing his
excrement from the toilet ``through interpolation,'' then eating it
with a knife and fork.
 &HT;    The voices seemed so real, so relentless, that on Nov. 24 a
psychiatrist wrote, ``He requested eyeglasses so that he will find
the people talking to him.''
 He Wanted Help  
 &HT;    When a mental patient kills, there is often an outcry for
tougher commitment laws, but this was not the problem in
Goldstein's case. He signed himself in voluntarily for all 13 of
his hospitalizations. His problem was what happened after
discharge.
 &HT;    The social workers assigned to plan his release knew he
shouldn't have been living on his own, and so did Goldstein, but
everywhere they looked they were turned down. They found waiting
lists for long-term care at state hospitals, waiting lists for
supervised housing at state-financed group homes, waiting lists for
a state-financed intensive-case manager, who would have visited
Goldstein daily at his apartment to make sure he was coping and
taking his meds (medicine).
 &HT;    More than once he requested long-term hospitalization at
Creedmoor, the state hospital nearby. In 1997 he walked into the
Creedmoor lobby, asking to be admitted. ``I want to be
hospitalized,'' he said. ``I need a placement.''
 &HT;    But in a cost-cutting drive, New York has been pushing hard to
reduce its patient census and to shut state hospitals. Goldstein
was instead referred to an emergency room, where he stayed
overnight and was released.
 &HT;    Again, in July 1998, Goldstein cooperated with psychiatrists,
this time during a monthlong stay at Brookdale Hospital, in hopes
of getting long-term care at Creedmoor. Brookdale psychiatrists had
a well-documented case. In a month's time, Goldstein committed
three violent acts: punching the young woman on the subway;
attacking a Brookdale therapist, a psychiatrist, a social worker
and a ward aide; striking a Brookdale nurse in the face. This time,
Creedmoor officials agreed in principle to take him, but explained
that there was a waiting list, that they were under orders to give
priority to mental patients from prison and that they did not know
when they would have an opening. Days later, Goldstein was
discharged from Brookdale.
 &HT;    Another reasonable alternative would have been a supervised
group home or single-room-occupancy hotel staffed by counselors
around the clock. Goldstein repeatedly asked for such a placement,
but openings are rare, since Gov. George Pataki financed no new
supervised community residences for the mentally ill during his
first four-year term and just 200 SRO beds statewide.
 &HT;    ``Working on getting him a residence in Manhattan within the
next three to six months,'' says a Dec. 16, 1998, note, 18 days
before he pushed Webdale.
 &HT;    At the very least, Goldstein should have had an intensive-case
manager, a state-financed caseworker whose job would have been to
visit him daily at his apartment. On Dec. 11, 1998 _ 23 days before
Webdale _ a North General Hospital social worker wrote that an
intensive-case manager was needed, because ``patient is unable to
manage his money, does not take care of himself and becomes
noncompliant with meds.'' But that waiting list was months long
too.
 &HT;    Goldstein's last hospitalization before Webdale was at North
General, from Nov. 24 to Dec. 15. Because of cost-saving measures
mandated under managed care, hospitals that operate short-term, or
``acute-care,'' psychiatric units are under great financial
pressure to discharge patients within three weeks.
 &HT;    So two weeks into his stay, on Dec. 9, even as Goldstein was
still being described by North General's psychiatrist as
``disorganized, thought-disordered . . . talking to himself . . .
very delusional,'' the discharge team had already set his release
for the next week.
 &HT;    Sure enough, on Dec. 15, North General discharged Goldstein with
a week's supply of medicine and a form advising him to report to
Bleuler Psychotherapy Center for counseling. This was like a bad
joke _ that a man so sick, with his history, would be sent into the
community with so little support.
 &HT;    At clinics such as Bleuler, state financing is minimal. Social
workers have large caseloads with no time to visit clients. Since
September, Bleuler had supposedly been treating Goldstein, but he
had missed most of his appointments and had repeatedly gone off his
meds.
 &HT;    It happened again: He missed two clinic appointments in late
December. He stopped taking his medication. If he had had an
intensive-case manager or a group-home counselor, or both, it would
have been their job to find him and see what was wrong. At Bleuler,
it wasn't anyone's job.
 &HT;    Instead, on Dec. 26, a Bleuler worker mailed a form letter
requesting that Goldstein phone the clinic by Jan. 6, 1999, or else
his case would be closed.
 &HT;    On Jan. 3, 1999, at 5:06 p.m., the N train pulled into the
station at 23rd Street and Broadway. Kendra Webdale was a vivacious
32-year-old who had come to the city three years before from
upstate and was working as a receptionist with dreams of landing a
big job in the music industry.
 &HT;    To Andrew Goldstein, she was another stranger. He never saw her
face. As he later wrote in his confession: ``I felt a sensation,
like something was entering me. ... I got the urge to push, shove
or sidekick. As the train was coming, the feeling disappeared and
came back. ... I pushed the woman who had blond hair.''
 A Confidential Case  
 &HT;    Because of patient confidentiality laws, Goldstein's 3,500-page
psychiatric file will never become public, even when he goes to
trial on the murder charge. But it was given to me by people who
see his treatment record as a harrowing testament to the failures
of the mental-health system.
 &HT;    There is a long list of institutions and individuals who should
be held accountable for what happened to Goldstein and Webdale, but
at the top of that list belong Pataki and the State of New York,
for it is the states that, for the last 150 years, have had primary
responsibility for citizens who are seriously mentally ill, and it
is the states, beginning with deinstitutionalization in the 1950s,
that have persistently shirked that responsibility.
 &HT;    With the introduction of antipsychotic medication, state
hospitals nationwide began releasing patients into the community.
There was a good deal that was hopeful about this; by then, many
state hospitals had become snake pits. Yet the states never created
the outpatient services that were supposed to replace those
hospitals, landing many of the seriously mentally ill on the
streets.
 &HT;    In 1953 there were 93,000 patients in New York's state mental
hospitals; today, the number is 6,000 and dropping. And while these
last patients are often very troubled (about one-quarter have
criminal backgrounds), the state's special discharge teams continue
to push them out the door _ even when there's no place for them to
go. The New York State Office of Mental Health provides only 21,000
supervised community beds. And during Pataki's first term, the
state financed just 200 new beds with 24-hour supervision.
 &HT;    The problems in New York are the problems in virtually every
state. Fewer than half of the Americans with schizophrenia receive
adequate care, according to a 1998 national study. The Bazelon
Center for Mental Health Law estimates that spending by the 50
states on treatment for the seriously mentally ill is a third less
today than it was in the 1950s (once numbers are adjusted for
inflation and population growth).
 &HT;    While this is a danger primarily to the mentally ill and their
families, who bear the brunt of the states' neglect, it is also a
danger to the public. From the many studies on mental illness and
violence, we know that treated mentally ill people living in the
community are no more a risk than the general population. But if a
person is off medication and psychotic, he becomes a greater risk
for violence. If you add substance abuse to that psychosis, the
risk grows significantly.
 &HT;    And one of the strongest predictors of whether a mentally ill
person will be violent is whether he has been violent before.
 &HT;    It is the most sensational cases of the untreated-turned-violent
that make headlines: Russell Weston Jr., ruled incompetent to stand
trial for killing two U.S. Capitol police officers; Sergei Babarin,
who murdered a man and a woman at a Mormon library in Utah; John
Salvi III, who shot to death two abortion-clinic workers in
Brookline, Mass.; Mark Bechard, judged criminally insane for
killing two nuns in Maine; and in April, another New York subway
case, Julio Perez, charged with attempted murder for pushing a
father of three in front of a rush-hour train, severing the man's
legs.
 &HT;    There are now far more mentally ill in the nation's jails and
prisons (200,000) than in state hospitals (61,700). With 3,000
mentally ill inmates on Rikers Island, the New York City jail is
now, in effect, the state's largest psychiatric facility. In a
year's time, according to a study by the Urban Justice Center,
15,000 prisoners in Rikers are treated for serious mental illness.
 &HT;    Some, such as Goldstein, are awaiting trial on violent crimes.
But far more have been too sick to cope alone in the community and
were arrested for shoplifting, disturbing the peace, public
lewdness, intoxication, drug use, fare-beating. Many would never
have landed behind bars if there were adequate community care.
 &HT;    And that is the larger, quieter scandal behind the states'
failure. While some of the untreated are dangerous, far more suffer
unnecessarily from their own illnesses. After years of declining
numbers, the population of homeless adults is rising again in New
York City shelters. It is estimated that of the 7,200 homeless,
2,200 to 3,000 are mentally ill.
 &HT;    In 15 years of reporting on mental health, I have never seen the
system in such disarray. Unprecedented cost-cutting measures are
undermining safety valves that had long been in place. What I found
most haunting about Goldstein's 3,500-page file was his repeated
pleas for services that had no vacancies. There was no room at the
inn.
 &HT;    Last month at a court hearing, Goldstein's lawyers, Harvey
Fishbein and Jack Hoffinger, argued that he was not fit to stand
trial. Judge Carol Berkman disagreed, finding him competent. But
she also hinted that she understood the larger scope of the crime.
 &HT;    ``I have no doubt,'' she said, ``that someday, probably after we
are all gone, people will look back at our treatment of mental
illness under the law and be shocked and appalled.''

   Russian Silents That Say a Lot
</P>
<P>
   In Aleksandr Dovzhenko's ``Arsenal'' (1929) a one-armed farmer,
furious over his imminent starvation, beats his decrepit horse with
a stick. Slowly the weary animal turns to him. ``You're hitting the
wrong one, Ivan,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true horse of the Soviet avant-garde, which in the
'20s used about anything to get its point across. In ``Arsenal,''
one of three films from the Soviet silent era to be released in new
editions this month by Kino International, a portrait on the wall
comes to life, if only to roll its eyes as a Bolshevik cadre
prepares to go to its glorious demise at the hands of Ukrainian
forces in an Alamo-style defense of a factory (the arsenal) in
Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   If flocking to the barricades suggests one-note filmmaking, rest
assured that the Russians found ways to make it fresh and startling
even today.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fertile examples is ``Strike,'' Sergei
Eisenstein's first feature film and one of his freest and most
inventive. A new Kino edition is made from film elements found in
Russia. ``It was in beautiful shape,'' said David Shepard, the film
conservationist who often oversees Kino projects. ``Sometimes we
work with scraps, but on this one we were incredibly lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstein, who was 26 in 1924 when the film was released, had
experience in the theater, which he both relied on and broke away
from on screen. Full of dazzling technique, brilliant visual
surprises and surreal juxtapositions, ``Strike'' is something of an
explosion. The story, about a group of workers who have finally had
enough and close down a foundry, becomes a choreographed pageant of
exaggerated characters and wildly roiling action.
</P>
<P>
   Stoking the excitement is the Alloy Orchestra, a present-day
group from Boston that lends live accompaniment to silent films.
For ``Strike'' the tempo is kept tightly coiled and pounding,
which, if it doesn't get on the nerves after a while, consistently
adds fun to the deepening pandemonium. The Alloy generates a big,
busy sound. ``Actually they're a trio, but it sounds like each one
of them has nine arms,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the music, grubby upstarts plot, and the masses brawl
and scream and roll around in mud puddles. Bosses, usually leering,
grossly obese men with cratered faces, have no compassion. Finally,
mounted troops ride up into the apartment houses to club down
strikers and murder babies. At the end a field is strewn with
hundreds of corpses who all look as if they can't wait to jump up
and rush off again.
</P>
<P>
   The third film of the series, Dziga Vertov's ``Kino-Eye,'' is of
a decidedly different disposition. Vertov was a documentarian who
regarded the acted film as a perversion of truth. At the start of
``Kino-Eye,'' also released in 1924, is a brief description: ``The
first nonfiction film thing without a script, without actors,
outside the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Vertov didn't shoot his films himself but sent camaramen into
the field to film what they would while he remained in Moscow to
edit the results. In one fascinating stretch, ``Kino-Eye'' begins
with a hamburger and traces it backward to its origins as a walking
piece of beef. The caption reads: ``Here we have what 20 minutes
ago was a bull.''

</P>
<P>
   A former schoolteacher, the cynical Dora (Fernanda Montenegro,
left, with Vinicius de Oliveira) works at the Rio de Janeiro train
station writing letters for the illiterate and then not bothering
to mail them. Then a woman with her 10-year-old son, Josue, in tow,
dictates a beseeching letter to her absent husband and gets killed
by a bus. Despite her loathing for children, Dora takes Josue home,
where she develops a plan to sell him to an adoption racket and get
a new television set. When the scheme lands her in trouble, she
gathers up the boy and goes on a wild goose chase after his father.
On the road the two slowly develop an affinity that takes on a
Felliniesque sense of spiritual discovery. Avoiding sentimentality,
Walter Salles uses his experience as a documentary maker, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, to give ``this lovely, stirring
film a strong sense of Brazil's impoverished rural landscape.''

   One of the 52 souls who constitute the population of the Irish
village of Tulaigh Mohr holds a winning lottery ticket. When no one
lets on who that might be, Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and his wife,
Annie (Fionnula Flannagan), carry out a detective project that gets
nowhere until they invite 18 of the biggest lottery players in town
to a dinner. When one, Ned Devine, doesn't appear, it turns out he
is dead, which inspires Jackie to try for the pot by making a
living Ned plausible to a visiting lottery official. In that
pursuit, Jackie and his friend Michael (David Kelly), both about
70, ride naked on bicycles, but this is one lottery film that is
about generosity and not divisive greed. Written and directed by
Kirk Jones, a blithe comedy ``has the knack of finding rubbery,
expressive faces and letting each villager's quirks emerge on cue''
(Maslin).

   In the far reaches of northern Norway, the fog and endless
daylight start to get on the nerves of the investigator Jonas
Engstrom (Stellan Skarsgard), who has been sent to look into the
killing of a beautiful young woman (Maria Mathiesen). Normally a
hard case capable of taking care of himself, Engstrom finds
developments working against him in ways he can't control. Spooked
by the setting early on, he shoots into the fog and accidentally
kills a colleague. Then he connects much too closely with suspects
in the case he has come to investigate, eventually becoming a
suspect himself. In Erik Skjoldbjaerg's taut debut feature, ``
Skarsgard's performance as a man pushed to the breaking point gives
the film its share of Hitchcockian undercurrents'' (Maslin). &QL;

earth on the body. At first he finds no takers. A young soldier
flees in terror, and a seminarian can't condone suicide. Only an

DRUG SHIP TO BE AUCTIONED OFF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENALIA MORENO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE, Texas _ Looking for a good deal on a used cargo ship?
One generally considered to be a great fixer-upper?
</P>
<P>
   Look no further. Beginning at 11 a.m. CDT Friday at the CBH
dockyard, you can put your bid in for the M/V Cannes, seized Jan.
13 by the U.S. Coast Guard in the Port of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities found nearly 10,000 pounds of cocaine buried five
feet below iron ore pellets piled inside one of the ship's
cavernous hulls, making it the Coast Guard's largest drug seizure
ever in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To generate revenues for the federal government's drug-fighting
efforts, the U.S. Customs Service is auctioning the ship off, with
bidding starting at $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be late.
</P>
<P>
   So far, as many as 40 ship agents from as far away as Pakistan,
Greece, Singapore, Finland and Germany have inspected the vessel,
which is rusty, but in good condition overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy from Hamburg was here,'' said James Foland, district
manager for Fairfax, Va.-based EG&AMP;G Services, which has been hired
to auction the 26-year-old vessel. ``A guy from Singapore called up
last week. He didn't even know if he was in Texas or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ship owners and agents from around the world are interested in
the bargain price of this Panamanian-flagged bulk freighter. The
previous owner, Quest Ocean Ltd. of Piraeus, Greece, did not
respond when contacted by government officials and lost ownership
of the Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to get more than that,'' Paul Rimmer, Customs port
director for Houston and Galveston, said of the $1.2 million
starting bid.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, a scrap dealer could pay $700,000 for the vessel,
which was seized in Houston after the Coast Guard boarded it on the
high seas 125 miles southwest of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the ship's 24-person crew were indicted on federal
drug-trafficking charges. They could receive 10 years to life, and
one crew member who is charged with being an accessory to the crime
could receive up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   At 580 feet long, the Cannes is the largest vessel seized by
Customs since 1990. The last freighter Customs seized nearly 20
years ago, the Bor, fetched $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Typical auction fare for EG&AMP;G, which auctions merchandise and
property seized by several other government agencies including the
Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Secret Service, includes
computers, clothing and cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, which has an office in Houston, also has sold
everything from gravestones to horses.
</P>
<P>
   The company once auctioned a DC 9 airplane for $3.6 million and
a Beverly Hills home seen in the film ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' for
$1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   These auctions provide the U.S. Treasury Fund a net profit of
$12 million to $20 million annually. The fund provides money for
crime fighting and victims assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Rimmer said the fund will receive 60 to 70 percent of the ship's
sale price. The remaining money will go to repaying the $125,000
owed to crew members who were sent back to their homelands. The
remaining money also pays for fuel and storage, which cost $17,000
in Orange over the last few months, compared with the $6,840 in
charges accrued during the vessel's weeklong stay in Houston after
the iron ore and drugs were unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   So, after four months of investigations by three federal
agencies, the seizure will culminate Friday with the slam of an
auctioneer's gavel.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G expects that 10 minutes into the auction, the Cannes will
have a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fast and furious,'' said Kerry Cooper, EG&AMP;G Services'
public relations coordinator.

SAN FRANCISCO WAGE PLAN HITS SNAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A plan to boost pay for working people suffered
setbacks Wednesday as a coalition of nonprofit organizations said
they could not afford the higher wage, and three members of the
city's Living Wage Task Force resigned citing a lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The living wage plan, proposed by Board of Supervisors President
Tom Ammiano earlier this month, would require employers who hold
service contracts with the city to pay their workers at least $11
per hour and provide health benefits, or a cash equivalent to the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate also would apply to businesses that lease property
from the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Services Task Force of San Francisco, representing
nonprofit organizations, said it was concerned that the proposal
would have ``a tremendous negative impact on the nonprofit
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of Dan Martin, Robert O'Malley and Walter
Johnson were sparked when a city supervisor called for extending
the committee's work beyond its original July 12 termination date
to Dec. 31, and a separate plan for an independent economic
analysis of the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further delay would mean thousands of people who are working
hard every day in this city _ caring for our parents and
grandparents, guarding our buildings, cleaning our offices _
continue to live in desperate poverty,'' the three resigning
members say in a letter to the task force. ``The situation demands
prompt attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the possible cost of wages for employees, the
Human Services Task Force said it didn't want the legislation to be
rushed through.
</P>
<P>
   At least 28 cities in the United States, including Oakland and
San Jose in California, already have living wage laws; San
Francisco's, if adopted as proposed, would pay the highest wage and
be the first to include businesses that lease city property.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. minimum wage is $5.15 per hour; California's minimum
wage is $5.75 per hour. A person working full time earning the
living wage envisioned by Ammiano would make $22,800 a year,
$10,840 more than a minimum-wage earner.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's proposal would exempt businesses with five or fewer
employees and those with city contracts worth less than $25,000 per
year. Also exempt would be employees under 21 who are working
after-school or summer jobs; employees in short-term training
projects; and disabled workers in special federal jobs programs.

`THE 13TH FLOOR': TRAVELING IN CYBERSPACE CAN GET A GUY
CYBERKILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some doors are best left unopened, and one of them leads to
movies with the kind of denouement that resembles one of those
boxes of salt with a picture of a woman holding a box of salt with
a picture of a woman holding a box of salt with a picture of ...
The possibilities extend ad infinitum and, in the case of ``The
13th Floor,'' ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   Repackaged as cyberthriller, the old time-travel adventure
returns in this stylish but overplotted and ultimately illogical
combination of science fiction, mystery and romance.
</P>
<P>
   The science fiction seems up to date with its computer images
and parallel worlds, including 1937 Los Angeles. The solution to
the mystery turns out to be a yawner that doesn't bear much
scrutiny. And the romance, with ever-so-faint echoes of Hitchcock's
``Vertigo,'' needs a better chemistry set.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The 13th Floor,'' directed by Josef Rusnak from a
screenplay he wrote with Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez, can be
appreciated for its re-creation of a Los Angeles of empty lots on
Wilshire Boulevard, a skyline of oil wells and visions of
white-tied swells riding in Packard town cars or dancing the night
away to ``Caravan'' in Art Deco supper clubs while the less
fortunate sweat out the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, based on the novel ``Simulacron 3'' by Daniel Galouye,
positions its main characters in parallel worlds where they lead
different lives. In the world of the 1990s the principals are
employees of the visionary magnate Hannon Fuller (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), whose projects include an experimental
computer-chip simulation of old Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After a journey to this virtually real world, where he leaves an
important letter with Ashton (Vincent D'Onofrio), an untrustworthy
bartender in the elegant supper club Hannon frequents for its young
female companionship, he returns, makes a hurried telephone call
from a seedy bar and is promptly and brutally knifed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning Hannon's favorite executive and heir apparent,
Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko), wakes to find a blood-drenched shirt
in his apartment and to find himself the prime suspect in events on
a night he cannot remember.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert), a police
detective, promptly singles out Douglas as the probable killer, and
an alluring young woman (Gretchen Mol) turns up and announces
herself to be Jane Fuller, Hannon's previously unknown daughter.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of clumsy dialogue, Douglas and Jane are soon, as
Yogi Berra might observe, experiencing a lot of d'eja vu all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   These being the complications, there is but one thing for
Douglas to do: travel to 1937 Los Angeles with the help of his
colleague Whitney ( D'Onofrio again) and, in the persona of a bank
teller named John Ferguson, try to sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   With strong performances by D'Onofrio and Mueller-Stahl and with
the help of the costumes of Joseph Porro and the production design
of Kirk Petruccelli ``The 13th Floor'' begins promisingly with the
murder that straddles two worlds. But it strikes no sparks with its
romance, and as the mystery unravels, so does the film. By its end
a return to genuine reality is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Floor'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It contains a bloody murder, shootings
and other violence, as well as coarse language and suggestions of

`THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE': THE STORY OF ADAM AND EVE, SORT
OF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' Mike Figgis' visually
exquisite, intensely personal meditation on the story of Adam and
Eve, the world's first couple are a black man (Femi Ogumbanjo) and
a white woman (Hanne Klintoe), who emerge like angelic beings from
the waters of a golden lake. Discovering each other, they explore
their anatomical differences like playful children delightedly
splashing around in the water.
</P>
<P>
   These are the happiest moments in a movie that locates the
essence of evil in sexual jealousy, betrayal and possessiveness.
The scenes of the first couple meeting, frolicking and eventually
running into the hills, where they gorge on pulpy red fruit from
the tree of knowledge and are galvanized by a lust that hardens
their eyes, convey powerful charges of sadness and eroticism.
</P>
<P>
   Those two feelings suffuse this audacious full-length
avant-garde film from the British director of ``Leaving Las
Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' is no simple Bible story. It is
a dreamy semi-autobiographical reverie that fuses the
lost-childhood pathos of the Terence Davies films ``Distant Voices,
Still Lives'' and ``The Long Day Closes'' with the erotic symbolism
of Derek Jarman, and inserts a portentous layer of myth.
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven with its version of the Adam and Eve story are scenes
from the life of a filmmaker named Nic (Julian Sands), who, like
Figgis, spent his early years in Kenya and moved to northern
England as a boy. Different actors play Nic at ages 5, 12 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   As the director has demonstrated in his more conventional films,
he is a master of mood with a keen musical ear. And in ``The Loss
of Sexual Innocence,'' he outdoes himself in creating atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film is a nearly wordless tone poem that sustains an
intense emotional gravity and sexual tension through its mixture of
music, beautiful outdoor cinematography and somber, silent acting.
</P>
<P>
   Solo piano performances by Joanna MacGregor of pieces by Mozart,
Schumann, Beethoven and Chopin deepen the feeling of ethereal
melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest scenes remembers a mid-'60s teen-age party
at which Nic's girlfriend disappears and is discovered in a bedroom
drunk and making out with another boy, who intends to seduce her.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect period pop nugget, Sandie Shaw's hit ``Girl Don't
Come,'' accompanies this moment. Later, the grown-up Nic, unhappily
married with a son, has a silent, angst-ridden sexual encounter
with his wife in the kitchen of their farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still later, a wordless scene set at a railroad station observes
the furtive erotic signals exchanged between attractive strangers
waiting side by side on a platform for their respective lovers to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a moment reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni, a
sound recordist working on a documentary film in Tunisia strolls
into a field with his equipment and accidentally picks up the
groans of his girlfriend and another man making love in a nearby
tent. The incident triggers a tragedy that resonates deeply with
the Adam and Eve story.
</P>
<P>
   But for every haunting scene, another one fizzles. A subplot
involving identical twins separated at birth who encounter each
other in an airport is extraneous. A scene of the obese 12-year-old
Nic being humiliated by a gym teacher also belongs in another
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Adam and Eve story is cluttered with intrusive Christian
symbolism. And the expulsion from Eden with its mixture of fascists
and paparazzi is discordantly shrill. Ultimately, the strands of
this elliptical allegory aren't pulled tight enough.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent screening of ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' the
one word bandied about the film afterward was ``pretentious.''
Perhaps. It takes a certain presumption to make a movie comparing
your personal erotic history to Adam and Eve. On the other hand,
isn't that what all great myths invite us to do?
</P>
<P>
   Those with no patience for avant-garde films will want to avoid
``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' which opens Friday in New York
City. Everyone else will find moments of surpassing beauty in this
courageous, deeply flawed film.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has full frontal nudity
(male and female), sexual situations and one scene of violence.

THE ANN RAND CLIFFS NOTES: PHILOSOPHY AS FOREPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Atlas shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   You will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even the estimable Helen Mirren cannot make a compelling
protagonist of loopy old Ayn Rand. And while the opportunity to see
Ms. Mirren hurl herself into simulations of noisy, athletic
coupling with Eric Stoltz may sound like voyeuristic fun, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   These determined May-September lovers sweat through ``The
Passion of Ayn Rand,'' which Showtime is unveiling on Sunday night.
This film is ``adult'' (in the nudge-nudge, wink-wink sense), but
it's a pretty muddled drama.
</P>
<P>
   It traps Ms. Mirren and Stoltz, as Rand's acolyte, Nathaniel
Branden, in cardboard characterizations. Julie Delpy suffers
angelically as Nathaniel's wife, Barbara. But among the actors,
only Peter Fonda, as Rand's pathetic husband, Frank O'Connor, is
really worth watching. And he never takes his clothes off.
</P>
<P>
   Rand (1905-1982) may not be discussed much nowadays, but people
of a certain age remember her as the author of two puzzling
anvil-size best-selling novels, ``The Fountainhead'' (1943) and
``Atlas Shrugged'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling was not her real goal, though. She was, as she was
the first to point out, a philosopher. She believed in ... well,
something that had to do with capitalism and self-reliance and that
sounded a lot like selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Many thoughtful people continue to say that their lives were
elevated by Rand's beliefs. But you'll have to do your own
homework. This portrait of a philosopher has scant time for any
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Rand's outstanding creation was herself. She was
originally Alice Rosenbaum, born in St. Petersburg, Russia. She
fled to the United States, landing in Hollywood. She met O'Connor
there, while they were working as extras for Cecil B. De Mille. But
she had ideas. She also had a Remington Rand typewriter, from which
she appropriated her new surname. She wrote, people read.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens in 1951, she and Frank, who has already been
crushed by her ever-expanding identity, are welcoming a couple of
eager young college students, Nathan Blumenthal and Barbara
Whiteman, into their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you zee, Frank,'' Ms. Mirren exclaims in an odd
pan-European accent, ``zees two bee-utiful people who haf come to
our house!''
</P>
<P>
   In no time the young people put their lives in Rand's hands.
They are her disciples. She gives Nathan a new name and instructs
the couple to marry and enjoy sex. They do their best to comply,
but Barbara has trouble with the enjoyment part.
</P>
<P>
   You learn a lot about Barbara's feelings because the film is
based on the real Barbara Branden's 1986 memoir. And she was a
consultant to the film, which was written by Howard Korder and Mary
Gallagher and directed by Christopher Menaul.
</P>
<P>
   When Ayn explains that as a remedy for her writer's block she
must have sex with Nathaniel twice a week (once in the afternoon,
once in the evening), Barbara is not too thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theez (italics)chh(end italics)ad to (italics)chh(end
italics)appen,'' Ayn says. (You may want to (italics)chh(end
italics)old your (italics)chh(end italics)ed.) ``Lesser people
could never accept it. But veee are not lesser people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer's block? What writer's block? Now the words come pouring
out. ``Atlas Shrugged'' is finished in a blink.
</P>
<P>
   Ayn and Nathaniel prove quite a team, for a while, anyway.
Besides their workouts (more often than twice a week, thank you),
he's soon running the Nathaniel Branden Institute, which makes lots
of money from Ayn's reflected glory.
</P>
<P>
   But the film makes clear that Nathaniel's a bum, not worthy of
the trust put in him by either woman, both of whom he betrays.
</P>
<P>
   His life is so complicated that when another lover, Caroline
(Sybil Temchen), asks in yet another bedroom scene, ``What if she
finds out?,'' Nathaniel asks, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mirren, so adept at mixing tough and vulnerable in ``Prime
Suspect'' on television and in other memorable roles, would seem an
ideal choice to play Rand, whose photographs captured the kind of
steely bearing this actress has perfected. But her Rand seems just
plain nutty.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda can't save the day. But he can make it more interesting.
His portrait of a strapping man who's withering inside is quietly
moving. Toward the end, when Nathaniel tells poor, drunk Frank that
he's sorry for the way things worked out, Fonda replies softly: ``I
am, too, Nathan. I'm really very sorry.'' Pause. ``For you.'' That
perfect instant between ``sorry'' and ``for'' is just the kind of
breath that this suffocating film desperately needed.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BESIEGED,'' &LR;  starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis.
Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (R, 92 minutes). Like all
Bertolucci's films, the love story of an expatriate African woman
(Ms. Newton) fleeing an oppressive military regime and the
reclusive British pianist ( Thewlis) for whom she works as a
housekeeper in Rome is a visual jewel. Based on a short story by
James Lasdun, ``Besieged'' is a film of few words and powerful
images. (Especially of a military coup in an impoverished African
country.) The love is sealed through an extraordinary act of
self-sacrifice and a deepening appreciation of each other's tastes
in music. If this elliptical movie leaves too much unsaid, it has
strong understated performances by its two stars (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COOKIE'S FORTUNE,''  &LR; starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Nel, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert
Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and
guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic
return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and
completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a
wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel
niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest
friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and
appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman
makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,''  &LR; starring Elodie Bouchez and
Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French
with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EDGE OF 17,''  &LR; starring Chris Stafford and Tina Holmes.
Directed by David Moreton (not rated, 100 minutes). It's 1984 in
Sandusky, Ohio, and Eric (Chris Stafford), a skinny, fresh-faced
high school student who worships the Eurythmics and Culture Club,
has his first homosexual experiences. This is not boy-meets-boy
(Romeo meets Romeo and they fall madly in love) but boy is used and
confused and tries to go straight by sleeping with his former
girlfriend. The teen-age coming-out story is realistic but
warmhearted, the best among the recent gay coming-out films
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ELECTION,''  &LR; starring Matthew Broderick and Reese
Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the
acerbically funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic
satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting.
Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms.
Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from
Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless
good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs
to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's
reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a
lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay
specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off what they
actually mean (Maslin).

<P>
   &UR; ``ENTRAPMENT,''  &LR; starring Sean Connery and Catherine
Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy
caper summons the days when being a thief was the profession of
choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the
great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly
investigating Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones
makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right. No need
to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's enough
verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on the
eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of
the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And
here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE LOVE LETTER,'' &LR;  starring Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner,
Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Everett Scott and Tom Selleck. Directed by
Peter No-sun Chan (R, 88 minutes). Cathleen Schine's whimsical
romantic novel about a summer affair between a divorced bookstore
owner (Ms. Capshaw) and a college student half her age ( Scott)
bleaches out pungent ruminations on May-September love in favor of
a bland cuteness. The teeny-weeny story revolves around an
unaddressed, unsigned love letter that floats into people's lives
and recharges their romantic fantasies. The dialogue is flat, the
level of the acting grade-B sitcom (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MATRIX,''  &LR; starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the
film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with
a big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,''  &LR; starring Rupert Everett,
Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer and Stanley
Tucci. Directed by Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This is
potluck Shakespeare, with a wildly uneven range of performances and
no clear style holding them together. Rather than wonder why the
actors are wrestling with bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a
setting used much less enchantingly than it might have been), it's
best to focus on the most comfortably Shakespearean performances
and not wonder what Ms. Flockhart is doing here. Kline makes a
perfect Bottom, Everett slinks seductively through Oberon's role
and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The
younger cast members are largely used as window dressing for the
Leo-Does-Romeo set (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MUMMY,''  &LR; starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent
spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror
classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an
unwieldy hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and
Costello Meet the Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.'' The
intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that
carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed
English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother).
It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming
scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful ``Alien''-like
things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE''  &LR; (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner) and Judi Dench (best supporting actress).
Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily
literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only
gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as
Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into
razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,''  &LR; starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 miutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,''  &LR; starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame
Maggie) who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously
relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted
from a chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of
English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War
II. Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of
the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are
shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves
carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest.
Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving
wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THIS IS MY FATHER,''  &LR; starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and
James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes). Made with
obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago schoolteacher (
Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish forebears ( Quinn)
involves a third Quinn brother as well. And Declan Quinn's
cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric, sentimental tale
featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Colm
Meaney) in cameo roles. Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a
lonely farmer in love with a fiery young lass from a prosperous
family, does a lot to help the film override its hackneyed elements
and keep it moving (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE WINSLOW BOY,''  &LR; starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon
and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with
unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works
as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a
cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of
that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully
lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets
the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge
(Maslin). &QL;

 STOMACH-TURNING: JOHN HURT LOOKS BACK ON `ALIEN' AT 20 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., JUNE 7, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of John Hurt in
the classic film, ``Alien.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Squish! Splat!
 &HT;    It hurts just to think about the infamous chest-bursting scene
in Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi favorite, ``Alien.'' So gross and
horrifying was John Hurt's convulsive demise, so genuine were the
terrified reactions of co-stars Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian
Holm and Yaphet Kotto, that it remains the film's signature scene,
one of the most indelible in movie history.
 &HT;    ``I remember shooting that scene, vividly,'' Hurt says by
telephone from his home in Ireland. ``I was doubled over on the
table, then they cut away _ and when they cut away I went through a
hole in the table and (fake) legs were built on, so the prop guys
could fiddle around with the little creature.
 &HT;    ``It was not very high-tech.''
 &HT;    Hurt chuckles.
 &HT;    ``A lot has been said about the other actors not knowing what
would happen,'' he says. ``Of course they knew, but they didn't
know there would be caps to splatter the blood around.
 &HT;    ``Ridley had four or five cameras on everybody to capture the
moment in closeups and two-shots,'' the actor adds. ``So a lot of
it was done in one shot. I, of course, couldn't see very much.''
 &HT;    Hurt admits he had no idea that ``Alien'' _ basically a
haunted-house flick set in outer space _ would emerge as a classic,
popular enough to merit Fox Video's current release of a gussied-up
20th-anniversary edition on video and DVD, featuring a new
documentary and deleted footage.
 &HT;    ``You don't think like that,'' he says. ``You hope that
something will be successful. You don't realize while making
something that it will become a classic in its own vein.
 &HT;    ``Ridley had a very, very real approach to `Alien,''' he adds.
``It was not just a formula film, but an original piece with an
original concept and an original design.''
 &HT;    Scott's concept and H.R. Giger's legendary designs made
``Alien'' even tougher to make than the usual science-fiction film.
 &HT;    ``I don't think sci-fi is ever an easy shoot for an actor,''
Hurt says. ``And Ridley at the time was not that easy to work with.
He's gotten a lot better with actors over the years, but at that
time, if you asked him a question, he'd hide behind the camera.
 &HT;    ``And I say this all very lovingly, because Ridley is a
remarkable director.''
 &HT;    Hurt has not seen ``Alien'' in its entirety since 1979, nor has
he caught the last two sequels. He did, however, check out James
Cameron's 1986 blockbuster, ``Aliens.''
 &HT;    ``It was a good film, but it was of a different genre,'' Hurt
says. ``It was an action-adventure, which is completely different
from `Alien.'''
 &HT;    The Oscar-nominated actor surprised many by spoofing his
``Alien'' death scene in Mel Brooks' 1987 comedy, ``Spaceballs,''
easily eliciting the biggest laugh in that movie.
 &HT;    ``Mel didn't have to twist my arm,'' says Hurt, who had already
worked for Brooks in 1981's ``History of the World, Part I.'' ``It
sounded like a good joke, and I was into it.
 &HT;    ``Mel said, `We'll put you up at a nice hotel. It'll be a bit of
fun,''' he recalls. ``When I got on the set I realized that, if he
hadn't gotten me, the whole scene wouldn't have played for
anything. They'd spent a lot of money on that set, and they needed
the original guy.''
 &HT;    Though best known as a serious actor for his work in 1978's
``Midnight Express'' and 1980's ``The Elephant Man,'' Hurt has
turned up in several sci-fi films, from the forgettable
``Monolith'' to Roger Corman's deliciously bad ``Frankenstein
Unbound'' and the much better ``Contact'' in 1997.
 &HT;    Still, he says, most sci-fi doesn't excite him.
 &HT;    ``As a spectator, I am not fond of the genre,'' he says.
```Alien' had something really original about it, as I say, which I
liked a lot. `Contact' was conceptually interesting.
 &HT;    ``Every now and then something does come up, and I'll quite
enjoy it.''
 &HT;    In other words, if a script for a certain sequel dropped onto
his desk ...
 &HT;    ``Alien 5?'' Hurt says. ``It would have to be a very, very
expensive rebirth.''

 SIDEBAR: DENISE CROSBY HOSTS TREKUMENTARY  
 &HT;    Can't get into ``The Phantom Menace,'' but need an otherworldly
fix? Want to meet the kind of creatures that even Qui-Gon Jinn
would blink twice at?
 &HT;    Then line up for ``Trekkies,'' a documentary about ``Star Trek''
fans. Co-produced and hosted by former ``Next Gen'' cast member
Denise Crosby, it's in theaters now.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people who aren't `Trek' fans are enjoying the
movie,'' Crosby says. ``They're so curious, amused and interested
in the phenomenon.
 &HT;    ``They're discovering that some of the cliched images of `Trek'
fans aren't necessarily true, that not every `Trek' fan is a
basement-dwelling geek with no life,'' she adds. ``In that sense,
the film is re-educating people.''
 &HT;    Crosby and director/editor Roger Nygard whittled 35 hours of
footage into 90-plus minutes of conversations with ``Trek'' talent
from Leonard Nimoy to Kate Mulgrew, from makeup artist Michael
Westmore to historian Richard Arnold _ and visits with Trekkies, as
the film calls them.
 &HT;    Among the fans interviewed are an Orlando dentist with a
``Trek''-themed office, a Boston-based would-be veterinarian whose
cats wear Dr. McCoy uniforms, Starfleet-uniform-wearing Whitewater
juror Barbara Adams and a California man contemplating surgery to
give him Vulcan ears.
 &HT;    Some diehard fans claim that ``Trekkies'' mocks them. Crosby,
who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and year-old son,
disagrees.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how anyone could say that,'' she says. ``I'm not
editorializing _ the fans are speaking for themselves. I think it's
pretty evenhanded.
 &HT;    ``There's plenty of room to mock fans,'' she admits. ``They're
an eccentric, obsessive bunch, as anybody would be if they have
such fanaticism about something. That's an easy jab, to make fun of
people _ which is exactly what I did not want to do.
 &HT;    ``If people say I'm mocking `Trek' fans, they've got a
problem,'' she concludes. ``Nobody could please them.''

JERRY BROWN PITCHES OAKLAND TO DEVELOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Like singer Wayne Newton, Oakland Mayor Jerry
Brown was in Las Vegas and had a song to sing.
</P>
<P>
   His tune was not aimed at the lounge lizards of Caesars Palace,
but to the world's largest conference of shopping center developers
and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   It went something like this: Come to Oakland/The rents aren't
high/Crime is down/Downtown's on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're pitching Oakland as the place for retail
development, especially downtown,'' Brown said Wednesday. ``We want
to bring back the retail splendor that once was the hallmark of
Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Shopping Centers conference in Las
Vegas may not be everyone's idea of a picnic, but it's exactly the
kind of event Brown must attend to realize his vision of a
revitalized downtown.
</P>
<P>
   To lure 10,000 new residents to downtown, as Brown has promised,
there will need to be shops, restaurants, movie theaters. And that
means persuading sometimes reluctant investors and developers to
put money into the dilapidated but improving city center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tell people why, in this age when urban living is
enjoying a renaissance, Oakland is a dramatic opportunity for the
creation of housing and for the creation of retail,'' said Oakland
Councilmember John Russo, who joined the mayor for the day-long
trip to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who has been to the conference the past four years, says
interest in Oakland has steadily risen. This year, the main
attraction was the new mayor, a former governor of California and
three-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just stopped and looked at him. They wanted to talk to
him,'' Russo said. ``It creates contacts we need.''
</P>
<P>
   But the city's strongest sales pitch may be the increasingly
inflated rents in San Francisco and other parts of the San
Francisco Bay area, which have made Oakland more attractive to
businesses and residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market dynamics are just right,'' said William Claggett,
executive director of the city's Community and Economic Development
Agency. ``Oakland is sitting in the catbird seat for the region
because we have an advantage in terms of rents and also an
advantage in that we are relatively underserved by retail
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Over several decades, city officials have watched retail
projects go to the suburbs or to other are cities, such as
Emeryville, that have been more aggressive in seeking out
developers to build major shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Oakland has been perceived by some as not
particularly development-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast hosted by city officials on Wednesday, City
Manager Robert Bobb told 150 people at the conference that
developers who hit bureaucratic roadblocks should contact his
office.
</P>
<P>
   The new administration would be a ``more entrepreneurial
government,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   To show its business-friendly side, a half dozen city officials
staffed a booth on the convention floor. The effort was noted by
writers of the trade publication, Shopping Centers Today.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland ``hopes to sell developers and retailers on its downtown
area, which has rebounded strongly after `hitting rock bottom'
following the 1989 earthquake,'' says the on-line version of the
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in a speech at the Wednesday morning breakfast, promised
that the city would continue to reduce crime and streamline its
permit process.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said it was too early to announce any new agreements.
He met with officials from The Gap, Sears and Target, and said he
made progress with mega-developer Forest City Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very bullish on urban centers and they like
Oakland,'' Brown said of Forest City. ``They're going to be
visiting us in the next 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   John Protopappas, an Oakland developer, praised Brown for
understanding that developers won't come to Oakland out of a sense
of duty or generosity, but only if they can earn a better rate of
return than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry respects capital,'' said Protopappas, president and
chief executive officer of Madison Park REIT, which is renovating
the Tribune Tower in Oakland. ``He's in a position where he can say
(to developers), `We're not going to be easy on you, we want you to
develop aesthetically pleasing projects. But we want you to earn a
return.'''

<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ De Luna has landed.
</P>
<P>
   The cry will go out June 5 during the 50th anniversary Fiesta of
Five Flags as locals re-create the arrival of Don Tristan de Luna
in 1559 on these shores.
</P>
<P>
   The explorer had been commissioned by the Spanish king to
establish a colony. But within two years, after suffering a
devastating hurricane followed by a yellow fever epidemic, de Luna
and his men abandoned the Panhandle settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that St. Augustine _ founded in 1565 by Pedro
Melendez de Aviles _ has the distinction of being the oldest
permanently occupied European settlement in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Pensacola is no also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Civic pride compels Marshall Emerson to point out that Pensacola
retains the claim of ``the first attempt'' at a permanent
settlement in North America, predating both Jamestown and St.
Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature wasn't cooperative,'' says Emerson, a museum
education specialist with the Historic Pensacola Preservation
Board, a state agency that oversees the Historic Pensacola Village
and T.T. Wentworth Jr. Florida State Museum. ``In 1698, they tried
again (to colonize), and it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Since de Luna planted the Spanish standard in 1559, five flags _
Spanish, French, British, American and Confederate _ have flown
over the city that takes its name from the Choctaw word for ``Bread
People,'' Panzacola.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the first Fiesta of Five Flags was staged to celebrate
the city's colorful heritage. This year's event, June 2-12,
includes re-enactments, a treasure hunt, sand sculpture, parades
(boats and floats), concerts, the crowning of a royal court,
fireworks and an exhibit of costumes and memorabilia from five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The event goes into high gear June 3, when the Fiesta Forces
``capture'' public officials, local business people and media
personalities and hold them hostage until the city ``surrenders to
a week of fun and frivolity'' during festivities in Seville Square.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to visit here during a festival to appreciate
the city's dual commitment to past and future.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the once-neglected downtown has been revived
with trendy boutiques, art galleries and restaurants on Palafox
Street _ the main north-south corridor _ and surrounding streets.
The restored 1925 Saenger Theatre on Palafox hosts name
entertainers and touring Broadway musicals. Just north of the
Saenger is the Civil War Soldiers Museum, which highlights
Pensacola's role in the conflict. And the Bayfront Auditorium on
the pier at the end of Palafox will have a new neighbor within a
year: the Palafox Pier development, with restaurants, shops and a
marina.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a small-town feeling permeates this city of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot like the old Florida I grew up with,'' says
Bruce Fender over waffles at the Pensacola Victorian Bed and
Breakfast. The Miami native, who lives in Forest, Va., was
celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife, Zoraida.
</P>
<P>
   A thriving arts community is anchored by the Pensacola Museum of
Art and the Pensacola Cultural Center, home of the Pensacola Little
Theatre. Next door to the museum is the Quayside Art Gallery,
featuring hundreds of works by regional artists on three floors.
Smaller galleries, such as the Adams Street Gallery in a historic
house overlooking Seville Square, are dotted throughout town. The
Seville Dinner Theatre stages Broadway musicals such as
``Nunsense,'' the current show, in the old post office on East
Garden Street. Plus, there's a ballet, opera company and symphony
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something to do,'' says Terance Johns, a native
who returned home to create the Orpheus Vocal Consort. ``The
community has been very receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best deal in town is a 25-cent trolley ride that
includes a narration by a driver-conductor as it loops through the
city. I hopped aboard one of the old-fashioned green trolleys
driven by Jerry Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago,'' Cooper says, ``downtown Pensacola was, uh,
not too pretty. They've really turned this downtown into a nice
area. Pensacola is going through a transition. There are people who
don't want it to change; but it's going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   I end my rolling tour where I began, across from the T.T.
Wentworth Jr. Florida State Museum, which houses such Ripley-like
oddities as a petrified cat and a shrunken head. But there are also
exhibits showcasing ongoing excavations of colonial fortifications
and a hands-on children's area called Colonial Kidstown, featuring
a kid-size representation of Fort Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and historic village _ a nine-square-block area
flanked by Plaza Ferdinand and Seville Square _ lie in the heart of
the Seville Historic District. During the Summer Open House on June
5, admission is free. Throughout the summer, the village buzzes
with costumed interpreters and craft demonstrations such as candle
dipping, gardening and bread baking at the outdoor beehive oven.
</P>
<P>
   Twice-daily guided walking tours of the village include stops at
three houses: the 1805 Lavalle House (a Creole cottage), 1871 Dorr
House (a two-story Greek Revival home overlooking Seville Square)
and 1890 Lear-Rocheblave House (a folk Victorian home decorated to
reflect its days as a boardinghouse in the 1920s). Currently being
renovated and not open for visitors, Christ Episcopal Church,
established in 1832, is the state's oldest church building. Tours
begin at the Tivoli House, 205 E. Zaragosa St., at 11 a.m. and 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also tour two village museums in historic warehouse
buildings. The brick Museum of Commerce holds a reconstructed 1890s
streetscape with a collection of horse-drawn buggies and a trolley
car. The Museum of Industry depicts major early industries,
including fishing, brickmaking, railroad and lumber.
</P>
<P>
   I found it helpful to visit the Pensacola Historical Museum on
East Zaragosa Street before touring the village. Exhibits in this
small museum trace the history of the area from the Indians of
10,000 B.C. to the present. Artifacts from archaeological digs
conducted by the University of West Florida and Historic Pensacola
reveal how people lived between 1752 and 1821. You can see the
excavation sites on a self-guided tour of the Colonial
Archaeological Trail in the historic district. Pick up a brochure
at Tivoli House.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the white-sugar sands and emerald waters of Pensacola
Beach are what lure you to the area, spend a day in town to explore
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like de Luna, you'll find that it's quite a discovery.
</P>
<P>

   &QR;  Moist towelettes. Yes, there are bathrooms in Cajun

 &HT;    Cajun spice: Marking three centures of French flavor in
Louisiana
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 30.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPELOUSAS, La. _ The dance floor at Slim's Y-Ki-Ki is jumping.
The wooden square in the middle of the dark, low-ceilinged dance
hall is literally bouncing up and down like a trampoline. Zydeco
star Frank Field is screaming his own name, and the sweaty dancers
in cowboy hats and belt buckles big as turkey platters are
screaming it back as they sway close and stomp fast to the rhythm
of the accordion, rub board, drums and bass guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can't keep the beat _ that would be the white couple,
namely my husband and me _ gets a jarring double-bounce from the
floor, a pop to the soles of their shoes that gets them back in the
groove.
</P>
<P>
   It's Saturday night in Cajun country, and from Baton Rouge to
Lake Charles, Cajun and Zydeco dance halls are crammed with
two-steppers, waltzers and dirty-dancing hip-grinders. The clubs
are in modest cinder block or clapboard buildings, on faded main
streets, off two-lane rural roads, or next to crawfish ponds and
sugar cane fields. And on Saturday night, things are just getting
warmed up: After church on Sunday, the good times keep rolling in
Cajun clubs with names like Smiley's, Chilly's and Guidry's
Friendly Lounge. Couples, many of them in their 60s or older,
tip-tap and knee-slap on wide-board floors, breaking for smokes and
swigs off 10-ounce cans of cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the music in this nonstop, region-wide party. I
haven't even gotten to the food yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have lived in New Orleans for 18 months, a trip into
Cajun country, or Acadiana, still feels like a journey abroad. The
land, flat and dotted with brick ranch homes and falling-in shotgun
shacks, could at first be mistaken for south Georgia or parts of
Alabama. But the fields are full of sugar cane, not peanuts or
cotton, and the ponds contain not catfish but crawfish, and
sometimes rice. And then there are the vast and mysterious swamps
that seem to engulf the landscape in the blink of eye. Some are
wide open, the surface a vibrant mix of blue water and silvery
green algae. Some are dark and closed, with moss-covered cypress
trees shooting out of the water like witch's fingers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the music, the language, and the justly world-famous
cuisine make this area of about 22 parishes (or counties) a world
apart even from the rest of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun country is the Deep South with a French accent, a
larded-up Loire Valley, where a seven-course meal consists of a
six-pack of beer and a link of boudin, the Cajun sausage. Southern
hospitality meets Old World gentility here: Nowhere have I been
offered a place to stay or a home-cooked meal as often as I have on
my visits to this open-hearted land.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere is evidence of a heritage not lost in homogenization
but rather zealously guarded. That heritage is being celebrated all
year with Francofete, commemorating the 300th anniversary of French
influence on Louisiana. Festivals and other events will emphasize
French language and culture to mark this anniversary of the
founding of a military camp at the mouth of the Mississippi River
on Mardi Gras day in 1699. The biggest event will be an Acadian
family reunion, opening in Houma on Aug. 1, that's expected to draw
tens of thousands from around the world for two weeks of events
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Cajuns feel fortunate their heritage has survived this long.
After decades of discouraging children to speak French, the schools
in the 1960s reintroduced the language and the state started
promoting Cajun culture and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you've ever heard a Cajun speak French, you know
it's not exactly the Parisian version. A. F. ''Pete'' Olivier, a
Cajun from Sunset, La., said he was recently entertaining some
Belgians when he realized his French wasn't quite being understood.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us read or wrote French growing up _ we just learned
it from our great-grandmas,'' he said. ''So if she mispronounced a
word, we did. While the Belgians were here, I managed to tell them
to put on condoms and put testicles around their necks.''
</P>
<P>
   What he meant to say was, ``put on your raincoats'' and ``wear
Mardi Gras beads.''
</P>
<P>
   Cajuns are the descendants of Acadians, exiled to the swamps and
prairies of Louisiana in 1755 from French-colonial Acadia, now Nova
Scotia. Since then, their culture has mingled with and evolved
alongside that of the Native Americans, Africans, Caribbeans and
immigrants from France, Spain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Atchafayala River basin, the largest freshwater swamp in the
country, kept Acadiana isolated long after other parts of the
country connected to each other via highways and airports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the most expensive interstate ever built in the United
States rose out of the swamps and connected Cajun country to the
modern world. Ever since, Cajun and Zydeco music and Cajun and
Creole food have been exported and enjoyed worldwide, and tourists
have visited.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed, of course. Cajuns trade on their heritage
somewhat, with ''Cajun'' this and ''Cajun'' that used in sales
pitches. Wal-Mart and the fast-food chains are here, as are
satellite dishes and video poker machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cajun traditions of good music, good food and good times
have endured. Although tour buses roll through small towns and
tourism bureaus stay busy, this remains a rural, working world.
Music and food are a way to blow off steam after a hard day
planting sugar cane, climbing around an oil rig, checking crawfish
nets or slogging through a rice field.
</P>
<P>
   So come hungry, bring your dancing shoes, and be prepared to
leave with recipes, new friends, and a new waistline. Don't worry:
You can always diet when you get home.

   UNDATED: Voorhies likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Abbeville
</P>
<P>
   The swamp tour returns you to Lafayette in time for lunch. Drive
south 30 miles on U.S. 167 to Abbeville, home of the coldest,
cleanest, biggest raw oysters in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   There are several places to get oysters in charming Abbeville,
including Black's, Shucks! and Dupuy's. We went to Dupuy's _ open
since 1887 _ ordered two dozen and soared into oyster ecstasy.
Order as many as you can eat: They are a steal at $4.25 a dozen _
at least $2 less than in New Orleans. Dupuy's also has good gumbo
and crispy, freshly made onion rings.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with cold oysters and greasy rings, wander around the
picturesque town square and have a look at the Steen Syrup Mill
(119 N. Main St.) with its giant ''cans'' of syrup outside. There's
a lovely old cemetery across the street.
</P>
<P>
   On your way back to Lafayette, you could stop at either
Vermilionville (318-233-4077) or the Acadian Village
(1-800-962-9133). These model Cajun villages are right next to each
other off U.S. 90 near the airport and offer a glimpse of life in
19th-century Acadiana. Also nearby is Lafayette's Acadian Cultural
Center (318-232-0789), similar to the one in Eunice, except this
one focuses on the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Prudhomme's Cajun Cafe, Carencro
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, I recommend Prudhomme's Cajun Cafe (318-896-3646),
due north of Lafayette on I-49. It's a little overpriced and not
everything is divine, but the deep, dark roux of the gumbo and the
homemade jalapeno cheese rolls are worth the seven-mile drive out
of Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back into Lafayette, take a turn around the dance
floor at Prejean's (318-896-3247), on the I-49 service road and
clearly visible on the east side of the highway. This cavernous
Cajun dance hall and restaurant is a little touristy, but the music
is authentic and the dancers enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   El Sido's, Lafayette
</P>
<P>
   You're not ready for bed yet, are you? Wind up the night at El
Sido's, a zydeco dance club (1523 Martin Luther King Drive, 318-
235-0647) a very short drive from Bois des Chenes. Zydeco is the
black Creole version of Cajun music, and the main way to tell the
difference is that zydeco bands include someone with what looks
like a washboard against his chest that he scratches with spoons or
bottlecaps. The rhythm of zydeco is different too, but I'll leave
that to you to study. (Be sure and call ahead to see if a band is
playing.)
</P>
<P>
   El Sido's is a nondescript place _ a large room with a long bar,
lots of tables, and space in front of a raised stage for dancing _
but the people-watching is fun. The night we went, Roy Carrier and
his band were playing and there were many older couples, some quite
dressed up, dancing close during the slow songs and sitting through
the fast ones.
</P>
<P>
   DAY THREE
</P>
<P>
   Henderson
</P>
<P>
   During crawfish season, which runs from late January until
mid-summer, I eat crawfish at least once a week. But the ones
shipped to New Orleans look like fire ants compared to those the
Cajuns save for themselves. The meat in the tails can be as big as
your thumb. And the heads, for those of you who suck them, and you
know who you are, are full of juicy, spiced-up fat.
</P>
<P>
   It seems every time we visit a ''boiling point,'' as boiled
seafood joints here are called, we proclaim the crawfish the best
yet. But three places stand out: Hawk's in Rayne, west of
Lafayette; Crawfish Town USA in Henderson; and the Guiding Star,
between New Iberia and Opelousas. Two of these could be hit in Day
Three.
</P>
<P>
   Start at Crawfish Town USA (318-667-6148), at exit 115 off I-10
a few minutes east of Lafayette. It may look like a tour-bus
magnet, and it is, but this place has crawfish big enough to last a
round or two in a ring with a small lobster. My husband doesn't
think they are spicy enough, but they make up for that by being
incredibly sweet and succulent.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martinville
</P>
<P>
   Next, drive west on I-10 a bit further and exit at Breaux Bridge
and head south. You will wind up on La. 31, a pretty, winding road
that will take you by the Bayou Teche, a narrow waterway named for
the Indian word for snake. You will pass through Breaux Bridge,
which is home of the Crawfish Festival every May, and St.
Martinville and New Iberia.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martinville, a beautiful town once called ''Little Paris,''
has a Cajun attraction almost as famous as Fred's. In the ''Cajun
Country Guide'' (Pelican, $17.95), this attraction is labeled
''Guys Under the Oak,'' and that's just what it is. The Romero
brothers are two retirees who have spent the last decade sitting
beside the Bayou Teche by the famous Evangeline Oak tree, singing
traditional Cajun songs in French and English and telling tales of
local history. I was expecting to find these ''guys'' sort of
silly; instead, I was completely charmed by them. Don't forget to
tip them, and don't try to see them on Sundays _ they'll be in
church.
</P>
<P>
   I took a look around the Old Castillo Hotel (220 Evangeline
Blvd., 1-800-621-3017) _ a steal at $80 a night for a large,
charming room with French doors onto a second-floor gallery
overlooking the Evangeline Oak and the Romero brothers. The hotel
has a restaurant as well.
</P>
<P>
   New Iberia
</P>
<P>
   But don't settle in until you drive on a little further on La.
31 to New Iberia. Be sure to find East Main Street, which is one
way, and travel its length. It has at least a dozen lavish old
homes and a cute downtown. Take a tour of Shadows on the Teche on
East Main Street (offered 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m. daily, $6;
318-369-6446). It is an 1834 plantation home which has 40
trunks-worth of family artifacts here and there.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of mystery writer James Lee Burke, you know
that his protagonist, detective Dave Robicheaux, lives and works in
New Iberia. Burke himself splits his time between here and Montana.
Drop by Books Along the Teche, (110 East Main St.; 313-367-7621)
and you can pick up a free, self-guided tour of Robicheaux's New
Iberia.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for some more crawfish? Of course you are _ it's not like
they have them in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Drive out of New Iberia, find U.S. 90, and head north about four
miles. Look on your right for the Guiding Star Restaurant
(318-365-9113), a squat, windowless cinderblock building with a
shooting star painted on the outside. Inside are rough-hewn wooden
chairs and newspaper-covered tables, industrial hand-washing sinks
in the corner, and a jukebox stocked with Cajun and zydeco hits.
This is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But please, a moment of silence for the crawfish. They are
obscenely large and covered in Tabasco mash _ the crushed peppers
left over after the Tabasco plant on nearby Avery Island makes a
vat of hot sauce. The crawfish, and the boiled crabs, will fill you
up and dirty your shirt and make you a happy soul.
</P>
<P>
   DAY FOUR
</P>
<P>
   Joe's ''Dreyfus Store''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant, Livonia
</P>
<P>
   I have saved the best day for last. Begin with lunch in Livonia,
on U.S. 90 between Opelousas and Baton Rouge, about an hour from
Lafayette. The only reason to come here is Joe's ''Dreyfus Store''
Restaurant (504-637-2625), but I would drive all day to come here
again.
</P>
<P>
   And the drive itself is interesting: U.S. 90 is a classic old
highway with rundown truck stops and retro neon signs, but with the
added attraction of swamps and bayous running alongside the road.
</P>
<P>
   A large, comfortable room that looks like the general store it
once was, Joe's serves food as good as anything I have had in New
Orleans. We began with a link of perfect boudin served with, of all
things, sweet, sticky pepper jelly. Then, I had Oysters Grand
Central _ cooked in a lemon-butter sauce and served in a French
bread boat that made me want to run around the block a few times
and order it again.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien Point Plantation,
</P>
<P>
   Sunset
</P>
<P>
   Next, drive west on U.S. 90 toward Opelousas and then south on
I-49 to the Grand Couteau/Sunset exit. Go west and follow the signs
to Chretien Point Plantation (tours daily, $6.50; 1-800-880-7050),
hidden at the end of a narrow blacktop that winds between sugar
cane fields. Built in 1831, it is an elegant, two-story brick
residence with Tuscan columns and a wide upstairs gallery with
wicker furniture. There are lots of good stories here: The
staircase in the back was copied for ''Tara'' in ''Gone With the
Wind,'' and the house was damaged by a Union cannon during the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien Point is a bed and breakfast: Rooms are $110-$225 a
night, which includes a tour, breakfast and use of the pool and
tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Couteau
</P>
<P>
   Drive back toward the interstate and go under it on La. 93 into
Grand Couteau, a picturesque little wide spot in the road with
historic homes and the Sacred Heart Academy and Convent
(318-662-5275), the oldest school west of the Mississippi. This
stunning place was the sight of the only Vatican-sanctioned miracle
to occur in the United States. The shrine where the miracle took
place _ I'll just tell you there were some visions and a curing _
is free and open to the public, but call ahead. Tours of the school
and convent are available for $5. Again, call ahead.
</P>
<P>
   My real reason for steering you to Grand Couteau is, of course,
food. A new restaurant called Catahoula's (1-888-547-2275) has
commanded attention with nouveau Cajun cooking and a sleek, modern
interior. Named for the Louisiana state dog _ images of whom are
among the wonderful photographs on the walls _ Catahoula's is,
excuse me, howlingly good. The grilled gulf shrimp with three
roasted pepper sauces and a sauteed black bean cake was a grand
start. I followed that with a quail with an apple, sausage and
pistachio stuffing, and somehow saved room for a seven-layer
chocolate cake, one layer of which was pure caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Opelousas
</P>
<P>
   Time to groove off those calories at Slim's Y-Ki-Ki, about 20
minutes away in Opelousas (Route 167 North; 318-942-9980). This is
the state's most popular zydeco dance hall, and I had one of my
favorite evenings here. Call ahead and make sure a band is playing
_ one usually is on Fridays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone dances with everyone here. My husband watched as I went
off with three different strangers, none of whom flirted or even
asked my name. They just wanted a dance partner.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chretien Point is very nice, if you don't want to drive
back to Sunset, stay instead in Opelousas at the Estorge House Bed
&AMP; Breakfast (318-942-8151), just a few minutes away from Slim's.
This is one of the best B&AMP;Bs I've stayed in anywhere in the South.
Not only is it a beautiful house furnished with very fine antiques,
it is also home to a very friendly hostess, Sherl Picchioni, who
cooks up a sensational breakfast, leaves a rose on your pillow at
night, and is a wealth of knowledge about the home and its past
inhabitants. Don't miss the tour, included in the price of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   POSTSCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   One last piece of advice: When visiting Cajun country, don't try
to do too much each day. Set aside time to sit by a bayou and watch
the water loll by, or linger over a plate of crawfish long after
the last tail has been cracked. And leave any big-city, modern
inhibitions at home: Talk to people, dance with them, share a beer
or a meal with them. This is a place where talking to strangers is
not only OK, it's expected.

THE SELLING OF A LEGEND OF DECOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most of us missed the party of the century: Carlos de
Beistegui's masked ball in Venice in 1951, the first truly
flamboyant fete after the Second World War. Guests donned elaborate
18th-century Venetian costumes and masks and congregated via
gondola at Beistegui's Palazzo Labia on the Grand Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Beistegui, a famous esthete, designed individual uniforms for
all the staff, as well as his own outrageous costume as a
``procurer of the Republic of Venice,'' which he wore standing on
stilts.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was recorded in ``Fetes Memorables (Legendary
Parties) 1922-1972,'' a 1986 book by Prince Jean-Louis de
Faucigny-Lucinge. ``It was a total fantasy,'' said Roger Prigent,
now a Manhattan antiques dealer, who attended the ball to
photograph it for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Guinness, who accompanied his American friend Daisy
Fellowes to Venice in 1951, recalled that ``Beistegui became a hero
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Beistegui is back in the news.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, from Wednesday through Sunday, Sotheby's France and
the Paris auction house Poulain Le Fur will sell the contents of
the Chateau de Groussay, Beistegui's house in the village of
Montfort l'Amaury, 30 miles southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The seller is his nephew, who inherited the property when
Beistegui died in 1970 and who is selling the house as well. Art
collectors, dealers and interior designers are making a beeline to
the auction because they know it will be the last time they will
see its decor in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is a dream,'' Prigent said. ``It's a pity it's being
sold. The French government should have bought it and made it part
of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sotheby's has organized the sale and prepared the
four-volume catalog, Poulain Le Fur will conduct the auction
because French auction houses still have a monopoly on running
sales in France.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will be held on the grounds of the chateau, whose
buildings, park and 18th-century-style follies were classified as
historic monuments by the French government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's predicts that the auction _ 2,000 lots of furniture,
paintings, drawings, sculpture, porcelain and works of art _ will
realize $16 million. Others say the total will be higher.
``Groussay is the kind of sale where the whole is greater than the
sum of the parts,'' said Tony Victoria, the New York antiques
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about furnishings, not furniture,'' said Mindy Papp,
another New York dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Aslet, the editor of Country Life, wrote in the catalog:
``The Chateau de Groussay occupies an almost legendary place in the
history of decoration. Not because of its fame, but legendary
because of its status as the only surviving masterwork of a man who
was consumed by a passion for creating the settings amid which his
life took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigent was unequivocal: ``Beistegui was the greatest decorator
of the century. It is he who was the inspiration for Renzo
Mongiardino and Alberto Pinto.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Cheneviere, a London dealer who specializes in
18th-century Russian antiques, said that Beistigui ``was more of a
decorator than a collector,'' adding, ``He was an extravagant man
who lived in a spectacular way.''
</P>
<P>
   Beistegui (1894-1970), always known as Charlie to his friends,
was born into a Spanish family that had settled in Mexico at the
end of the 18th century. The family made its fortune there in
silver, but left Mexico after the execution of the Emperor
Maximilian in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   Though the family had Spanish passports, when Beistegui was
born, his parents were living in Paris. He was eventually sent to
Eton, where he wrote a volume of poetry he illustrated with his own
drawings. He was about to attend Cambridge when World War I broke
out. He then joined his parents in their mansion on the esplanade
of Les Invalides.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Mexican who thought he was an Englishman who was
living in France,'' Prigent said.
</P>
<P>
   Beistegui's interest in design dates to the 1920s, when he asked
Le Corbusier to create a penthouse for him. But Beistegui did not
love the ultra-modern space that resulted and became disenchanted
with modernism.
</P>
<P>
   He decorated the modern duplex with Baroque antiques and highly
decorative objects. One ``surtout,'' ornamentation for a grand
dinner table, is an 18th-century-style Nymphenburg porcelain
pyramid to which he added four antique blackamoor archers, much to
the consternation of Corbusier.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of his roof garden shows a carved oval picture
frame that was set outside to frame the glorious view of the
Champs. In 1939 he bought Groussay, a country house that had been
built in 1815 for the Duchesse de Charost. He spent the rest of his
life transforming it into a pleasure palace with help from his
friend Emilio Terry, a Cuban-born architect based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Because he carried a Spanish passport, the Germans did not
bother Beistegui during World War II. He spent the war decorating
and entertaining a small band of friends including Daisy Fellowes,
Cecil Beaton and Christian Berard.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite room was the two-story library. The sale includes
an Italian bronze gueridon in the Empire Style dating from around
1820 whose specimen marble top has a micromosaic head of Medusa
(sale estimate: $80,000 to $128,000) and an English oval convex
mirror from the early 19th century surmounted by a gilded set of
arms (estimate: $12,800 to $19,200).
</P>
<P>
   A handsome rare Louis XVI ``table a la tronchin,'' named after a
Swiss doctor who thought it was healthier to read standing up, is
made in plum pudding mahogany and is signed by Feuerstein
(estimate: $32,000 to $40,000).
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Salon has a pair of bronze-mounted white Meissen
porcelain pots-pourris circa 1750 (estimate: $128,000 to $192,000)
and an ebony and gilt bronze writing desk from around 1770 with
spiral-turned legs, which Sotheby's attributes to Rene Dubois, a
royal cabinetmaker who is considered a pioneer of the Louis XVI
style (estimate: $240,000 to $320,000).
</P>
<P>
   The Billiards Room has two impressive, massive mahogany desks,
including a cylinder desk with gilt bronze mount of circa 1785 made
by a Russian follower of the cabinetmaker David Roentgen (estimate:
$160,000 to $192,000). The Yellow Salon has a big, colorful
Savonnerie carpet, circa 1790, designed with Pompeian motifs
(estimate: $160,000 to $240,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very like an English country house, with staggeringly
wonderful objects,'' recalled Kenneth Winslow of Butterfield's, an
Englishman who spent three days there at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog, Aslet wrote: ``How was it possible for him to
have created a work of such sumptuousness at a time when almost
everyone else in the country was suffering the privations of war?
It is tempting to imagine that Beistegui conceived Groussay as an
essay in the arts of living, created at a time when the
civilization in which he believed seemed about to succumb to
barbarians.'' It is an essay worth reading.

<P>
   As American As, Well, Sex
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Forget that George Lucas film!
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely as it seems, the movie that has the town buzzing is an
oddball, funny, charming and sometimes gross comedy, ``American
Pie.'' The film, about teen-agers in the Middle West who are
struggling to inaugurate themselves into the ways of sex, marks the
feature-film debut of its screenwriter, Adam Herz, and its two
director-brothers, Paul and Chris Weitz. Only Paul gets the
director's credit on the film, because the Director's Guild is
extremely reluctant to give two people such billing).
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens on July 9, has been welcomed in early
screenings by mostly younger audiences. Studio executives around
town expect it to emerge as the sleeper hit of the summer, even
with a mostly unknown cast. But Universal, the studio that made it,
seems to be befuddled about it; the studio sold off rights to the
$11 million film in many foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, if not bizarrely, the movie has had rating
problems. The Motion Picture Association of America, which has
given extremely violent films an R rating, said at first that the
jokey sex talk and situations deserved a far more prohibitive NC-17
rating, which bars anyone under 17 from seeing the movie and
severely limits its distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back to them four times,'' Chris Weitz said. After
several editing trims, the ratings board reluctantly gave the movie
an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Weitz brothers themselves have a somewhat elite pedigree _
they are third-generation Hollywood _ although the film itself is
about as elite as ``There's Something About Mary,'' with which it
may be compared. The brothers' grandfather was the famous agent
Paul Kohner, who represented John Huston, Billy Wilder and Ingmar
Bergman. Their parents are the actress Susan Kohner and the fashion
designer John Weitz. Paul Weitz, who is 33, graduated with a film
degree from Wesleyan University, and three of his plays _ ``Mango
Tea,'' ``Captive'' and ``All for One'' _ were produced Off Broadway
by the Ensemble Studio Theater just as he left college.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Chris, 29, earned a bachelor's and master's degree
in English literature from Cambridge University in England, and
worked as a freelance journalist there. He then decided to join the
United States diplomatic corps. Although the State Department
accepted him, there was a one-year wait. So he began writing
comedies with his older brother, and the two have never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   Their early scripts, which opened doors in Hollywood and led to
several years as script doctors, included a comedy about a porn
director trying to make a legitimate movie, as well as a take-off
on buddy cop movies whose lead role was, of all things, a
nonviolent Hindu detective. They also collaborated on recent
screenplays, including the animated film ``Antz'' and the
children's movie ``Madeline.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``American Pie,'' the brothers were given the script by
the producers Warren Zide and Craig Perry, who are also talent
managers representing, among others, the screenwriter, Herz.
Despite the inexperience of the Weitz brothers, Zide said their
vision of the film was appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted adults to see this movie, too, and say how much it
reminded them of their high school years,'' Zide said. ``And our
goal was to appeal to girls as well as guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Paul Weitz said: ``The issue of female sexuality is
just not explored in the canon of high school sex comedies. But
girls are as curious as boys. Why not deal with that?''
</P>
<P>
   The two said their childhood had given them a sense of
wonderment about film directors because they met so many of them.
On one occasion, they went to the circus in New York with Ingmar
Bergman. In Los Angeles, they said, they often go to a revival
house to see Billy Wilder and John Ford films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tend to think about the oldies more than a lot of
people our age,'' Chris, left, said. Paul added, ``A lot of younger
people here aren't aware that there were great writers and
directors doing this years ago, and there was actually a world
before `Armageddon,'''
</P>
<P>
   The movie itself deals with a group of seniors at a high school
in Michigan who are desperate, in one way or another, to discover
sex. The boys are as hopelessly inexperienced and anxious as the
girls and endure numerous sexual mishaps and humiliations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our personal experience was not quite the same, except for the
extreme humiliation and total inability we had in dealing with the
opposite sex,'' said Paul, who attended the Collegiate School in
New York. His brother attended schools in London.
</P>
<P>
   But reluctantly the brothers did acknowledge similarities
between themselves and the boys in the film. In a scene near the
movie's opening _ one of the more benign scenes _ a boy is found by
his father watching a scrambled porn channel on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll cop to that,'' Chris said. ``Anything more extreme I
absolutely deny. You'll have to go to my brother for that.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother laughed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lemmon as Darrow &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spans 50 years, Jack Lemmon, a two-time Academy
Award winner, has played a dizzying number of film roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I was typecast as the comedic lead, the boy next door,''
Lemmon said. ``That was a long period for me. Then `The Days of
Wine and Roses' and `Save the Tiger' got rid of that. From that
time on, I got a lot of dramatic parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a lot of roles, but the thing that's eluded me so
far is playing a cop,'' he said. ``I don't know why I've never
played a serious role as a cop. In `Irma La Douce,' I sort of
played a cop, but that wasn't serious. I'd love to play a cop, a
detective.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon, 74, will have to wait just a little longer. He is to
appear as the Clarence Darrow figure in the drama ``Inherit the
Wind,'' on Showtime on Saturday at 9 p.m. The play, written by
Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, was a Broadway success in the
1950's during the McCarthy era when it had unmistakable relevance.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it was a fictionalized version of the Scopes
``monkey trial'' 74 years ago, in which a Tennessee schoolteacher
was prosecuted for teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to
students. The trial pitted the Presidential nominee, Bible scholar
and orator William Jennings Bryan against the nation's most
celebrated defense lawyer, Clarence Darrow. In the current
production, George C. Scott plays the Bryan character, and Beau
Bridges enacts the role of a reporter who in real life was H.L.
Mencken.
</P>
<P>
   The drama itself deals with religious fundamentalism, the
unbridled power of the media and, to some degree, mass hysteria.
Lemmon said, ``It's really about freedom of speech, the freedom to
think and express yourself in whatever way you want, the fact that
you can't throw someone in jail just because they're teaching
something you don't particularly like.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon said he had wanted to work for years with Scott, his
longtime friend. Last year the two appeared in the ensemble
television production of ``Twelve Angry Men'' on Showtime. This led
them to try to revive ``Inherit the Wind,'' which was also an
acclaimed 1960 Stanley Kramer film with, among others, Spencer
Tracy, Fredric March and Gene Kelly. It was remade in 1988 for
television with Kirk Douglas and Jason Robards.
</P>
<P>
   Why the continuing interest in the drama?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely beautiful play,'' Lemmon said. ``The words
are gorgeous. And those parts _ they're terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon acknowledged that he had been fortunate over his enduring
career to have so many terrific parts. His most memorable ones, he
said, included Ensign Pulver (an Oscar-winning performance) in
``Mister Roberts''; the alcoholic in ``Days of Wine and Roses'';
the troubled businessman in ``Save the Tiger,'' another
Oscar-winning role, and a salesman in ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' He
also cited his roles in the Billy Wilder films ``The Apartment''
and ``Some Like It Hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon said that he was being offered roles as a grandfather now
but that he wanted to reach beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to be a kindly old grandfather,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most important advice he ever got came decades ago
in New York from a Broadway character actor, Myron McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just done `Mister Roberts,' and I was pretty full of
myself, and I walked into Sardi's, and I saw Myron there,'' he
said. ``After a while he said, `Let's take a walk up the street.'
So I'm walking with Myron, my old buddy, and I'm talking nonstop
about me and ` Roberts,' and I just don't shut up. And finally he
stopped and said: `I'll bet we just passed about six young actors
since we left Sardi's, and all of them could have played Pulver
better than you. But you got the part.' And he just kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' Lemmon said. ``And he was right. There'll
always be someone who's as good as you or even better who didn't
get the part. But you did. And you're the lucky one. And don't
forget it.''

A DAVID PORTRAIT IN WILLIAMSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in
Williamstown, Mass., is unveiling its latest purchase Friday:
Jacques-Louis David's ``Portrait of the Count Henri-Amedee de
Turenne,'' from 1816. Not only is this the Clark's first painting
by David, the French neo-classicist, but it has not been publicly
seen for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Count de Turenne was an important officer in the French Army
who served as First Chamberlain to Napoleon. He was made a count of
the Empire in 1813 and led the retreat at Waterloo a year later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1816 David painted the count's portrait and in a letter said
he was ``amusing myself making easel portraits of M. le Comte de
Turenne ... who is passionate for the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   David's records show that this is the first of two portraits he
made of the Count. The second, a three-quarter-length painting, is
in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the Clark had been aggressively buying important
Old Masters recently, Etienne Breton, a Parisian dealer who is a
partner in the firm of Marc Blondeau, heard that the painting had
become available and contacted Michael Conforti, director of the
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was last seen in 1878 in an exhibition in Paris,'' said
Conforti. ``No photograph of it was ever published.'' The portrait
had, until now, remained in the sitter's family in a country house
in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It relates very well to our collection,'' said Conforti. ``We
have a Goya portrait and Jericho's `Trumpeter of the Hussars.' And
being able to get an unpublished portrait by David that is of equal
quality was both a surprise and a unique opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim at 9
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim visitors are early risers. Every morning museum
officials have noticed lines forming outside its Frank Lloyd Wright
building on Fifth Avenue, as crowds wait for the doors to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a substantial number of visitors from Europe who wake
up early,'' said Judy Cox, one of the Guggenheim's deputy
directors. So the museum will wake up early, too, opening at 9,
instead of 10. The change is to take effect on June 4, opening day
for ``Surrealism: Two Private Eyes, the Nesuhi Ertegun and Daniel
Filipacchi Collections.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum will still close at 6 p.m. on Sunday to Wednesday and
at 8 on Friday and Saturday. But the Guggenheim's SoHo branch will
not open earlier, Ms. Cox said, because downtown visitors tend to
show up later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are not the only change at the Guggenheim. Its stationery
and logo have been redesigned, too. ``We're trying for a consistent
graphic identify,'' said Ms. Cox. Now all the Guggenheims around
the world will have the same logo, but each with the word
Guggenheim in a different color: In New York it's a bright red, a
favorite shade of Frank Lloyd Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice is
green; Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin's is blue, and at the Guggenheim
Bilbao in Spain it's a metallic silver. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Change at Artist's Space &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Gould has resigned as director of Artist's Space, the
nonprofit institution in SoHo, after five and a half years.
Beginning on Sept. 7 she will become director of the Institute of
Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd done everything I could,'' she said. ``We're
on sound financial footing, having raised $1.2 million of an
endowment campaign.'' The institution has also just received a
$71,500 matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts for
its own endowment.
</P>
<P>
   And it has just published a book, ``5,000 Artists Return to
Artists Space: 25 years.'' Meanwhile, Virginia Cowles, chairwoman
of the Artist's Space board, said, the museum was in the process of
forming a committee to look for a new director.
</P>
<P>
   Topkapi Treasures
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of treasures from the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul
will travel to three American museums next year.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring art and objects from the royal home of the Ottoman
sultans, ``Palace of Gold and Light: Treasures From the Topkapi,
Istanbul,'' will first open at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington on March 1, then go to the San Diego Museum of Art and
the Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Palace Arts Foundation, based in Washington,
the show is to include more than 200 objects. ``This show sums up
everything the Ottoman Empire was in its heyday,'' said Walter
Denny, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
who has been an adviser to the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's highlights are a famous emerald and diamond
Topkapi dagger and an imperial throne.

 &HT;    TIVERTON, England _ At a time when the daily diet of news and
information is about war, hatred, crazed murders of schoolmates and
all the vile things we human beings are capable of doing, it is
good to be reminded that we can also be kind, helpful and
considerate. And how important that is to a whole society.
 &HT;    I suppose goodness isn't news because we like to think it can be
taken for granted. Still, when you see it, when you feel it, when
it is part of a country's image of the self it wants to be, it
evokes a feeling of gratitude. In this sense, England did well for
my Sheila.
 &HT;    For all the anti-welfare rigors of Thatcherism and planned
constraints of Prime Minister Tony Blair's ``third way,'' Britain
still can offer remarkably kind, effective care to those who are
suffering. It makes an enormous difference. To those who become
aware of it, it colors a whole society with a glow of warmth and
decency.
 &HT;    My daughter Sheila Gruson died last week, after living in
England for more than 15 years. She had breast cancer, and after a
year or so of the usual treatment which had no useful effect, she
began to need special care. When she broke her leg, because the
cancer got into some bones, the social services loaned crutches and
brought equipment into her home to help with getting in and out of
the bath and using the toilet.
 &HT;    Volunteers were organized to pick up her daughter (my
granddaughter) and take her to the school bus stop in the morning
and bring her home in the evening while Sheila was unable to drive.
Nurses visited Sheila at home and supervised the pain relief which
doctors ordered.
 &HT;    At the end, which suddenly went very fast, she was taken to the
Marie Curie Cancer Care Hospice in Tiverton, Devon, and was looked
after with gentle, dedicated attention focussed on making sure that
she suffered as little as possible. There are 11 such centers in
Britain and they are totally admirable, without the intimidating,
sterile atmosphere of a hospital and with rules that can take
account of the ill person's family and friends in a way that
hospitals cannot.
 &HT;    They do not charge at all, existing on a combination of public
funds and donations, and they spend less than hospitals do. When I
stopped by before leaving England to thank the nurses for their
understanding, soothing care, the Home Care Sister who had been
assigned to Sheila told me, ``We are very good at what we do.'' Her
name is Anne Hunneyball, a large, comforting woman who joked, ``We
have broad shoulders.'' She is completely right.
 &HT;    The Center is due to close in October for lack of funds, a
dreadful shame because it performs such a well-organized, necessary
service. My daughter, who had convalesced there after the operation
on her leg, knew about that and told me she was glad the place was
still open when she needed it.
 &HT;    We buried her near the town of Watchet, in Somerset, where she
and her daughter had lived before moving to Tiverton. The place was
called the Woodland Burial Ground, recommended by a funeral home
called Green Undertakings, and it is acutely sensitive to
environmental needs.
 &HT;    It is on a green hillside with a magnificent view of the rolling
valley and wildflowers in the fields. Trees are planted at the
gravesites and there are no headstones, only flat markers in the
ground. There is nothing morbid. There is rather a consoling sense
that death is part of nature too, and can be accepted as the needed
completion of nature's cycles, though it doesn't feel natural for a
parent to survive her child.
 &HT;    I won't go on much about Sheila here. She was a generous,
intensely intelligent, artistically talented, passionate person who
drew people to her and enhanced the lives she touched. But I was
moved by the outpouring of emotion from her friends and neighbors
and the feeling that there really was some community for her in
England, although they all had come from very different
backgrounds. It seemed that they really do care about each other
and the simplicities of love.
 &HT;    The health service, the social services, which make sure that
the society provides concern for all are crucial to that
willingness to leave none out. There is a point beyond which
individual enterprise, initiative and self-responsibility just
can't meet the human need.
 &HT;    Britain gains by the assurance that it is determined to go
beyond that point when it is required; other countries might well
take it as an example of decency and compassion, which are never
out of date.

   ADAM-YAHOO _ Adam.com has forged a deal with Yahoo that Adam's

new healthcare portal. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   COKE-DISCRIMINATION _ Plaintiffs in the racial discrimination
lawsuit against Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. plan are expected to
file motions today challenging Chairman M. Douglas Ivester's plans
to hold meetings with small groups of black employees to discuss
diversity issues. Plaintiffs lawyers also plan to complain that the
company is sending out letters to employees without a court-ordered
disclaimer that says: ``The foregoing represents Coca-Cola's
opinion of this olawsuit. It is unlawful for Coca-Cola to retaliate
against employees who choose to participate in this case. (Unger,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   CARSALES-HAULERS _ Last summer, it was the United Auto Workers
strike at General Motors Corp. parts plants that disrupted car
sales. This summer, it may be the Teamsters Union who throw car
sales into a skid. If the Teamsters strike _ and they have
threatened to do so at the end of Memorial Day _ the work stoppage
will hurt all the major automakers and many of their dealers, and
threaten what is shaping up to be a record year for vehicle sales.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A summery weather pattern will spread over a large part of the
nation during the next few days as the jet stream continues to
retreat north into southern Canada. Areas of substantial rainfall
will be confined to clusters of thundershowers which will roam near
the Gulf of Mexico and across parts of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn, a strong warming trend will begin over the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. Sunshine will be plentiful in
most areas, however, a few widely separated showers will develop in
New England during the late part of the day Friday and Friday
night. Little or no rain is expected during the next few days which
will exacerbate the unusually dry conditions which are beginning to
develop across these regions.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of clouds and scattered thundershowers will surround a
wavering front that separates humid air near the Gulf of Mexico
from drier air to the north. A few strong afternoon thunderstorms
will erupt in Florida where converging sea breezes force sultry air
to rise rapidly. Meanwhile, the interior Southeast and much of the
Middle West will be dry and warm under the influence of high
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms will form during the warmth of the
afternoon over parts of the southern Rockies, especially where
breezes ascend the sloping terrain in eastern parts of Colorado and
New Mexico. Farther north, a moisture-starved cold front will
produce some clouds and isolated showers near the mountains of
western Montana and eastern Idaho. In the wake of the cold front,
the Northwest will be windy with ample sunshine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Lightning and Cars
</P>
<P>
   An automobile is not immune to being struck by lightning. On
Wednesday, lightning struck a car in Bexar County near San Antonio,
Texas. One person was killed, though the exact cause of death was
not known. Yet a car is one of the safest places to be in a
thunderstorm if taking refuge inside a building is not feasible.
When lightning strikes a car, electricity is conducted along the
car's metal skin. It then typically harmlessly jumps to the ground
or flows through the tires to the ground. The notion that tires
ground a car and thus prevent a car from being struck by lightning
is false.

IMPRESSIONISM'S ICY BEAUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Think of the Impressionists, and chances are you
think green (or possibly pink, or lavender, or bluebird-blue in the
case of Monet). They were painters of lawns, hedges and fertile
fields, of a deciduous nature caught at full leaf.
</P>
<P>
   But like artists anywhere with rents to pay and mouths to feed,
they were year-round workers. And inevitably winter landscapes,
quickly brushed in the frosty open air or caught through the glass
of a studio window, figured in their repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige,'' which opens
Friday at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, brings together some 60 such
paintings. And if ever a show were tailor-made for summer viewing,
this one is. It's of perfect, modest, untaxing size. It has been
installed with plenty of elbow room to spare. And its deep-freeze
images of snow-covered fields and ice-caked trees are the visual
equivalent of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Impressionism needs a promotional hook. It has long
since been a shrink-wrapped cultural fixture and box-office gold.
And like any critic-proof phenomenon, it provokes its share of
resentment. Even this show's dutifully descriptive catalog ventures
a note of pique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most Impressionist paintings,'' one writer says of a
certain Monet, ``it asks nothing of the viewer, which is very
likely the reason it is so appealing to modern audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressionism may not demand much, but there's no question that
it offers a broad audience substantial rewards. Through a
material-rich, instantly recognizable painting style, it turns
everyday life into something exotic. Suburbs became mini-Edens.
Urban smog has a pulverized radiance. Workaday pleasures _ a
country walk, a spin on the dance floor _ assume a vibrant glamour.
</P>
<P>
   This is an art that projects a direct, uncomplicated sort of
beauty. It is Romanticism with the prickly bones removed, Realism
with fabric softener added. And, perhaps most important, this
beauty is dynamically theatrical: it delivers its full impact only
when experienced live.
</P>
<P>
   Hold a postcard of any Impressionist painting up to the original
and be prepared to wonder how on earth photography could get color
so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us back to this very beautiful show, which
was organized by the Phillips Collection in Washington and
coordinated in Brooklyn by Elizabeth Easton, the museum's curator
of European painting and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven brand-name artists are included: Monet, Pissarro and
Alfred Sisley are each represented by several works; Gauguin and
Gustave Caillebotte by a few, and Cezanne and Renoir by one apiece.
The work has been arranged more or less chronologically, beginning
with a very early snowy landscape _ or ``effets de neige,'' as the
motif was called _ by Monet, done in 1865 when he was living in
Honfleur.
</P>
<P>
   Monet was the outdoors type; a friend once found him dressed in
three overcoats and standing at his easel in a field on a
bone-crunching midwinter day. For the 1865 painting, he planted
himself in the middle of a country road and recorded what he saw:
low-lying farm buildings, snowbanks and trees, a cart up ahead, and
a huge expanse of sky.
</P>
<P>
   But light is the real subject here. He must have been working in
late afternoon. The snow is slate-blue, soot-gray, ivory-yellow,
anything but white. The sky is a rich, custardy mix of these colors
and tones but concentrates to an opalescent glow where the sun lies
below the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   This point of banked warmth can be seen _ sensed is more like it
_ all the way across the museum's gallery. It grows intense, even
brightens and dims like a mood ring as one moves in close, though
it is almost invisible in printed reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chromatic epiphanies of a similar kind abound in the show. A
nothing-special Pissarro street scene has a patch of electric Jacob
van Ruisdael-blue sky. A picture of an alley in the village of
Louveciennes by Sisley is a little chamber music ensemble of
russet, ocher and turquoise. The green-gray sky in Gauguin's ``Snow
at the Pont d'Iena, Snowy Weather'' has a scary, leaden feel like a
dark lid descending.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every painting, a stripped-down palette amplifies
individual colors and throws compositional structure into relief.
Such structure is most apparent where architecture is involved.
Caillebotte's vista of Parisian rooftops with chimney pots against
snow is an example.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Monet's wonderful ``Red Cape,'' a
frames-within-frames portrait of his wife, Camille, taking a stroll
and glancing in through a window as she passes.
</P>
<P>
   But winter makes nature itself look diagrammatic, and the
paintings reflect this. Many of Sisley's landscapes (one suddenly
sees) are geometric puzzles carefully pieced together around a
dominant foreground triangle, like his ``Snow Effect at
Argenteuil,'' with its giant, wedge-shaped shadow. And Cezanne's
single contribution, a woodland scene at Fontainebleau, is a
proto-Cubist mosaic of angles and faceted blocks.
</P>
<P>
   It is Monet, given pride of place by himself in the final
gallery, who most effortlessly blends structure and color and in
the process gives winter the metaphoric resonance that it has
always enjoyed in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the images are pure magic. The whipped-up white tree
branches in ``Frost'' look like a species of calligraphy, with
hair-fine strokes standing out in low relief. In the celebrated
paintings of stacks of wheat, each stack sits in its snowy field
like a Technicolor muffin on a breakfast table.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the mysterious pictures of ice drifting on the
flood-swollen Seine. These date from the winter of 1879-80, a
terrible time in Monet's life. His wife had died of cancer in
September. (In the unforgettable deathbed portrait he did, which is
not in the show, her face is shrouded by a snow-white veil.)
</P>
<P>
   His work had been clobbered by critics. And even the weather was
calamitous. After record snowfalls, a January thaw sent an
avalanche of ice careening down the river, leaving destruction in
its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Monet captured the aftermath of the disaster _ of all the
disasters of that fall and winter, one is tempted to say _ in two
very different paintings, each an exercise in minimalist
compositional and expressive color. In one, titled ``Breakup of the
Ice,'' white floes lie in becalmed water. Distant trees rise above
the flood like thin plumes of smoke. The sky and its reflection are
a benumbed, depressed blue-gray.
</P>
<P>
   From that same period comes ``Sunset on the Seine in Winter.''
The trees, dashed off in fading light, seem charged with static.
Floating ice looks as weightless as mist. The colors of the sky _
hot oranges, golds, pinks _ spread through everything like a high
flush, and at the center is a thick circle of scarlet paint, the
setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   The picture drew strong reactions when it first appeared; one
critic called the depiction of the sun ``a slice of tomato stuck
onto the sky.'' Viewers today are likely to approach it in other
ways. For some it will be read as a gauge of an artist's emotional
temperature. For others, it will crystallize the classic, defining
Impressionist vision of nature caught on the fly. For still others,
it will be an image of the world both extravagantly strange and
reassuringly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   In short, more than almost any other kind of painting,
Impressionism tends to yield what is asked of it. Maybe this
explains why it has been for a century and more the attraction it
is: an art for many audiences and for all seasons.

TONY STEWART TRIES FOR TWO WINS IN ONE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Tony Stewart is going for the daily double: a
win Sunday afternoon in the Indy 500, another Sunday night here in
the Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Stewart's attempt intriguing is that he has a
legitimate chance to win both, although the odds are certainly not
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   But his Indy car is competitive, and so is the Pontiac he drives
in NASCAR competition for Joe Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   It is questionable, given the concentration level required now
in both types of racing, whether any driver can divide his time
between stock cars and Indy cars and make a total effort in both.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, though, shrugs that off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've driven just about every type of race car there is,'' he
said. ``Once you leave pit road, you remember what car you're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has spent most of this month in a race car, about 25
days in fact.
</P>
<P>
   He came to stock cars from the Indy Racing League, which
features the Indy 500 as its top event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a young race driver from Indiana, it isn't hard for most
people to understand when I say that this is the single most
important race to me,'' Stewart said about the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could guarantee a win in any race in the world, I'd pick
the Indy 500,'' said Stewart, 28, who grew up in Columbus, about 45
miles from Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Stewart from wearing down trying to run both races,
Gibbs hired a personal trainer to work with him two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was crazy at first, but it's really worked to
improve my stamina,'' Stewart said about the trainer. ``I feel
stronger and more alert throughout a race, and I'm definitely not
as drained afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes strength training has improved his ability
to control his stock car and has helped his reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winston Cup is a whole new ballgame when it comes to physical
requirements for the driver,'' Stewart said.``I went from running
1,500-pound open-cockpit Indy cars a dozen times a season to racing
3,400-pound stock cars every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has also been on a high carbohydrate diet to build
endurance and offset the affects of traveling back and forth
between Indianapolis and Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be racing to win, so there's even more reason for me to
prepare myself as much as possible, both mentally and physically,''
Stewart commented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to keep a level head, and I've got to make sure my
body holds up.''
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of the two race cars.

TRANS AM UPHOLDS BAD-BOY IMAGE  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, MAY 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Pontiac Firebird Trans Am is today's archetypal
American muscle car: loud, fast, and in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Barely acceptable in polite society, Trans Am is a survivor from
a lost automotive era, along with sibling Chevy Camaro SS and rival
Ford Mustang GT.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call Trans Am a throwback. Some might ask, ``Hey, who
said dinosaurs are extinct?''
</P>
<P>
   Even General Motors has been muttering about doing away with the
F-body cars, as Firebird and Camaro are known internally. Too
heavy, too archaic, too aggressive, just too much.
</P>
<P>
   But others still get a thrill. Few things on the planet will get
a group of teenage boys to spin around faster than the thunderous
roar from those twin exhausts. Midlife hot rodders, nostalgic for
the muscle cars of the '60s, hear the call of the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Power and sex appeal, Trans Am's got 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car was the full-boat Trans Am convertible in sinister
black with the huge, flaring nostrils of the WS6 Ram Air package,
bright 17-inch aluminum wheels with performance tires, free-flow
dual exhaust and six-speed stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's that 5.7-liter V-8 cranking out a convincing 320
horsepower and 345 pounds of pure grunt, accompanied by the
aforementioned thunderous roar. Acceleration is of the
pinned-to-your-seat variety.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, just what the doctor ordered to perk up a Sunday
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Ram Air system, by the way, boosts engine power from 305
horses and 335 pound-feet. There's also a 200-horsepower V-6
available for the thrifty sort.
</P>
<P>
   As prehistoric as it may be, Trans Am certainly has come a long
way since it wore a big screaming chicken on its hood. Recently, it
was the recipient of a cosmetic face lift and some minor
performance tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can forgive most of its adolescent styling cues, such as
the honeycomb rear lights, figuring that it's all part of the
territory. But those big nostrils, with associated bulges that lead
up over the entire hood like big, square sinuses, are just way over
the top. Embarrassing, even.
</P>
<P>
   At least they are for this modest driver, who would like to
enjoy his midlife crisis in quiet humility.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get used to peering over those sinuses, put down
the automatic top, relax and enjoy the ride, Trans Am does exactly
what it's supposed to do. Which is: be fun. A hoot, even.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I was impressed with the power, and the enjoyable
six-speed tranny that came along with it. Six speeds? Well, one
through four are the usual driving gears, and fifth gear is the
normal .75 ratio overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's sixth gear. The ratio here is .50, meaning that
for each turn of the engine, the rear wheels spin twice. This gear
is so tall that when cruising at 75 on the freeway, the engine is
ticking over at about 1,500 rpm, just a rumble over idle speed.
</P>
<P>
   This translates to relaxed high-speed touring, and gas mileage
in the 28 mpg range. In case you're wondering why every automobile
doesn't have a similar setup, the answer is: torque. It takes the
low-end muscle of a mighty V-8 to make this system work.
</P>
<P>
   At speed with the top up, the Trans Am's cabin is quiet with
just a whisper of wind noise, a dramatic improvement over past
practice and the better to hear the fantastic optional stereo
system. With the top down, the large sweptback windshield keeps the
wind roar and buffeting to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The topless body feels generally tight and rattle-free, though
it occasionally sets up some shimmies on corrugated surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with Firebird and Camaro is the tight interior,
especially in relation to overall size. Front-seat legroom is just
acceptable, while the rear seats are a cruel joke. When they say
bucket seats in the rear, they mean it literally.
</P>
<P>
   One continuing complaint: For the past several years, the Camaro
and the Firebird each has a ridiculous hump on the passenger-side
floor. Everybody who gets in the car for the first time lifts up
the floor mat to see if I'm smuggling a meatloaf. I'm told the hump
is there to accommodate the catalytic converter below the floor.
There had to be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, handling is tight and aggressive. An improved handling
and traction-control system keeps the unwary driver out of trouble,
and does so without being overly obtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a disconcerting feel of twitchiness to the rear
suspension, as if it would like to perform some impromptu spins,
especially under braking. That's also a typical fault in this line
of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Trans Am is equipped impressively, I thought the
bottom line was way up there. There are plenty of great cars
available in the $35,000 range. And I don't think Firebird's
natural constituency is in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, once I got used to the mighty nostrils and settled
in behind the wheel, I found the Trans Am to be an enjoyable and
satisfying ride, though it takes a high level of self-control to
keep from mashing the gas pedal every chance you get. &QL;

KEN SCHRADER LOOKING TO BREAK OUT OF SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.) (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ There have been bright spots. Winning the pole
at Talladega, Ala., and finishing sixth in the April 25th race
there was one of them. But for Ken Schrader, the bright spots have
been few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway here,
Schrader stands 12th in points with three top-10 finishes. A year
ago after 11 races, Schrader was ninth in points with one top-five
and four top-10s.
</P>
<P>
   The only race this season Schrader has really been competitive
in was the Diehard 500 at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, is nothing new. For various reasons, Schrader has
been in a slide for several seasons. He has not won a race since
1991 and has not finished as high as second since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Schrader left Rick Hendrick, where he drove the
ill-fated Bud car, to go with a new team formed by Andy Petree, who
had been Dale Earnhardt's crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   If determination and drive could win races, Schrader would have
a bunch of victories because Petree has the determination and
Schrader will drive anything.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some have felt that has been one of Schrader's
downfalls. Schrader's job is driving race cars and his hobby is
driving race cars, and some think that's too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The move from Hendrick to Petree has not turned things around
for Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   In his third year in Petree's Chevy, Schrader has not finished
higher than third.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because Petree's team is still coming together.
Petree added a second car this season, driven by Kenny Wallace, and
hired Sammy Johns to be Schrader's crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season as a Winston Cup crew chief, Johns struggled
with a low-financed car owned by Buzz McCall his first two years,
but got to know Petree through a consulting agreement between
Petree and McCall.
</P>
<P>
   When McCall's team folded, Petree offered Johns a chance to take
over Schrader's car.
</P>
<P>
   The least experienced of the major players on the team, Johns
knows if Schrader doesn't do well, he could end up being the fall
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the situation I'm in,'' Johns said. ``If
I can't get the job done, they'll let me know, and if I can't get
the job done, I'll probably be the first one to let them know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a fortunate situation with Andy Petree. He's been there
and done it. He knows what's going on and he's a honest person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not winning every week, it's tough,'' Johns said.
``Everybody who works in this sport is doing it because they want
to win races. You just have to keep coming back and do all you can
to keep morale up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a team doesn't perform, there's a reason,'' said Schrader,
who's been driving full time on the Winston circuit since 1985. The
Fenton, Mo., native turns 44 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the driver and the crew chief together can't get the
job done, or the driver plain old can't drive, or the crew chief
can't make the car handle or get you in and out of the pits,''
Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, the crew chief could be the scapegoat, just like the
driver could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate in having Andy as a team owner,'' Schrader
went on. ``Andy has worked with some of the best drivers. He's won
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy can't go to Andy and say Schrader can't drive the car
because Andy knows better. I can't go to Andy and tell him the car
is terrible, Sammy can't make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate we don't have to worry about that because we
can't BS our car owner.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they can't, which gives them all the more reason to get
their car running up front.

ROMANTIC STROLL UP NOTTING HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Just because Julia Roberts plays a fabulous movie star
imprisoned by her face and fame doesn't mean she's playing herself
in ``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it doesn't mean she isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Julia adds a sense of honesty to her accustomed
luminescence, which makes ``Notting Hill'' one of the most
satisfying romantic comedies in years: witty, sweet and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts plays Anna Scott, a famous movie star in London to
promote a new film. She wanders into a small bookstore run by
William Thacker (Hugh Grant), a man with considerable wit but no
prospects for career or love life.
</P>
<P>
   Anna is rather taken with the ordinariness of his life,
William's self-effacing good nature and the supportive spirit of
his down-and-out friends, who like to compete to see who has the
most miserable life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setup and the movie's previews, ``Notting Hill''
isn't one of those automatic Hollywood romances where two
mismatched beauties fall madly in passion to the accompaniment of a
musical montage.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roger Michell (``Persuasion'') and writer Richard
Curtis have a bemused sense of the difficulties of finding real
love and how easily it can slip from your grasp. They keep the film
grounded in the impossibility of a romance between a creation of
celebrity and a normal guy: Anna can't uncomplicate her life, while
William can't believe his good fortune or that he deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   Michell uses their slowly evolving yearnings to pose a number of
intriguing questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Can an ordinary man find perfect happiness with the goddess of
his dreams?
</P>
<P>
   _If it's not quite so perfect, will he care?
</P>
<P>
   _What do you say when you find a naked movie star in your
bathtub?
</P>
<P>
   _What exactly is a stunt bottom?
</P>
<P>
   Writer Curtis, who also scripted Grant's ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral,'' understates the humor in that British way. His comic
style blends smoothly with the film's halting but touching sense of
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is expressively tender in a role that obviously means
much to her, as she conveys the burden that the dream places upon
the person who must live the reality behind the fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   As she did in ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' Roberts creates not
just passion with her co-star but a sense of real affection.
</P>
<P>
   Michell and Curtis have deglamorized Julia considerably to
demonstrate that, off screen, the most beautiful actresses are not
what they're lighted up to be.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is a natural as the funny but discomfitted Englishman who
finds humor in hesitancy and self-doubt while convincing us that
much of love is based on simple human kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' is an English production banking on an American
star to achieve popularity. Difficult to imagine Hollywood making a
romantic comedy this sweet, this touching and this unforced.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the movie slips up on one Hollywood cliche: Bookstore
owner has now replaced architect as the occupation of choice for
hopeless romantics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' should be equally agreeable to men and women.
While women enjoy the tenderness and humor of the love story, men
can imagine themselves in William's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' is misrated at PG-13. Although it contains no
nudity or sex, the film has ample enough profanity to have merited
an R rating. 4 stars. &QL;

FILMS TAKE A DIM VIEW OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 ( Note: Byline fixed to Whipp, sted Whipps)

By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We have seen the future _ and it stinks.
</P>
<P>
   In recent science-fiction movies like ``The Matrix'' and
``eXistenZ,'' tomorrow's earth is a desolate, disturbing and
thoroughly unpleasant place where virtual reality rules and free
will has been shunted off to some far and distant corner. Then
there's ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' arriving in theaters today, where
the future is OK (except for some tacky high-rise developments
along Southern California's coastline), but stupid humans still
muck everything up by creating virtual worlds with their computers.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying message: Get real. Because if it's not real, it's
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that the hard-core fans watching these movies
generally don't share that world view. All those people who went
back to see ``The Matrix'' again and again generally feel
comfortable with technology and confident about the future. And
yet, they can't seem to get enough of the film's ground-breaking
special effects and its heady (but ultimately dour) mix of
symbolism and cyber-technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interesting tension there,'' says Wired magazine
columnist Jon Katz. ``I don't think I've ever seen a technological
film that doesn't see the future as a dark, menacing place. I think
it's going to take a brave producer _ someone who isn't so cynical
about our world _ to wake up and finally make a movie that's both
hip and forward-looking and not so bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Katz didn't like the movie. The author, whose
books include ``Virtuous Reality,'' a spirited defense of
cyberspace and youth culture, has seen ``The Matrix'' three times.
His loyalty _ and that of moviegoers like him _ is one reason the
film has made more than $150 million since its release in late
March. A sequel is already in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The themes explored in this crop of virtual reality movies are
hardly new to the science-fiction genre or, for that matter,
television and popular movies. Rod Serling's anthology series ``The
Twilight Zone'' often had episodes in which characters examined
their surroundings with a suspicious gaze, believing they were part
of some kind of cosmic practical joke. (Usually they were.)
</P>
<P>
   Science-fiction writers such as Harlan Ellison and Philip K.
Dick also explored the blurring of reality and illusion in their
stories. Last year, ``The Truman Show'' successfully captured that
queasy feeling that life, as we know it, is a fake, staged exercise
in futility. It was one of the year's most successful movies.
</P>
<P>
   Technology only enhances the level and quality of the fakery. In
``The Thirteenth Floor,'' there are multiple virtual worlds and its
denizens are never quite sure whether their society is the original
or a computer copy. That kind of guessing game fuels the audience's
interest, much as it did in ``The Matrix'' and the excellent
Spanish movie ``Open Your Eyes,'' which opened in the United States
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted to keep the audience just a little bit in the
dark so they'd be wondering what's going to happen next,'' says
Larry Wachowski, who wrote and directed ``The Matrix'' with his
brother Andy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the film's hodgepodge of biblical and mythological
references and its bleak view of the future, Wachowski declines to
go into too many specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the audience to use their brains while they're
watching the movie,'' he says. ``The idea of `The Matrix' is that
it's too easy to live the unexamined life and not be aware of
what's going on in the world. And that can lead to a sorry state of
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in ``The Matrix,'' involves humans being kept awash in
amniotic fluid, blind and mute from birth to death, existing only
so their brain currents can power the machines that run the
universe. Meanwhile, the humans think everything is OK, living in a
virtual world that masks their dire plight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common motif in these virtual reality movies: Unaware
people blissfully plugged into illusory worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Which, say some social critics, is kind of like the Internet
and, to a lesser degree of involvement, television and movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already live in a kind of virtual reality,'' says author
Neal Gabler, whose latest book is ``Life the Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Littleton. There was kind of a seamless transition
between the video games Doom and Quake and the actions of Eric
Harris and Dylan Kleibold. When you live inside giant fantasies,
you are essentially living in first-stage virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz blanches at the correlation between video games and acts of
murder, but admits that he often feels a ``jarring sensation'' of
living in a parallel universe when he goes online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you do have to pinch yourself to know what is
real,'' Katz says. ``Going online is very empowering to some people
because they can assume personalities much different than their
own. And now you have people paying thousands of dollars on e-bay
for virtual personalities that they can use in games like Ultima
On-Line. The lines between fantasy and reality have definitely
blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's actually good news for studios making
technology-driven movies since a little familiarity with the
subject matter can go a long way at the box office. Witness ``The
Matrix'' or ``Open Your Eyes,'' a big hit in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``The Thirteenth Floor'' are keeping their fingers
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scripts for virtual reality movies have been floating around
for five or six years now,'' says ``Thirteenth Floor'' director
Josef Rusnak. ``We're seeing them now because people have caught up
with the technology. They understand it better. And that makes it
easier for them to connect with the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Centropolis Entertainment, the film's producers, decided to take
that audience know-how to the next level and hosted a ``virtual
premiere'' of ``The Thirteenth Floor'' Monday night. It all
followed to form _ movie stars walked down the red carpet, the
paparazzi shot their pictures and fans sat in the bleachers and
cheered for their favorites. There were even celebrity guests _
Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt among others.
</P>
<P>
   And none of it actually happened outside of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point these premieres begin to feel redundant,'' says
producer Dean Devlin, who partnered with director Roland Emmerich
on ``Independence Day'' and ``Godzilla'' and spearheaded the
cyberspace gala.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all these movies about virtual reality in the air right
now, it's weird that nobody has ever staged a virtual premiere.
Being uncharted territory, it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the next step? Virtual moviegoing?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Devlin laughs. ``Not profitable enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What the future might hold, if technophiles have their way, are
movies that depict virtual reality in a manner that isn't so
destructive and despairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These movies, particularly `The Matrix,' operate within a
convention that essentially says that happiness of a virtual
reality sort comes at the expense of free will,'' Gabler says.
``But that assumes we don't want those things, and I think we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy humming and with drugs like Prozac, we're
already on the road to purging a lot of the qualities _ anxiety,
loneliness, depression _ that make us human. Virtual reality will
probably take us to the next level. Yet you don't see any movies
that imagine the future that way. It's always the machines, not the
humans, who are in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Katz: ``We'll see one someday. Maybe it will take the `Star
Trek' people to go where no film has gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it lives long and prospers (in theaters), maybe others
would follow. &QL;

NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA COULD LOSE SOME PUBLIC TRANSIT FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York and California stand to lose millions of
dollars in federal transportation funds next year in the wake of a
Senate panel vote Thursday to cap the amount of money each state
can receive for subways and buses.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected move by the Senate Appropriations Committee drew
immediate criticism from California and New York lawmakers who
vowed they will try to reverse the funding formula.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of
California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer of New
York said they will fight the mass transit provision when the $12.1
billion transportation appropriations bill reaches the Senate floor
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., said he will work to ensure that the
provision isn't adopted in the House version of the bill. The House
has yet to take any action on its draft $12.7 billion
transportation bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures give each state funding for such transportation
projects as roads, bridges and mass transit for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1. The total for mass transit is $5.4 billion. The
measures also provide funding for the Federal Aviation
Administration and the United States Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new formula that the Senate Appropriations Committee
adopted Thursday for mass transit funding, California would lose
about $117 million and New York, about $160 million in fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The formula, devised by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., limits the
amount of money any one state may receive to 12.5 percent of the
total amount available for mass transit. Under the current formula,
New York would receive 15.5 percent of the total, or $837 million,
and California would receive 14.7 percent, or $794 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the new formula were to go into effect, both states would
each receive about $676.5 million next year in mass transit funds.
The other 48 states would receive about $5 million each in such
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his new formula, Shelby told his fellow committee
members that New York and California receive a ``disproportionate
share'' of federal transit dollars, according to a source who
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If his formula prevails, California and New York, which,
combined, now receive 30.2 percent of the total amount of federal
mass transit dollars, would be limited to a combined total of 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein noted that California and New York have almost half
the nation's public transportation riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transit is and should be a needs-based program,'' Feinstein
said, adding that the funding now ``goes to states that have the
most invested in transit and who have the most need.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney called the formula change ``unfair'' because it undoes
the existing formula that was agreed to last year ``after several
months of careful negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he plans to ask House Transportation Committee
Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., to work to ensure that the transit
formula is not changed as the House considers its legislation.
Shuster was the chief architect of the existing formula.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the transportation funding bill does not
change the transit formula. Any differences between the House and
Senate bills must be worked out in a conference committee of
lawmakers from both chambers before the overall measure can be
signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the San Francisco Bay Area could lose $27 million
and Los Angeles, nearly $48 million if the Senate version of the
bill prevails.
</P>
<P>
   A Sweeney aide said the Albany, N.Y., area would be cut by about
$2.2 million in mass transit funds. The cut would be primarily in
money for bus service, the aide said. In the current budget the
Albany area received $5.7 million for mass transit.

CHASING THE ELUSIVE GHOSTS OF DEEP ELLUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The streets of Deep Ellum are the province of rock
bands unloading their gear on the sidewalk, tony-looking couples
going into tony restaurants, college students dancing the night
away in funky clubs, suburban kids with an attitude, wearing black
T-shirts and cruising, looking to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Govenar's Deep Ellum, however, is rooted in the past and
its ghosts, which he still plainly sees: Blues pianist Alex Moore
and western swing acts playing long-gone juke joints; gospel
musician Blind Willie Johnson moaning ``Nobody's Fault but Mine''
on one corner; and legendary bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson
standing down there on Elm Street, just east of the Gypsy Tea Room,
where cars rumble overhead on the Central Expressway overpass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the phantom presence is; it makes you wonder
what was, what life happened here that no longer exists,'' Govenar
says, as cars shoot down the off-ramp toward downtown, and a couple
of homeless guys sip from brown paper bags nearby. ``Blind Lemon
stood right about here, and when he played, people gathered around
him. He had a tremendous presence. This is the nexus of past and
present, humor and fear, life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also one of the major sources for Govenar's inspiration.
His career has included filmmaking, directing the Dallas Folk
Festival, presenting conferences on American music in Paris, and
producing numerous CDs by folk and blues artists. Through it all,
the Boston-born Govenar, 46, has returned again and again to Deep
Ellum and the music and shadowy story of Jefferson to spark his
creative imagination. This week, that imagination delivers ``Blind
Lemon: Prince of Country Blues,'' a mixture of history and fiction,
music and dance that debuts at the Majestic Theatre's Experimental
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by Govenar six years ago and written over the past two
years with Dallas actor/director Akin Babatunde, ``Blind Lemon''
presents the legend and music of Jefferson as seen partially
through the eyes of Eli, a young, white blues researcher. We see
Jefferson in his prime, wandering the streets of Deep Ellum, and
then going to Chicago to cut the records _ among them ``See That My
Grave Is Kept Clean'' and ``Matchbox,'' the latter of which was
retooled by Carl Perkins and became a rockabilly staple.
</P>
<P>
   But we also see him as a myth, an archetype of the bluesman who
gave voice to his community and then disappeared off the face of
the earth. There is, for example, only one known photograph of
Jefferson, and the date and cause of his death have never been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   His mythical status suits Govenar and Babatunde just fine.
Govenar has been writing about the blues for years; his 1995 book
``Meeting the Blues'' was a thorough examination of the people and
forces that shaped Texas' blues sound, from Jefferson to Stevie Ray
Vaughan. This past spring saw the publication of ``Deep Ellum and
Central Track'' (University of North Texas Press), in which Govenar
and Dallas Morning News writer Jay F. Brakefield portray the
neighborhood in its wild and woolly prime.
</P>
<P>
   Babatunde, the founder and artistic director of the Vivid
Theater Ensemble, hails from Brooklyn and moved to Dallas nine
years ago. The only Blind Lemon he knew about was the
not-exactly-funky Deep Ellum bar of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The two met through a mutual friend, and Babatunde was perplexed
about why Govenar, a white guy from the East Coast, would care so
much about a long-gone black bluesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were working on it, I kept talking to Alan about the
nonlinear aspect of the play,'' says Babatunde, who directs and
stages the play, and who enlisted gospel/R&AMP;B singer David Peaston
to play Jefferson. ``The images are flashbacks, which is what
happened to me in doing this: What was this time like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I didn't know about him made this more
creatively engaging. For anybody who leaves the theater, we want
them to take what we think we know about the blues and go
investigate it. We want to spark the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Govenar emphasizes that Eli and his research of Jefferson are
not the focus of the play, which finds Jefferson/Peaston
encountering such people as Leadbelly and Johnson, and going to
Chicago to record.
</P>
<P>
   Because the blues is defined by the interaction of performer and
audience, Govenar says, much of the story is told through a ``Greek
blues chorus'' of various people, who at times challenge the man's
motives for investigating Jefferson's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the whole thing is a running repartee of the
ensemble _ what is true, and what isn't?'' he says. ``Why is Eli,
or anybody, doing this? Blind Lemon is the metaphor for not only
wanting to know about him but also about yourself _ the desire to
find out about more and not finding it right away. What is the
truth you find in the blues?''
</P>
<P>
   And the truth that Govenar finds, after all these years, is that
the music still speaks to him at a basic, emotional level. No, he
says, he's not Eli, not anymore. But it was that sort of quest to
understand a different culture _ and why he wanted to understand
that culture _ that fired his desire to write ``Meeting the Blues''
and do other projects related to Texas folk and blues performers.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Ellum, and by extension Jefferson himself, are the phantoms
that he has chased to find himself. And ``Blind Lemon'' is putting
that onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about the blues that makes it transcultural and
multicultural?'' he asks. ``That's the bigger question. We're just
putting that out there in this play, which I hope will be both a
touring stage show and a repertory piece for this area. Eli knows
he's dealing with the myth _ that he'll only find Blind Lemon in
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Lemon: Prince of Country Blues'' runs through June 12.
Show time is 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday at the Experimental
Theater in the basement of the Majestic Theatre, 1925 Elm St. in
downtown Dallas; there are also 3 p.m. Saturday matinees. Tickets
are $20, available by calling (214) 515-0543.

   FILM-WINSLOW BOY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ When writer-director David Mamet decided to direct a
new version of ``The Winslow Boy,'' he knew what he was doing. The
material, a warhorse of a play that has been performed at many a
high school, is about the troubles that befall a privileged London
family when its honor is assaulted. Winslow, 13, has been expelled
from the Naval Academy because he's accused of stealing. The family
gives up everything _ its money, its future _ to combat the attack
on its reputation that this charge becomes. This premise doesn't
sound like something that would attract a talent like Mamet. But
Mamet embraces the squareness of playwright Terence Rattigan's
drama and improves upon it. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in

</P>
<P>
   FILM-THIRTEENTH FLOOR &QL;

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Notting Hill'' is a meeting of the archetypes. Even
though it's supposed to be about a man (Hugh Grant) falling for a
woman above his station, a movie star (Julia Roberts) _ like a
fable in which a mortal tumbles helplessly into love with a goddess
and then learns how dangerous such an act can be _ Grant plays it
like a movie star. A very mannered movie star, perhaps, but anyone
who's seen him in ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' or any of the
other comedies, won't be surprised. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has

gnashing of teeth when Steven Spielberg's WWII epic ``Saving
Private Ryan'' didn't walk home with a Best Picture Oscar earlier
this year. Despite the film's well-deserved statues in five
categories, including Best Director, the coveted Picture award was
considered by most critics to be a lock. I'm of two minds on the
subject, disappointed in some ways but ultimately happy with the
way things played out. By TODD CAMP. Story has moved in ``e''

   FILM-WINSLOW BOY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ When writer-director David Mamet decided to direct a
new version of ``The Winslow Boy,'' he knew what he was doing. The
material, a warhorse of a play that has been performed at many a
high school, is about the troubles that befall a privileged London
family when its honor is assaulted. Winslow, 13, has been expelled
from the Naval Academy because he's accused of stealing. The family
gives up everything _ its money, its future _ to combat the attack
on its reputation that this charge becomes. This premise doesn't
sound like something that would attract a talent like Mamet. But
Mamet embraces the squareness of playwright Terence Rattigan's
drama and improves upon it. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in

though it's supposed to be about a man (Hugh Grant) falling for a
woman above his station, a movie star (Julia Roberts) _ like a
fable in which a mortal tumbles helplessly into love with a goddess
and then learns how dangerous such an act can be _ Grant plays it
like a movie star. A very mannered movie star, perhaps, but anyone
who's seen him in ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' or any of the

this year. Despite the film's well-deserved statues in five

COMPARING THE FAKE AND THE GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Western attitudes toward forgery have changed over
the centuries. In the 16th century, Vasari admired Michelangelo for
his ability to fake antiquities. The most famous forger in this
century, Han Van Meegeren, went to jail for painting fake Vermeers.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Vermeer partly because the public had recently begun to
admire him after centuries of neglect, and fakery thrives when
people are beginning to prize an art, a situation akin to new love.
</P>
<P>
   History being full of odd coincidences, it happens that Van
Meegeren was born roughly when van Gogh, his compatriot, moved to a
village called Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he was to be
under the care of a homeopathic physician, art collector and
amateur painter named Paul-Ferdinand Gachet.
</P>
<P>
   Gachet (1828-1909) is one of those curious figures of French
bohemia, an intimate of Courbet, the novelist Champfleury and
Baudelaire and later a friend to painters like Monet and Cezanne,
who at the time were unrecognized. He had a voracious and
indiscriminate appetite as a collector.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh described him as a strange man, a sad widower
disheartened by his medical work but excited by art. If Gachet's
name is familiar today it is probably above all because one of van
Gogh's portraits of him made front-page news in 1990 when it was
sold to a Japanese businessman for $82 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gachet tended to van Gogh after van Gogh shot himself, and
quickly removed the paintings that were left in van Gogh's room
after he died.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned Van Meegeren because the Gachet legacy, which is the
subject of a new exhibition at the Met, ``Cezanne to van Gogh: The
Collection of Dr. Gachet,'' has for decades stirred discussion of
deception and fakery.
</P>
<P>
   When the show opened in Paris a few months ago it prompted
another spate of newspaper articles. Did Gachet or his son, who was
also named Paul and was also a painter of sorts, forge pictures?
Did they, like Van Meegeren, capitalize on the public's sudden
enthusiasm for previously neglected masters, in this case Cezanne
and van Gogh?
</P>
<P>
   The questions arose because of the behavior of the son, a
recluse who spent his life (he died in 1962, at 89) tending his
father's legacy with pathological and paranoid zeal. He preserved
everything in the family house as if it were a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely did he let visitors see the collection, preventing
photographs of it. Its contents didn't become known until the
1950s, when, having discreetly sold off parts of the collection,
Paul bequeathed what remained of it to France. People inevitably
asked what, if anything, he had been hiding all those years.
</P>
<P>
   The present exhibition is considerably absorbed by these
questions. The heart of it consists of paintings (by Monet, Sisley,
Cezanne etc.) donated to France, which until now had never left the
country, supplemented by other works once in the Gachets'
possession. There are a few important paintings and some small,
pleasant surprises, like a Cezanne still life of green apples.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts have been expressed about several of the other
pictures on view, among them a spectacularly awful scene of cows by
van Gogh and a clunky still life by Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   The curators, Anne Distel and Susan Alyson Stein, argue sensibly
for authenticity: they say Paul's secretive nature provoked
unnecessary suspicions, that good painters have bad days and that
some of the pictures are simply bad, not fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may be true, although an exhibition that in large
measure invites you to contemplate the difference between fake van
Goghs and poor van Goghs is, as you might expect, not visually
thrilling. The show has an instructive value as an exercise in
comparative viewing, along the lines of the Met's previous
``Rembrandt/Not Rembrandt'' exhibition, and this is not negligible.
But mostly it's a hodgepodge of second-rate work with a handful of
great pictures among the curios.
</P>
<P>
   We see, for example, the paintings that the Gachets signed under
their pseudonyms, Paul van Ryssel (Gachet) and Louis van Ryssel
(Gachet's son), which are, more or less, in the styles of various
artists whose works they owned: Pissarro, Armand Guillaumin,
Cezanne and van Gogh. The Gachets also copied various works they
acquired, which they clearly marked as copies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gachet's hilarious version of Cezanne's ``Modern Olympia''
belies the idea that Gachet might ever have imagined himself to be
a capable forger. You see the difference between an original artist
and an earnest dabbler paying him homage. The fact that the Gachets
made and kept copies argues against any concerted program of
deception.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a book about van Gogh that Dr. Gachet intended to
write, additional copies of the collection were made by a woman
named Blanche Derrouse, a family friend. These are in the
exhibition, too, with artifacts like van Gogh's palette and vases
and silverware that were the basis of several van Goghs and
Cezannes in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Like all relics, they have an extraordinary talismanic appeal
that often exceeds the attraction of the pictures on view. In
particular there's something about the authenticity of these
objects _ their direct contact with the artists _ that inevitably
returns a visitor to the question of the authenticity of the
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar romance of forgery will no doubt attract many
people to the show, particularly attached as it is to alluring
names like Cezanne and van Gogh. Fakes have endless popular appeal,
which supersedes any debates about a show's overall quality. And
maybe this isn't such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Forgery is a measure of our shifting values. Fakers in previous
days forged religious relics. Now we have counterfeiting of
brand-name products, like Rolex watches and Chanel bags. Does this
tell us something about ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   Whether the authenticity of the Gachets' collection will be
resolved to everyone's satisfaction will depend on whether someone
someday steps forward with irrefutable evidence. Many fakers have
become known because the faker confessed, sometimes even having to
overcome experts who refuse to believe the confession.
</P>
<P>
   Van Meegeren's fakes, which now look comically implausible, were
identified only because he was arrested in 1947 for selling art to
the Nazis. A Vermeer in the collection of Hermann Goring was
discovered to have been owned by Van Meegeren. To exonerate
himself, he had to prove that he had faked the picture by painting
a Vermeer in court.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question that everyone asks remains: What
difference does it make? If a picture is admired before it is
revealed to be a fake, isn't it still admirable afterward?
Esthetically speaking, Michelangelo's fake antiquity would be as
good as any genuine antiquity. Isn't the esthetic value of a work
finally independent of who made it?
</P>
<P>
   No. No matter how much we think art can be judged purely in
visual terms, it's a commodity. Authenticity is a measure of market
value, a peculiarly Western idea that we impose even on works from
other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   What we call primitive art, for example, may apply to an object
made not by an individual but by a group of people mimicking a form
with no thought about originality. Over the years the object may be
reworked and repaired until it is no longer recognizably what it
was, then discarded.
</P>
<P>
   But in our marketplace its value is nonetheless based on
standards of invention, individuality, authenticity and so on. This
is our way of measuring quality.
</P>
<P>
   And quality is about faith. We value a van Gogh to the extent
that we may trust it is by him. For good reason, fakery is
sometimes likened to sex: admiring a fake, it's said, is akin to
making love in the dark to someone who turns out to be the wrong
person. That is, art appreciation, on a basic level, is
transactional and not simply esthetic. It demands trust.
</P>
<P>
   Fakes loosen our foothold in reality because they mix with true
objects to infect the historical record. Sometimes, in the case of
forged documents, they can actually change history itself: the
``Donation of Constantine'' and the ``Protocols of the Elders of
Zion'' are two such fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A forged Egyptian statuette from Rhodesia that at one time was
taken as proof of Egypt's presence there changed the way history
was imagined. Likewise, as we've seen in recent books and
exhibitions, Stalin tried to alter history by eradicating Trotsky
from photographs of the Russian Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The philosopher Nelson Goodman, who died recently, wrote
influentially on this subject. He once compared the relationship
between a genuine painting and a forgery with that between an
edible mushroom and a poisonous one. To think that the difference
is merely esthetic or superficial is to be dangerously ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can either look harder for the difference,'' he wrote, ``or
avoid paintings and mushrooms entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Gachet show tells us anything, it is that even mediocre
paintings have a purpose, which is to give us a firmer grasp of
genuine greatness.

WHAT'S AT THE MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BESIEGED,'' &LR;  starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis.
Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (R, 92 minutes). Like all
Bertolucci's films, the love story of an expatriate African woman
(Ms. Newton) fleeing an oppressive military regime and the
reclusive British pianist ( Thewlis) for whom she works as a
housekeeper in Rome is a visual jewel. Based on a short story by
James Lasdun, ``Besieged'' is a film of few words and powerful
images. (Especially of a military coup in an impoverished African
country.) The love is sealed through an extraordinary act of
self-sacrifice and a deepening appreciation of each other's tastes
in music. If this elliptical movie leaves too much unsaid, it has
strong understated performances by its two stars (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COOKIE'S FORTUNE,''  &LR; starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Nel, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert
Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and
guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic
return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and
completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a
wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel
niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest
friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and
appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman
makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,''  &LR; starring Elodie Bouchez and
Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French
with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EDGE OF 17,''  &LR; starring Chris Stafford and Tina Holmes.
Directed by David Moreton (not rated, 100 minutes). It's 1984 in
Sandusky, Ohio, and Eric (Chris Stafford), a skinny, fresh-faced
high school student who worships the Eurythmics and Culture Club,
has his first homosexual experiences. This is not boy-meets-boy
(Romeo meets Romeo and they fall madly in love) but boy is used and
confused and tries to go straight by sleeping with his former
girlfriend. The teen-age coming-out story is realistic but
warmhearted, the best among the recent gay coming-out films
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ELECTION,''  &LR; starring Matthew Broderick and Reese
Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the
acerbically funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic
satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting.
Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms.
Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from
Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless
good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs
to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's
reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a
lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay
specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off what they
actually mean (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ENTRAPMENT,''  &LR; starring Sean Connery and Catherine
Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy
caper summons the days when being a thief was the profession of
choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the
great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly
investigating Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones
makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right. No need
to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's enough
verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on the
eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of
the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And
here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE LOVE LETTER,'' &LR;  starring Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner,
Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Everett Scott and Tom Selleck. Directed by
Peter No-sun Chan (R, 88 minutes). Cathleen Schine's whimsical
romantic novel about a summer affair between a divorced bookstore
owner (Ms. Capshaw) and a college student half her age ( Scott)
bleaches out pungent ruminations on May-September love in favor of
a bland cuteness. The teeny-weeny story revolves around an
unaddressed, unsigned love letter that floats into people's lives
and recharges their romantic fantasies. The dialogue is flat, the
level of the acting grade-B sitcom (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MATRIX,''  &LR; starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the
film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with
a big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,''  &LR; starring Rupert Everett,
Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer and Stanley
Tucci. Directed by Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This is
potluck Shakespeare, with a wildly uneven range of performances and
no clear style holding them together. Rather than wonder why the
actors are wrestling with bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a
setting used much less enchantingly than it might have been), it's
best to focus on the most comfortably Shakespearean performances
and not wonder what Ms. Flockhart is doing here. Kline makes a
perfect Bottom, Everett slinks seductively through Oberon's role
and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The
younger cast members are largely used as window dressing for the
Leo-Does-Romeo set (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MUMMY,''  &LR; starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent
spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror
classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an
unwieldy hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and
Costello Meet the Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.'' The
intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that
carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed
English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother).
It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming
scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful ``Alien''-like
things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MOVIES-IN-BRIEF-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Holden. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE''  &LR; (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner) and Judi Dench (best supporting actress).
Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily
literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only
gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as
Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into
razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,''  &LR; starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 miutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,''  &LR; starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame
Maggie) who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously
relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted
from a chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of
English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War
II. Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of
the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are
shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves
carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest.
Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving
wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THIS IS MY FATHER,''  &LR; starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and
James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes). Made with
obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago schoolteacher (
Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish forebears ( Quinn)
involves a third Quinn brother as well. And Declan Quinn's
cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric, sentimental tale
featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Colm
Meaney) in cameo roles. Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a
lonely farmer in love with a fiery young lass from a prosperous
family, does a lot to help the film override its hackneyed elements
and keep it moving (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE WINSLOW BOY,''  &LR; starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon
and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with
unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works
as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a
cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of
that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully
lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets
the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge
(Maslin). &QL;

`STELLA ADLER ON ...': VOTARY OF STANISLAVSKY AND CHAMPION OF
CHEKHOV 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an actress and, most importantly, as a teacher of acting,
Stella Adler was one of the most influential artists in the
American theater. Through her classes, she trained several
generations of actors, including Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and '80s, she gave a series of lectures to
theater professionals, and from them Barry Paris has compiled the
book, ``Stella Adler on Ibsen, Strindberg and Chekhov.'' As the
title indicates, this is primarily Adler's instructive advice on
how actors should approach roles in works by three seminal modern
playwrights. The book also serves as an introduction to Adler and
her extravagant personality. One regrets never having seen her
perform, but reading her on these writers, especially Chekhov, is
the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   She derived her realistic techniques directly from Konstantin
Stanislavsky and not from Lee Strasberg. From Adler's vantage point
as a founding member of the Group Theater, Strasberg misled actors
through his egotism and his insistence that they mine their own
experiences for use in their art. For her, the emphasis should be
on the character, not the performer, and the text of the play is
only the beginning. It is the actor's mission, as a creative
artist, to draw a full portrait, before the character comes on
stage and in terms of the physical and emotional attributes one
chooses to stress in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Forged in the heady atmosphere of her celebrated theatrical
family (whose patriarch was Jacob Adler, an actor at the pinnacle
of the Yiddish theater), she had a fierce dedication to her craft.
Harold Clurman, who was married to her for seven years, was
enraptured with her, extolling her in his book ``The Fervent
Years'' as ``a living symbol of so much I treasured in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as she approached 80 _ she died in 1992 at the age of 91 _
she was a striking woman. I remember talking to her for a profile
of Clurman I was writing. She received me in her elegant Fifth
Avenue apartment. Candlelit, it was the most theatrical of
settings, and she exuded glamour along with a kind of radiant
intelligence about theater and her place in it. In contrast to
Clurman, she was not a writer. But she gave of herself passionately
in her classes.
</P>
<P>
   As transcribed and then edited by Paris, these lectures have a
certain spontaneity _ at moments we feel as if we are in the studio
with Adler _ but they are also diffuse and repetitive. The fact
that they are undated leaves the reader somewhat adrift about
specific references. Because the book is drawn from tapes and not
from written notes, they are far removed, for example, from
Vladimir Nabokov's artfully composed classroom lectures on
literature.
</P>
<P>
   The section on Ibsen, focusing on two plays, ``A Doll's House''
and ``An Enemy of the People,'' offers insights, particularly when
she is dealing with the character of Nora, but it lacks the rigor
and acuity of Clurman's own brief critical book on that playwright.
With Strindberg, the slightest of the three entries, she strikes a
provocative comparison between ``The Father'' and ``A Doll's
House.'' The former, she says, represents ``the revolt of the male
against the tyrannical female,'' and the latter, the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   With Chekhov, she makes her most original observations. The
scene-by-scene analysis is an illuminating guide to the plays and
to the power of the playwright to reveal reality through indirect
action. For actors and directors and for theatergoers seeking a
greater appreciation of the plays, this section should be an
invaluable resource.
</P>
<P>
   That value derives from her intense love of Chekhov and her
intimate understanding of the motivations and the milieu (in
contrast to her treatment of Ibsen and Strindberg). For her, ``The
Seagull'' is very much a play about theater people. As she
discusses the relationship between Konstantin and Arkadina _ the
son's intellectual snobbishness, the mother's obsessiveness about
her profession _ she could be talking about herself and the people
she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Konstantin and his play are a social embarrassment to
Arkadina,'' she says. ``She is irritated by the play, by his age,
by his bringing in a young pretty girl who in two years will want
to take her place.'' She continues, ``Actresses must remain the
same, and this is very annoying to the boy.'' Therefore, they are
``in eternal, psychological strife.'' Illustrating Arkadina's sense
of pride, she retells an anecdote about her own mother. When asked
by a reporter how she could have a son of 38 when she was only 48,
Sarah Adler replied, ``He lives his life and I live mine.'' Her
daughter comments, ``Very witty and very applicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing ``The Cherry Orchard,'' she says that the great theme
of Chekhov is ``the destruction of beauty in the world.'' With
``The Three Sisters,'' which she regards as his masterpiece, she
links Chekhov with Tennessee Williams: ``Chekhov is able in one
sentence to convey the most shattering experience _ the suffering
of having lost yourself without it being your fault.'' For her,
Blanche in the last act of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' becomes a
Chekhovian figure: ``Chekhov says, finally you must accept your
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in detail about the characters, in effect she tells us
how she would play them: Arkadina and Ranevskaya, and each of the
three sisters as well as Natasha, the ``utterly vulgar'' provincial
who assumes control of the Prozorov household. She even seems to
undertake the male roles, with a special understanding of the
various doctors who populate the world of Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   Chekhov had, in his words, ``iron in the blood,'' the power of
survival ``in order to get past what is defeating you.'' Clearly,
Stella Adler also had that in abundance. This book offers a
sampling of the brilliance of her teaching. What is still needed,
of course, is a full recounting of Adler's extraordinary life in
the theater.

DEVIL RAYS SADDLED WITH SEVERAL WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ A question comes to mind after three
glorious days in the greater Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world did baseball ever decide to expand here?
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, the exorbitant $130 million expansion fee that the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Arizona Diamondbacks were forced to
hand over to their eager fellow owners.
</P>
<P>
   Money is ever the driving force behind decisions made by Major
League Baseball. It's why the baseball owners are seriously
considering putting advertising on uniforms. The more money they
make, the more money they can put into player salaries, always
forgetting that it's not a lack of revenue that has created the
serious problems, but the way the rather-bountiful revenue is
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Devil Rays are in danger of becoming just another
small-market team unable to keep up with the big boys, especially
since they're stuck in the same division as the behemoth New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays are making an honest effort, having plunged into
the free-agent market to sign Fred McGriff, Wilson Alvarez, Jose
Canseco and Roberto Hernandez. General manager Chuck LaMar also has
done an admirable job putting together a strong organization with
some pretty decent young players.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a good sign that the Devil Rays are ninth in the
league in attendance, drawing 19,485 per game through 23 home
dates. That's only 1,000 or so ahead of the Kansas City Royals, not
exactly the franchise you want to be compared with these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays' marketing department is trying, but Christmas in
May and a Labor Day special where all pregnant women get in free
smacks more of desperation than innovation.
</P>
<P>
   One problem _ and there are many _ is that St.
Petersburg/Pinellas County (pop. 851,659) is becoming almost the
sole supporter of the team as interest in Tampa and other places
dwindles.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Vince Naimoli already has been forced to squelch a rumor
the team was thinking of moving _ where could they possibly go? _
but he did meet with St. Petersburg Mayor David Fischer and Tampa
Mayor Dick Greco about ways to drum up more support.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the efforts are directed at Tampa and Hillsborough
County, a 22-mile drive to the northeast. Many of the 830,000
residents there are unwilling to make that drive because it's too
far and _ surprise, surprise _ tickets are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Another troubled spot is an area that includes the Sun Coast
resort cities to the south: Sarasota, Bradenton, Port Charlotte and
Fort Myers, another area with more than 800,000 residents. These
should be Devil Rays strongholds, but the team can't even get their
cable games televised there.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays are on SportsChannel Florida, but cable systems
in those areas carry the Sunshine Network, which shows the
cross-state Florida Marlins. SportsChannel Florida, trying to get
Sarasota to switch, regularly runs ads in the local newspaper
advertising Devil Rays games with the plea, ``See what you're
missing?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Tropicana Field, which is not a field but a domed
stadium. Naimoli spent $60 million upgrading the place, adding a
cigar bar, a left-field upper deck known as ``The Beach'' and an
Ebbets Field-style rotunda at the center-field entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But it still is a domed stadium, and the roof is not retractable
unless the right-sized hurricane comes along. Domed stadiums, as
every other team in baseball knows, went out of style a long time
ago, but the Devil Rays are facing a 26-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is the country's fourth most-populous state, but many
residents are senior citizens on a fixed income, and two major
metropolitan areas _ Orlando and Jacksonville _ are too far away to
be of significant help to either the Devil Rays or the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Naimoli said the Devil Rays are committed to building a
championship team for the Tampa Bay area, but this franchise is 2
years old and already in trouble.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Winning the Indianapolis 500 has been a lifelong
dream for Tony Stewart, a homegrown Hoosier from Rushville. But
Stewart's budding NASCAR Winston Cup career and his commitment to
drive the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac for car owner Joe Gibbs at the
Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., Sunday posed a conflict with his
desire to drive his own car in the 83d Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Until Gibbs came up with a solution: Why not drive in both
races?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed my contract with him two years ago, Joe actually
was the one that brought up the Indianapolis 500,'' said Stewart,
28. ``I didn't even bring it up. He said, `I know how much of a
dream it is for you to run Indy, and I want you to be able to do
that as long as you like to.' So I guess that's what his
involvement is; it's his willingness to let me come here and run
this race.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gibbs's blessing and support, Stewart will attempt to run a
grueling marathon by driving in both the Indy 500 during the
afternoon and the Coca-Cola 600 that evening. Talk about May
Madness. CART driver Robby Gordon and Roberto Moreno will also pull
double duty this weekend by driving in the Motorola 300 CART race
in Madison, Ill., then starting in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   But their whirlwind weekend will not compare to Stewart's, who
will attempt to turn his double play on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday, Stewart will pilot the No. 22 Home Depot
Aurora-powered Dallara he co-owns with Tri-Sports Motorsports
partners Larry Curry and Andy Card and start 24th in the 33-car
Indy field. Barring unforeseen circumstances, Stewart will climb
out of his Indy car after completing 500 miles, fly by charter jet
to Charlotte, climb into his Winston Cup car, start from the rear
of the field, and drive another 600 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Total mileage for the day: 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't know how difficult it's going to be,''
said Stewart, who sucessfully completed a dry run last weekend when
he overcame a one-hour rain delay, qualified for Indy with a
four-lap average of 220.653 miles per hour, then flew to Charlotte,
where he won The Winston Open qualifying race and finished second
to Terry Labonte in The Winston all-star race. ``Because I've never
done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The last driver to run both races was John Andretti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart would be the first to complete all 1,100 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty worried when I went to bed Saturday night,''
recalled Andretti, who finished 10th in the 1994 Indy 500, then
flew by private jet to Charlotte and, though he qualified ninth,
was forced to start at the rear of the field because he was unable
to attend a mandatory drivers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti wound up 36th when he dropped out after 220 laps with a
cracked shaft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weird thing was, I usually go to bed worrying about the
race car,'' Andretti said. ``That night, all I worried about was
the weather. I was worried that it might rain in Indianapolis and
it might not rain in Charlotte. A rain delay in Indy was going to
make it really tough to make the start of the race in Charlotte. A
rain delay in Charlotte, at least at the start, was going to make
it a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up Sunday morning and saw the sun shining in
Indianapolis, I was pretty relieved. I knew then we could pull it
off and get everything done. We could run all day at Indianapolis
and still have time to make the race at Charlotte. Once I saw that
sunshine, race day became the easiest part of the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the weather. It can be unpredictable in these parts at this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart awoke last Saturday morning for pole day at Indy,
he was greeted by rainy skies which caused a one-hour delay in the
start of time trials. It was an hour Stewart, already on a tight
schedule, could not afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Stewart drew the No. 2 spot in the qualifying
lineup and was the second to take the track for a qualifying
attempt and first to make the field. He wasted little time in
departing Indy, driving a police-escorted van to the airport, where
Gibbs's private jet was waiting to whisk him to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   He was airborne at 12:50 p.m., just 40 minutes before Curry's
self-imposed deadline of 1:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude about his whole two weeks is that it's going to be
an unforgettable two weeks of my life that I've enjoyed
thoroughly,'' Stewart said. ``So I'm just enjoying it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But pole day was just one obstacle with which Stewart and Curry,
his former chief engineer at Team Menard, were forced to contend
when they arrived at Indy. First, Stewart had to win a court
decision over his former IRL car owner, John Menard, who filed suit
claiming Stewart was still contractually obligated to drive for him
at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Thursday during a late-afternoon practice run,
Stewart crashed his primary car, slapping the wall between Turns 3
and 4 and causing light damage to the right side. A year ago, he
had been a moody sort who wouldn't have had the patience to explain
his blunder to the media, but he was a changed man _ humble,
contrite, and yes, even patient _ when he arrived at the trackside
conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely still hard on myself,'' he said. ``I guess I'm
still a driver in training to a certain degree. I definitely didn't
win any Mr. Congeniality awards last year by any means, and I
apologize for acting like that. My team and my engineer give me 100
percent, and I want to give them 100 percent back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is but a small price to pay for a boyhood dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of races that are important to me that I still
want to try and win in my lifetime,'' Stewart said. ``But I would
say that if I could only guarantee that I was going to win one of
them, this would be the one that I would pick. You know, it's the
most important race of my life.''

WHITNEY GIVES UP A GIFT, AND COMPETITORS BLANCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Minn., Texas)  (rk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the hammer came down on the sale of Alexander
Calder's ``Constellation'' at Sotheby's on May 18, there was joy in
the auction room. The painted wood and wire sculpture fetched $1.9
million from an anonymous private collector, more than double the
pre-sale estimate of $600,000 to $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one problem. The work had been promised to the
Whitney Museum of American Art in 1981 by its owners, Theodate and
Scott Severns. Considered to be the most sophisticated work in
Calder's constellation series, it was commissioned in 1943 by Mrs.
Severns and her brother, architect Philip Johnson, for their
Manhattan home. It is one of four Calder works in the catalog for
``The American Century: Art and Culture, 1900-1950,'' the Whitney's
current blockbuster exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move that has stunned people in the art world, the
museum has permitted ``Constellation'' to slip from its grasp. Mrs.
Severns, who is 91 and is ill, could no longer afford the gift and
asked for relief. Instead of structuring a deal that both helped
Mrs. Severns and kept the work, the Whitney decided that it could
be sold, potentially undermining the concept of promised gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets an extraordinary precedent for the diminished
importance of promised gifts,'' said a retired museum director who
insisted on anonymity. ``It means you can play with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell L. Anderson, the Whitney's director, defended the
museum's action as a necessary ``renegotiation of a promised
gift.'' He could think of no exact parallels, he said, but added
that museums have on occasion restructured pledges privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to lose the work, but over the course of 20
years things can change,'' Anderson said. ``We have a rich Calder
collection. It's a loss to us, but it's not a crisis to the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale began several months ago when Johnson approached his
lawyer, Joel S. Ehrenkrantz, who is also the president of the
Whitney's board. Johnson told Ehrenkrantz that Mrs. Severns needed
round-the-clock care, and that she and her husband, a semi-retired
dentist who is 76, had limited financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dilemma because the Whitney had documentation of a
promised gift that it received from a donor in good faith,''
Ehrenkrantz said. ``But there's a moral issue here: how to deal
with an ill, financially needy person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenkrantz said he discussed the situation with Anderson and
Arthur Fleischer, a lawyer who is chairman of the Whitney board's
legal and ethics committee. They decided the solution was to
establish a trust with the proceeds from the sale of
``Constellation'' and to give the Severnses the interest income for
the rest of their lives. ``The Whitney will receive the balance of
the principal when they both die,'' Ehrenkrantz said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Anderson said the board's executive committee approved
the deal without dissent. ``We will gain handsomely, financially,''
Anderson added.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum has lost ``Constellation,'' which has twice been
on view at the Whitney, in 1991 and in 1976, when as part of a
traveling show called ``Calder's Universe'' it also went to museums
in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ```Constellation' is unique in Calder's career,'' said Richard
Marshall, an independent curator who worked on ``Calder's
Universe'' when he was employed by the Whitney. ``It's a
spectacular work, the largest and most complex wall piece, derived
from Miro's work at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at other museums, who insisted on anonymity, said
that the Whitney should have structured a different deal. The
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art in
Chicago have each sued to enforce promised-gift agreements, though
financial need was not a consideration in either dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Whitney ``could have bought an annuity for her
and kept the work,'' said one of the administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenkrantz rejected the idea of an annuity. ``You don't know
how much that would come to; she might live another 10 years,'' he
said.``The museum would really be buying the object. Although the
museum really covets the work, the museum doesn't want to be in the
insurance company business.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen E. Weil, a senior scholar at the Smithsonian
Institution's Center for Museum Studies, said he was surprised at
the museum's course of action, but did not censure the Whitney.
``If the person honestly can't afford to give the gift, and the
museum found a middle way, it sounds kind of creative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in another decision that may rankle museum purists, the
Whitney's executive committee did not commit the museum to using
the money it eventually receives from the sale for acquisitions,
Ehrenkrantz said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when a museum sells an artwork, standard practice
dictates that it use the proceeds solely to purchase additional
art. While technically the Whitney is not deaccessioning
``Constellation'' _ it never formally accepted it into its
permanent collection _ the rule might still be expected to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money goes to the board to be used for board-designated
reasons,'' Ehrenkrantz said. ``The executive committee will decide
what to do with it. We said it will be up to the board at that
time, though there is strong feeling that it will be used for
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that his solution was not desired by Mrs. Severns or the
Whitney, Ehrenkrantz called it a compromise. ``We tried to be very
compassionate,'' he said. ``The institution will never benefit as
much as it would have, but at least we'll have the opportunity to
take a substantial sum of money in the future and buy a Calder or
another work of art.''

Gingrich is injecting himself into the 2000 presidential campaign,
suggesting that the Lincoln-Douglas debates of the mid-19th century
are a better model for sorting out candidates than the

which each contender is allowed to present a 15-minute speech on a
prearranged topic, and then answers questions for five minutes. 2.

LOYALISTS STAND BEHIND MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Sitting on a plush couch in the lounge of a hotel
here late Wednesday night, Zeljko ``Arkan'' Raznatovic used a
remote control to turn down the sound of the European soccer
championship game on a giant screen and turn up the volume on a
second, smaller television tuned to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had
been indicted for war crimes, Raznatovic turned his attention back
to the soccer match, shook his head and later said, ``He is no war
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of Raznatovic, the Serb paramilitary leader, was
not surprising, given that he also stands indicted by the same war
crimes tribunal at The Hague which Thursday announced the
indictment of Milosevic and four of his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic's loyalists are united in their belief that the
charges are a trumped-up political ploy, many other Yugoslavs
received the news with less defiance and more concern. Many
Yugoslavs see the indictment as ending any chance for a negotiated
settlement. They say it shows that NATO is determined to escalate
the war, and that Milosevic now has no incentive to negotiate an
end.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government was contemptuous of the indictment,
dismissing the tribunal as a NATO front. A government minister,
Goran Matic, said the tribunal is used to ``destroy the sovereignty
of countries the United States does not like.'' Matic said it was
illegal to charge Milosevic and the others with war crimes in
Kosovo because ``it is not a war. It's an operation against
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who despise Milosevic _ and believe his policies have
unnecessarily made Yugoslavia a pariah in the international
community _ were bitterly critical of the indictment, and
especially its timing, coming just hours before Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin was scheduled to arrive here for more talks
with Milosevic Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, who was recently fired as a government minister
because he suggested Milosevic needed to compromise, criticized the
indictment as ``politically provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope President Milosevic will ignore that and strengthen
efforts to approach the peace on the principles of the charter of
the UN ... in the interest of our nation, our state, and stability
of this region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zarko Korac, a psychologist and critic of Milosevic, said the
indictment ``shows that NATO is determined to escalate the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is meant to wreck the peace process,'' he said. ``NATO is
not interested in finding a solution. This is warmongering.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanimir Miljkovic, a leader of the students movement that wants
to get rid of Milosevic, said the tribunal needs to prove its
independence by indicting those in NATO who have killed civilians
and routinely hit civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indicting Milosevic is one step, but Serbian people will see
it as an injustice if that is all that happens,'' he said. ``This
is the real test of the court's credibility. It's hard to indict
someone who is paying your bills, but people here will be waiting
to see how credible the court is.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the tribunal's budget is paid for mostly by the United
States, Britain and France, many people here dismiss it as biased.
Few people here see the tribunal as independent, believing its
prosecutors take their cues from NATO. Government-controlled media
reinforce that perception.
</P>
<P>
   Vojin Dimitrijevic, director of the Belgrade Center for Human
Rights, who supports the tribunal's mandate, said the tribunal,
which was created in 1993 to prosecute war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia, is seen as anti-Serb here because most of its early
prosecutions were of Serbs. But Dimitrijevic, a law professor,
believes the tribunal can be used to redress Serb grievances, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it necessary for NATO to destroy the bridges in Novi Sad?
Is depriving civilians of electricity and water legitimate? These
are questions that the tribunal must answer, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs interviewed Thursday had not heard about the
indictment, which received scant attention in the
government-controlled broadcast media. Many are preoccupied with
the daily grind of getting by in a country where the economy has
collapsed and the air raid sirens sound and bombs fall every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic is a war criminal, then so is Clinton and
everybody else in NATO,'' said Dragan Jovanovic, 26, who, like most
Yugoslavs right now, is unemployed. ``This doesn't mean anything to
me. Losing my electricity means something. Finding Pampers for my
daughter means something. Not getting bombed means something. War
crimes tribunal means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   If some of Milosevic's enemies hope the indictment will inspire
a military coup or popular uprising against him, few here seem to
believe that possible.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Svilanovic, a spokesman for the Civil Alliance, a small
opposition party, said he saw no successor to Milosevic on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm wrong,'' said Svilanovic, 35, as he prepared to
report for military duty, ``but I don't think so.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The prime suspect in the disappearance of
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair pleaded guilty Thursday to two
federal firearms offenses.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Waters, 52, who had faced a June 7 trial on the gun
charges, admitted guilt during a pretrial hearing before U.S.
District Judge Sam Sparks. The weapons charges are unrelated to the
missing atheist leader and her two adult children, who vanished in
September 1995 from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no defense. They've got 30 pictures of him using the
gun at a firing range,'' said Waters' attorney Patrick Ganne.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was charged with one count of possessing ammunition and
one count of transporting firearms, both federal offenses because
of his prior felony convictions, including one for murder.
Sentencing was tentatively set for July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, but because of the vagaries of federal sentencing
guidelines, officials said Thursday it was unclear how much time
Waters may serve.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who arrived in court shackled at the ankles and waist,
has not been charged with any crime in connection with the O'Hair
case.
</P>
<P>
   However, an affidavit unsealed late Wednesday accuses him of
being the mastermind of the kidnapping and murder of O'Hair, her
son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair gained prominence in the 1960s for her successful court
battles to eliminate organized prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' lawyer denounced the Internal Revenue Service special
agent who filed the sworn statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first read it, I thought I had been handed a script for
Oliver Stone's next move,'' Ganne said of the affidavit. ``It's all
double-talk, speculation and conjecture. It's an affidavit that
quotes news stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters had worked for the O'Hair in 1993 and 1994, and later
pleaded guilty to stealing $54,400 in funds from her atheist
organization. According to confidential sources quoted in the
affidavit, he nursed a wish for revenge, as well as an ambition to
separate O'Hair from her money.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was used to obtain a search warrant that led to
the raid on March 24 of Waters' apartment in Austin. In the search,
federal agents turned up 119 rounds of handgun ammunition and other
gun paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   The second firearms charge stems from Waters shipping guns and
ammunition from Austin to a family member in Peoria, Ill. The
charge states he sent a 9mm pistol and a .357 Magnum revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Although no arrests have been made in the O'Hair case, the
affidavit also names Waters and two other men as suspects. The
others are Gary Karr, who is imprisoned in Detroit, and Gerald Lee
Osborne of Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Fry, who was killed shortly after the O'Hairs vanished in
September 1995, also was named as an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit of IRS agent Edmund I. Martin says Waters, Karr
and Fry ``executed the scheme to abduct, kidnap and murder'' O'Hair
and her children ``for the purpose of stealing at least $600,000
from the United Secularists of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin also accuses Waters of killing Fry.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Karr are ex-convicts who had served time together in
an Illinois prison.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit describes how the former manager of an Austin
storage facility recalled seeing three white males inside the unit
in late 1995 with at least two blue plastic barrels. Investigators
believe Osborne rented the storage unit for Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have theorized the remains of O'Hair and her
children were disposed of in barrels, although investigators have
been unable to find either the barrels or bodies.

CRIMES PANEL CHIEF FACES AGONIZING CAREER DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In Canada, they're calling it ``Arbour's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Arbour, the UN chief war crimes prosecutor who made
history Thursday with the indictment of Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic, faces an agonizing personal and professional decision _
one the world is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the 52-year-old Ontario judge, on special leave from
that province's Court of Appeals to serve with the United Nations
tribunal, is likely to be offered a seat on the Supreme Court of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Appointment to the nation's nine-member high court is the honor
of a lifetime, the greatest professional achievement to which any
Canadian judge can aspire. If she passes on the opportunity now, it
will likely be years before another vacancy occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But anxious human rights advocates warn the loss of the
highly-regarded Arbour could throw a monkeywrench into efforts to
hold Milosevic's Serbian regime accountable for genocide, and are
urging Arbour to stay with the tribunal for humanity's sake. In the
long run, they fear, the departure of the iron-willed, high-octane
prosecutor might even cripple the fledgling process of
international prosecution of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her departure would be very, very bad news for the tribunal,''
said Stefanie Grant, director of programs for the New York-based
Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights. ``It's not only the loss of
her tremendous talents, energy and focus, although that would be
bad enough. The real concern is that her departure would slow the
process, perhaps even drag it down.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, many observers say, Arbour's departure would
effectively halt the prosecutorial effort for months and even years
as the UN casts about for a politically-suitable replacement.
Russia, which opposes the US-led bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, is expected to use its seat on the UN Security Council
to block appointment of any proposed prosecutor from a NATO nation,
such as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But sources in Canada's government and legal community, as well
as media speculation, suggest Arbour is leaning strongly toward
accepting the Supreme Court position, if it is offered.
</P>
<P>
   The Quebec-born judge, little given to public musings, has
declined to deliver the verdict on her future. ``I don't think it's
fair to speculate on what I might or might not do with my life,''
she told the Toronto Star.
</P>
<P>
   The situation poses a dilemma for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, to have a Canadian serving in such a prominent and
powerful post fits perfectly with the country's policy of
international activisim. But delaying appointment of a new justice
to fill a Supreme Court position would hamper the high court's
work, and likely become a major political controversy for the
government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by Arbour and Canda will have to be made soon since
Supreme Court Justice Peter Cory is scheduled to retire next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a critical situation, such a historical juncture,
we're hoping the Canadian government can find some other option,
one that would let her to stay on the tribunal'' while still
keeping the Supreme Court seat open, said Kenneth Roth, executive
director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Roth recently wrote a personal note to Arbour, imploring her to
continue working for the war crimes tribunal. ``But there's
recognition that this must be extraordinarily difficult personal
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour is one of Canada's best-respected jurists, and it doesn't
hurt, politically, that she is also of French-Quebec heritage,
fluently bilingual and female. ``There is a kind of consensus in
the legal community that Louise Arbour is an ideal candidate, or,
if not ideal, then clearly the leading candidate,'' said Patrick
Monahan, a professor at the prestigious Osgoode Hall Law School in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour, the mother of three, is separated from her husband, and
is said to yearn for a return to Canada. The 1971 graduate from the
University of Montreal, whose special expertise is in criminal law,
is known as much for her graciousness as her unswerving integrity
and resolve. She was appointed to the Ontario Supreme Court in
1987, and to Ontario's Court of Appeals in 1990. In 1996, at the
special request of the UN, she was given a leave to work for the
war crimes tribunal and has been based in The Hague, Netherlands,
ever since.

practice, didn't mince words at a recent breakfast when she warned
that huge pay packages for U.S. CEOs were causing problems. And
it's not just that the CEOs are so flush they're escaping to
Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it because worker-bee morale is hurt by insanely
skewed corporate pay structures. Big-company compensation
committees ignored that fallout while cultivating pay systems to
reward Fortune 500-type CEOs with more than 400 times the annual
pay of average blue-collar workers. (Just 20 years ago, the
difference was ``only'' about 40 times average-worker earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also a world marketplace backlash. This is a global
economy, remember? European and Asian executives are not drawing
anywhere near the monster bucks of their American counterparts, and
they don't like competing with those who do.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation kinks in the Daimler-Chrysler merger were a
perfect example. Uppermost Daimler execs earned noticeably less
than Chrysler execs in subordinate positions. Talk about difficulty
meshing corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the free-market theory of supply and demand _ which
holds that top executive talent commands whopping pay because
demand for proven business winners exceeds the supply _ has been
undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Joy blamed Section 162(m) of the federal tax code, passed in
1993. Reacting to public outcry against surging executive pay,
Congress decided that publicly traded companies no longer could
take tax deductions for compensation exceeding $1 million to any of
their top five executives, except for certain performance-based
compensation. Companies reacted by channeling more executive pay
into those performance-based exemptions, such as bonuses and stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   But the unintended legacy of the intended pay cap, Joy said,
``was that it sent out the message that, hey, we can go up to $1
million before there's a problem of excess _ so it just set a new
floor instead of a maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this surprises Responsible Wealth, a program of United
for a Fair Economy, and the Executive PayWatch project of the
AFL-CIO. The groups have campaigned for years for brakes on
executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their bottom line is pretty much mine in this regard: Yes, there
are executives whose intellect, vision, skill and charisma combine
to lead their organizations to strong growth and a competitive
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But show me one who's doing it alone.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't see how it's possible for Michael Eisner _ to pick
on one of the megabuck collectors _ to have earned $575 million
last year.

ROLAND GARROS PROVES HAZARDOUS FOR SAMPRAS _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Most people wouldn't consider the leafy 16th
arrondissement a dangerous neighborhood. Anything but.
Nevertheless, Georgia Sampras ought to ground her little boy, Pete,
whenever he wants to hang out in this part of town called Stade
Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many hooligans in short pants cruising the clay
pits, awed neither by Pete's wealth nor reputation as the best
tennis player in the world, and quite willing to bash him while
picking his pocket. Must be some other world this kid's from, they
mutter while conducting the annual May mugging of Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Pete doesn't understand their languages or their game. Never
has. Probably never will. But he dutifully shows up at the French
Open like a demented blackjack player holding 13 and demanding,
``Hit me! Hit me!'' And they do _ every year for 10 years, and no
payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the second-round task of dispatching him in the
direction of an airport _ any airport _ fell to a burly Russian
ranked No. 100, Andrei Medvedev, who did so, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Having somehow survived 4 1/4 hours of punishment at the hands
of the only player in the history of Costa Rica, Juan Albert Marin,
in the opening round, Pete thought he'd stretch his luck and go for
two. Medvedev threw him out effortlessly as Sampras stacked 61
unsolicited errors and 10 double faults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should hire James Carville to scream, ``It's clay,
stupid!'' the way Carville shouted, ``It's the economy, stupid!''
at Clinton. Carville got through to his man. But poor Sampras
increasingly acts as though a clay court is the deepest mystery
since Humphrey Bogart tried to cross the Sahara in a World War II
flick.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Sampras is undertrained, physically and tactically, to
last long among the dirtkickers. He needs professorial help in Clay
101 from somebody like Spaniard Jose Higueras, who tutored the last
American guys to win French titles: Michael Chang in 1989, Jim
Courier in 1991-92. Those two kicked a considerable amount of the
Europeans' and Latin Americans' favorite soil in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was covered with plenty of it and acted self-delusional
afterward. ``I felt fine,'' he said. ``Physically, I was pretty
fresh, quite good. You know, it's still something I need to figure
out, how to play well here. Sometimes I think I overcomplicate
it.'' After going zero for 10 French Opens?
</P>
<P>
   Felt fresh? Napoleon said the same thing about his troops on the
way home from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Slogging about the court, Sampras frequently seemed to be
working on the choreography of an opus by the local composer
Berlioz, ``The March to the Scaffold.'' By this time, a useful
gimmick might be to hold his press conferences at Pere Lachaise,
Paris's most celebrated cemetery. One of the inmates, Chopin,
couldn't play on clay, either, preferring ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Pete says he, too, ``gets into a hole. I just try to serve my
way out; that's my instinct. But you can't do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's definitely an identity crisis here. Sometimes Sampras's
head droops so low that he seems to be impersonating an ostrich.
Other times, he tries to convince himself he's a Spaniard, but he
hasn't got the topspin or patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel numb,'' he said. ``The next few days will be very long
before I get over this.'' He yearns for the green grass of
Wimbledon, where he may be able to reclaim No. 1 with a sixth
title. ``Sure, I'm frustrated, PO'd. I let it slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court is gritty, so is Sampras. To his credit, he said,
``Sure I'll be back. I'll never give up on the French. It's my
biggest challenge, the only major I haven't won.''
</P>
<P>
   Masochists everywhere will delight in his words.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras might have a future as a press agent. Look at the
no-names he's made headlines for by losing to them here: No. 76,
France's Thierry Champion; No. 24, Austrian Gilbert Schaller; No.
65, Swede Magnus Norman; No. 98, Paraguayan Ramon Delgado; now
Medvedev, the lowest ever to beat him in a major. Still, Sampras
did get to the semis in 1996, losing to the champ, Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, his current successor at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But No. 1 doesn't really exist these days. Kafelnikov has
crumbled like that other Russian treasure, the Berlin Wall, losing
seven of his last 12 starts. Carlos Moya held it for nine days
before swooning, and the possibility of getting up there has made
such players as Greg Rusedski, Richard Krajicek, Petr Korda, and
Patrick Rafter fade at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   It may be painful watching a player as great as Sampras trying
to cope with crimson earth, sort of like witnessing Don Knotts cast
as Romeo, but he's still the man week in and week out. At least his
mom must be relieved that her boy is out of this hazardous
neighborhood with a French kiss-off for another 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras says he may even show up in Boston for the Davis Cup
joust against Australia July 16-18. ``What those guys (Courier and
Todd Martin) did in beating Britain was inspiring,'' he said. ``I'm
very sensitive about jumping on the bandwagon now. They should play
the singles, but I might be a help in the doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   After slapping a last forehand mildly into the net and shaking
hands with Medvedev, Sampras sat in his chair a long time, head in
hands. He resembled a statue by a another local artist: Rodin's
``The Thinker,'' perhaps trying to figure out something Rodin was
good at _ clay. If Rodin had been here Thursday, he might have used
Pete as a model and called it ``The Clinker.''

DISCOVERY HEADS TOWARD U.S.-LED SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ The shuttle Discovery late Thursday sped
toward a rendezvous with the first components of the new U.S.-led
international space station, following a dawn liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The four-man, three-woman crew of U.S., Canadian and Russian
astronauts was on course to reach the 235-mile high, unstaffed
orbital outpost early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle carries nearly two tons of supplies and equipment,
including laptop computers, a range of spare parts, drinking water,
air purification equipment and clothing for the new station's first
resident crew.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and
Yuri Gidzenko are to arrive aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule early
next year to coordinate a crucial, five-month construction period.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery soared from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 6:49 a.m
EDT Thursday . The shuttle climbed steeply on a northerly
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a great flight,'' pledged Discovery
commander Kent Rominger, as the final seconds of the countdown
ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is scheduled for 10 days, but even as Discovery
departed, shuttle managers were prepared to extend it by 24 hours
to give the astronauts more time for the cargo transfers, a
demanding spacewalk and internal repairs to the station's power
generation and satellite communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   The transfers will require the astronauts to carry 120 soft
cargo bags packed with hundreds of small items from the big
Spacehab module in Discovery's cargo bay, through the shuttle
docking module and into the station's compartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single bag, every single item has an exact place it's
supposed to go, and the crew has been trained to put each of them
down in one and only one place,'' said NASA's Wayne Hale, the
mission's lead flight director. ``It reminds me a lot of packing
for a long camping trip. We are trying to get everything in and to
make the maximum use of the space.``
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew's activities at the orbital outpost will begin
late Saturday as Discovery astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry
begin a near seven-hour spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   During the excursion, the two spacewalkers will work with
colleague Ellen Ochoa. Stationed inside the shuttle's cockpit,
Ochoa will operate the shuttle's 50-foot long robot arm, using it
to hoist Jernigan around the exterior of the station, cherry
picker-style.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan and Barry, who will scale the exterior of the outpost,
have trained to install a small U.S. cargo crane and the first
segments of a similar Russian device. Future station crews are
depending on the two cranes to lug large power storage batteries
and other bulky equipment across the orbital laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The two spacewalkers also plan to fasten three bags filled with
a variety of hand tools to the exterior of the station so they will
be available to future astronaut construction teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new house,'' said Barry. ``It doesn't have much
furniture or exterior trim yet. ``We are bringing up the parts to
help finish out our house. All the pieces we bring up are support
for future flights, things future construction crews will use to
help them get their jobs done more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-year effort to build the new station began late last
year with the launch of the Russian-fabricated Zarya and U.S.-made
Unity modules. They were successfully joined by a shuttle crew last
December into a single 68,000 pound spacecraft, spanning 78 feet in
length and measuring 84 feet between the tips of the two wing-like
solar arrays.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Rick Husband, Canadian astronaut Julie Payette and Russian
cosmonaut Valery Tokarev will join their colleagues for several key
tasks within the new station.
</P>
<P>
   These include installation of sound dampening insulation in the
Zarya module to quiet a noisy air circulation system. Payette and
Tokarev will replace 18 faulty amp meters that regulate the
constant charging and discharging of the half-dozen storage
batteries in Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   Husband will lead efforts in the Unity module to repair a
satellite communications system that faltered in early March. The
system permitted ground controllers in Houston to communicate with
the station independently of the Russian control facility in
suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's flight is the first for a shuttle in nearly six
months. The unusually long hiatus was caused by Russian financial
and political difficulties that have stalled the arrival of the
station's crew module by 19 months, until late this November. A
succession of unresolved technical problems with an American X-ray
observatory called Chandra has pushed its launch to no sooner than
late July, nearly a year behind schedule.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Details of a crater on Mars probably dug by a huge
asteroid and evidence of ancient seas gone dry are among the
earliest findings of a topographic mapping satellite orbiting the
planet, scientists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mars experts already knew that the huge Hellas impact basin in
the planet's southern hemisphere was the largest impact crater in
the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   But in millions of measurements beamed back to Earth since early
last month by instruments on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft
they have found surprising evidence that the floor of the huge
crater is covered by a smooth material that is different from
surrounding terrain.
</P>
<P>
   They also have found that an ice pack at the south pole of Mars
contains as much frozen water as a similar pack they already knew
about at the North Pole, making the amount of known water on Mars
equal to about 1.5 times that found on Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   And for reasons that are not at all clear, the southern half of
Mars appears to be about three miles ``higher'' than the northern
half.
</P>
<P>
   The new data, flooding into NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md., at the rate of 900,000 measurements a day,
suggest a planet that is losing its interior heat rapidly, largely
through volcanism, scientists working with the spacecraft said.
</P>
<P>
   The information is provided courtesy of an instrument known as
the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, which sends bursts of light down
to the surface of Mars and determines the height of the surface at
each point on the basis of how long it takes the light to reflect
back.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping program was delayed by nearly a year while space
engineers worked to correct a malfunction in the craft's solar
power panels shortly after it reached Mars orbit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Hellas crater is nearly six miles deep and more than 1,300
miles across, said Goddard scientist David Smith, meaning that a
person standing in the middle of it would be surrounded by walls as
high as the Earth's Mt. Everest. Yet those walls would be so far
away that the observer would not know he was in a crater. The ridge
would be beyond the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The new mapping tool shows that when the object that caused the
crater hit Mars _ probably 4 billion years ago _ enough rock and
rubble to cover the continental United States to depth of two miles
was splashed onto the surrounding terrain, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   This material is pocked with thousands of additional craters,
evidence that it has been there for eons.
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the crater appears much smoother, suggesting that
it is much younger than the surrounding terrain. One speculation is
that the object, probably an asteroid up to 500 miles in diameter,
hit with such force that it broke through to the planet's molten
interior, which has been oozing out ever since, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the data suggest Mars once had much more water than
today _ and that it could have ``ponded'' in oceans _ there does
not seem to be any evidence of river systems, with creeks and
tributaries, Smith said. That would mean Mars probably never had
``rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While water flowed south to north in general, the data clearly
reveal the localized areas where water may have once formed ponds,
`` said geophysicist Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, another project scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Zuber added that the mapping data show that the southern
hemisphere of Mars is unusually ``rubbly'' and that much of the
lost water could have run underground _ back where it came from,
since the planet's early volcanos probably sent it steaming into
the atmosphere to begin with.

 Ann Douglas, the author of ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in
the 1920s'' (Noonday), is writing a history of American culture in
the Cold War period.  
 By ANN DOUGLAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During rehearsals for ``I Married an Angel,'' a 1938 musical
comedy about a Hungarian banker, the show's lyricist, Lorenz Hart,
a quick-witted master of the last-minute fix, decided to add a new
number called ``At the Roxy Music Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joshua Logan, the director, asked anxiously how a number
filled with allusions to contemporary New York personalities could
possibly be made to fit into a comedy set in old Budapest, Hart
answered airily: ``Well, just bring up the subject of New York. You
can't sing about Budapest all night. We've got to give people a
little fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hart's collaborator, the composer Richard Rodgers, moved
out of the city to Fairfield, Conn., in the early '40s, Hart
remained behind, giving parties for the homosexual elite in his
duplex at the Ardsley on Central Park West. On a visit to Khartoum
he was indignant to learn that his hotel didn't carry Variety.
</P>
<P>
   To Hart's mind, no musical comedy, whatever its putative locale,
could be inhospitable to a mention of New York. Dependent on a
lavish flow of cash and illusion, too loud and fast-moving for
introspection or tragic denouements, the city is not only the
birthplace of the musical comedy form but also its primary
exemplar.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's skyline, a competitive cluster of peaks and flops,
metamorphoses architecture into a musical number, an affected riot
of energy as irregular and surprising as the popular jazz rhythms
Hart evoked into diabolically inventive lyrics. Daringly divorced
from its continent, a gigantic, jagged sculpture served up to the
world on an exceedingly fragile platter, New York is the
``Syncopated City'' (the first title of George and Ira Gershwin's
``Fascinating Rhythm''), a vaudeville act of desperation and glee.
``Now I'm sane,'' a Hart lyric runs, ``but I'd rather be gaga!''
</P>
<P>
   Movie musicals came in with the advent of the talkies in the
late 1920s. From the start they depended on Broadway and Tin Pan
Alley talent, including Rodgers and Hart, all of whose hit shows
were turned into movies. Hollywood's most important artists in the
musical form _ notably Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Bob Fosse _
began on Broadway and kept up with its fashions after they left;
Fosse alternated between plays and movies throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   The big Hollywood studios maintained large, all-purpose New York
City sets where New York stories like ``Broadway Melody'' (1929),
``42nd Street'' (1933), ``Easter Parade'' (1948) and ``My Sister
Eileen'' (1955) were largely shot. A montage of the neon signs of
Times Square, a glimpse of a palpably cardboard Empire State
Building, a Cole Porter tune on the soundtrack, is enough to tell
us where we are.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most photographed cities in the world, New York, like
the musical, is a state of mind, an instance of the supremely
American confusion of the real and the fake. A New York set is a
real New York location.
</P>
<P>
   The movie musical had its own brand of realism, however, sharing
its heyday and occasionally its personnel with gangster and noir
films. Although these went in for stylish camera angles and moody
cynicism, while the musical preferred advertisement-friendly
frontal shots and happy endings, both genres specialized in
synthetic extremes and the unexpected possibilities of public
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   If noir's investigations took place in the seedy urban back lots
of American capitalism and crime, the musical staked out its
underside in the sometimes deliciously low-life stories of the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Hays Code, imposed in 1934, hit gangster films and musicals
hardest. James Cagney went from ``Public Enemy'' to ``G-Man,'' and
Shirley Temple became more popular than May West. The musical
banned openly gay characters and girls shimmying to songs like
``Shake My Powder Puff.''
</P>
<P>
   Slight, suave Fred Astaire _ who thought of himself as a
character actor, not a Romeo _ benefited from the new standards.
His style of singing and dancing was smart but refined, almost
censor-proof, and he elevated Ginger Rogers from her ``42d Street''
Anytime Annie persona to romantic-partner status. Yet the fairy
tale aura of the Rogers-Astaire films contained a tough-minded show
biz core.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Swing Time'' (1936) Rogers and Astaire play hard-pressed
New York performers who get their big chance when he wins the
contract of the Silver Sandal club's band leader at the gambling
table. ``I own you,'' Astaire announces to the unlucky Georges
Mataxa. Even in the smart Art Deco world Astaire and Rogers
inhabit, everyone is a professional; popular art is also hotly
contested property.
</P>
<P>
   In the magical ``Never Gonna Dance'' number, Rogers and Astaire
give away their talents for nothing, singing and dancing just
because they feel like it, because they have to, but we always know
where they got the skills to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In ``You'll Never Get Rich,'' a wonderfully romantic musical
with Astaire and Rita Hayworth, the couple, again playing
professionals, never dance outside an entertainment context.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's ``Oklahoma!'' (1943;
filmed in 1955) represented a dramatic shift in the musical form.
Rodgers had brought the project to Hart first, but when Hart read
this period romance about cowboys and farmers in Oklahoma
territory, replete with rustic dialect cast in ominously phonetic
spellings like ``purty,'' ``skeered'' and ``fer,'' Hart told a
friend, ``Baby, I don't see it,'' and turned it down. ``Oklahoma!''
became the hit of the war years, establishing the integrated,
serious musical play as the new Broadway-Hollywood ideal.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Oklahoma!,'' none of the characters are professional
entertainers. They sing and dance precisely because they are
amateurs, to quote Irving Berlin's own ``Oklahoma!''-inspired
musical, ``just doin' what comes natur'lly'': to wit, militantly
heterosexual mating and patriotic state-building.
</P>
<P>
   In a premature moment of Disneyfication, when the Hotel Astor
was host to a costume party to celebrate the success of
``Oklahoma!,'' it christened itself the Hayloft and instructed
guests to ``check your shootin' irons at the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   The mongrel world-city was masquerading again, this time as the
American heartland. But the losses involved were real, too.
</P>
<P>
   No numbers like ``At the Roxy Music Hall'' appeared in
``Oklahoma!'' Here the songs were integral to the plot. They
weren't detached from the show and sent through multiple
interpretations as Rodgers and Hart's had been, but packaged in a
recorded ``show album.''
</P>
<P>
   Folk ballet, superbly choreographed in ``Oklahoma!'' by Agnes de
Mille and drenched in what Martha Graham portentously called the
``aura of race memory,'' eclipsed the percussive wizardry of tap,
black vaudeville's gift to Broadway. Hammerstein remarked that not
one of the characters in ``Oklahoma!'' ``has a brain in his head,''
but no sharp-witted urban racketeer is on hand to satirize or
exploit rural credulity.

 UNDATED: rural credulity.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodgers and Hammerstein's major musicals weren't set in New
York, nor did they make extensive allusions to it. Something like
the anti-New York musical had been born, and it was long vastly
influential, though never uncontested, on Broadway and in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kelly, who succeeded Fred Astaire as Hollywood's foremost
musical comedy star in the 1940s, had the muscular physique,
athletic skills, ballet training and Irish-American charm to work
in the wide-open, space-eating ``Oklahoma!'' mode of prescribed
World War II and postwar optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Mention of Kelly today conjures up the image of an overeager,
overenergetic professional amateur with an Ipana-white grin and a
penchant for on-the-beat movement, desperately trying to persuade
us how much fun he's having. (One British reviewer found his smile
as reassuring as a ``nuclear accident.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kelly wasn't really a booster type, but rather an early
example of that peculiarly late-'40s and '50s phenomenon, a rebel
disguised as a cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1912 into a working-class family, fiercely intelligent
and ambitious, Kelly never lost his acutely class-conscious
resentment of the rich and powerful. Ballet was a late acquisition.
His roots were in the tap and vaudeville routines he had learned in
the cheap clip joints and burlesque houses of his native
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Though he directed ``Flower Drum Song,'' a minor Rodgers and
Hammerstein hit, on Broadway in 1958, he made his name in 1940 in
the starring role of Rodgers and Hart's ``Pal Joey,'' John O'Hara's
slang-filled, mordant portrait of a fast-talking hoofer-hustler
with New York ambitions stuck in the seedy Chicago nightclub scene.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who regarded ``Pal Joey'' as his masterpiece, adored
Kelly. After rehearsals the two men drank and talked all night in
the rough bars of the Eighth Avenue theater district. Kelly went to
MGM in 1942, but his best movies were collaborations with New York
talent, often recruited by Kelly himself; he played sanitized
versions of Joey Evans for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Astaire's styles were radically different. Wittily
stylish, implacably if nonchalantly superior, Astaire endures the
routine uncertainties his plots inflict on him with the well-worn
patience of a host handling an ill-timed guest. Behind the
mechanics of his lines, behind his balding, even comic appearance,
the real Fred Astaire, endowed with a genius invisible in repose,
waits, on hold until the moment when he can sing and dance,
effortlessly compelling the world's adoration.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a has-been in ``The Band Wagon'' (1953), Astaire steps
off a train in Grand Central Terminal to find a throng of reporters
brushing him aside to get to Ava Gardner. He walks off singing
Howard Dietz's lyrics, ``I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world
of my own. ... By myself.'' Temporary neglect is merely a
provocation to greater self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   If Astaire's preternaturally stable persona defined and
normalized every movie in which he appeared, Kelly's volatility
upset genre conventions without being able to control them.
Bringing to his roles the gift of male beauty, a charisma,
vulnerability and warm, full-chested density outside Astaire's
range, Kelly cast himself as Marlon Brando to Astaire's Cary Grant,
bypassing top hat and tails for form-fitting T-shirts and jeans
designed to show off the body line. Astaire's masculine status is
an elegant hypothesis, but Kelly's virility is insistent and in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cover Girl'' (1944), on the brink of losing his club and
his girl, Kelly dances a fierce debate with his Alter Ego (also
performed by Kelly) on a dark Brooklyn street piled with packing
crates. Tap exploding into skids and big balletic leaps to a jazzy
bass-dominated score, colloquial in movement, taut in execution,
sexy, angry and scared, this is psycho-dance, the musical spliced
with Method and tinged with noir, laying bare its roots in despair.
</P>
<P>
   A canny four-decade survivor of Broadway's Golden Age in the
wide-open 1920s, Astaire, whose centennial we are celebrating this
year, knew how to be timeless, innately emblematic of the best
America can offer. But Kelly was a veteran of the Depression whose
career peaked when Sen. Joseph McCarthy's did; Kelly had scant
talent for the varied rhythms self-invention requires.
</P>
<P>
   As a passionate opponent of the blacklist, Kelly narrowly
escaped investigation by the House Committee on Un-American
Activities; in several of his finest numbers, cops interrupt
dancers: musical comedy cops but censors all the same.
</P>
<P>
   While Astaire's movies require only that he reveal himself,
Kelly's films demand a confession, an apology, even a conversion.
His ``Oklahoma!'' style is in part a repudiation of his ``Pal
Joey'' past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'' takes Manhattan in Kelly's sunniest movie, ``On
the Town'' (1949), with a divine script by Betty Comden and Adolph
Green. Playing a country boy, one of a trio of sailors released
from shipboard discipline for 24 mad, magical hours, Kelly brings
us the tourist's New York, a utopia in the here and now, whizzing
and glittering with open-air scenes, shot on location.
</P>
<P>
   But in Kelly and Stanley Donen's last great musical, ``It's
Always Fair Weather'' (1955), also written by Comden and Green, the
ravishingly exuberant camaraderie of the ensemble work of ``On the
Town'' gives way to a bitter comedy of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Three wartime buddies hold a reunion in New York, now a noir set
of midnight streets, grimy boxing gyms and man-eating television
studios, only to discover they have nothing in common. Despite an
implausibly happy ending, Kelly, in his most openly ``Pal Joey''
role, never sings or dances with his romantic partner, Cyd
Charisse. Drunkenly carousing on a dark street with garbage can
lids affixed to their left feet, Kelly, Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd
turn dancing into an obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood musical was going out of style, and Kelly would be
as firmly (and unluckily) associated with its fall as Astaire was
with its peak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Bob Fosse, perhaps the musical's greatest talent, was
only 28. A practitioner in a nearly posthumous form, Fosse took
advantage of the collapse of the Cold War verities that shaped
Kelly's career to prove that the coda can sometimes trump the
composition it concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Like his idol Astaire, Fosse was unprepossessing in appearance,
a fair, slight, balding man with few acting skills beyond a
pleasant manner. As a dancer, he, too, relied on wit, irony and
superbly inventive timing to transform a quality of physical
absence into eloquently astute commentary.
</P>
<P>
   But where Astaire built poignancy and excitement into his
low-key emotional repertory by the choreographic tactic of freeze
and melt, stop-motion alternating with glides, subtle bends and
musical curves, Fosse banished the melodic and sheerly expressive
in favor of the old percussive soft-shoe ``Tea for Two'' rhythm,
finding the antidote to motion not in relaxation, but in another
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Only in his late homage to Astaire, ``I Wanna Be a Dancin' Man''
(which can be seen Friday on Broadway in the revue ``Fosse''), did
he even try to approximate Astaire's aristocratic panache and
fundamentally ballroom style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pal Joey'' and Kelly's success in the role were a lifelong
impetus to Fosse's ambition. Although his background was firmly
middle-class, before coming to New York in 1946 he apprenticed as a
dancer in the strip joints of Chicago.

 UNDATED: of Chicago.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1951 he starred in a summer stock revival of ``Pal Joey,''
playing the role again in two off-Broadway productions of the '60s.
He never made it to Broadway in the part (and bitterly lamented the
fact), but he injected the ``Pal Joey'' story into every movie and
play he directed.
</P>
<P>
   Fanatically hard working, chronically insecure, abrasive, even
cruel, yet compulsively eager to please, Fosse aspired to Astaire's
unassailability, but he identified with Kelly's hunger. For Fosse,
too, the noir and the musical were kin, though he learned to
integrate them into a new hybrid form as Kelly never could.
</P>
<P>
   Dancer-choreographers like Astaire, Kelly and Donen had proved
themselves the best translators of Broadway musicals into cinematic
terms. Choreographers come to film knowing how to divide space by
form, to manipulate matter to visual effect.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse was the first, however, to have started in television,
choreographing and performing for ``Your Hit Parade'' in New York
in 1950. By the time he arrived in Hollywood in 1952, he had
already conceived the body as an intricate, two-dimensional display
of silhouettes, profiles, angles and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In a Fosse number the body seems to cut and edit itself into
sharp, unexpected shifts and splices of perspective, mind
experimenting on matter as only a camera can. Mimicking a close-up
shot, one dancer turns manic miniaturist and compartmentalizer. A
single segment of her body _ a pelvis convulsing in bumps and
grinds, a stiff turned-out knee, a raised shoulder blade or eyebrow
_ goes free-lance, abruptly detaching itself from its physical
context, before the number shifts back to the ensemble long shot,
allowing the overall pattern, the kaleidoscopic, high-tech repartee
of multiple bodies, to click into focus.
</P>
<P>
   In his movie ``Cabaret'' (1972), Fosse brought the integrated
musical to new heights, even as he unplugged its heterosexual
imperative, discarded its folk pretensions, decimated its
euphemisms and satirized its equation of singing and dancing with
national salvation. ``Cabaret'' reminds us that the Nazis sang and
danced, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fosse's greatest contribution was to return the musical to
its mongrel, episodic, Hartsian roots. His dances suggest the
nervous system in acute states of spasmodic withdrawal (a condition
to which Fosse, an addictive womanizer and a drinker and drugger of
mammoth proportions, was no stranger), the war of the part against
the whole. Yet his later productions often refuse any coherence
other than their status as show biz.
</P>
<P>
   Ransacking entertainment's trunk, Fosse used the various styles
of Chaplin, Astaire, Kelly, Busby Berkeley, Al Jolson, Bert
Williams, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson and the Nicholas brothers as
multiple ideas in nonstop collaboration and collision, creating a
fugal exercise allergic to blurred edges.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the ``Steam Heat'' number (included in
``Fosse'') in ``Pajama Game'' (1954; filmed in 1957), the dazzling
Carol Haney and her two male partners, garbed in unisex
Chaplinesque black suits and derbies, don't bow themselves off the
stage, eliding gracefully from number back to narrative, from
theater to life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they scamper into the wings, come back to cavort in the
applause, return yet again to scramble for a dropped hat, then
finally chase one another offstage, intent on further deviltry, as
fresh as they began. Artifice is nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to put it on,'' Fosse remarked, ``to make it
through the day.'' The stage may showcase entertainment, but only a
body bag can end it.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiographical movie masterpiece, ``All That Jazz''
(1979), Fosse's stand-in, Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), a middle-aged
Broadway director dying of heart disease in a hospital, escapes his
nurses and enters the room of an old woman groaning in final agony.
</P>
<P>
   The film, shot without filters or glamorizing tricks,
mercilessly shows the woman's yellow teeth and decaying skin. In a
shocking, wonderful moment, Gideon tells her he loves her and
kisses her passionately full on the mouth. Her pain forgotten, she
kisses him back, then looks at him in amazed happiness and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, when the Angel of Death asked Gideon if he believed in
love, he gave the cynical show biz response ``I believe in saying I
love you.'' It's a good answer. The dying woman is his mother, that
is to say his audience, and he does indeed love her. The ``Pal
Joey'' heel is a hero in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before his death after a heart attack in 1987, Fosse
considered doing a movie about the gossip columnist Walter
Winchell. Looking at Times Square's new Marriott and Holiday Inn,
noting its increasingly upscale tourists and pedestrians, he asked
a friend: ``Where am I going to shoot it? This isn't Broadway
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, while Disney redesigns Times Square into
``Oklahoma!''-bright colors and Madison-Avenue Americana, Broadway
is host to a major Fosse revival. No wonder ``Chicago'' and
``Fosse'' are hits. Like the city he loved, a Fosse production
sometimes blocked out the sky, but he had his own oxygen supply. As
the narrowing fin de siecle funnels us fast into the 21st century,
could we possibly need Bob Fosse more?

 &HT;    Braves frost Brewers 8-7
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The last hurrah for the Braves in their former
County Stadium home was a wild one, to the enjoyment of much of the
Milwaukee Brewers' first decent crowd of the four-game series,
22,252.
</P>
<P>
   Day game. Seventy-degree weather. Bases full of runners. Little
bit of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good game,'' said Chipper Jones, who did his part to lead the
Braves to an 8-7 victory with a three-run homer and a tag at third
base in the critical play down the stretch. ``Competitive. Lot of
offense. We swung the bats well and played just good enough on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory probably came down to one moment in the eighth
inning. The Braves got a double play when Jeromy Burnitz struck out
on a 3-2 fastball from reliever Russ Springer and Javy Lopez threw
out Ron Belliard trying to steal third.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers had been battling back all day against Braves' leads
of 4-1 and 8-4. They were still battling until the final out, when
Rudy Seanez coaxed a double play ball from Lou Collier to give the
Braves a 3-1series victory.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this season the Braves have won three road games in a row.
Atlanta won three against the Florida Marlins during its first
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game was just strange,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``It's
not a game you'd like to film and show your minor-leaguers. We
probably played worse than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the daylight and some fat pitches from
starters Scott Karl and Kevin Millwood, the teams combined for 24
hits _ including 10 off Karl and eight off Millwood _ and left the
game to late-inning hitters and relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood gave up six runs, his highest total of the season. But
he improved to 5-2 with the victory, tying John Smoltz for the most
victories on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it wasn't really there,'' Millwood said. ``I
didn't have any confidence. I thought my curveball was bad, my
slider was bad, my changeup was bad, and I couldn't locate my
fastball. It was like every hitter was a huge battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood watched a 4-1 lead disappear in the fourth. He hit
Geoff Jenkins in the foot, walked Bobby Hughes on five pitches and,
after giving up an RBI single to Mark Loretta, fielded Scott Karl's
sacrifice bunt and threw past Chipper Jones to allow a run to
score.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves used a pair of Brewers errors in the next inning
to score four more runs, including the two that won it on Brian
Hunter's double.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody deserves this win,'' Millwood said, ``it's the
eight guys behind me.'' Rogers writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution

 &HT;    Throwing force may be to blame in Saunders' injury
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The incredible force a pitcher exerts while throwing a baseball
probably is to blame for Tony Saunders' broken arm, an Emory
University sports-medicine expert says.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible cause is a bone abnormality, such as a benign
or malignant tumor, that weakens the bone, said Dr. Robert
Frederick, an orthopedic surgeon who heads Emory's Sports Medicine
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, 25, who had not been diagnosed with any such problem,
broke his left humerus in mid-pitch Wednesday. The humerus is the
large bone that connects the shoulder to the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when people break their arms, they fracture the smaller
forearm bones, the radius or the ulna. That Saunders' humerus was
fractured indicates how tremendously it was stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an acute overload that the bone just can't stand,''
Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen the problem before, generally with younger pitchers
who aren't as strong and well-conditioned as professionals. All
pitchers risk injury, however, simply by the nature of what they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're starting with the arm way back over the head, then
whip the arm forward,'' Frederick said. ``It creates a tremendous
torque, or rotational stress in the bone. At some point it may
surpass what the bone is able to tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even under such circumstances, the humerus rarely breaks. More
frequently, it comes out of its socket, resulting in a dislocated
shoulder. Alternately, the rotator cuff _ the four muscles that
hold the humerus in its shoulder socket _ tears.
</P>
<P>
   If Saunders' injury proves unrelated to any other medical
problem, he has a good chance of returning to his previous form,
Frederick said. The bone, which breaks in a spiral manner in such
cases, will take three to four months to heal, Saunders' doctors
said. No surgery was required, a team official said, and Saunders
left the hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His recovery might be complicated if the surrounding muscles and
tendons are damaged. Such injuries might create scar tissue, which
in turn might limit the range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, when you're dealing with an athlete at that
elite level, any small change can sometimes make the difference in
getting back to their top performance level, versus being just not
quite there,'' said Frederick, who was director of athlete care for
gymnastics during the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Other major-league pitchers who broke or fractured their humerus
bones while pitching include the Cleveland Indians' John Smiley,
the Cincinnati Reds' Tom Browning and, most memorably, Dave
Dravecky of the San Francisco Giants. Dravecky's humerus snapped
shortly after his triumphant return to baseball after cancer
treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Since he was a teenager driving sprint and
midget cars on the dirt tracks of Indiana, Tony Stewart dreamed of
winning the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Stewart, from Columbus, Ind., will make his fourth
start in the Indy 500. He'll start in the outside position of the
eighth row, but if he's fortunate enough to take the lead late in
the 200-lap race, Stewart says he could do the unimaginable: Pull
onto pit road and shut off his Oldsmobile Aurora engine.
</P>
<P>
   That's the dilemma Stewart, 28, faces when he attempts to become
the first driver ever to complete all 1,100 miles in the
Indianapolis 500 and then the Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race at Lowe's
Motor Speedway in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 1997 Indy Racing League champion but a rookie on
the Winston Cup circuit this year, says he doesn't want anything to
hinder his early-season performance in the No. 20 Pontiac stock car
of Joe Gibbs Racing. Not even the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were leading Indy with five laps to go and it was time
to get on the airplane (back to Concord), I would have to leave,''
said Stewart, who has hired John Paul Jr. to drive if that happens.
``We would stop the car and make sure I got to Charlotte on time. I
am not going to be late to Charlotte. We would have to quit early.
Charlotte is my No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis 500 begins at 11 a.m. on Sunday; the Coca-Cola
600 starts at 6:15 p.m. If the Indy 500 is delayed by accidents or
inclement weather, Stewart says he'll pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart already faces one obstacle in the Coca-Cola 600. He
probably will miss the drivers' meeting in Concord at 4:15 p.m., so
he'll have to start at the rear of the field on Sunday, no matter
how well he qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it and decided we're not going to open
ourselves up to a Pandora's box,'' NASCAR spokesman Tim Sullivan.

 &HT;    Earnhardt's team on a roll
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Things are starting to look up at the biggest
race shop in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Inc., housed at the ``Garage Mahal'' in
Mooresville, seems poised to turn its disappointing season around,
beginning with Sunday's Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park, DEI's second-year driver in the No. 1 Chevy, and
Dale Earnhardt Jr., the 24-year-old son of the seven-time Winston
Cup champion, will start fifth and eighth, respectively in Sunday's
race. Earnhardt will start 15th in a car owned by Richard Childress
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of improvement on our team,'' Earnhardt said.
``It's really showing a lot of promise. I really feel good about
what I see. I see us running better, and the program's coming
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who ended a 101-race winless streak earlier this year
with a victory at Talladega Superspeedway, finished 12th or better
in five of the last six races. And that doesn't include his
fourth-place outing in last week's The Winston all-star race.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who was 20th in points after the fifth race at
Darlington Raceway, climbed to ninth in the last six events,
trailing leader Dale Jarrett by 341.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our program with Richard Childress is on track,''
Earnhardt said. ``We're ninth in points. We need to do better than
that. Top-10s and top-fives and wins are the only things that will
do that. The Atlanta race was a disaster for us. Give us that race
back and we should be fifth or sixth in the points.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt wrecked early at Atlanta and finished 40th.
</P>
<P>
   Park, 31, was hand-picked by Earnhardt to drive the No. 1 Chevy,
DEI's only Winston Cup entry last year. But Park, from East
Northport, N.Y., suffered multiple injuries in a nasty crash at
Atlanta Motor Speedway in March 1998 and missed half of his rookie
season. This year, Park didn't finish higher than 12th in the first
11 races and finished 32nd or worse in five events.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lopez, Park's crew chief, was dismissed last week, and
Earnhardt hired Paul Andrews, formerly the crew chief for Jeremy
Mayfield and the No. 12 Ford. With Andrews on board, Park finished
fifth in the Winston Open and then qualified fifth for Sunday's
race, his second-best position in 33 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the main things that has really turned around
is my confidence,'' Park said. ``The addition of Steve Hmiel
(technical director of DEI) and Paul Andrews, that's really boosted
my confidence. It's given the driver a real lift. It's given the
team a big lift. It's contagious, I can tell you that. I'm feeling
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Park also should benefit from the addition of Earnhardt Jr., the
1998 Busch Grand National champion who will start five Cup races
this year. Earnhardt Jr. will move to Winston Cup full-time in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's got a lot of pressure on him,'' Park said. ``He's a
great race-car driver, and he's a good friend of mine. All the guys
working on that team were my (Busch) guys. We all have a very close
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just excited for him,'' Park said. ``I know he's under a
lot of pressure, but he performed under it. I feel like we have a
great one in Dale Jr. Both teams are really looking forward to
working together and doing what we did this weekend, and that's
putting both cars in the top 10 week in and week out.''

`NOTTING HILL' A PERFECT ROMANTIC VEHICLE FOR ITS STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't happen very often these days, but every once in a
while, the Hollywood Dream Machine gets it right. The Julia
Roberts-Hugh Grant romantic-comedy fairy tale, ``Notting Hill,'' is
one of those times. It's pure fluff, but as irresistible as cotton
candy.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, it's a near-flawless example of the old-fashioned
movie-star romance: a vehicle in which the script is witty,
original and effortlessly romantic, the stars are at their
crackling best, and their chemistry is magical.
</P>
<P>
   Its main character is William Thacker (Grant), a mild-mannered,
recently divorced, self-deprecating man who owns a small travel
bookstore in the Notting Hill section of London. In recent years,
he has been spectacularly unlucky in love.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Anna Scott (Roberts), the most famous movie star in the
world, walks into his store looking for a guide to Turkey.
Flustered, he manages to spill orange juice all over her, and when
they go to his nearby flat to get cleaned up, sparks fly.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie follows the storybook romance over the
course of a year, which becomes complicated by her immense fame, a
pre-existing boyfriend (Alec Baldwin, in a cameo) and, more
gradually, by Thacker's lack of confidence that true love can
endure under such an intense spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the film _ in which the two fall inexorably in
love and she finds refuge in his cozy circle of family and friends
in Notting Hill _ comes off with a kind of mesmerizing perfection,
sweeping us up in the manner of such classics in the genre as
``Roman Holiday'' or ``Love Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half is slightly less satisfying, but it also works,
and it adds a rather unexpected edge to the film as it becomes, in
part, a fairly devastating portrait of the freakishness of big-time
fame, revealing the sheer horror of what it is like to have a face
that's so instantly recognizable that it draws a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The script by Richard Curtis (``Four Weddings and a Funeral'')
is funny, rich with enjoyably eccentric supporting characters, and
custom-made for the star's personalities. In his first Hollywood
effort, British director Roger Michell (``Persuasion'') has wisely
opted for the lightest possible directorial touch _ staying well
out of the way of his stars and script.
</P>
<P>
   As she's aged, Roberts has developed a hard angularity to her
face, but she's still immensely captivating and more exquisitely
vulnerable than ever _ especially in the scenes in which she fully
realizes how her fame is a handicap to personal happiness. (Her
character here is reportedly closer to her true self than any she's
ever played.)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the movie more properly belongs to Grant. In role after
role in the '90s, he has skillfully constructed a
befuddled-but-charming-educated-Englishman persona very much in the
vein of his role model and hero, David Niven. In this movie, that
construction seems to have reached its zenith, and it should
finally make him what he's long threatened to become: an A-level
Hollywood movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Notting Hill. Directed by Roger Michell. Written by Richard
Curtis. Cast: Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Hugh Bonneville, Emma
Chambers, Rhys Ifans. Universal. 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
sexual references.

 &HT;    Adam.com strikes deal with Yahoo!By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam.com on Thursday announced a deal that will put the
company's name, content and links to its home page on a new,
Internet healthcare site being created by Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility and brand name are seen as keys to Internet success,
and the agreement is meant to give Atlanta-based Adam a bit of
both, said Chief Executive Officer Robert Cramer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Adam, which has shifted from a software strategy to a bet on the
Net, has its own site. But Cramer said the company sees Yahoo as
one of the premier portals _ gateways that most Net surfers use to
start a search. Yahoo Health could be the way they go looking for
healthcare tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us in position to be seen by 50 million Yahoo users
so that when a Yahoo user wants more information, a connection to a
community or imagery, the odds are they will find us,'' Cramer
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get its name and content in front of more
Internet eyeballs, Adam has in recent months signed agreements with
CNN, Excite and Cox Interactive. However, the Yahoo deal is the
broadest, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is probably the most significant development
we've had with the company yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Adam declined to release financial details of the
deal. However, Cramer said that Adam was not paying for the right
to be carried on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Briggs, a senior producer at Yahoo, called Adam a ``key
component'' of the company's service.
</P>
<P>
   However, Adam does not have an exclusive arrangement with Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Yahoo's new site, the company announced agreements
with HealthCentral.com, and Dr.Koop.com, the Web site operated by
Dr. C. Everett Koop.
</P>
<P>
   Healthcare, which represents 14 percent of the nation's $6
trillion-a-year economy, remains a hot area on the Net as investors
and companies vie for a piece of the growing action.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD Inc., a high-flying Atlanta-based Net company, last week
announced a multi-billion dollar merger with Healtheon Corp. The
combined company will have Net services in healthcare for both
consumers and professionals.

 &HT;    Yahoo! buys Encompass for $130 million in stock
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo! announced Thursday that it had paid about $130
million in stock for Encompass, an Atlanta company that makes a Web
browser that comes with PCs made by 7 of the 10 largest PC-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which closed Wednesday, gives Yahoo! a company that
controls the first few minutes of a new PC-user's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC-makers were in the business of just renting their
desktops, selling space so companies like America Online could
place an icon, let people link to their site and become a
customer,'' said Jeff Mallett, president and chief executive
officer of Yahoo!. ``Lately, the PC-makers have been getting back
control of the browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett said Encompass' 27-person staff will stay in Atlanta.
John Willcutts, Encompass founder, former chairman and chief
executive, said he expects to expand the Atlanta office. He said he
will continue to run what had been the Encompass operation in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Encompass software handles the registration of the hardware,
software and Internet Service Provider for people who have bought a
new PC.
</P>
<P>
   The company's browser acts as a kind of welcome wagon for people
new to the Web, pointing them toward the sites and companies that
have paid for that recommendation. A browser is the windshield
through which much of the Internet is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Encompass has distribution agreements with Acer, CTX, Dell,
Diamond Multimedia, Hewlett-Packard, Micron, Toshiba and Sony and
with ISPs such as Earthlink, AT&AMP;T and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who recently bought an Acer computer, for example, would
use an Encompass browser that would already have links set up to
popular Web sites, such as Yahoo! or Amazon.com or Excite. Yahoo!
had been a link on the Encompass browser for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The company made money by selling banner ads on the browser and
links to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let the PC-makers point their customers toward the
companies they do business with,'' Willcutts said. ``We make it
easy for a PC-maker to maintain an economic tie to its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Encompass is based on Circle 75 Parkway, near
Cumberland Mall, but has offices in San Francisco. The 33-employee
company was founded in January, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the company, Willcutts was vice president of
engineering for Softnet, an Atlanta company that made fax
communication software. Encompass was financed by Benchmark Capital
and Technology Crossover Ventures, both in Silicon Valley, as well
as the Interpublic Group of Companies.

COMMENTARY: IN YOUR FACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; There is a lunatic attempt by out-of-work Cold Warriors in
Washington and retrograde Chinese nationalists in Beijing to use
the latest Chinese spying scandal and bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade to put China and the United States on a
collision course. It is times like these when you need a president
who is ready to get right in the face of both his critics and the
Chinese leadership and say the following: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   President to the China-bashers in Congress: ``Where exactly do
you guys think you're going with this? Yes, the Chinese spied on
us. Is it serious? You bet it is. Do we need to drastically improve
security at our nuclear labs and stop our companies from selling
everything that isn't nailed down? You bet we do. But you all seem
to be pushing for something more. Let's cut to the bottom line
here: Do you want to declare war on China? Is that what you want?
Fine, let's do that. Let's take them all on _ all 1.3 billion of
them. Hey, they're only one-fifth of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's not what you want? Well then, cut the war dance and
get real. Yes, China is a rising power, and over time we may have
no choice but to have a Cold War with China. But it is not a
confrontation we should be cultivating. China is not the Soviet
Union. It's not committed to the universal spread of communism.
These are not people who build television sets that blow up when
you turn them on. These are serious people. They've had nuclear
weapons for 35 years. China is not the Soviet Union, which was
surrounded by weak countries that needed our military backing and
welcomed us. China is largely surrounded by strong countries, which
have decent relations with it, and they would not be eager to join
us if we picked a fight with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what if you win your Cold War with China and produce a
collapse of the regime there? What do you think happens the morning
after? That China is going to become a replica of the United
States? That the Dalai Lama will be embraced by Chinese democrats?
If this regime collapses, the morning after will be utter chaos.
You want chaos in China and Russia at the same time? You think that
is going to make America safer? What is it you're trying to trigger
here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to be an American patriot, be outraged at the
lax security of our nuclear weapons labs, be outraged about China's
pervasive spying and still want to foster better relations with
Beijing to bring about a stable transition there and a more
rule-based regime. You seem to have forgotten that we engaged in
sweeping arms-control deals with the Soviet Union at a time when it
was patrolling our coasts with nuclear submarines and trying to
steal every secret we had. If you can't juggle multiple objectives
at the same time, that's your problem. But I am not going to take
this country down the lunatic path of destroying relations with
China so that you can have a cheap political thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   President's message to China's leaders: ``OK, boys, you've had
your fun now. You've sucked up everything from our nuclear labs. I
just want you to know a couple of things. First, we're going to
step up our electronic spying on you. In fact, we're going to be
bouncing so many microwaves off your Defense Ministry your generals
are going to feel like rotisserie chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, I have heard enough about the bombing of your embassy
in Belgrade. We both know it was an accident, and if you keep it
up, I'm going to close the visa window at our embassy in China.
After all, your people wouldn't want to visit a war-mongering
country like ours. Could be dangerous. You want to play footsie
with the Russians? Be my guest. Let's see how many of your young
people want to go to Moscow University for an M.B.A. By the way,
there's no Disney World in Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Chinese friends, you're not the only ones with power and
weight in this relationship. I'm struggling to keep this thing on
track. But if you're not ready to do the same, if it just isn't
important enough for you to stand up to your lunatics, then we
 &UR; will &LR;  end up in a Cold War. And if you think China can develop
without us, well, then the opium trade must have come back to your
shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I checked  &UR; you &LR;  had a $60 billion trade surplus with
 &UR; us &LR; . Oh, I'm sure the Russians would be happy to buy your exports
and give you rubles. Rubles, yes, they make wonderful wallpaper.
You get my drift? So let's cut the bluster and resume a sensible
relationship.''

`THE SWINDLE' IS A WICKEDLY HUMOROUS PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Hollywood, the filmmaking process has become so labyrinthine
and expensive over the past few decades that even the best
filmmakers seem to progressively make fewer films. The late Stanley
Kubrick, for instance, was able to make only five films in the past
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the best French directors somehow manage to keep cranking
out film after film: all have produced a vast body of work in the
'80s and '90s. Claude Chabrol's ``The Swindle'' (which jumps out of
the Seattle International Film Festival lineup for a regular run on
Friday) is his 50th film in 40 years of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   And, while not his best, it represents no big letdown in
quality. It's another wickedly humorous psychological thriller that
provides a showy part for his favorite star, Isabelle Huppert. It's
very much in the tradition of his body of work, but also different
enough to be worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a pair of small-time bunco artists, Betty
(Huppert) and the much-older Victor (Michel Serrault), who work a
circuit of resort hotels and conventions. Betty lures men to her
room, drugs them and steals part of their cash _ but only part, so
their crime might go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The scam has been successful, but has become routine for Betty,
and when she takes a holiday in St. Moritz, she branches out with a
more ambitious scheme to roll Maurice (Francois Cluzet), an
accountant for the mob who is about to transport a suitcase full of
cash to the island of Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   When Betty calls Victor and confesses her plan, he hurriedly
joins her in St. Moritz and the rest of the movie is a strange
cat-and-mouse game in which Betty is swindling both Victor and
Maurice, and in which the audience is never completely sure who
knows what or what exactly is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Chabrol once co-wrote a book about Alfred Hitchcock, who greatly
influenced his style, and hostile critics often dismiss him as a
mere imitator of the master. Since the mood of ``The Swindle'' is
one of his more Hitchcockian in years, it could be in for a rough
critical time.
</P>
<P>
   But it's mostly great fun. The tone is light (it's being
advertised as a comedy, which is not exactly the case), the plot
puzzle is agreeably challenging, and the locations are glamorous,
beautifully composed and well integrated into the story line.
</P>
<P>
   Like the best of Chabrol's films, this one also has a
fascinating, ambiguous, slightly perverse human relationship at its
core: a platonic love affair between a weather-beaten, 70ish master
criminal and a beautiful, 40ish protege who calls him ``Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another SIFF veteran beginning a regular theatrical run this
weekend is the Canadian-Irish feature, ``This is My Father'' _ only
this one is leaping out of the '98 festival, where it had its world
premiere last June in the prestigious closing night slot.
</P>
<P>
   A collaboration of the Quinn brothers _ star Aidan,
cinematographer Declan and writer-director Paul _ it's a
labor-of-love, family project that tells the story of a Chicago
schoolteacher (James Caan) who stumbles upon a 50-year-old photo of
his mother and a man who likely was the father he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied with his own life and obsessed with the mystery of
his family background, he impulsively takes his own troubled son to
their ancestral village in Ireland, and pieces together the story
of his mother's star-crossed love affair _ which we see in
flashback.
</P>
<P>
   The movie somehow fails to be something truly memorable, but
it's touching, full of the moody magic of Ireland, and well-acted
by a cast that includes not only Caan, Aidan Quinn and John Cusack,
but a virtual who who's of the New Irish Cinema: Stephen Rea, Colm
Meany, Donal Donnelly and Brendan Gleeson.

   KINGSTREE, S.C._ They call the area ``on the crick,'' a cluster
of country homes beside a creek, where, by reputation, someone
looking for drugs can find them.
</P>
<P>
   Local deputies know Bloomingvale all too well. Now, state and
federal agents are getting to know it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Williamsburg County Sheriff Kelvin Washington has asked for a
full-blown investigation into a black man's claims he was dragged
beside a truck by two white men, even though the sheriff doubts the
incident was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Texas,'' said Washington, referring to the recent
Jasper, Texas, case in which three white men were charged with
murder in the dragging death of a black man. ``It is unknown and
uncertain whether this is racially motivated. We are not ruling out
the possibility it was drug-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said the two white men were driving through
predominately black Bloomingvale at about 1 a.m. in a red pickup
truck that allegedly was stolen. The two came upon Sharon Green,
23, standing in a driveway. The men stopped to ask directions,
Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow Green ended up halfway into the vehicle and they took
off,'' said Washington. ``It is undetermined whether they were
holding him or he was holding them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officers here said they believe it was a
drug deal gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   But Green told a Charleston television station the passenger in
the truck grabbed his arm as the driver sped off. The passenger did
not let go until he bit him, Green said. He said he was dragged
about a quarter-mile.
</P>
<P>
   Green's right leg and ankle, right arm and lips were injured,
the incident report says. Washington said Green was treated and
released from an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Eric W. Jones, 38, of Gastonia, N.C., and Arthur Marshall, 35,
of Georgetown, S.C., have been charged with assault and battery
with intent to kill. Marshall, who has family in the area
</P>
<P>
   and criminal convictions including assault and grand larceny
dating back to 1981, was also charged with possession of a stolen
vehicle. The men were in custody in the Williamsburg County
Detention Center Thursday afternoon. No bond had been set.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has called on the FBI and the South Carolina State
Law Enforcement Division to see if Green's civil rights were
violated or if other charges are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Munn, SLED spokesman, said state agents will take
statements from witnesses and gather physical evidence before
filing a report with the local solicitor. South Carolina does not
</P>
<P>
   have a hate crime law.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will look into possible civil rights violations, and
will turn over its report to the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came to this area of tobacco and soybean farms
in 1996 to help celebrate the rebuilding of Mount Zion AME Church,
a black church burned by two men with ties to a local Ku Klux Klan
group.

`13TH FLOOR' HAS SOME NICE PRODUCTION TOUCHES AND CHALLENGING
SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood's latest movie about a computer-generated universe,
``The 13th Floor,'' is, in its own way, no less imaginative than
``eXistenZ,'' or ``The Matrix,'' but it definitely suffers from
being the third cat out of the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw the first two entries in this 1999 mini-cycle
will sit through this latest one with a certain sense of deja vu.
The two teenagers who sat in front of me at a preview screening
(discussing every scene as it happened in a loud voice) certainly
did.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you're new to the concept of a
computer-generated alternate world, you may just find much to enjoy
here. The film has a wonderfully noir-ish production design and a
challenging script that takes its premise straight to max.
</P>
<P>
   It's about an L.A. software company that, over six years time,
has painstakingly built a model of the city in 1937 (complete with
``thinking'' characters) that can be downloaded into the human
brain, so the recipient can enter that world as if transported by a
time machine.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, the aged creator of the program (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) is in this world, but has discovered a serious
problem with it _ a problem that, for no reason that makes any
sense, he commits to paper and leaves with a bartender in the old
Ambassador Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to the real world of 1999 L.A., he's promptly
murdered, and it becomes the task of his handsome young successor
(Craig Bierko) to journey to the simulated L.A., interview the
various ``characters'' the old man met there, and find the message.
</P>
<P>
   Like the two earlier films, this one requires you to swallow a
preposterous concept that really doesn't stand up to any analysis.
If you think about it too hard, the absurdity of it creeps in, and
makes it hard to stay in that necessary state of suspended
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   As co-produced by Roland Emmerich (``Godzilla'') and directed
and co-written by his protege, Josef Rusnak _ members of
Hollywood's growing German emigre community _ the film also has a
certain heavy-handedness and ponderousness to the action and chase
scenes, which seem drawn-out, overdone and emotionally uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, charismatic newcomer Bierko does surprisingly
well with his first starring role, the several big twists of the
script are clever and fun, and the production design of the '90s
sequences nicely evokes the stylish bleakness of ``Blade Runner''
(to the point of using some of the same L.A. locations).
</P>
<P>
   The visual recreation of Depression-era L.A. may be
anachronistic (it actually looks more like 1910 L.A.) but the
dream-like, desaturated images are haunting, and indicate that _ as
James Cameron discovered with ``Titanic'' _ the more fertile domain
for computer-animation in the new century may be less the
unappealing future as the lost past.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th Floor. Directed by Josef Rusnak. Screenplay by Joseph
Rusnak &AMP; Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez. Cast: Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol,
Vincent D'Ononfrio. Columbia. 100 minutes. Rated R for violence.

 &HT;    Christian job program delivers a paycheck, spiritual aid
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ Cheryl O'Hair has found Microsoft Windows, the
minimum wage and God. Suddenly, she says, life doesn't look so
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   She's been tricked by false hope before. In those days, she
relied on whiskey and AA meetings.
</P>
<P>
   When she was taking home $500 a week selling alarm systems for
ADT Security, O'Hair figured she finally had moved past two failed
marriages, bouts with alcoholism and a hodge-podge of rotating
jobs. But she just couldn't stop buying as much Crown Royal as she
could drink. Alone, she had spent her days crying and sleeping on
her couch contemplating ``impending doom.'' She quit her
door-to-door sales job after three months. The bank repossessed her
Toyota Celica. She lost her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at rock bottom,'' said the 39-year-old, who ended up
living in government housing and losing custody of her 14-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   She feels she's on the rise _ this time for real. Following the
suggestion of a friend, O'Hair discovered self-sufficiency and
salvation through the Christian Women's Job Corps.
</P>
<P>
   During an Atlanta campaign stop Monday, Vice President Al Gore
said the program is a tonic for what ails American society. While
proposing new financial partnerships between the federal government
and religion-based agencies, Gore called the Birmingham-based
program a model of spiritual aid.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs program, an offshoot of the Southern Baptist
Convention, trains women to fend for themselves. It started two
years ago and has expanded nationwide to 100 cities. There's a
similar group in Peachtree City, Ga., and multiple programs in
Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they are religious or not, most Americans are hungry
for a deeper connection between politics and moral values,'' said
Gore, treading on ground traditionally held by Republicans.
``Americans profoundly _ rightly _ believe that politics and
morality are deeply interrelated. They want to reconnect the
American spirit to the body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality fills a gap in today's culture, O'Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what's happening in schools now,'' she said. ``They've
taken prayer out of school and look what's going on. I believe
everybody needs God.''
</P>
<P>
   A bonus: The Christian job program also delivers a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Certified volunteers teach five-week classes. An expert on labor
relations from BellSouth conducts mock interviews. A horse farmer
gives lessons on money management. Community professionals donate
clothes for interviews and for the first days on the job.
Volunteers canvass businesses for second-hand computers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair makes $6 an hour _$9 on Sundays _ as a church janitor.
When she cried on her couch, she thought mostly about survival. Now
she has the gumption to think about going to school and becoming a
paramedic. On Tuesday, she begins paying her own rent _
$300-a-month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work with them as long as it takes,'' said Anna
Holmes, who runs one of Birmingham's four programs. She registers
about 50 women a year and half find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a notebook, pen, pencil and a binder outlining basic
job skills, the Christian job program gives its graduates a Bible.
Daily devotionals are as integral as learning how to keep a budget.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gore invited the group to be a founding member of his
Welfare to Work Coalition, a task force that, among other things,
helps women find ways to climb out of poverty. The four Birmingham
programs operate on $84,500 a year from donations and grants. The
nonprofit organization pays each of its coordinators about $12,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while Gore backs ``carefully tailored partnerships''
with faith-based groups, the Christian Women's Job Corps refuses
federal entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a historical and Biblical perspective, we feel neither
the church or state should interfere with each other,'' said Trudy
Johnson, national director for the Christian Women's Job Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and civil libertarians look skeptically on Gore's
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's reading the same polls everyone else is,'' said GOP
pollster Whit Ayres. ``The economy is good and many in the public
say that what's wrong can't be fixed by the government but by
something in the spiritual realm. ... It's a tough sell for the
party that has made a religion today of taking religion out of
public life.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's an easy sell to O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more spiritual than religious,'' O'Hair said. ``It's not
like organized religion. You come in and you share your experience.
No one's telling you what God to follow. There's not as much dogma
as in a church.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair shares traits with many of the program's students. She
was a single mom with little education, age 30 to 45 with no job
training and little life experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a dead-end cycle,'' Holmes said. ``But the jobs are
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Thurman, 42, never had been to a job interview until Holmes
helped her get a job at The Greater Birmingham Humane Society.
Before that, Thurman said, she had been spending nearly every penny
she made _ $100 to $300 a week _ on drugs, usually crack cocaine.
She lost her house and bounced between relatives. Eventually, ``no
one wanted to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Holmes, Thurman enrolled in job preparation
classes. She had never seen a resume. Technology was beyond her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I had seen a computer was at the food stamp
office,'' said Thurman, who now catalogues animals on her desktop
PC.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman becomes a full-time employee in a few days. She splits
her rent with the government, paying $286 a month from her own
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a hopeless situation,'' Thurman said. ``But
being with positive people just boosted my confidence. Now I have a
job.''

 &HT;    Gore says GOP trying to shoot down gun control measures
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House Republicans held their first hearing on
proposed gun control legislation, Vice President Gore appeared on
Capitol Hill Thursday to accuse the GOP leadership of seeking to
kill the measures with needless delays.
</P>
<P>
   Are they ``genuinely troubled over the details of the
legislative language?'' asked Gore, flanked by more than a dozen
House Democrats. ``Of course not. It is because some within the
Republican caucus are so responsive to the NRA. They are hoping
against hope that if they can slow-walk this whole measure, then
the American people will lose the sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The House adjourned for the Memorial Day recess without taking
up the gun legislation, though House Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.) has pledged a vote by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore's second appearance on Capitol Hill in just a week
to lobby lawmakers on tougher gun control legislation in the wake
of shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers. Last week, Gore cast
the deciding vote on a Senate provision that would require gun
buyers to undergo criminal background checks at gun shows just as
they do at gun shops, closing the so-called gun show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions include requiring trigger locks and safety
storage boxes to be sold with all handguns and banning the
importation of large ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Those testifying at Thursday's Judiciary subcommittee hearing
included the top lobbyists of the gun lobby, including National
Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, and the
parents of teen shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Scott, the father of a teenage daughter killed at
Columbine High School and a son who was wounded, told lawmakers not
to scapegoat the NRA and work to re-integrate God and prayer into
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think guns kill people without people behind those
guns,'' said Scott, urging lawmakers to avoid ``political posturing
and restrictive legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia mother of a teenage son gunned down ten years broke
down in tears as she described how her son, Scott Phillips-Taylor,
was shot six times with an AK-47 assault rifle stolen by a troubled
teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns killed my son,'' said Byrl Phillips-Taylor, crying
softly. ``The easy availability of guns got my baby killed.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, whose 3-million member organization waged a fierce
lobbying effort against aspects of the Senate bill, urged Congress
to enforce existing laws, rather than pass new ones.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said the NRA would accept ``instant'' background checks
at gun shows, but would reject the current language of the Senate
bill, which allows law enforcement three days to conduct the checks
and defines gun shows as any gathering where more than 50 firearms
are sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a red tape nightmare,'' LaPierre said. ``It's a
massive ... federal government bill that gets into everyone's life
if you just mention the word 'firearm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before hearing from LaPierre, two Clinton administrated
officials testified about the president's proposals for reducing
gun violence, including limiting handgun purchases to one a month
and re-instating the three day waiting period for handgun sales.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, criticized the officials for failing to
enforce existing gun laws. They demanded to know why criminals
denied a gun by the instant background check were not prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged that federal
prosecutions were low, but said most gun violations were prosecuted
at the state and local level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than talking about the gun show loophole, let's talk
about the current loophole that allows criminals to avoid
prosecution,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), an NRA board member.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Barr suggested that if a copy of the Ten Commandments
had been hanging in the hallways of Columbine and Heritage High in
Conyers, as it does in his own congressional office, ``we would not
have had the tragedies that bring us here today.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the media, Gore called on the House to adopt
even tougher gun restrictions than those included in the Senate
bill. But after he had departed House minority leader Richard
Gephardt (D-Mo.) said he would be happy ``if we could simply pass
what the Senate passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats blame huge losses in the 1994 elections on
unpopular votes they cast in 1993 and 1994 on handgun waiting
periods and an assault weapons ban. Democratic leaders are
reluctant to push to hard on gun control for fear of creating
similar problems for Democrats, particularly in rural Southern
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue on which there is not absolute consensus,''
Gephardt acknowledged. ``I think a vast majority of Democrats will
vote for reasonable, moderate gun safety legislation, and I think
you'll find that when we get the bill on the floor.''

CLINTONS TAKE TIME OUT TO RELAX ON FLORIDA PLANTATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YULEE, Fla. _ While Republicans roar about Chinese spying and
Democrats crow about Hillary Rodham Clinton's future political
plans, the only commotion the Clintons are likely to hear this week
might be coming from amorous white rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the first lady are taking a pause from
what has been a rather tumultuous year to relax at the White Oak
Plantation, a 7,500-acre conservatory and timber operation near the
Georgia border owned by the Howard Gilman Foundation. Howard
Gilman, who died two years ago, owned one of the largest privately
held paper and building products companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plantation includes an array of exotic wildlife, including a
white rhinoceros mother and her 4-week-old baby, who reside just
outside of the two-story, cedar-sided house, where the Clintons are
staying through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The five-day vacation is designed to be relatively low-key, with
no prominent guests arriving until the weekend when the Progressive
Policy Institute, a group of moderate Democrats, will gather here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it,'' Clinton said, when asked about the respite from
the ordeals of the nation's capital. So far this year the president
survived an impeachment effort and plunged the nation into a
bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple seem intent on keeping outside distractions to
a minimum. The traveling White House press has been kept at a
distance, housed a half-hour's drive away and across a bridge on
Amelia Island along the Atlantic Ocean. Unlike their favorite
vacation spot of Martha's Vineyard, the opportunities for outside
socializing are limited in the four-stoplight town of Yulee, where
the only Dunkin Donuts just closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the outside world can't help but intrude as the
conflict in Yugoslavia continues and Congress considers a new
report that details how China stole classified military information
over decades.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the buzz continues to grow over Hillary Clinton's likely
plans to run for the Senate from New York. The first lady is
reportedly using some of the down time to put the finishing touches
on her plans to launch an exploratory committee to replace retiring
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She is expected to face
the feisty Republican mayor of New York City, Rudolph Guiliani, in
what political observers predict could be one of the most
pugnacious matches of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This week New York Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope confirmed
that Hillary Clinton was likely to announce the exploratory
committee by late June or July.
</P>
<P>
   Hope said that Hillary Clinton called her from Florida to
inquire about spending part of the summer visiting families in
upstate New York, a Republican-tilting region in a largely
Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems very exuberant and very excited,'' said Hope. ``Her
commitment seems to be increasing toward this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the speculation about her political plans were reports
that the Clintons are checking real estate in Westchester County,
the leafy suburbs north of New York City, where the president is
more apt to find a good golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been no comment here from the first lady. A press
spokesman said her big activity of the day was bike riding with the
president. On Sunday, she is expected to participate in the seminar
put on by centrist Democrats, which may be an effort to soften
likely attacks from New York Republicans that she is an unabashed
liberal who helped mastermind the administration's politically
disastrous national health-care plan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The president also will participate in the Democratic group's
conference. But until then he has played plenty of golf on the
plantation's nine-hole course.
</P>
<P>
   While he may not have had lots of company, Clinton did have his
dog Buddy, who bounded off Air Force One with the president when he
landed at Jacksonville Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The president also brought plenty of reading material, including
Carl Hiassen's ``Lucky You,'' Robert Parker's ``Sudden Mischief''
and Tony Campolo's ``A Reasonable Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the president had totally left behind voters' concerns.
Aides noted that Clinton also brought along weightier reading
matter, including a binder of Medicare information. The
administration is expected to unveil its proposals for shoring up
the federal health-care program for the elderly soon.
</P>
<P>
   The president also could not escape the situation in Yugoslavia,
and took time out to issue a statement supporting the decision by
the International War Crimes Tribunal to indict Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He also telephoned European leaders to confer about the air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not comment on the Cox report to Congress that
revealed widespread theft of U.S. nuclear technology by China.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were quick to note that the embarrassing report
came out as Clinton headed to vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National committee chairman Jim Nicholson, through a
spokesman, quipped that Clinton is ``joining the ostriches with his
head in the sand the day after the Cox committee exposed the worst
case of espionage in the U.S. history under his watch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, there are no ostriches at the White Oak
plantation, although there are wolves, tigers, lizards and a
cockatoo. The Clintons took a tour of that animal kingdom,
including a compound where white rhinos were in the midst of the
mating season.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart defended the president's decision
to take some time off in the midst of the varying crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important from time to time to take the chances to get
away,'' Lockhart said. ``I don't think there is any worry on their
part about appearances here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Wendy Weir &LR; , sister of Grateful Dead guitarist  &UR; Bob Weir &LR;  and a
veteran of careers in ``finance and environmental education,''
claims to have conversed with  &UR; Jerry Garcia &LR;  after his death.
Weir's new book is ``In the Spirit: Conversations With the Spirit
of Jerry Garcia'' (Harmony; $24).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the book was an agreement Jerry and I had before
this life, before being incarnated here on Earth,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After this life, however, there were problems. Weir wasn't in
touch with Garcia until August 1996, a year after his death, when,
she says, she was able to ``break through.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's spirit ``looks like a brilliant, white-gold beam
radiating out from a center of pure light,'' writes Weir. He urges
the Grateful Dead survivors to continue playing together, and tells
the author he wants her to be an example from whom others may
learn.

   _ Lower Your Cholesterol Day festivities, including a planned
giveaway of 25,000 bagels shmeared with the margarine substitute
Benecol at San Francisco's Justin Herman Plaza on Wednesday
morning, were canceled after the food truck broke down near
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   _ The drivers are fine:  &UR; Ann Byington &LR;  applauds the 19-Polk bus
driver she saw present each (delighted) child on his bus with a bag
of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   _ And the passengers are fine, too: We were aboard a 45-Union
whose passengers looked the other way when the driver tried to sign
up witnesses after a fender-bender. When the driver of the car
involved appeared in the bus doorway to blame the accident on the
bus driver, at least half the passengers _ outraged by what they
perceived as an unfair charge _ changed their minds and filled out
witness forms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some imp has been going around painting out an ``n'' in
``Hemingway Dined at Jack's'' signs atop cabs. But no, Papa didn't
die there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secure Wrap, an outfit in Miami, New York and Panama, charges
about $9 to wrap a traveler's suitcase in plastic, which isn't
impenetrable but is considered a deterrent to airport thieves, says
Maxim magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Metropolitan Transportation Commission voted to spend
about $1.7 million _ funds that will need final approval from
Caltrans and the feds _ for renovating the 16th Street BART station
in San Francisco and $350,000 for Pioneer Park atop Telegraph Hill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Motorcyclists in Tennessee have organized a letter-writing
campaign to complain about the recent naming of a stretch of state
highway after a state senator who killed a motorcyclist in a
hit-and-run crash in 1996.  &UR; Carl O. Koella Jr. &LR; , who died in
January 1998 after heart surgery, had pleaded no contest to the
hit-and-run charge.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the highway named after Koella ends on the road
where the accident took place. ``Soon to come,'' prophesies
Citybike magazine, ``the Jack Kevorkian Hospice.''

PAKISTAN CLAIMS TWO INDIAN JETS DOWNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pakistan Thursday claimed it shot down two Indian
combat jets over the disputed territory of Kashmir, further
inflaming a border conflict between the rival nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The shootdown _ and two days of Indian air attacks on hundreds
of separatist invaders _ represented the most serious escalation in
tensions between the countries in a decade, pushing them
dangerously toward their fourth war since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   It has prompted a series of diplomatic appeals for calm from
Washington, the European Union, and the United Nations. US
Assistant Secretary of State Rick Inderfurth urged India's and
Pakistan's ambassadors in Washington to show restraint and stop the
fighting from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about rising escalation of violence in
Kashmir,'' said US National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer.
``We have appealed to the governments in both India and Pakistan''
to find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, India launched a major air assault against Muslim
guerrillas crossing from Pakistan into Indian-controlled territory
in Kashmir. India announced it would continue to use fighter jets
and attack helicopters to dislodge some 400 Muslim separatists that
it claims have infiltrated India in recent weeks with the backing
of the Pakistani army.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has dealt a blow to a February agreement between
India and Pakistan to use peaceful means to resolve the
half-century-old dispute over control of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   US officials and other analysts said that the course of the
conflict is highly unpredictable. But they expressed confidence
that India and Pakistan would have the sense to climb down from its
current confrontation, noting that the countries' leaders have been
in telephone contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this will escalate to war by any means,'' said
Ashley Tellis, a military analyst on South Asia at the Rand
Corporation in California. Tellis believes that Pakistan's
orchestrated the rebel incursion into India-controlled Kashmir in
an attempt to restart flagging peace talks over the fate of
disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan's chief objective was to embarrass New Delhi, let
them know that normalcy will not return to the border without a
settlement and to remind them there are lots of Afghan militants
willing to carry on the fight,'' Tellis said. ``Now that India has
called their bluff, Pakistan has no reason to go on. It has
achieved its objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has vowed to keep on shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pakistan Armed Forces are ready to defend the territorial
integrity of our motherland at every cost,'' said Major General
Anis Bajwa, Pakistan's vice chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials said Thursday that a pair of jets, a Mig 21
and a Mig 27, were hit with ground fire as they ``intruded into our
air space.'' The jets were recovered more than four miles behind
the border, according to Pakistani authorities.
</P>
<P>
   India admitted that one of its fighters was downed by Pakistan.
But it insisted that the second jet was brought down by mechanical
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to panic,'' said Brajesh Mishra, a security
adviser to Prime Minsiter Atal Behari Vajpayee. ``We do not think
that is will escalate into a war.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over Kashmir dates to the birth of two nations. The
mountainous region has been contested since Pakistan and India each
became independent in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which has long sought greater UN involvement in
mediating the dispute, urged the world body to send an envoy to the
region and reinforce a tiny UN military observer force that has
been monitoring the dispute since 1948, making it the
longest-running UN operation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for
a referendum on whether the territory should become part of India
or Pakistan. It has been divided by an uneasy and shifting cease
fire line ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been particularly high since a separatist Muslim
movement took up arms against the predominantly Hindu nation of
India nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that artillery exchanges and commando raids across
the cease fire line are routine at this time of year, when the snow
begins to melt in the Kashmir highlands. And dozens of combatants _
including Afghan veterans of the war against the former Soviet
Union _ die each year during the exchanges.

SIDES CLASH OVER TEEN ABORTION LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A conservative congressman and like-minded
professors clashed with liberal lawmakers and a doctors' group
Thursday over legislation that would bar people from transporting
pregnant girls across state lines to circumvent local laws
requiring parents to be notified before abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., chairman of a House Judiciary
subcommittee, said the proposal would ensure the rights of parents
in states with parental-notification laws to be apprised of their
daughters' medical care. But Rep. Maxine Waters of California, a
senior Democrat on Canady's Constitution Subcommittee, assailed the
proposed Child Custody Protection Act as ``a thinly veiled attempt
to chip away at a constitutionally protected right'' of girls and
women to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law, at least for now, does not require parents to be
notified when their young daughters seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The pending federal legislation is designed to end the practice
of adults escorting girls into Texas and other states with relaxed
abortion laws. Under the measure, adults who transport girls across
states lines for abortions could be sentenced up to one year in
jail and fined.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas law is expected to change soon. Gov. George W. Bush is
predicted to sign legislation on his desk that would require
doctors to notify parents by telephone or mail two days before
performing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant girls fearing violence from their parents could bypass
the notification requirement with a judge's consent.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a hearing of his subcommittee Thursday, Canady said
the federal proposal would end the practice of people interfering
with parents' involvement in a critical medical decision affecting
their children. The Florida Republican said parents usually are the
most knowledgeable about their daughters' medical history,
information a doctor must have before performing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across this county, a child can't even be given an aspirin at
school without her parent's permission,'' Canady said. ``It is not
surprising, then, that many states have decided that a serious
surgical procedure like abortion should also involve the child's
parents, or in some cases, a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-backed legislation has virtually no Democratic
support in the House or Senate and little chance of becoming law
with President Clinton, an abortion rights advocate. But the
measure has given supporters and opponents of abortion rights a
focal point around which to continue debate.
</P>
<P>
   Though not participants at the subcommittee hearing, Planned
Parenthood Federation of America and the National Right to Life
Committee issued dueling statements on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planned Parenthood encourages young women to involve their
parents when they face an unintended pregnancy and are considering
abortion,'' the abortion rights group said. ``But not every family
is a model family. (The legislation) would place young women who
are unable to talk with their parents at risk _ and treat the
people they turn to for help as criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered the National Right to Life Committee: ``By passing the
Child Custody Protection Act, Congress would take a clear stand
against the bizarre notion that the U.S. Constitution confers a
`right' upon strangers to take one's minor daughter across state
lines for a secret abortion, even when a state law specifically
requires the involvement of a parent or judge in the daughter's
abortion decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the subcommittee, University of Texas law
professor Lino Graglia praised the proposed law as a legal and
appropriate way for Congress to regulate abortion.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia law professor John Harrison agreed that
Congress has the constitutional authority to make it illegal to
transport pregnant girls across state lines for abortions. He said
Congress' exclusive authority to regulate interstate commerce
extends to the interstate transportation of people _ a comment that
drew fire from Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a subcommittee member.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Harrison's testimony, Nadler said he knew of no
federal law that bars people from escorting others to another state
for the purpose of engaging in a lawful activity. ``Could Congress
make it illegal for citizens of New York to go to New Jersey to
gamble?'' Nadler asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Klein of the American Academy of Pediatrics said
the legislation would do pregnant girls a disservice by making it
more difficult for them to seek medical care. The girls,
apprehensive due to their pregnancies, must be able to consult
doctors free of the fear that their parents will be notified, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teen struggling with concerns over his or her sexual health
may be reluctant to share these concerns with a parent for fear of
embarrassment, disapproval or possible violence,'' Klein told the
subcommittee. ``The guarantee of confidentiality and the
adolescent's awareness of this guarantee are both essential in
helping adolescents to seek health care.''

AMID NEWS OF INDICTMENT, HEAVIEST BOMBING YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ NATO conducted its heaviest bombing raids yet on
Yugoslavia Thursday as the international War Crimes Tribunal
accused the nation's president, Slobodan Milosevic, and four top
aides of being personally responsible for war crimes committed in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary indictment of a sitting head of state, Chief
Prosecutor Louise Arbour of the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal
in The Hague accused Milosevic and his aides of ordering,
executing, instigating, or aiding and abetting the murder of 340
Kosovar Albanians and the deportation of 740,000 others from Kosovo
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The five have ``personal criminal responsibility'' for the
alleged ``crimes against humanity,'' Arbour said, and not simply
``command responsibility.'' The distinction means that the men are
accused of being intimately involved in the murders and
deportations, and not just culpable as leaders whose forces
committed the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment ``says to the hundreds of thousands of victims of
atrocities in Kosovo that their voices have been heard,'' President
Clinton said from his Florida vacation post.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Belgrade dismissed the allegations, calling
Arbour a ``puppet in the hands of the masters of war.'' The
indictment _ coming as Russian Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin
readied to travel to the Yugoslav capital for peace talks _ ``is
just another way of stopping diplomatic attempts to solve the
crisis through peaceful political negotiations,'' the state-run
Tanjug news agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO stepped up the pressure as well, announcing Thursday it had
flown the highest number of attack sorties _ 741 _ in the 66-day
war. Thursday evening in Belgrade, the power went out after a loud
explosion, believed to be a hit on an oil refinery, was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia upped its defense as well, firing at least 33
surface-to-air missiles against the attacking planes, NATO
spokesmen said, more than three times the daily average. One of
them jolted an F-16 fighter with a near-miss.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is benefiting from an improvement in both the weather and
its geographic launching capability. With the conclusion of
agreements for the use of air space in Romania and Bulgaria, along
with the stationing of 24 F-18 fighter planes in Hungary, Milosevic
is virtually surrounded by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're boxing him in,'' said a Marine pilot at Hungary's
southern air base in Taszar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Milosevic has a lot of military capability,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said Thursday, and Yugoslav air defenses and
runways are being continually repaired after NATO has damaged them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Milosevic, the indictment names Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic, who is commander of Serb forces in Kosovo and
who was present at the failed peace talks in France earlier this
year. The other accused are Nikola Sainovic, a Yugoslav deputy
prime minister and close aide to Milosevic; Vlajko Stojiljkovic,
Serbia's Interior Minister, and Dragoljub Ojdanic, head of the
Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   But if indicting the leaders is dramatic, catching them is
trickier. Just a few more than half of the 84 publicly accused war
criminals from the Bosnian war have been apprehended or have turned
themselves into The Hague, human rights workers note. The biggest
names _ Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic _ are among those at
large, and are believed to be hiding among loyalists in Serbia and
Republika Srpska, the Serb part of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very unlikely'' Milosevic will be apprehended or
volunteer himself to the tribunal, said Colin Soloway, an analyst
with the Sarajevo-based International Crisis Group.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were hailed by human rights leaders, who have
long accused Milosevic and his cronies of committing atrocities in
not only Kosovo, but in Bosnia and Croatia during the 1992-95 wars
there. Arbour said she was still investigating allegations of war
crimes committed in all three locales.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the 41-page indictment said, Serb police hunted
down villagers hiding in a Kosovo forest two days after the bombing
began. The police ordered the women and children to go to Albania,
and demanded identity documents from the males.
</P>
<P>
   The men and boys were herded into a house, and ``Serb police
opened fire on the group. After several minutes of gunfire, the
police piled hay on the men and boys and set fire to it in order to
burn the bodies,'' the indictment said, killing 105 Kosovar
Albanian males.
</P>
<P>
   The account is similar to stories told by legions of refugees
who fled or were forced to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro in the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said the West could
negotiate even with an indicted war criminal, if it meant an
acceptable agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to rule out future contact if it helps us
achieve our objectives,'' Rubin told reporters. ``But there is no
deal on an immunity to be cut, and we will not support efforts by
anyone to suggest it.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria's secretary general for foreign affairs, Albert Rohan,
Austria's top career diplomat, said the indictment of Milosevic was
long overdue and that there would not be any immediate effect on
attempts to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment ``firms him up in the opinion that he cannot give
in,'' Rohan said, but Milosevic will not drastically change his
perspective because he already was strongly resolved not to
compromise Serbia's dominion over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats exprienced in Balkan affairs ``were quite amazed
the tribunal did not proceed sooner,'' he said, adding that he and
other leaders had been in direct contact with the tribunal on the
matter and were ``always told that there was an important
difference between information and truth. Countries in possession
of evidence withheld it for various reasons, presumably
political,'' until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour's work is independent of any military strategy or
diplomatic negotiations, U.N. officials said. ``The prosecutor must
therefore go where the evidence leads her,'' U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said in a statement. ``Justice must be allowed to take
its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbour said the indictment was not timed to assist or interfere
with NATO's objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will say the indictment comes too late; others will say
it came too soon. I say it was perfectly appropriate because it was
governed by the demands of our mandate,'' she told reporters in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have anything to lose now,'' Soloway said. ``He
could go down in flames, creating as much chaos as possible'' in
Kosovo and politically tenuous Montenegro in the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real end game for Slobo, I think,'' Soloway said.

`INHERIT THE WIND' WORTH A LOOK, IF ONLY TO SEE LEMMON, SCOTT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kermit said it best. It's not easy being green.
</P>
<P>
   Differentness is, well, different. Sticking out like a sore
thumb, or like an amphibian among dry-land creatures, will get you
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   For some, this individuality remains the ultimate quest, life's
irresistible aphrodisiac. For others, individuality is not so much
sought after as it is a natural byproduct of personal growth.
Either way, it comes at a price, sometimes affordable, sometimes
not.
</P>
<P>
   With all the subtlety of an inflated ego, Showtime presents a
seminar on the suggested retail price of individualism this
weekend, pairing two worthy study aids: ``The Passion of Ayn Rand''
and a remake of ``Inherit the Wind.'' Both films are period pieces
based in fact, with ``Ayn Rand'' coming out slightly ahead on the
satisfaction meter.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Inherit the Wind,'' the fictionalized story of the John
Scopes ``monkey trial,'' is also worth a look, if only to see Jack
Lemmon and George C. Scott sparring in the courtroom as the thinly
veiled individualists, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   The film has some problems, notably a reliance on unimaginative
scenes lifted whole from the movie-of-the-week handbook. But Lemmon
and Scott trudge slowly up Mount Banal to present an entertaining
debate on the sanctity of individual thought vs. the venerability
of the unthinking collective. It's a pleasant, leisurely walk,
punctuated by Beau Bridges' gently acidic take on the sharp-tongued
journalist, H.L. Mencken.
</P>
<P>
   His name in the film isn't Mencken. It's E.K. Hornbeck.
Likewise, Lemmon's and Scott's characters are named Drummond and
Brady, not Darrow and Bryan and the town is Hillsboro. The names
are changed in keeping with the original 1955 drama by Jerome
Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, which takes huge liberties with the
1925 events.
</P>
<P>
   The Scopes character, named Bert Cates in the film, is on trial
as much for his individualism as for teaching Darwin's theory that
we're not so much monkeys' uncles as monkeys' nephews. Drummond
says at one point: ``I didn't come here to make Hillsboro
different, I came to fight for his right to be different!''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Everett Scott plays Cates as the simple, honest, small-town
schoolteacher caught up in something he never envisioned. An
individual simply because he colors outside the lines, he is
charged with thinking outside the box. (Brady, the fundamentalist
with a voice like a cement mixer and a personality to match,
bellows that Cates teaches EVIL-ution.)
</P>
<P>
   The price of his individuality is loss of employment and
possible loss of freedom. Drummond and Brady, meanwhile, pay higher
than retail for displaying their own brand of individualism.
Lemmon's Drummond is liberal and open-minded; George C. Scott's
Brady is conservative and intransigent. Such polarization is
horribly hackneyed, but over the course of two hours, Lemmon and
Scott, both outstanding in shirt-sleeves and suspenders, manage to
keep the cliche subsidiary to an engaging debate about free thought
and conformity.
</P>
<P>
   For Ayn Rand, conformity was death. Even worse, it was just so
unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Passion of Ayn Rand,'' the marvelous Helen Mirren
stylishly conveys the cult of self that Rand forged into a
mini-industry after her two novels, ``The Fountainhead'' and
``Atlas Shrugged,'' found a willing and receptive audience in the
'40s, '50s and even today.
</P>
<P>
   Her most willing audience was Nathaniel Branden, a brilliant
UCLA psychology student who became her protege, and then her lover
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was not your usual affair. Rand and Branden, who both changed
their Jewish-sounding names to fit their self-images, carried on
with the full knowledge and grudging consent of their respective
spouses. The film is based on the book by Barbara Branden, who to
this day remains devoted to Rand for giving her ``the gift of life,
because I learned to think from her in a way I don't think I would
have fully have discovered on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The French actress Julie Delpy plays Barbara Branden in the
film, sometimes struggling with an American accent but nobly
displaying the conflicting emotions of a scorned wife who remains a
disciple in Rand's inner circle. Peter Fonda is Rand's cuckolded
husband, Frank O'Connor, who also manages to extract a measure of
nobility from his unhappy situation.
</P>
<P>
   But the film belongs to Mirren, as the brilliant and
controversial writer-philosopher, and to Eric Stoltz, as Nathaniel
Branden, the icy-cool intellectual who gets Rand's motor running
with his smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Of their relationship, the enormously condescending Rand says,
``Lesser people could never accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but with arresting imagery, great music and a quality
cast, ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' makes it fun to watch how
uncomfortable nonconformity can be.

 &HT;    Baby from Bosnia on the mend now
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _The sound of blood and oxygen swirling and swishing
underneath a tiny patched-up chest signals a new lease on life for
Azra Beso, the 2 1/2-month-old Bosnian baby who fell from the sky
into Atlanta's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Azra is expected to be discharged this weekend or early next
week from Egleston Children's Hospital, where she was moved
Thursday from the cardiac intensive care unit into a room.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kirk Kanter and a team of eight on Monday switched the
baby's main heart arteries, which were transposed at birth. The
condition causes an inadequate mixture of blood and oxygen, leading
to labored breathing and, if untreated, eventually death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect she should have a normal heart and a normal
life expectancy,'' said Kanter, a pediatric cardiac-thoracic
surgeon. ``She's doing much better and she's started to take in
food on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Azra should be on the mend after a few weeks of recovery in the
home of a host family, Dr. Joe and Sharon Wilson, where she will
stay with her mother, Almira Beso, and translator Julijanna
Mikulic.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the color of her daughter's lips from bluish to pink
was one of the first changes that Azra's mother noticed, Kanter
said. ``She's pink now, for the first time in her life, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mom also knows that her daughter feels better. ``She's been
smiling a lot,'' Almira Beso said through Mikulic. ``She's a really
happy baby, and she likes to be held.''
</P>
<P>
   Azra's arrival in Atlanta last month was unexpected. She was
aboard a Delta Air Lines flight from Vienna, Austria, to Detroit
for scheduled heart surgery there when her breathing went from
troubled to touch-and-go halfway across the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls made from the plane quickly arranged emergency
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Azra is one of dozens of infants born with congenital heart
defects in Bosnia who are being helped by Samaritan's Purse Bosnia
Heart Project. The babies can't be treated in Bosnia, because its
civil war disrupted medical services and drove doctors out of the
country. In the United States, about one in every 1,000 babies is
born with the same congenital heart defect as Azra, the cause of
which is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Samaritan's Purse, a nonprofit international Christian relief
group, is headed by Franklin Graham of Boone, N.C., and provides
medical and spiritual assistance. The Heart Project finds U.S.
hospitals willing to treat Bosnian babies on a charitable basis and
arranges a round-trip flight and a host family for the baby, mother
and a translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure when we will go home, back to Bosnia,''
Mikulic said. ``We could be here a few more weeks or another month.
We both want to get back to our families.''

MILOSEVIC INDICTMENT LIMITS PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that there's an arrest warrant out for Slobodan Milosevic,
hopes for a negotiated end to the Kosovo conflict are fading fast,
say Balkan watchers. And military escalation _ including the use of
NATO ground troops _ is growing more likely every day.
</P>
<P>
   By indicting the Yugoslav president for war crimes committed in
Kosovo, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia has deepened his isolation. He will, for instance, be
unable to travel to a peace conference without risk of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   All 185 member states of the United Nations plus Switzerland
(which maintains a permanent observer mission to the United
Nations, but is not a full member) are obligated to detain
Milosevic if he sets foot on their soil. This includes nations like
Russia, Belarus, and China that have sympathized with the Serbs in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Also, all UN states must freeze any assets of Milosevic and the
four lieutenants indicted with him, said war crimes prosecutor
Louise Arbour, who announced the indictments Thursday at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``This complicates the political situation,'' said John Reppert,
a specialist on international security at Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government. ``Think how it would be if you invited him back to
Rambouillet and he was given an arrest warrant, not a hotel key.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris suburb of Rambouillet was where negotiators tried to
work out a peace plan for Kosovo before the conflict began.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Milosevic may never be brought to trial. He might
hunker down as Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic have done. Both were indicted for war crimes; neither has
been arrested despite the presence of NATO troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has watched NATO operate,'' said Reppert. ``He may know
that an indictment isn't quite as serious as it may seem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a public relations win for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has been struggling for a legal rationale
for the intervention in the Balkans,'' said Michael Scharf,
professor of international law at New England School of Law and a
former State Department official. ``Now they've got it. This gives
them the legal high ground.''
</P>
<P>
   With more and more NATO troops being readied for deployment to
the Balkans, that sort of justification will be important in
convincing the public that potential casualties are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the indictment likely will affect the Yugoslav
conflict and attempts to bring it to a peaceful conclusion,
according to Balkan analysts.
</P>
<P>
   --Peacemaking: Though Russian, Finnish, American, and other
diplomats are shuttling from capital to capital talking peace, the
United States and its allies will be loathe to sign a treaty with
an indicted war criminal, many specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you negotiate with a war criminal?'' asked Uri Ra'Anan,
professor of international relations at Boston University. It's a
question that many analysts have been asking. Ra'Anan takes it a
step further: If Milosevic does not surrender himself to the UN or
is not toppled by his own people, NATO will have to fight him to
the bitter end. ``If you don't negotiate with him,'' Ra'Anan said,
``it appears that the NATO stance is unconditional surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not shared by other observers, including Reppert,
who still sees diplomacy as a live option. But he noted that the
indictment may have set back these efforts, pointing out that the
Russian media have expressed suspicion that the timing of the
indictment was an attempt to undermine the efforts of Balkan envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO resolve: Germany, Italy, and Greece have been
increasingly uncomfortable with the NATO air campaign, which is now
in its third month. Public support in the United States and Europe
also has been weakening in recent weeks, according to opinion
polls. There are many reasons for this, say analysts, including the
bombing mistakes by NATO planes and televised reports of suffering
by the Serbian people. With the Serb leader labeled a war criminal,
allied support for the campaign against him might firm up, say
several analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that this will stiffen the resolve of some
wobbly people in NATO and have an impact on public opinion in
non-NATO countries,'' said Terry Scott, former Air Force lieutenant
general who directs the national security program at the Kennedy
School.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility made Ra'Anan a bit skeptical about the timing:
``It's an interesting coincidence between the appearance of this
indictment and the need to shore up public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   --Opposition in Belgrade: Though the Serbian people are
overwhelmingly bitter about the NATO bombing, the singling out of
Milosevic as an alleged war criminal may give pro-democracy forces
some hope. Jasminka Udovicki, a local academic who stays in touch
with anti-Milosevic activists in Belgrade, said the indictment at
least encourages them ``that Milosevic is not going to be there
when this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said both Udovicki and Scott, military and
political leaders in Belgrade may begin to distance themselves from
him _ may even oppose him _ to save themselves from guilt by
association in a post-war Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a staff apparatchik without much blood on your
hands and you suddenly realize that before this is over you might
have something to answer for, you might split off from Milosevic,''
said Scott. ``It becomes more difficult to be seen sitting at the
table with him.''

MBEKI, MANDELA'S LIKELY SUCCESSOR, IS NO CLONE OF SOUTH AFRICAN
PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   VREDENDAL, South Africa _ When Thabo Mbeki rose to speak in the
half-empty community hall here recently, the applause was polite.
Barely visible behind the tall lectern, the diminutive Mbeki began
with what sounded like an attack on the press.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters never come to places like Vredendal, he said. They
never look at the new housing project here or the farming project
that is about to give 50 people new jobs. The press, he said,
believes that bad news will sell. But, he said, there is plenty of
good news to be told about the new South Africa, and some of it is
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vredendal speaks of the capacity we have to work together,''
Mbeki said. ``To generate good stories, not just the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In this small, remote farming community awash with poverty, the
pep talk was clearly welcome. By the time he had finished speaking,
Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president and the man who will almost
certainly inherit President Nelson Mandela's job after the election
on June 2, had earned a standing ovation _ a bit restrained
perhaps, but a standing ovation nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has none of the spontaneous charm and sense of the
right gesture that makes Mandela so beloved, the reserved, bookish
Mbeki, 56, has thrown himself into campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He is everywhere these days, kissing babies, escorting old women
to the podium to speak with him, and offering a message of hope
that many South Africans, appalled at the rising crime and
unemployment rates, are eager to hear: Change will come faster now
because the policies are in place.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Mbeki has been the behind-the-scenes
administrator as Mandela has greeted dignitaries and traveled the
globe to woo foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   It is Mandela, 80, who basked in the photo opportunities wearing
his open-necked ``Madiba shirts,'' while Mbeki _ rarely out of a
suit and tie _ handled the nitty-gritty, giving few interviews and
offering little of himself to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts say they are not yet sure who the real
Mbeki is. No one doubts his intellectual abilities. He writes his
own speeches, some of them memorable. He is said to be a chief
architect of the country's conservative economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   But some say an aura of fear lurks around him. They point out
that his early political rivals have been all but extinguished,
some leaving for the business world, others pushed to the fringes
of the governing party, the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, an economist with a degree from Sussex University in
Britain, is working hard at a new image. He has even been seen in a
sports shirt under a blue blazer. But, frankly, stiff may be more
his style.
</P>
<P>
   During a broadcast on AIDS last year, he gave a speech while
seated, surrounded by orphaned children, some of them climbing up
his legs and pulling at his clothes. During the entire 15 minutes
the camera was fixed on him, he didn't pat or touch a child.
</P>
<P>
   When he is surrounded by adult well-wishers trying to touch him,
he often looks like a deer caught in the klieg lights. Mandela goes
right for the tallest beauty queen in a crowd and chats her up;
Mbeki smiles but seems tongue-tied with almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is now wading into the crowds, grabbing hands, and is
even occasionally dragged into dancing with the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the African National Congress will
win the election _ perhaps by the two-thirds majority it is hoping
for. The party still commands loyalty for its role in the
liberation struggle, and it has delivered on its campaign promises,
at least in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Electric and telephone poles can be seen crisscrossing even the
tin shack settlements that sprawl across the landscape. A new
constitution has been enacted and more than 500 laws have been
passed, revamping a legal system that once ordained that blacks
could not vote and needed only a rudimentary education.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems remain enormous, and South Africans are
beginning to grumble. Every day newspapers deliver a catalog of
rapes, killings and armed robberies. And the country has lost more
than 500,000 jobs since 1994 _ leaving many who have just gotten
phones, lights and clean water unable to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent community meeting in the black township of Soweto,
many of those who came to speak to Mbeki simply described their
poverty. Holding her paycheck in her hand, Rebecca Madiba said she
was earning about $220 a month as a nurse's aide and could not pay
her electricity or her taxes.
</P>
<P>
   She now owed more than $1,000 and was afraid she would lose her
new house. She simply asked for help. Mbeki, sitting on a dais
surrounded by officials, listened intently.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that he is gaining in popularity, though he does not
yet approach the status reserved for Mandela and he is
significantly less popular than Mandela among whites. Some
political analysts were sure that Mbeki would rely on Mandela to do
most of the campaigning. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign kicked off in earnest, Mandela was abroad,
visiting China, Pakistan, Russia and Hungary. Early posters
featured the two men together, but the vast majority now feature
only Mbeki and the slogan that the African National Congress used
in 1994: ``A Better Life for All.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mbeki remains a fiercely private man. In a rare television
interview recently, he repeatedly turned away personal questions,
saying at one point that he was willing to tell people what size
shoes he wore and how much coffee he drank, but he didn't think
they really cared _ so he wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   When the dogged interviewer insisted that people wanted to know
him, he replied that on the hustings ``people want to shake
hands.'' He added: ``They want to embrace. They want all sorts of
things and you see the passion in their eyes, and none of them have
said, `Who is this Mbeki whose hand I want to shake?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pestered further, he briefly relented. He was reading a book on
economics by two Americans and had just stayed up late the night
before to watch the movie ``Educating Rita'' on television. He
should have been sleeping, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, having poured out one-eighth of an inch of his soul, he
turned on the interviewer. What had revealing that ``done for the
South African public?'' he asked. ``Well I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer gave up.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His unknowability particularly worries non-blacks. Mandela could
sometimes be harsh about how little whites were contributing to
remaking this society, but most whites believed that they could get
a fair hearing from the president _ who talked often of the need
for forgiveness. Mbeki, though, is seen as a man who keeps whites
out of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thabo's priority is not national reconciliation,'' said Themba
Sono, the head of the nonprofit South African Institute for Race
Relations and a frequent critic. ``It is national reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Mbeki's most notable speeches, often referred to as the
``two nations'' speech, delivered last year, harshly questions
whether South Africa is moving toward national unity. It is two
nations, he said, one white and rich, one black and poor. Unlike
the case in Germany, where the West paid to help the East when the
Berlin Wall came down, whites are not doing the same in South
Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said about 30 percent of corporations were trying to
dodge their taxes while the new government was being faulted for
failing to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, which prompted nervous responses from the country's
editorial writers, most of whom are white, ended with a reference
to the American poet Langston Hughes and what happens to a dream
deferred: it explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mandela and Mbeki come from Transkei, an area of almost
treeless rolling hills that Mandela talks of with great fondness.
Mandela was from Xhosa nobility, though he was the first in his
family to receive a formal education.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, on the other hand, was the product of a small black
middle class. His family converted to Christianity early on and had
been successful farmers, teachers, preachers and clerks for
generations before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki did not grow up in wealth or ease. His father was
Govan Mbeki, an early African National Congress intellectual and an
avid Communist who spent much of his life imprisoned on Robben
Island with Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Though educated, the family was often desperately poor as Govan
Mbeki, dedicated to the cause, was in and out of jail. The main
income was from a small shop that Thabo Mbeki's mother, Epainette,
ran. It also served as the post office and one of Thabo's chores as
a youth was to read and write letters for villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Govan was a distant father even before he was sent to jail and
says himself that he does not really know his son. Thabo joined the
movement at 14 and was a student activist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 the African National Congress decided to send him abroad
to study, but not before he had fathered a child with his young
sweetheart. The boy disappeared in 1980, apparently on his way into
exile, and is presumed to have died at the hands of South Africa's
brutal security police.
</P>
<P>
   But even the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was
unable to find out what had happened to him. Mbeki later married
Zanele Dlamini, who is now the director of the Women's Development
Bank, which provides small loans to women, mostly in rural areas.
They have no children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his university degree, Mbeki went to Russia for
military training. But he was always considered better with a book
than an AK-47. During one frigid night march in the Russian
wilderness, he lost his map, forcing his disgruntled platoon to
wander for miles. But he is considered a shrewd politician,
particularly able to find compromise.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, he rarely asks for a vote. Instead, he
highlights the government's accomplishments. As in Vredendal, many
of his stops focus on new schools, new roads, new water pipes. He
talks often about the need to root out corruption, strengthen the
police and the justice system and get ``delivery'' moving faster.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be successfully forging an image of himself as a
tough leader, perhaps more willing to enforce discipline than
Mandela. After listening to Mbeki in Soweto, Hazel Mashinini, 22,
who counsels AIDS sufferers, said she was optimistic about the
course Mbeki would set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ANC has gotten a bad name because some in the Cabinet are
there for their own pockets, but I think Mbeki will fix that,'' Ms.
Mashinini said. ``Mandela is an old man and maybe too soft. He
wants us all to live a happy life. But Thabo Mbeki is still young.
He understands the problems.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ On a rundown road in this sprawling border
city, the Castaneda Elementary School, built in 1965 for the
children of Mexican migrant workers, is still housed in its
original portable buildings. All of its 360 pupils are
Mexican-American; a majority arrive not knowing English and a
quarter spend several months a year on the road with their working
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last year, 90 percent of Castaneda's third-graders passed
the state's standardized test of academic skills, putting it among
the state's top schools. Many other schools are not far behind. In
1998, 76 percent of third-graders in Texas passed the test, up from
58 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And on national examinations, Texan schoolchildren have begun to
show up their peers in other states. The trend has become so
consistent that Texas' public school system, long among the
nation's most troubled, is viewed today by educators as an emerging
model of equity, progress and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable turnaround for a school system that is more
than half black and Hispanic, and the causes and effects are being
debated around the country. Few would deny that children are the
chief beneficiaries. But with a presidential election next year,
there will very likely be another beneficiary, Gov. George W. Bush,
at the moment the Republicans' best hope for taking control of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush cannot take full credit for the turnaround _ and he
does not try to _ his record on education in Texas shows that some
credit will rightfully accrue to him.
</P>
<P>
   He readily acknowledges that the improvements in the system were
well under way when he came into office in 1995. But he and others
point to his enhancement of the system _ his firm support for
accountability, his non-ideological approach, his initiative on
early reading _ as evidence of his ability to lead, manage and
unite disparate factions at a time when education is emerging as
the most significant domestic political issue in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas school system is not without detractors. Some
educators complain that it puts too much emphasis on standardized
tests; others assert that the tests are too easy, and still others
say that the system permits too much state control. And there are
those who contend that the state has put too little money into
teacher training. But for now the criticism is relatively muted,
with most educators offering praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from outside come to me and say, `He represents the big
money interests of Republicans everywhere,'' ' said Susana Navarro,
executive director of the El Paso Collaborative for Academic
Excellence, a nonprofit group in El Paso. ``But all I can say is
that in Texas with regard to education, George Bush has managed to
maintain the sort of system that insures attention, support and
achievement for minority and poor kids. While he has been governor,
the gap between minorities and whites has closed rather
remarkably.''
</P>
<P>
   This has stemmed partly from a unique accountability system that
predates Bush's tenure and requires all Texas schools to give an
array of standardized tests and record the results for each
subgroup _ white, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged.
The schools are judged on the performance of each group separately.
Other states give tests but no other uses the performance of
subgroups separately to determine success.

   When Bush was elected in late 1994, the accountability system,
an initiative of the education commissioner of his Democratic
predecessor, Ann Richards, was still new. Those who saw it as vital
to the future of minority schoolchildren feared that he would
dismantle or weaken the system. Instead, they say, he has
strengthened it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a relatively short period of time, the whole culture of
education has changed in Texas,'' said professor Richard Elmore,
who specializes in public policy at Harvard's Graduate School of
Education. ``Today, kids of color and poor kids there are fully
expected to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last nationally administered mathematics test for
fourth-graders, the 1996 National Assessment of Educational
Progress, black Texans ranked first among all black fourth-graders
in the country, white Texans ranked first among white
fourth-graders and Hispanic Texans ranked sixth.
</P>
<P>
   This was in marked contrast to states with similar populations:
California's black fourth-graders ranked 36th and New York's
Hispanic fourth-graders ranked 30th.
</P>
<P>
   National reading tests in 1998 again showed Texas ahead of the
pack. Black fourth-graders in Texas were ranked ninth nationally
while those in California were 29th and those in New York 16th.
White fourth-graders in Texas were second while those in Florida
were 33rd and those in New York were sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And a report last November by the National Education Goals
Panel, a group that tracks education across the country, cited
Texas and North Carolina for their rapid gains.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' test gains do not follow any notable increase in
investment in the education system, though its teacher/pupil ratio,
15.3-to-1, puts it ahead of the national average of 17.3-to-1. The
state's other vital education statistics are slightly below the
national average. Its spending per pupil is about $5,500 while 26
percent of its teachers have advanced degrees and 49 percent have
11 years of experience or more.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office in Austin _ glass cases of signed
baseballs against one wall recall his recent ownership of the Texas
Rangers _ Bush emphasized his new legislative proposals aimed at
having every third-grader reading at grade level. He said that
research showed that after third grade, catching up was much harder
for pupils who fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals, most of which have been approved by the
Legislature, is one calling for five days of training for every
teacher in kindergarten through third grade. The Legislature has
already approved $18.8 million to carry out the training this
summer, with another $30.8 expected to be allocated for it next
summer. Under the plan, all children deemed likely to have problems
would receive special instructions as early as kindergarten,
continuing through third grade.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the rest of Bush's plan passes the Legislature
in the current session, all third-graders would be required to pass
a reading test to move to fourth grade starting in 2003. Many
states are talking about ending so-called social promotion _ the
practice of moving children to the next grade irrespective of their
academic skills _ but Texas would be among the first to accompany
that policy with a program of early intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from the ultimate results-oriented world, which is
major league baseball,'' Bush said. ``Every day we saw the score.
Texas has a very good accountability system that began to develop
thanks to others who preceded me. I have worked hard to strengthen
it, to continue to raise the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas educators credit Bush with persuading wealthy business
friends to donate money to advance education _ for example, by
bringing in experts for advice and rewarding high-performance
pupils.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The implications for education of a Bush presidency are vague.
Bush has so far declined to lay out any specific ideas for a
national education policy, advocating state and local control. That
puts some distance between him and Vice President Al Gore, who
recently called for an ambitious federal policy that would make
preschool universally available and offer grants of $10,000 to
college graduates willing to spend four years teaching in troubled
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he is not sure what role a president or the federal
government should play in education. He mentions the ``bully
pulpit'' and the need to press for sound research and
accountability systems that rely on testing and clear goals. He
says, when asked, that he may be open to the use of federal money
as a means of persuasion, something President Clinton also
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has upset liberals with his support of vouchers, the use of
public money to send children to private schools, but that support
has not been especially vigorous, and Texas has not instituted a
voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says his views on education have been influenced by his
years as a businessman and by his mother, Barbara Bush, who has
long pushed literacy in a national campaign, and his wife, Laura, a
former librarian.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Texas accountability system since it was
instituted in 1991 has been the relentless focus on testing. Every
year, from third through eighth grade and once again in high
school, virtually every Texas public school pupil takes a version
of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, known to all in the
state as TAAS. The results, along with school attendance figures,
determine a school's rating in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In some districts, the administration of the skills test is
viewed as the end of an annual campaign, rather like the homecoming
football game, in which every pupil is a player. Students train
with pep rallies and inspirational speeches; posters plaster the
walls; those who pass are rewarded with parties and full days at
amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is not universally admired. It is opposed by the
religious right because it is seen as a centralized curriculum, and
by some on the left for the fact that minority children do less
well than whites, and by other parents and educators who say
``teaching to the test'' is a distortion of the learning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many years, all my daughters' teachers have done is drill
them for TAAS instead of giving creative writing or interesting
projects,'' said Susan Monsees, an Austin dental hygienist, whose
two daughters are in the ninth and fifth grades. ``I am not a Bush
supporter. I see him using TAAS and education for political gain.
The system may look good on paper but I feel my daughters are
getting ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minority rights advocates worry about reliance on
standardized tests because black and Hispanic students historically
do less well on them. The Mexican American Legal Defense and
Education Fund is suing the state of Texas over the high school
skills test, which students must pass to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say governments shouldn't measure because that is too
much government control,'' Bush said. ``Some say it is racist to
test. I strongly say it is racist not to test because by not
testing we don't know and by not knowing we are just moving
children through the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argues that the success is the result of ``the simple
application of principles'' that could apply to running a business:
clear, easy-to-understand and measurable goals, staying focused on
a few things and doing them well.
</P>
<P>
   His analogy to business is significant. Texas' success, most
analysts agree, stems from a sustained interest in education by the
state's business leaders, which began in 1983 when a panel headed
by Ross Perot made a number of recommendations. Many were passed by
the Legislature, setting the stage for the improvements to come.
These included reducing class sizes in first through fourth grades,
introducing statewide performance tests for students, not allowing
students with below-average grades to play on school sports teams
and reallocating state education funds so that poorer districts
received a larger share.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders said they understood that the state's
future depended on producing a well-schooled population. They said
they also realized that it would not be many years before the
state's Mexican-American and black citizens would form a majority
and that to neglect them meant to neglect Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As Mike Moses, the state's current commissioner of education,
put it: ``The school system is already `majority-minority.' The
fate of our state is dependent on those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the minority pupils were part of the advance,
superintendents, principals and teachers were allowed to pursue the
goal of having their pupils pass the skills test as they saw fit, a
management approach that Bush considers vital to the improved test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   At the Roosevelt Elementary School in North Houston, where only
eight percent of the children are white, Charlotte Parker, the
principal, requires each child to hand in to her a writing sample
every two weeks. Ninety percent of her pupils, many of them in
bilingual education, now pass the skills test.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the use of bilingual education in Texas is noteworthy,
another example of Bush avoiding traditional Republican education
politics. The practice in Texas is in sharp contrast to what is
happening in California, a state with a very similar population.
Last June, California banned the use of bilingual education because
of concerns that children were not learning English and that the
Hispanic population was engaging in separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Texas not only permits bilingual education, but many of its
schools are planning to increase its use so that students who leave
classes taught in Spanish for those taught in English maintain
their fluency and literacy as they get into the upper elementary
grades, the practice that most worried Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this, Bush said he favored ``what works'' and that
as long as children learned English and proved, through their test
scores, their English proficiency, he had no objection to the use
of bilingual education. And he adds, ``You have got to understand
that we have a 1,600-mile border with Mexico with uncles and aunts
on both sides of the border for centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   This is especially important in border cities like Brownsville.
Superintendent Wallace Jackson said that six years ago, based on
the skills test, the district had 11 low-performing schools out of
43. Today there are none.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lopez High School in Brownsville, Sylvia Senteno, the
dean of instruction, said that ``for 30 years, no one cared how
many kids dropped out.'' Today, since school ratings depend partly
on attendance and reducing dropout rates, Ms. Senteno said, ``we do
everything we can to keep kids in school so as to avoid lowering
our rating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We visit their homes,'' she said. ``We have improved the food.
We greet the kids when they arrive, even hand out free pencils if
we get them, anything to show them we miss them when they are not
here.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, she said, only five seniors failed the skills test.
Three years ago, there were 70.

   INSTALLATION-ARTIST (Undated) _ Ann Hamilton, the installation
artist who will represent the United States in the 48th Venice
Biennale, which opens on June 13, is a slight woman. Dressed in the
art-world uniform, black pants and jacket, her salt-and-pepper hair
closely cropped, she is a casual, earnest person who occasionally
flashes an impish smile. But if she has the look of a pixie, she
also has a mind as imposing as an Oxford don's _ and much more
imaginative. Among the many honors on her resume is a much-coveted
``genius'' award from the MacArthur Foundation. Her works are known
for being sensory and cerebral at the same time. By Judith H.
Dobrzynski. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo. &UR; ( &LR;

</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-FILMS (Undated) _ The Shakespeare thing. Is it out
of control? Like lemmings, Hollywood's bankable are rushing to
throw themselves into the sea. Right now, Michelle Pfeiffer's
Titania, queen of the fairies, is flitting through Michael
Hoffman's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' in starlit freefall. Soon to
follow are Jessica Lange's Tamora, vicious Queen of the Goths, in
Julie Taymor's cinematic ``Titus Andronicus,'' and Alicia
Silverstone as the by no means clueless Princess of France in
Kenneth Branagh's updated ``Love's Labour's Lost.'' The industry is
smitten, cranking out Shakespeare as if there were no tomorrow. By
Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CANNES-FILM-FEST (Cannes, France) _ The top official accolades
at the Cannes International Film Festival were awarded to two
intense, painful French-language films dealing with hard lives in
lonely surroundings. The Palme d'Or winner, the Belgian film
``Rosetta'' by the brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, offers a
fierce portrait of a young woman trying to eke out a living against
impossible odds. The year's other major winner, Bruno Dumont's
``L'Humanite,'' is self-consciously minimalist. Dumont's would-be
painterly, philosophical film watches a wide-eyed police
investigator respond to stirrings of evil and sexuality in a rural
town, where the filmmaker regards his characters as brutish and
naked in every sense. By Janet Maslin. (Moved).

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-LA-FOSSE-DANCE (New York) _ On a recent Sunday, Robert La
Fosse of New York City Ballet prepared to put on the sleek black
wig, orange gloves and cape of the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart for
the final performance of Peter Martins's ``Swan Lake.'' A few days
later, the elaborate wig and makeup of Von Rothbart packed away, La
Fosse looked more like his wholesome, all-American self in
rehearsals for two of the three new ballets, collectively called
``Duke!'' and set to Duke Ellington's music, that have their
premiere on Thursday as part of City Ballet's program celebrating
jazz. By Susan Reiter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANATASIA-BALLET (New York) _ Not many story ballets are based on
the lives of real people while they are still living. Yet the
ballerina Lynn Seymour recalls that she wasn't surprised when the
choreographer Kenneth MacMillan asked her to create the role of
Anna Anderson, the woman who for years claimed to be the Grand
Duchess Anastasia, a daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in a
one-act ballet, ``Anastasia,'' that he choreographed in 1967 for
Berlin's Deutsche Oper Ballet. The story of the mysterious woman
who thought she was Anastasia so captivated MacMillan that in 1971
he expanded the work into a eveninglong ballet for Britain's Royal
Ballet, which performed it in New York the following year. Now, on
Thursday, ``Anastasia'' returns to New York in the first of eight
performances to be presented by American Ballet Theater at the
Metropolitan Opera House. By Terry Trucco. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AVERY-FISHER-PRIZE (New York) _ Calliope, Euterpe and Erato
looked out from the pages of the morning newspaper not long ago.
Daughters of Zeus, goddesses of the arts, photographically
rendered. Well, maybe not the three Muses but certainly violinists.
Their particular Zeus has passed on but left behind a patrimony now
called the Avery Fisher Prize. Women, when I was growing up, were
not known for having pockets, but those of Sarah Chang, Pamela
Frank and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg are now each jingling with
$50,000. The big news about the prestigious and financially
attractive award is that the present honorees are all female. It
has not happened before. This same-sex recognition serves the
sociological concerns of the music world, though I, for one, can't
hear anything identifiably feminine or masculine in their playing.
They just play, which is, I hope, the reason they won. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DIDO-RECORDINGS (Undated) _ When performers make new recording
alliances, they often start by revisiting favorite works. Ideally,
they do so for good reasons: their ideas have changed, or
scholarship has yielded new perspective on a work. Whatever the
terms of the new agreement between the conductor Andrew Parrott and
Sony, Parrott's second reading of Purcell's ``Dido and Aeneas''
(Sony Classical SK 62993; CD) is sufficiently different from his
classic 1981 Chandos recording, for better and worse, that he
cannot be charged with reduplication of the more cynical kind. By
Allan Kozinn. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-OPERA-HOUSES (Shanghai, China) _ In one of the strangest
regional competitions in China yet, every city that can afford one
suddenly wants its own world-class opera house. Now leading the
competition is Shanghai, whose gleaming Grand Theater opened last
September. The $150 million building in glass and steel is up to
the minute technologically, with French design, German
construction, a Japanese stage and American acoustics. A separate
concert hall is to open by the end of the year. By Sheila Melvin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AULENTI-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ They say that anyone can
nominate candidates for the Pritzker Architecture Prize. May I
propose Gae Aulenti? The great Milanese architect has just broken
ground for her first major project in the United States. She
already has as distinguished a body of work to her credit as any
Pritzker Prize winner. Not incidentally, she is also the most
important female architect since the beginning of time. Think about
it. Ms. Aulenti's current project, the San Francisco Museum of
Asian Art, is the most recent in a series of older buildings that
she has remodeled into art museums. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LIXENBERG-PHOTOGS (Los Angeles) _ The Danish photographer, Dana
Lixenberg, 34, first American exhibition opened at the Los Angeles
Center for Photographic Studies in Hollywood on May 15 and remains
on view through June 15. Her 40-by-30-inch Imperial Courts housing
project portraits, hanging alongside another series taken in 1998
of women living in a homeless shelter in Jeffersonville, Ind., look
disconcertingly formal. They are indicative of a new documentary
photography that is turning its back on the often graphic, verite
styles of the last two decades. By David Hay. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MARLO-THOMAS (Undated) _ ``That Girl,'' the ABC comedy from
1966 to 1971 ever so judiciously entertained the notion that an
unattached woman in her 20s might have the urge and the right to
lead a life of her own. As is apparent in nine episodes of the show
now on video from Anchor Bay, those were deep waters in 1966. ``If
women were single, they were `Our Miss Brooks,''' Ms. Marlo Thomas
said the other day, referring to the 1950s series in which Eve
Arden played a wisecracking high school English teacher (who rented
a room in an elderly woman's house, rather than really living on
her own). ``That Girl'' was Ms. Thomas's idea. ``I wanted to do a
show about a young woman who lived in her own apartment, trying to
make it, not divorced from her family, but who, like most young
girls at that time and today, still was related to her parents but
not programmed by them.'' By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).

   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEISTEGUI-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The contents of the Chateau de
Groussay, the circa-1815 house near Paris that Carlos de Beistegui,
a Spanish dandy, transformed into a temple to grande luxe
romanticism during the Nazi occupation, will be sold on site in a
three-day sale beginning on Friday. Sotheby's is conducting the
sale in partnership with a Paris auctioneer, Poulain et Le Fur. The
2,416 lots are an eclectic procession of splendors: a Victorian
side chair made of crystal (presale estimate, $3,200-$4,900); an
ebony and bronze Louis XVI desk once owned by the
pianist-politician Ignace Jan Paderewski ($243,000-$324,000); a
lurid raspberry-pink-and-turquoise-blue Savonnerie carpet made in
1953 for Beistegui's Venetian palazzo ($13,000-$19,500), even a
pair of copper frying pans bearing the arms of a noble Spanish
family ($650-$800). By Mitchell Owens. (Moved).

   JUDGE-DURHAM (Seattle) _ A serious illness has caused Washington
state Supreme Court Justice Barbara Durham to withdraw her
nomination to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, White House
and Justice Department sources said Thursday. Durham was recovering
from eye surgery Thursday and could not be reached for comment. It
was not certain whether her illness _ the nature of which has not
been publicly disclosed but is unrelated to the recent surgery _
would cause her to step down from the Supreme Court as well.

   JAZZ28 (Seattle) _ In a rehearsal studio near Seattle's Fremont
Bridge, 14-year-old Tyler Musgrave and Shorecrest freshman Tom
Miller are no longer just kids. Tyler is a drummer, a human
metronome whose left foot can be as relentless as a dripping
faucet. The boys and their surroundings are part of a music and art
program developed in Seattle by jazz pianist Bill Rossi. Rossi's
organization, Youth Advancement Through Music and Art, or YATMA,
recently was awarded a $25,000 grant from the William H. Gates
Foundation. The money will help to underwrite lessons for kids who
can't afford them at a time when many schools can't either.

   BOEING-ISRAEL (Seattle) _ Boeing has sweetened its offer to
Israel in hopes of winning a $2.5 billion fighter plane order,
which would keep alive future production of the company's
profitable F-15. John Boyle, vice president of international
business development for Boeing, personally presented the Israeli
defense minister with a proposal in which Boeing will guarantee an
additional $500 million in work for Israel companies. Boeing
already provides about $1.7 billion to Israeli companies in these
so-called offsets.

   FILM-HILL (Undated) _ It doesn't happen very often these days,

``Notting Hill,'' is one of those times. It's pure fluff, but as
irresistible as cotton candy.

   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-FLOOR (Undated) _ Hollywood's latest movie about a
computer-generated universe, ``The 13th Floor,'' is, in its own
way, no less imaginative than ``eXistenZ,'' or ``The Matrix,'' but
it definitely suffers from being the third cat out of the bag.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   FILM-SWINDLE (Undated) _ While not Claude Chabrol's best film,
``The Swindle'' represents no big letdown in quality. It's another
wickedly humorous psychological thriller that provides a showy part
for his favorite star, Isabelle Huppert. It's very much in the
tradition of his body of work, but also different enough to be
worth seeing. With tag-on review of ``This Is My Father.''
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)

<P>
   TV-INHERIT (Undated) _ With all the subtlety of an inflated ego,
Showtime presents a seminar on the suggested retail price of
individualism this weekend, pairing two worthy study aids: ``The
Passion of Ayn Rand'' and a remake of ``Inherit the Wind.'' Both
films are period pieces based in fact, with ``Ayn Rand'' coming out
slightly ahead on the satisfaction meter.

children in a fatherless family, off his mind. Peters tutored the
little boy for about four weeks during a recent internship as part
of his senior management training program to build management

   BOSTON -- Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Thursday announced it will
be exiting the Medicare market in western Massachusetts, leaving
over 3,500 seniors with the task of selecting another insurer by
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The health maintenance organization cited financial losses due
to inadequate reimbursement by the federal government to care for
seniors enrolled in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, which covers about 60,000 Medicare patients in
Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island, did not
rule out the possibility that it would pull out of the Medicare
business in other areas where it operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're currently evaluating our product and our network,'' said
Patti Embry-Tautenhan, spokeswoman for the Brookline-based HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the latest in a series by HMOs across the
country to scale back their Medicare businesses. This year, 100
HMOs cut back their Medicare business, with some pulling out of the
program entirely, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office,
a federal watchdog agency. On Jan. 1, Aetna U.S. Healthcare dropped
its Medicare program in six states, including Massachusetts. The
move left 17,000 Bay State seniors scrambling to find another
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 239,000 seniors in Massachusetts belong to Medicare
HMOs, according to the state Division of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs, including Harvard Pilgrim, blame low reimbursements for
their decisions to pull out and are lobbying for more generous
payments from the federal government. But a GAO study published in
April said low payments are just one of many reasons for the waning
interest among HMOs in the Medicare business. Inability to compete
with more established rivals and difficulty in knitting together a
network of hospitals and doctors also account for many withdrawals,
the GAO found.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim said one factor in its decision to withdraw from
Franklin, Hampden and Hampshire counties in the Pioneer Valley is
the low rate of reimbursement in those counties.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, through the Health Care Financing
Administration, pays HMOs in Franklin County, for instance, $426.56
a month on average for each senior. For Suffolk County, which
includes Boston, the rate is $663.04. In an effort to encourage
HMOs to move into less urban areas, HCFA has tried to boost
payments more in those locations. The rate for Franklin County will
increase 9.7 percent in 2000, while Suffolk County will see just a
2 percent hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very sorry to see them go,'' said Peter Toland,
associate regional administrator for Medicare at HCFA. ``They're
one of the best plans in the country and one of the original
Medicare HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard Pilgrim has been offering Medicare insurance since
1985, it has only been in western Massachusetts since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors in the Pioneer Valley enrolled with Harvard Pilgrim will
be notified of the cancellation of their HMO policy by letter in
the coming days. Seniors will either have to return to traditional
non-HMO Medicare or join another HMO. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Massachusetts and Fallon Community Health Plan offer Medicare HMOs
in all three counties, while Tufts Health Plan and Kaiser
Permanente operate in Hampden County.
</P>
<P>
   For seniors who return to traditional Medicare and wish to buy
so-called ``medigap'' insurance that will cover expenses not paid
for by Medicare, the Division of Insurance is considering allowing
an open enrollment period for residents of Pioneer Valley to
purchase such plans at the end of this year, according to Chris
Goetcheus, a division spokesman. Normally, seniors can only sign up
for medigap policies in the spring for coverage that begins June 1.

INFLATION WORRIES THROW DOW INTO DIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 235.23 points Thursday
as a selloff _ prompted by fears of rising inflation _ caused the
market's worst percentage decline in more than 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The index lost 2.2 percent of its value, falling to 10,466.93,
its fifth down day out of the past six.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was blamed on institutional investors and day
traders preparing for the Memorial Day holiday by selling stocks
they do not want to hold over the long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, analysts and portfolio managers said investors
should brace themselves. Thursday's drop may signal more declines
ahead as investors react to the increasing likelihood of an
interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board to ease
inflationary pressures building in the economy. Reflecting these
fears, the bond market also declined Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little pessimistic about the stock market right now,''
said Easton Ragsdale, director of quantitative research for State
Street Research &AMP; Management Co. ``We'll be up for the year but the
market has been expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which has experienced a spectacular rise this year, has
lost 420 points since last Thursday. Since its May 13 high of
11,107.1, the Dow has fallen 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's rise on Wednesday ``was the aberration,'' said Ned
Riley, chief investment officer for BankBoston Corp. ``Today was
just an acknowlegment that the higher interest rate environment is
starting to strike some fear in the hearts of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which has not risen as much as
the Dow, declined just 1.79 percent Thursday. While the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index dipped only 0.33 percent, analysts
predicted rough waters ahead for the high-flying sector.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Minervini, chief investment strategist for Quantech
Research Group in New York, said he is ``negative on the Nasdaq 100
kinds of stocks. We think we're in a short-term correction.'' The
Dow, he predicted, ``could undercut 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds rose
5 basis points to 5.85 percent, close to its highest level in a
year. But yields on two-year notes were hardest hit, rising to
their highest level in more than nine months, 5.42 percent. Bond
prices move in the opposite direction of yields.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates hammered financial company stocks. J.P.
Morgan led the pack, declining 3 3/4, to 135 1/8; Bank of America
Corp. fell 3 1/2, to 62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks had a mixed day. Internet stocks, which have been
pushed to heights professional investors have long said were
unsustainable, continued to be battered. Lycos lost 4, closing at
98 a share, and Amazon.com fell 6 3/8, closing at 111 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   But computer companies that have posted good earnings reports
were only nicked in the selloff. Dell Computer lost 1/6, closing at
34 1/2; Hewlett Packard dipped 7/8, closing at 92 5/8.

IF SHE RUNS, HILLARY CLINTON WILL SEEK N.Y. JEWISH VOTE TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for the U.S. Senate
from New York, she will be hoping for support from the Empire
State's sizable Jewish population to win.
</P>
<P>
   A key adviser, who asked not to be identified, said that while
the first lady has no specific aide working on the Jewish vote, she
has received advice from a several political figures and experts on
Jewish politics in the state.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 1.6 million _ 9.1 percent of the state's
total _ Jews are a key ingredient to victory in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But their vote, although traditionally Democratic, is not
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, Clinton, if she runs, will have to explain remarks
she made last year favoring creation of a Palestinian state, still
a sore point among many Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Her May 1998 statement that it is ``in the long-term interests
of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state'' came in the midst
of delicate peace negotiations and created a brief but intense
controversy. The White House politely disavowed her comments.
Israel has long opposed Palestinian statehood as a threat to
Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israeli elections earlier this month, incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost to challenger Ehud Barak, who has
vowed to jumpstart negotiations that might ultimately lead to
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The election signaled a turning point that may end up countering
the fallout of Clinton's Palestinian-statehood remark among Jewish
voters, Clinton supporters said. Several pointed to the decision
last week by the influential American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) _ a pro-Israel lobbying group _ to drop its
opposition to a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the atmospherics are changing,'' said David Singer,
research director for the American Jewish Committee (AJC), a New
York-based organization devoted to civil rights and religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to polls showing American Jews are not uniformly
hostile to a Palestinian state. An AJC survey this month of 1,000
Jews found 47 percent opposing such a state and 44 percent
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said,
``There'll be elements in the Jewish community that will make an
issue out of this'' but added that he didn't think the issue would
be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to have to make her case to Jewish voters on why
she should be senator from New York, but that's going to involve
bread-and-butter New York issues rather than foreign policy,'' the
adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said
he talked to Clinton about her Palestinian-statehood remark in
March. She explained that she had been inspired by a conversation
with the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who told her
that ``the only way to make peace is with an entity, and that if it
had no shape and no form, it is very difficult to enforce an
agreement,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But her commitment is the same as our government's,'' he
continued. ``She believes unequivocally that the parties should
make an agreement, and that our government should not impose
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Clinton is vulnerable among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community has a long memory,'' said Matthew Brooks,
executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. ``I think
Hillary Clinton will find that support in the Jewish community will
not be as easy as she thinks it is..MDRV/.MDNM/''
</P>
<P>
   For Jewish voters, he added, a race involving Clinton is just as
likely to turn on issues such as crime, education and saving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also pointed to the 1997 re-election victory of New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is seen as the leading Republican
contender for the Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by retiring
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, Giuliani, a non-Jew, won 70 percent of the Jewish
vote against Democratic challenger Ruth Messinger, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Democratic strategist, I'd be very concerned about
Giuliani's ability to leverage his strength by bringing those
constituencies into supporting Republican candidates,'' Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way it leans in any given election, the Jewish vote is
not monolithic. In New York City, with a million Jewish residents,
10 percent to 15 percent of the Jewish population is orthodox or
ultraorthodox, according to Singer. Though many of these Jews are
loyal Democrats, they also are politically conservative when
compared with more secular Jews, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, there is a solid Jewish Republican tradition in
New York. The late Republican lawmaker, Jacob Javits, who was
Jewish, served in the U.S. Senate from New York from 1957 to 1981.
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, another New York Republican Jew, has served
in the House since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls show Clinton doing well among Jews. In a survey last
week of 807 voters by the Hamden, Conn.-based Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute Clinton beat Giuliani 48 percent to 42 percent.
Among Jewish voters, who made up 8 percent of those questioned,
Clinton trounced Giuliani 60 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last month by the Poughkeepsie, N.Y-based Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion showed the two in a statistical dead
heat: 44 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Giuliani. But among
Jews, 12 percent of the 512 questioned, Clinton beat Giuliani 51
percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a poll of 748 voters two weeks ago by Zogby International of
Utica, N.Y. showed Giuliani beating Clinton among Jewish voters 50
percent to 36 percent. Among voters overall, Giuliani beat Clinton
49 percent to 44 percent, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are important in New York balloting because of their
reputation for heavy turnouts.
</P>
<P>
   According to data cited by Singer, 72 percent of eligible Jewish
voters went to the polls in New York's 1997 mayoral race. Overall,
only 38 percent of the city's eligible voters cast ballots.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino, Phil
Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM) 1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Castle'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caton.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny little sleeper from Australia. A cheerfully dimwitted
working-class bloke named Darryl (Michael Caton) takes on the
system when the neighboring airport decides to expand and tries to
force him and his family out of their home. It's a genial and
just-goofy-enough David-and-Goliath (Darryl-and-Goliath?) comedy
that aims to do little more than put a smile on your face. Which it
does. Handily. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' R (strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elodie Boucher
</P>
<P>
   and Natacha Regnier.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful character study of two young women trying to make
sense of life in a working-class town. The film is shot with a
documentarian style that registers every nuance. Subtitles. (SM) 1
hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a
</P>
<P>
   bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell themselves to
justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' PG-13 (violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery
</P>
<P>
   and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little
</P>
<P>
   chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at
</P>
<P>
   generating laughs out of a throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1
hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock
</P>
<P>
   and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet
</P>
<P>
   Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy Ritchie piles on the
characters, plot twists and violence, but one thing is clear:
Everyone involved had a fine time making this movie. (ERG) 1 hour,
45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Capshaw,
</P>
<P>
   Tom Everett Scott
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   Not lovable, but generally likable. An anonymous love letter
circulates among the residents of a small New England town setting
off rendezvous, revelations and romantic misunderstandings. The
film has two problems: It flirts with a serious case of the cutes
and Kate Capshaw, sexually appealing and adorably flustered, never
quite takes over her own star vehicle. Still, it has enough charm
to keep you interested. (ERG) 1 hour, 29 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please both comic book
fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with
stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns its
explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent
</P>
<P>
   bullets. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' PG-13 (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a mid-20s newspaper copy editor
and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they called her)
who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter, promptly
relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way to
popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The movie's
jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does make a go
of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) At metro theaters. 2
hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use,
</P>
<P>
   some thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Billy Bob
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, Cate Blanchett
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   A juiced-up ensemble comedy-drama that loses its bearings
halfway through its flight. John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton play
rival air traffic controllers who keep 747s from colliding every
few seconds in the super-crowded sky above New York. The talented
supporting cast includes Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') and
Angelina Jolie. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 3 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon
</P>
<P>
   and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad on a mission to find
a private (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have already been
killed in combat. Hanks'
</P>
<P>
   performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but
kudos all 'round here. (ERG) At area discount theaters. 2 hours, 50

   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological

<P>
   and Heath Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
References to the original verge on precious. But the film also has

</P>
<P>
   A ``what is reality?'' sci-fi thriller that doesn't measure up

It's about a modern-day computer wiz team that creates, then walks

   A burned-out teacher travels to Ireland to unravel the mystery

nearly twice her age. But everything conspires against the lovers _
from curses and small-town snobbery to the kind of timing that

</P>
<P>
   Winner of three awards at Sundance and further distinguished as
the first U.S. film shot in Vietnam since the war, this tenderly
appealing
</P>
<P>
   pastiche interweaves several obliquely connected stories while
catching a country in transition between a conflicted past and an

</P>
<P>
   Roger Nygard's documentary looks at the TV franchise's ardent
</P>
<P>
   followers with a tone that fuses affection and deadpan satire.
Most of the time, Nygard and game narrator/interviewer Denise
Crosby let the fans speak for themselves, often with
unintentionally hilarious results. If you ever wondered what your
dog or cat would look like in a Star Fleet uniform, this is your
movie. (SM) 1 hour, 28 minutes. B

   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)

   ``Trippin''' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Deon Richmond
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Adeosun Faison.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps trippin' up on its own mixed message. Deon Richmond
plays Greg, a high-school senior whose plans for college keep
getting waylaid by his fantasies of living the phat life,
surrounded by gorgeous women whose sole goal in life is to show him
their breasts. The movie has flashes of charm and heart, but
they're undermined by the filmmakers' pandering to the basic
instincts of its target teen audience. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``William Shakespeare's

<P>
   A Midsummer

<P>
   Night's Dream'' PG-13 (sensuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, magic doesn't happen. A sexy cast, a classic play,
the
</P>
<P>
   sensuous Tuscany countryside. How could ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' misfire? Blame it on director Michael Hoffman, whose
</P>
<P>
   picturesque but pedestrian approach dims the sparkle of William
Shakespeare's script. (SM) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nigel Hawthorne
</P>
<P>
   and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet proves an unexpectedly good match for Terence
Rattigan's 1946 play loosely based on a true story of an Edwardian
patriarch's risky and costly fight to clear his 13-year-old son's
name when the boy is expelled from a prestigious school for
stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care, thoughtfulness and even
a theatrical spark to the material. Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy
Northam lead an excellent cast. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Phil Kloer) 41 minutes. B-

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a world so fast-paced that few bankers keep
bankers' hours anymore, there remains something quaint about the
insulated world of stock traders.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange, which closes each day at 4 p.m.,
operates just 32.5 hours a week, barely an hour a day more than
when it began trading stocks continuously a century ago. Even the
more technology-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market, a 28-year-old market
that exists only in computer links between trading houses, has
hewed to a schedule laid out when a broker's most important tool
was a pencil, not a computer.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of resisting longer trading hours _ and after
several attempts to extend them failed because of lack of interest
_ the nation's major stock markets are now hurrying plans to trade
stocks for several additional hours in the evening. On the horizon,
many in the industry see around-the-clock trading.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the board that governs the Nasdaq market approved a
plan to add an evening session for trading of the 100 largest
Nasdaq stocks. Beginning perhaps as soon as September, evening
trading would last from 5:30 to 9 p.m. In response to Nasdaq's
emerging plan, the New York Stock Exchange has said it too might
add an evening session lasting until 10 p.m. this year; its board
will meet June 3 to discuss the possibility. Any extensions are
subject to approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   By extending their hours beyond the current sessions, which last
from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., the exchanges will cause untold changes
in the lives of thousands of traders, clerks and others who work in
and around Wall Street in lower Manhattan. But the change will also
touch, in ways yet to be seen, millions of people across the
country, from investors on the West Coast whose opportunities to
trade stocks now end shortly after midday, to small brokerage firms
that could be severely strained by a much longer business day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about it,'' said Robert Neff, president of
Carnes Capital, a brokerage firm in Naples, Fla., with 18
employees. ``If something occurs after hours, will I have to come
charging in from home and man the machines? Running a small shop
like ours, I don't have extra people to staff those hours. And
where do I get them?''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of adding an evening trading session already have
proved so cumbersome that Nasdaq pushed back its timetable to a
probable start in September from midsummer. And there remain dozens
of unresolved issues that must be answered before such a monumental
change takes place. Among them is whether to extend trading hours
five days a week or only Monday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike consumers who wander the aisles of an all-night grocery
store to avoid crowds, many investors who attempt to trade
securities when traffic is light will be giving up in profits what
they gain in convenience. Generally, more participants means better
prices for both buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies whose stocks are being traded after hours will face
demands for information from investors long after headquarters has
closed for the day. Trades made in the late session would be
considered to be next-day transactions, meaning that mutual funds,
which by law must report the value on their assets once per day,
might rely on 4 p.m. prices to do so. Newspapers and wire services
that provide stock prices to investors around the world would also
have to decide which closing prices to publish.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so many questions remain unanswered, even as the
exchanges move toward a late session, demonstrates how the
exchanges have lost control of their destiny. In fact, their hands
have been forced by a handful of upstart computerized trading
systems that are using cheap technology to provide a forum for
late-night trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask why the New York Stock Exchange still closes
at 4 o'clock, I say it's because the last bar car to Greenwich
leaves at 4:40,'' said Douglas M. Atkin, president and chief
executive of Instinet, an electronic trading system owned by
Reuters PLC that already offers late trading to mutual funds,
insurance companies and other institutions to trade among
themselves around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet itself is also exploring ways to allow small investors
to trade on its network. Eclipse Trading, a computerized service
started by two former lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, plans to start its own system allowing individual
investors to trade with each other beginning this summer; it has
already signed deals with Discover Brokerage, part of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, and Dreyfus Brokerage to provide after-hours
trading to their customers. Wit Capital, an Internet-based
brokerage and investment banking firm, has said it plans to offer
extended-hours trading this summer. And Island ECN, which has
applied to Federal regulators to become a full-fledged stock
exchange, aims to provide an around-the-clock computerized market.
</P>
<P>
   Many market participants think individual investors, who in the
past two years have turned stock investing into a sort of national
obsession, will be keen on the idea. ``Why shouldn't people be able
to trade when it's convenient for them?'' asked Harvey Houtkin,
chief executive of All-Tech Investment Group, a day-trading firm
based in Montvale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market has become a tremendous part of millions of
peoples' lives,'' Houtkin said. ``It's what people talk about at
cocktail parties. I'm pretty sure by the end of this year you'll
see pretty good volume in an evening session.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the battle over whether to extend trading
hours lines up the traditional Wall Street firms against the
electronic brokers. It also pits the big-ideas people against those
who make the markets run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who ultimately are voting on this are not the ones
sitting in the trenches,'' said Edward Collins, head of trading at
Daiwa Securities America. ``The clerks at the New York Stock
Exchange already get to work two hours before trading starts and
stay two hours after it's over, making sure the paperwork gets done
properly. I know how Wall Street works, and these firms are not
going to hire a whole lot of new staff for extra hours. So you're
going to get the fatigue and boredom factors, and all of the
problems that goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan L. Davidson, president of Zeus Securities, a small
brokerage firm in Jericho, N.Y., said extended hours could prove to
be a burden to thousands of small brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the brokerage firms in the country have fewer than 10
employees,'' said Davidson, who heads a trade group of independent
brokers and who serves as a board member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers. ``For us, it will mean a lot of
pressure on profits if we have to add staff to stay open late.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns weigh on Sam Chuopayev, manager of Wall Street
Shoe Repair, located in Chase Manhattan Plaza, a block from Wall
Street in lower Manhattan. ``I already am open from 6 to 6,''
Chuopayev said. ``How many more hours can I work? I don't think
more people will be coming to get their shoes done at nighttime.''
Even the subway entrance near his shop closes at 7:30 p.m., he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Larger brokerage firms, however, say extending their operations
into the evening would take little effort. ``I could probably take
one senior trader out of 120, plus a couple of assistants, and they
could handle the after-hours business,'' said Kenneth D. Pasternak,
chief executive of the Knight/Trimark Group, one of the largest
Nasdaq market makers. ``To use the factory for another shift costs
us very little.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the pressure on brokerage firms, it is clear that
investors are scouring for investment opportunities well after the
exchanges are closed for the day. At E-Trade, the online brokerage
firm, 20 percent of each day's orders are executed in the first
hour of trading, said Lisa Nash, vice president for customer
management. Many, if not most, of those orders are placed while the
markets are closed, she said, producing a big queue of orders
awaiting the opening of trading each morning.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for having their orders executed in the evening
when they are placed, rather than the next morning, investors may
give away the ability to participate in a far more liquid market.
That's because price swings can be exaggerated in light trading.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq and Big Board officials have begun to warn that stock
prices could move more erratically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors should not expect the same liquidity that is present
during the normal trading day,'' said Richard Ketchum, president of
the Nasdaq's parent regulatory group. And in a speech to a meeting
of financial executives in Vancouver Thursday, Richard Grasso,
chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, said that investors could
expect greater volatility during evening trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   While the new, smaller systems that aim to provide late-night
trading can do so on their own, the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq will need the approval of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, said Thursday that the
commission ``strongly supports investor choice in trading hours,''
but he cautioned that investors should be warned about after-hours
liquidity and volatility. He also voiced concern that the exchanges
and large securities firms are ready to deal with year 2000 issues
before turning their attention to longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Nasdaq and the Big Board have portrayed themselves
as not-especially eager to embrace late trading hours. Grasso has
told exchange members that a move to extend trading would be a
necessary competitive response, but one that the exchange would not
take on its own. And he advised members that an evening session was
unlikely to be profitable for members.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq officials, in pushing their anticipated start date back
to September from midsummer, have said that their extension of
trading hours primarily is a response to competitive threats.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their effort is designed to ward off foreign markets,
many of which have been building systems that will allow them to
trade any country's stocks around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies whose stocks will be traded late into the evening
appear to relish the idea. In part, that is because companies
prefer to make news announcements on earnings trends or
acquisitions and to schedule conference calls with financial
analysts and major investors during non-trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potential upheaval can be gleaned from what happened
to previous attempts to extend hours. In 1991, the New York Stock
Exchange attempted to move its opening time up by a half hour, to 9
a.m., but the proposal failed when it was vigorously opposed by
West Coast brokerage firms. In 1989, the exchange said it would
offer limited night trading, but those plans fell through. Efforts
to promote trading in European stocks in an early-bird session on
both the New York and Nasdaq markets has all but failed. And in
1981, regional stock exchanges actually shortened their hours,
citing lack of participation, moving their closings from 90 minutes
after the major exchanges to 4:30 p.m., where they remain.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of Nasdaq market makers, conducted this year by
Traders magazine, 70 percent of the firms said Nasdaq should not
extend its hours. Only 27 percent supported longer hours, with 3
percent registering no response. The results most likely reflect
the misgivings of small brokerage firms; many of the largest firms
did not answer the survey.
</P>
<P>
   So just who is in favor of longer trading hours? Clearly, the
movement is driven by individual investors, newly empowered by
computer technology and increasingly interested in buying stocks
whose prices only seem to go up. Frank Zarb, chairman of Nasdaq,
insists that individual investors, particularly those who trade
online, are banging down the door to be able to trade after hours.
``The fact is that online traders are not going to go away, and
there are going to be more of them a year from now than there are
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few individuals are not so sure. Krishan Datt, of
New Hyde Park, N.Y., who was visiting the Charles Schwab office at
the World Trade Center Thursday, said stock trading should be done
during the day. ``I'm afraid after hours trading would be giving
the wrong message to people,'' Datt said. ``That is time that
should be spent with your family.''

 &HT;    Campaign 2000 column: Gore opposes anti-gun suit bills in Texas
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore was not naming names when he
criticized efforts in some states to prevent cities from suing gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Dallas, speaking at a forum on school safety. Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, who happens to lead all other GOP presidential
prospects and Gore in the polls, is expected to sign a bill banning
those lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's time to take steps to prevent the kind of
lawsuits that many cities are filing to protect their citizens,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters interpreted the comments as an attempt by the vice
president to distinguish himself from Bush on an issue that has
new-found public support following school shootings in Colorado and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could have made the same point two days earlier in Georgia,
where he met with families of students who were wounded at Heritage
High School in Rockdale County and where Gov. Roy Barnes in
February signed into law a bill that bars Georgia cities from
filing such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gore's silence had something to do with the fact that
Barnes endorsed him for president this week.
</P>
<P>
   A Nudge from Newt
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who once considered running
for president in 2000, is injecting himself into the 2000
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Gingrich will send to senior Republican leaders, he
is suggesting that the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 are a better
model for sorting out candidates than the made-for-television
soundbites of today, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is proposing a series of encounters in which each
contender is allowed to present a 15-minute speech on a prearranged
topic, and then answers questions for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach would establish an adult rhythm of responsible
people describing important ideas in a serious way,'' Gingrich
wrote to Republican Chairman Jim Nicholson, all 50 state GOP chairs
and all Republican members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas held a series of three-hour
debates in Illinois in their campaign for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the modern age would not afford that kind of
opportunity to nine or 10 different candidates,'' Gingrich wrote.
``On the other hand, there is nothing which requires us to reduce
the presidency to an average soundbite of nine seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's bucks
</P>
<P>
   The money and the endorsements keep rolling in for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   His exploratory committee announced this week that Bush has been
endorsed by 114 House Republicans, a majority of the 222-member
Republican caucus. Just two of eight Georgians in the House, Reps.
Mac Collins and Charlie Norwood, are backing Bush. The others are
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Bush's campaign has raised more than $500,000 since
March. Most of that total comes from a fund-raising event last
weekend that was headlined by former President George Bush and his
wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' Iowa blitz
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes has named Ohio Secretary of
State Ken Blackwell chairman of his presidential campaign, making
Blackwell one of the highest-ranking campaign officials in either
party.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell called Forbes ``an advocate for the politics of
inclusion.'' Forbes campaigned for Blackwell last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Blackwell may be of particular help to Forbes in Ohio, the
candidate will be spending most of his time in Iowa, New Hampshire
and California, campaign manager Bill Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes may spend as many as 35 days in Iowa this summer,
including the two weeks leading up to the August 14 presidential
straw poll there, although Dal Col said his final schedule has not
been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant event in Iowa, but you don't want to
overemphasize it,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Republican party bills the straw poll as ``a test of
organizational strength'' for the presidential candidates. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, supporters of Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas packed
the event and held former Sen. Bob Dole, the leading Republican
candidate, to a draw. The straw poll may have been the high point
for Gramm's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not Your Father's GOP
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tent may be getting bigger than anyone ever
expected. Thinking about running for Congress next year as
Republicans are Jeff Baxter and Bob Backlund.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, whose nickname is Skunk, used to play guitar in two rock
bands, Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers. The former is named for
a sex toy, the latter for a marijuana cigarette. Baxter may run
against Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California.
</P>
<P>
   Backlund is a Connecticut Republican who is preparing for a run
against Democratic Rep. John Larson. But Backlund already has an
affiliation, WWF.
</P>
<P>
   That stands for the World Wrestling Federation. Like Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, Backlund is an ex-pro wrestler.

COMMENTARY: GIRL WITH A SKULLCAP

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Sometimes when I am nearing the end of a trip to a
nation that has a special meaning in my life, happy or dismal, I
make a list of the words, images and memories that will keep fresh
the people, and happenings, that shaped my attitudes and emotions
about that country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   India _ the oranges and reds of the clothes of peasant women of
Rajasthan, part of their inherited sense of art as daily life, and
then the memory of them rising predawn to line up to use a new
heritage they had never dreamed would be theirs _ the right to
vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Poland under Communism _ a nasty sense of absence, the sudden
disappearance of a Polish colleague in the New York Times Warsaw
bureau, snatched from his apartment by the secret police. I never
saw him again until told by a famous Polish editor who was also a
secret police colonel that he had not been beaten much, ``even
though he is a Jew.'' That, but also the Polish determination to
rebuild first Warsaw's lovely 17th-century Old Town, brick by
brick, to show that the Germans had not destroyed Polish history
with all their house-by-house bombing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had not made an Israeli list for myself until now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What surprised me was that words like peace talks or names of
politicians did not leap to mind in the first cut of memories. But
words like music, arts festival, university, road, sand, trees _ in
Jerusalem and in the desert _ and the hilarious scene of the little
girl leaping up at the King David Hotel to snatch her brother's
skullcap for her own pretty head, they all popped up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then came awareness of a sensation I diagnosed as optimism _ not
mine, but of the people who planted the trees, built the buildings
of everlasting stone and always-renewing talent at Bar-Ilan
University in Tel Aviv and Ben-Gurion University in the sands of
the Negev. All of them, and the little girl, had in common the
optimism necessary to live and plant trees or children here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so do all the Israelis, perhaps half of them or more, who
believe that this time they may get a peace that might become
permanent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not share that particular attack of optimism, but in
leave-taking gentleness, I hereby concede that they might be partly
right. I think that the Prime Minister-elect, Ehud Barak, will try
mightily to achieve peace with Palestinians, as did Benjamin
Netanyahu, whose inability to keep loyalty of friends and followers
drowned him in antipathy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barak is now going through the excruciatingly delicate
complexities of trying to make a national unity government grow
from the losses of his Labor Party. He won, his party slipped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He negotiates with defeated Likud, now being steered by Ariel
Sharon, one of the more admired people in Israel, and the
burgeoning Shas religious party, which questions whether the laws
of democracy can or should be superior to the law of the Torah. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Likud is asking Barak questions before saying yes or no _ will
he really return to Syria the Golan Heights from which Syrians
shelled Jewish villages in the Galilee for decades, what borders
will he demand with the Palestinians for security's sake, what will
happen to the Jewish ``settlements'' on the West Bank, most of them
now established Jewish communities ranging from rugged to
Scarsdale. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think that a temporary peace can be patched together with an
independent Palestine if it is willing to make concessions of
military and immigration sovereignty, and if the Clinton
administration, loaded and panting with longtime Labor supporters,
does not push Barak too hard and too fast, and out of public
trust. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But permanent, no; Palestine will be one more Arab dictatorship,
led by a Yasser Arafat who openly wants to make the supposed final
settlement simply part of the 1974 Arab plan to slice Israel down
to an unprotectable country with its thin back to the ocean.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole clutch of Arab tyrannies can hardly be trusted to let
the Jewish, and only, democracy in the Mideast live in a permanent
peace that will be a constant reminder to Arabs of the political
freedom reaching so much of the world. Permanent peace depends on
its reaching the Muslim Mideast too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, a taste of optimism is not surrender or passivity _ as
the little girl showed racing about the hotel lobby, hand firmly
clutched on the skullcap on her head.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KYOTO, Japan _ As Japanese heroes go, he is an unusual one. He
never wore a tie, never got a job, and after seducing his
stepmother when he was a teen-ager he had a string of affairs with
women who included his own adopted daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But Prince Genji is a central figure in Japanese culture, and he
never had a wit of trouble with the law _ perhaps in part because
he never existed. He was the title character in ``Tale of Genji,''
the nearly 1,000-year-old love story that is sometimes described as
the world's first novel and is usually considered Japan's greatest
literary achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Prince Genji is an unusual cultural icon, his latest
chronicler is if anything even more startling. Jakucho Setouchi, a
77-year-old Buddhist nun with shaven head and twinkling eyes, has
translated ``Tale of Genji'' into modern Japanese and turned it
into a huge best seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man and a woman are in love, the situation hasn't
changed in the last thousand years,'' Ms. Setouchi said cheerfully,
explaining the tale's popularity as she sat on the tatami floor of
the temple she heads here in Kyoto, the ancient Japanese capital.
``There's jealousy. There's agony. Even a modern career woman can
feel those same pains of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, yes, `Tale of Genji' is relevant to today's people. And
after all, it teaches the basics of love. And that's very useful,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Setouchi is helping Japan address one of the fundamental
tensions in any society: how to move into the future without
entirely losing a grip on the past. The challenge is particularly
great in Japan because Japanese has changed far more than most
languages.
</P>
<P>
   While English-speakers can still enjoy the 14th-century
``Canterbury Tales,'' most Japanese cannot understand works written
100 years ago. Young people often have difficulty reading anything
written more than 50 years ago, making their past largely
inaccessible to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tale of Genji'' has been translated into modern Japanese
before, by some of the nation's greatest writers, but the other
translations have tended to be in formal Japanese that today's
young people find largely indigestible or even unintelligible. So
Ms. Setouchi, who was already a famous author and renowned for her
racy novels, decided to tackle ``Genji.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a mammoth task, in part because the novel is so long _ Ms.
Setouchi's translation is 10 volumes _ and in part because the
original language is so abstruse. In the original, many sentences
have no subjects, go on forever and use many layers of archaic and
deeply nuanced politeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put lots of subjects in my sentences, so people can figure
out who is doing what, and I also broke up some long sentences,''
Ms. Setouchi said of her translation. ``My goal was to make a very
readable book, one that could be enjoyed by both elementary-school
children and by people in their 90s.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Altogether, almost 2.1 million volumes have been
sold, including 340,000 of Volume 1 and lesser numbers of the later
volumes. A ``Genji'' play has come out, and Ms. Setouchi is a
television star on the national lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   She also gives regular talks at her temple about life and
prayer, and huge throngs now turn up at them. The next step was
video collections of her lectures, and Ms. Setouchi is also
churning out various other novels and translations. Her temple _
for all its idyllic gardens and lovely antiques _ seems to have
compromised its serenity with all the fans coming to see Japan's
most famous nun.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Beichman, an American who is a professor of Japanese
literature at Daito Bunka University in Tokyo, says sales of the
latest ``Tale of Genji'' translation reflect both the greatness of
the original story and the reputation of Ms. Setouchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything she writes would be a best seller,'' she said. ``She
manages to make anything interesting, and people are also very
interested in what she does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Tale of Genji'' was written at the beginning of the 11th
century by a brilliant young widow, Shikibu Murasaki, who was
governess to the empress and had attracted the (apparently
unwanted) attentions of the empress's father. ``Tale of Genji'' was
read aloud to the emperor, and its mix of plot and heartache and
psychology _ a bit like Jane Austen _ have made it a hit ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned British translator Arthur Waley, whose ``Tale of
Genji'' is one of several translations into English, described the
original in 1925 as ``the greatest novel in the East'' and ``one of
the dozen greatest masterpieces of the world.'' In Japan, it seems
to be particularly popular among women, particularly those in
middle age or older.
</P>
<P>
   ```Tale of Genji' is filled with psychological themes,'' said
Hideyo Ueda, the director of the Japan Classic Literature Research
Institute in Tokyo. ``It subtly describes the political stage in a
different way, from the women's side.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Setouchi sees in the novel a strong feminist voice,
protesting the conditions of women at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Murasaki was a very highly educated woman, widely read,
and she knew that if she were a man she could have accomplished
much more,'' Ms. Setouchi said. ``So she wanted to express
dissatisfaction about the status of women in her day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Setouchi argues, in contrast to many other critics, that the
key figures in ``Tale of Genji'' are the women whom the prince uses
and discards. She sees the prince himself as merely a literary
device to carry the plot along and develop the more interesting
characters of the women in court.
</P>
<P>
   While Genji's liaisons are normally described as seductions, Ms.
Setouchi scoffs at that. ``It was all rape, not seduction,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   These days Japan is still ``a man's society,'' Ms. Setouchi
says, but she argues that Japanese women have made so much progress
since World War II that they are now quite free. ``Maybe too
free,'' she grunted. These days, Japanese sexual mores are becoming
more relaxed, she said, and despite some wavering she ultimately
thinks that is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are very free now to have girlfriends, and women to have
boyfriends, and it's getting back to the way it was in Genji's
time,'' Ms. Setouchi said. She paused, and a wicked smile spread
across her face, making her look more like a rebellious high-school
student than a 77-year-old chief nun with a shaven head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good to be free,'' she said, giggling, ``and to
have sex with anyone.''

 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first global three-dimensional map of Mars,
made with data from an orbiting American spacecraft, reveals a
surface of extreme highs and lows sculptured by still mysterious
processes, scientists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The high-resolution map shows a sweeping panorama of highlands
and basins that include some of the solar system's most extreme
features, including the tallest volcano and one of the largest
impact craters.
</P>
<P>
   Mars is slightly pear-shaped, with a bulging, mountainous
southern hemisphere that is, on average, three miles higher than
its northern counterpart, scientists said. And a long-known
depression in the south, the Hellas basin, is actually the remnant
of a giant asteroid impact, perhaps the deepest found on any
planet, they added.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Smith of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, lead
author of a paper detailing the results in the journal Science,
said new measurements reveal that the Hellas crater _ six miles
deep and 1,500 miles across _ was gouged out by an ancient impact
early in Mars' four-billion-year-old history.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had been hit by an identical body, Smith
told a NASA news conference Thursday, the crater would stretch from
the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains. And rock and debris blasted
from the crater would be enough to cover the United States in a
blanket up to two miles thick, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new map was generated with readings from an instrument
aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which reached Mars in 1997 and
began its science mission a year ago. The instrument, the Mars
Orbiter Laser Altimeter, fires infrared laser light pulses at the
surface and determines land elevations by measuring the round-trip
time of the light.
</P>
<P>
   Using 27 million measurements gathered in March and April of
this year and last summer, scientists constructed the revealing
map.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pilcher, NASA's science director for solar system
exploration, said, ``This data will serve as a basic reference book
for Mars scientists for many years and should inspire a variety of
new insights about the planet's geologic history.''
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft continues to collect about 900,000 elevations
measurements a day and that data will be used to compile an
increasingly detailed map over the next two years, equal to one
Martian year.
</P>
<P>
   An evolving map will be used to study Mars' evolution and the
ancient processes that shaped its surface, scientists said, and
also to help select landing sites for future spacecraft missions.
Researchers already are using this information to assess an area
near the south pole where NASA's Mars Polar Lander mission is
scheduled to set down on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Maria T. Zuber, a professor of planetary sciences at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and researcher on the
project, said the dramatic slope from the south to north pole is a
major finding relating to past water flow on the red planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all downhill from the south pole to the north pole,'' Dr.
Zuber said at the briefing, and knowing Martian elevations helps
track the paths of ancient water flows. In the northern hemisphere,
there is a huge basin that slopes down to about six miles below the
average elevation of Mars, she said, and this feature ``is
consistent with the formation of a past ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, it remains to be proved if Mars ever had
enough water to fill such a basin. While the area is smooth and
featureless, as if once occupied by a sea, she said scientists have
yet to detect any ``beach features'' indicating the edges of an
ocean around the basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The north basin is the smoothest surface known in the solar
system,'' Dr. Zuber said, but it could have been formed by volcanic
upswellings instead of the presence of water.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zuber said the Tharsis region, a bulging plateau topped by
volcanoes that straddles the equator, appears to be composed of two
raised volcanic domes instead of one. The new map also shows that
Olympus Mons, which rises nearly 17 miles high to form the biggest
volcano in the solar system, is a separate feature that is not part
of the nearby Tharsis rise, as scientists had believed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new map also shows that Mars' south pole is structured very
much like the northern one, even though they look different from a
distance. Dr. Zuber said this indicates there is more water ice
than previously believed at the south pole, which also has a
concentration of carbon dioxide ice. The combined deposits of water
at the two poles could equal about 1.5 times the water frozen in
the glaciers of Greenland, she estimated.

<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The International Criminal Tribunal
issued an arrest warrant here Thursday for Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, charging him and other senior officials with
crimes against humanity in Kosovo, including the murder, forced
deportation and persecution of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the indictment of Milosevic and four of his top
associates, Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor, said arrest
warrants for the five had been served on all member states of the
United Nations and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is now a much smaller place for these men,'' Ms.
Arbour said. ``We require these states, including Yugoslavia, to
arrest the accused if they are within their jurisdiction and
deliver them to The Hague for trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The others accused in the 42-page indictment are Milan
Milutinovic, the Serbian president, long a close aide to Milosevic;
Dragoljub Ojdanic, the chief of staff of the Yugoslav armed forces
and former commander of an army corps active in eastern Bosnia;
Nikola Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, and
Vlajko Stojilkovic, the minister of internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the charges branded the Yugoslav government as a
criminal regime _ an extraordinary development. But the arrest of
Milosevic, whose tenacity in holding onto power is by now
notorious, appeared highly unlikely in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the indictment clearly changed the terms of the hectic
international quest for a peace settlement to end the two-month-old
NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of crimes including the forced deportation of
740,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo this year and the murder of
more than 340 identified Albanians instantly turned Milosevic into
little short of an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   They made it almost impossible for him to travel abroad,
rendered his signature on any international document deeply
suspect, and made negotiation with him awkward _ but not illegal _
for any state respecting the United Nations charter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these diplomatic difficulties, President Clinton
formally backed the indictment. ``I welcome the decision of the
international war crimes tribunal to indict Slobodan Milosevic and
four other senior Serbian leaders of crimes against humanity and
war crimes,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, tribunal officials said the United
States had expressed serious concerns about timing when informed a
few days ago that the indictment was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objections to our timing were quite strong, and it took a
while for everyone to understand,'' one tribunal official said.
``We had to patiently explain to Washington and some other capitals
that there was no alternative to our procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, is deeply
involved in Russian-led diplomatic efforts to end the war. The
failure of these efforts would inevitably lead to greater pressure
for a ground invasion of Kosovo by NATO forces, a step that Clinton
opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy to the Balkans, is to travel
to Belgrade on Friday for a meeting with Milosevic, and he plainly
doubted the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement saying the
indictment was ``politically motivated,'' and Russian officials
said talking to the Yugoslav president remained essential.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour, however, suggested Chernomyrdin might be talking to
the wrong man. ``Although the accused are entitled to the benefit
of the presumption of innocence until they are convicted, the
evidence upon which this indictment was confirmed raises serious
questions about their suitability to be the guarantors of any deal,
let alone a peace agreement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the 52-year-old Canadian judge, who was appointed to the
tribunal in 1996, added that she did not expect politicians to tell
her how to do her work, and she said, ``I have no intention of
telling them how to do their work.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration made clear that contacts with
Milosevic would continue for the moment. Still, it is evident that
the Western view of the Serbian leader has changed radically. Long
seen as an unsavory strongman who could also be a de facto ally, as
he was in the negotiation of a Bosnian peace, Milosevic now appears
to be viewed as the central obstacle to Balkan peace.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said this change in the Western attitudes opened
the way for what amounted to a remarkably fast indictment by
allowing Ms. Arbour access to intelligence and other information
long denied to her by Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant that the court was able to overcome political
resistance in Western capitals to what amounted to an indictment of
devastating diplomatic timing, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour signed the indictment on Saturday, and it was
confirmed as valid by a tribunal judge on Monday. Western
governments were informed of the court's action between these
dates, but wider disclosure was delayed to allow a United Nations
mission to Yugoslavia to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree that this is a bad time,'' Ms. Arbour said
Thursday. ``Some will say that this indictment came too late.
Others will say that it came too soon. I say it came perfectly
appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the indictment, the British foreign secretary,
Robin Cook, said Thursday, ``There can be no deal, no amnesty for
war crimes.'' He added that there would be no negotiation on NATO's
objectives, even if ``we have to deal with those who can implement
those objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's central aims include the removal of all Serbian forces
from Kosovo, the return of all Albanians refugees, and approval
from Milosevic for the deployment of an international peacekeeping
force that would have NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's action clearly complicates the attainment of
these objectives. At a minimum, Milosevic's incentive to bring a
quick end to the war no longer seems clear, for peace would bring
him no protection from arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government reacted with
predictable fury to the indictment, describing it as ``another
attempt to mislead the world community in order to conceal who is
really responsible for the genocide against the Yugoslav people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Yugoslavia began to unravel in the late 1980s,
``genocide'' has been one of the most often used words in the
Serbian political vocabulary. It has been applied to the
difficulties of some Serbs in Kosovo in the 1980s, to the effects
of the Western trade embargo on Serbia in the early 1990s, to
Croatian attacks on Serbs between 1991 and 1995, and, most
recently, to NATO's bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's aim in using this language has clearly been to
reinforce the Serbs' predominant image of themselves as victims,
and blind them to the repeated acts of Serbian violence against
civilians during the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment drew a tough portrait of the Yugoslav
leader's acts, seeking to demonstrate Milosevic's personal criminal
responsibility for ordering, planning, instigating, executing or
aiding and abetting crimes committed in Kosovo this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour said that the role of Milosevic in Bosnia, where more
than 750,000 Muslims were driven from their homes by the Serbs in
1992, was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Milosevic of the persecution of Albanians
on racial, religious and political grounds and traces, in some
detail, what it describes as the mass execution of hundreds of
Albanians in several towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Before reviewing these killings, the indictment describes the
range of Milosevic's powers, in an evident attempt to establish his
responsibility for what has happened in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that, beginning on or about January 1, 1999,
and continuing until today, the forces of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and Serbia, ``acting at the direction, with the
encouragement, or with the support of Slobodan Milosevic'', have
committed acts resulting ``in the forced deportation of
approximately 740,000 Kosovo Albanian civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to describe Serbian acts of shelling, intimidation,
random shooting, systematic humiliation and destruction in towns
including Kosovska Mitrovica, Djakovica, Orahovac, Pec, Pristina
and Prizren that, it says, resulted in the departure or death of
large numbers of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some communities, the indictment describes how large numbers
of named Albanians were executed by Serbian police. For example, it
relates how 105 named Kosovo Albanian men and boys from the
villages of Velika Krusa and Mala Krusa were assembled in a house
and killed on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the men and boys were assembled inside the house, the
Serb police opened fire on the group,'' it says. ``After several
minutes of gunfire, the police piled hay on the men and boys and
set fire to it in order to burn the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said such charges were based on testimony
gathered from ethnic Albanians who have now fled to Macedonia or
Albania, and on intelligence reports from western governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received, and we are continuing to receive valuable
information from governments, as well as from groups and
individuals,'' Ms. Arbour said. ``We are still awaiting further
evidence that I believe many states will be able to contribute to
our larger investigation. I repeat my pressing call to them to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected accusations that his forces have driven
large numbers of Albanians from their homes, saying that their
flight was prompted by the NATO bombing. He has not responded to
specific accusations of Serbian-perpetrated massacres in Kosovo,
focusing instead on the eviction of over 150,000 Serbs from Croatia
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the warrants for the arrest of the five accused, the
Tribunal also ordered United Nations member states to freeze the
assets of the men in order to limit their ability to escape and
allow possible restitution to victims in the event of conviction,
but the order is not legally binding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour said she did not find it ``impossible to imagine''
that Milosevic would eventually give himself up to the court,
where, she said, he would be guaranteed a ``fair and transparent''
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbian leader has long made his contempt for the
international court clear, and such a surrender appeared possible
only in circumstances of complete desperation. Milosevic still
appears to have some options, including looking to Russia for
eventual protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you if Mr. Milosevic is willing to come here and
be tried,'' Ms. Arbour said. ``I say he has to. That is the rule of
law. The Yugoslav minister of justice should stand up for the rule
of law and provide for his arrest and transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Such words might appear naive or even absurd, especially in the
light of the fact that NATO forces have proved unwilling to arrest
the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders _ Radovan Karadzic
and Gen. Ratko Mladic _ who were indicted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian judge, like other tribunal officials, was
resolute and quietly confident. The tribunal, created in 1993 in
what looked like an attempt to salvage Western political
consciences after the failure to stop the Serbian rampage against
Muslims in Bosnia in 1992, long seemed peripheral and weak.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's indictment, the first time the court has moved
against a head of state, appeared to signal its definitive
emergence as an important, and perhaps highly disruptive, element
in the Balkan equation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the charges marked a culmination of its efforts in
that Milosevic has been central to four consecutive Balkan wars _
in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and now Kosovo _ over the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour said that she had chosen not to reveal much of the
evidence in the indictment, and would only do so when the accused
were under arrest in The Hague. ``That,'' she said with a smile,
``is the prudent course.''

MORE THAN 42,000 TEXAS INMATES INFECTED WITH HEPATITIS C, STUDY
INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE SNYDER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Preliminary results of a study of hepatitis C in Texas
prisons show that 28.6 percent of the prison population _ more than
42,000 inmates _ are infected with the potentially lethal liver
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Smith, chairman of the state's Correctional Managed
Health Care Advisory Committee, which oversees prison health care,
said the final figure ``may creep up a bit'' after further analysis
of data obtained from a sampling of about 2,600 incoming prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is lower than many observers expected. A 1994 study
of California prison inmates found that 41 percent were infected
with hepatitis C, and a more recent study in Maryland prisons found
an infection rate of about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results provide the first documentation of the scope
of an epidemic that is forcing prison policy-makers to confront
difficult medical management questions and potentially enormous
costs.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts who met with prison health officials in
Austin in December advised them that a ``minimal'' program for
treatment of Texas prisoners for hepatitis C would cost $65
million, said Allen Hightower, executive director of Correctional
Managed Health Care, the prison system's health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In its current session, he said, the Texas Legislature has
appropriated $12 million for vaccinating inmates against hepatitis
B, a disease that can cause illness in patients with hepatitis C to
be more severe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, about $40 million in new funding is
available for a variety of inmate health care services. How to
apportion those funds among programs for hepatitis C and other
purposes, Hightower said, will be ``a medical decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The most effective treatment for hepatitis C, a combination of
the drugs interferon and ribavirin, costs about $10,000 for a
course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the prison system has provided treatment only with
interferon, which is less effective than combination therapy but
also significantly less costly. To date, about 95 prisoners have
been treated, said Dr. Michael Kelley, director of preventive
medicine for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is president of the Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center and a former Texas health commissioner, said a new
policy for management of hepatitis C in the prison system will be
presented June 17 to the health-care advisory committee that he
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the new policy will be ``more aggressive in every
area, including education as well as evaluation and treatment.''
Among other changes, he said, the policy calls for moving toward
the use of combination treatments for prisoners rather than
interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that the relatively poor results even of
combination therapy must be considered in deciding which prisoners
to treat. The combination therapy has yielded long-term benefits
only in about 40 percent of patients in clinical studies.
</P>
<P>
   And because of side effects that can be severe, Smith said,
``the dropout rate is rather high within the first two months of
treatment. In some cases, we've already experienced patients that
find the treatment worse than the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Common side effects include fatigue and flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The study, begun last November, involved drawing blood samples
from incoming inmates at selected prison units, including units
populated exclusively by drug offenders. Injection drug use is the
most common means of transmitting the hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
   Among the so-called ``drug abuse units,'' where all inmates
participate in intensive drug treatment programs, the prevalence
rate was about 34 percent, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gullahorn, a founder of the Central Texas Hep C Connection,
an Austin-based patient advocacy group, said he found it
``encouraging'' that the rate of infection in prisons appears to be
somewhat lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's pretty sobering when you think about what it means''
in terms of the prison system's responsibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gullahorn said he is confident that the prison system and its
health care providers will develop an effective program to deal
with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Young, who chairs the health-care committee of the prison
system's governing board, said the study results will provide a
solid basis for policy decisions. She acknowledged, however, that
these decisions will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funding is always a problem,'' Young said, ``particularly in
light of the fact that we are juggling a lot of things. As
important as this (hepatitis C) is, we have to focus on a lot of
other issues. All of this is incredibly expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emil Miskovsky, a liver specialist at the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and a principal investigator in
the study, said the results provide a valuable planning tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It documents the frequency and allows people to make concrete
plans for this prevalence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now can go full steam ahead with educational programs for
the inmates, talk to care providers about the substantial frequency
(of hepatitis C) and what kind of effect it has on the health of
the inmates that they care for.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prison inmates with hepatitis C interviewed recently
said the infection appears to be rampant in the units where they
are confined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone I associate with in here has it,'' said James
Whittington, an inmate at the Ramsey 1 unit in Rosharon in Brazoria
County. ``I don't know hardly anyone that doesn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittington, who has served eight years of a 22-year sentence
for aggravated robbery, said he learned of his disease in 1992. He
assumes his infection came from his use of injection drugs for more
than 20 years.

STOCKS TUMBLE A FIFTH TIME IN SIX DAYS AS THE DOW DROPS 235.23 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices resumed their losing ways Thursday as
rising long-term interest rates prompted many investors to cash in
profits on the approach of a long holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth decline in the last six sessions and except for
the Nasdaq market, where losses were relatively modest, the drop
more than wiped out the lone recent advance on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, the hardest-hit gauge, tumbled
235.23 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,466.93, its biggest skid of
the year in terms of points and the third time this week that its
loss surpassed 100 points. Over the latest six sessions, the
blue-chip index has lost 420 points, or 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks seem to be the tail tied to the interest-rate kite,''
said Timothy E. O'Grady, senior portfolio manager at the First
Capital Group in Philadelphia. Yields jumped by nearly 0.1 percent
on two-year notes.
</P>
<P>
   Two government reports, as well as desultory bidding at the
Treasury's note auction on Wednesday, may have contributed to the
further unease over rates and caused investors to focus again on
the Federal Reserve's stated inclination to increase rates if the
economy shows no signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   One report disclosed revised figures on first-quarter economic
output showing that personal consumption grew at a 6.8 percent
annual pace, even faster than first estimated. The other,
suggesting a continued taut labor market, recorded no rise last
week in first-time claims for jobless benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rising long-term bond yields create valuation issues,'' said
Richard B. Hoey, director of equity research at the Dreyfus Corp.,
referring to the appeal of stocks relative to fixed-income
securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's decline was not much greater than that of the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which fell 23.35 points, or 1.8 percent,
to 1,281.41. The latter, however, had 85 rising components, paced
by Intel, while only Johnson &AMP; Johnson among the Dow's 30 stocks
managed an advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which is laden with high-technology
stocks, fell 8.03 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to
2,419.15.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were at a loss to explain why most of the technology
sector resisted the decline other than it has already been badly
battered, especially Internet issues. The index is down 8.8 percent
from its record on April 26 and was down 10.2 percent on Tuesday,
enough to technically qualify as a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have raised a lot of cash,'' said Matthew W. Johnson,

   ``The market is again concerned about the Fed tightening,'' said
John Kattar, director of U.S. equities at Boston Company Asset

<P>
   Some drug stocks bucked the downtrend, with Pfizer gaining 2~,

</P>
<P>
   IBM, which soared on Wednesday, fell 2[, to 116, after a 2-for-1

INDIA-PAKISTAN DISPUTE INTENSIFIES AS 2 JETS GO DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Two Indian fighter jets were lost in combat
Thursday on the Pakistani side of the cease-fire line in troubled
Kashmir, worsening the confrontation between the subcontinent's two
nuclear-armed rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan said it had shot down the two Indian jets when they
ventured ``well inside our territory,'' said an army spokesman,
Rashid Quereshi. ``We had already given India a warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials, however, said that one of the planes, a
Russian-built MiG-21, crashed because of a mechanical failure. As
the jet went down, its pilot bailed out, and a second aircraft, a
MiG-27, responded to a distress signal. That plane was then
destroyed by a Pakistani surface-to-air missile, said Air Vice
Marshal S.K. Malik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this a provocative act,'' the vice marshal said at
a press briefing. ``The other side has escalated the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan said the body of the dead pilot would be returned to
India and the surviving pilot would be held as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   Both aircraft had been taking part in a second day of Indian
rocket attacks against Islamic guerrillas who have seized
mountaintop positions a few miles inside Indian territory. These
Himalayan perches overlook supply routes that extend from the
Kashmir Valley to an important Indian military base in Ladakh.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's information minister, Mushahid Hussain, called on the
United Nations to send a special envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, Kashmir has been split in two, with the
Pakistanis controlling about a third of it and India the rest. The
territory has been contested ever since the two nations won their
independence from Britain in 1947. India has fought wars with
Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971. The first two conflicts were
caused by disagreements over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Militant separatists challenge India's control. India routinely
insists that Pakistan, which is predominantly Muslim, finances and
arms these guerrillas, a charge that Pakistan invariably denies.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the lost warplanes began a long day of emotional
comments from both sides, with leaders sometimes speaking of acts
of war and nuclear flash points, at other times urging political
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   India's Cabinet met in emergency session to discuss a response
to the loss of the warplanes. In Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif delivered a message marking the eve of the one-year
anniversary of Pakistan's test of a nuclear bomb _ the powerful
reply to a similar test by India two weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistanis ``are confident for the first time in their history
that in the eventuality of an armed attack they will be able to
meet it on equal terms,'' Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department appealed to both countries
for restraint to prevent the conflict from widening.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts predicted that India and Pakistan would indeed
back away from further escalation, though all couched their
optimism with the possibility that bad blood could overwhelm good
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous, but I tend to think it will simmer down,''
said Dennis Kux, a South Asia specialist at the Middle East
Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There are many unanswered questions about the 500 to 600
militants who have established well-fortified positions in northern
Kashmir's snow-capped, oxygen-thin peaks. These guerrillas are
equipped with snowmobiles and heavy artillery, the Indians say, and
they are being resupplied by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   To India, the guerrillas' ability to sustain themselves in some
of the world's least hospitable terrain proves the coordinating
hand of the Pakistani armed forces. In fact, the Indians charge
that Pakistani soldiers are fighting alongside guerrillas
predominantly from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   On this score, many Western experts agree with the Indians. It
seems likely, they say, that the militants are sponsored by
Pakistan, or perhaps even by one of Pakistan's intelligence
agencies operating without government sanction or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Selig Harrison, a South Asia expert with the 20th Century Fund,
said that while the Islamic militants have not been successful in
Pakistan's elections, they have come to wield influence in the
intelligence agencies. And one of those agencies, he said, could
now be involved in supporting the large guerrilla presence in the
remote mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Pakistani forces are all under unified
control,'' he said. ``This may have been done without the knowledge
of Nawaz Sharif.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the makeup of the guerrilla force, the Indian military
has come under severe criticism for not discovering the extent of
the separatist guerrillas' incursion in Kashmir until early this
month. By then, the militants had secured the high ground, and
dislodging them was too much for ground forces alone. Air power,
never before employed in Kashmir, seemed necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Indians thought they had battered the hell out of the
insurgents and could relax a bit,'' said Sumit Ganguly, an expert
on Kashmir at Hunter College in New York. ``They were complacent
and got caught entirely off guard by all these people settling into
the heights.''
</P>
<P>
   This presents a distressing political problem for the Bharatiya
Janata Party, the party of India's current caretaker government.
BJP leaders have built much of the party's reputation as defense
hawks. Its leadership championed the nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with general elections but months away, the BJP leaders are
being chastised as military bumblers by their political opponents.
Some analysts wonder if the party might be tempted to recover its
reputation through war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a fundamental assault on their credibility,''
said George Perkovich, director of the Secure World Program at the
W. Alton Jones Foundation in Charlottesville, Va. ``The BJP can't
afford to lose in this confrontation _ or to appear Gandhian. I
don't see how they can even afford to take the high ground and
negotiate. They're under intense pressure to use their military
power.''

FAMILY OF ONE COLUMBINE VICTIM FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST PARENTS OF
GUNMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MINDY SINK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The family of one of the 12 students killed in the
Columbine High School shootings in nearby Littleton last month
filed a $250 million lawsuit here Thursday against the parents of
the two young gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Vonda Shoels, the parents of Isaiah Shoels, an
18-year-old senior who was killed in the shootings on April 20,
announced the lawsuit at a news conference here. They said they
were suing to hold the parents accountable for their children's
actions and to help make sure other parents were more responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money, it's about change,'' Shoels said.
``No money, no nothing, can ever bring my son back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although witnesses said Isaiah was sought out by the gunmen,
both of them Columbine students, because he was African-American,
and Shoels said his family had been harassed before the shootings,
racial intimidation was not cited in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Shoelses and their daughter have since moved to Denver from
Littleton to live, they said, in a more ethnically diverse area.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in District Court, accuses the parents of the
gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, of being ``negligent in the
duties and responsibilities of parental supervision'' and contends
that ``by omission and inaction,'' they ``facilitated the actions''
of their sons.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations include letting their sons build bombs in their
homes and accumulate a cache of weapons; letting their sons
associate with each other, even though they had previously been
charged as juveniles in the break-in of a van, and letting them
``author hateful extremist writings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's parents, Susan and Thomas Klebold, have already met with
the authorities, but Eric's parents, Wayne and Kathy Harris, have
refused unless they are granted immunity. Lawyers for the Harrises
did not return phone calls Thursday, and lawyers for the Klebolds
said they would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Robinson, a criminal defense lawyer here, said he thought
it would be difficult to prove parental responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Harris was an adult at the time of the shooting,''
Robinson said in reference to the 18-year old gunman. Dylan Klebold
was 17.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson added that ``the parents would have had to have actual
knowledge that made it reasonably foreseeable that what would
happen, happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said a flurry of similar lawsuits would create ``a
spectacle of injured people's families fighting over crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the families of the 36 people who were injured or killed
in the shootings publicly complained last week that they had not
received any of the millions of dollars donated to them from people
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   They have since met with the Jefferson County district attorney
to decide how much each family will receive for food, medical
expenses and other services.

</HEADLINE>
   (With TRADING-HOURS)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thursday's decision by the the board that governs the
Nasdaq stock market to add an evening trading session puts new
pressure on newspapers, wire services and television networks
already competing to get the latest market information to their
readers and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nasdaq's plan to continue using the traditional 4 p.m.
closing time for the day's prices could make the potential
production headaches for newspapers less severe than they had
feared. They had faced the prospect of having to update stock
listings after 10 p.m. to reflect the late trading.
</P>
<P>
   But The Associated Press, which provides stock listings to 900
newspapers, will update them with the evening results as fast as
possible, said Randy Picht, business editor at the AP.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, part of NBC and the parent General Electric Co., and
CNNfn, the business-news cable network owned by Time Warner, said
they would continue to cover the markets whenever they are trading.
</P>
<P>
   But the later hours give CNBC a potentially costly problem.
Between 8 and 10 p.m. on weeknights, the network has two programs _
``Hardball with Chris Matthews'' and ``Rivera Live'' _ that earn
higher Nielsen ratings and more advertising revenue than its
daytime business coverage does.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC could run a scrawl with the ticker figures along the bottom
of the screen during those programs, or move the programs to new
time slots, and executives there said that no decision had been
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a real sea change in financial news on
television,'' said David Borman, executive vice president of CNNfn,
which carries business news from 6 a.m. until midnight. He said the
network would probably have to add reporters to cover business
stories that break in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, too, may face that need. For example, companies
inclined to release certain information only after the market
closes may now release it at 10 p.m., rather than 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The New York Times Co., said:
``As we learn more about the securities exchanges' plans, The Times
will decide on the best way of supplementing the traditional
tables, consistent with still providing prompt delivery of the
newspaper to subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In whatever we do,'' she added, ``we will also look for ways
to make use of The New York Times on the Web to update our
financial market coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Richard J. Tofel, a spokesman for The Wall Street Journal,
a unit of Dow Jones &AMP; Co., and Jim Henderson, deputy managing
editor for the Money section of the Gannett Co.'s USA Today, said
that editors were waiting to see what final plans the exchanges
developed before making coverage decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Borman of CNNfn said he thought that the era of 24-hour trading
was fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``After-hour mechanisms like Strike are filling the gaps, which
are already getting smaller,'' he said. ``Down the road, the
markets will fill in all the gaps. I wouldn't be surprised by
spring to see a morning session popping up. It's fascinating to see
the competition going on, and the questions it raises, and we have
a great front-row seat.''

BARAK RENEWS PLEDGE TO PULL TROOPS OUT OF LEBANON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak on Thursday
pronounced as policy his campaign promise to ``bring our boys
back'' from Israeli-occupied south Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had pledged such action repeatedly during his election
campaign against outgoing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister-elect spoke while visiting a house along
Israel's border with Lebanon that had been damaged by a rocket
fired by Lebanese guerrillas as Israelis went to the polls May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to stand firm in our right to provide a
secure life and prosperity to citizens in Kiryat Shemona and the
whole north,'' said Barak, referring to the Israeli border town
often hit by rockets fired by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bring our boys back from Lebanon under an agreement and
make it a more secure place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, in Jerusalem, several Palestinian legislators were
beaten by Israeli police during a peaceful sit-in at the site of a
controversial Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem. Two
legislators were treated for minor injuries at nearby Maqassed
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Ariel Sharon was named temporary leader of the
Likud Party, replacing Netanyahu who stepped down hours after his
crushing election defeat against Barak. Netanyahu said he would
resign his Knesset seat as well but hinted he was not leaving
politics permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's renewed pledge to pull troops out of Lebanon kindled
speculation that preparations to leave the zone, set up in 1985 to
protect Israel's northern towns from guerrilla attack, might be
seriously in the making.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the local press has been reporting that the army was
considering withdrawing its proxy militia, which it calls the South
Lebanese Army, from the Christian enclave of Jezzine, a move that
could be carried out in weeks or even days.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army's chief of staff, said
the decision was made by SLA commander Antoine Lahad, not Israel,
and should not be taken as a sign that Israel intended to withdraw
farther from the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly suggest not to draw conclusions from Antoine
Lahad's decision to withdraw from Jezzine,'' Mofaz said on Israel
Army Radio. ``We will deliberate our future steps according to
decisions made at the political level and the (army's) assessment
of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With casualties mounting _ nine soldiers have died in Lebanon
this year _ Israel's government has come under increasing public
pressure to get out of Lebanon, even if it means unilaterally
withdrawing troops.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Israel's military commanders have come out against
withdrawing without a peace agreement with Syria, or at least some
kind of guarantees from Lebanon's government to curb Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the end,'' said Eyal Zisser, a
researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African
Studies, Tel Aviv University. ``It's quite clear that the concept
of the security zone has collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was based on the readiness of the Lebanese to
cooperate with Israel and on their ability to resist Hezbollah and
secure the northern border,'' Zisser said. ``The fact that the
South Lebanon Army cannot maintain its presence (in Jezzine) and
Israel has decided it can't send its forces there, well, it means
that the concept of the security zone is not valid anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If the regular Lebanese Army moves into Jezzine after the SLA
leaves and prevents Hezbollah activity, Israeli commentators say it
could make it easier for Israel to leave more Lebanese territory in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Matan Vilnai, a former deputy chief of staff and Labor party
legislator close to Barak, called Jezzine ``a litmus test for what
is to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yossi Beilin, a member of Barak's Labor party who led an
earlier drive to quit Lebanon, said this week that a unilateral
withdrawal would not work without security guarantees from Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Those guarantees are not likely forthcoming without an agreement
that involves substantial Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he plans to restart stalled negotiations with
Syrian President Hafez Assad. The stumbling point is over the point
at which those talks should begin.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, under Netanyahu, wanted to begin without reference to
any progress made in negotiations between Syria and Israel's
previous Labor-led government. Syria insisted on entering the talks
at the point at which negotiators left off when talks stopped in
1995.

REBOUND IN CORPORATE PROFITS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a year of weak growth, corporate profits
rebounded in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday. The giant settlement of litigation against tobacco
companies distorted the figures, temporarily fattening the
first-quarter number. But the rebound also suggested that the
squeeze on profits evident last year may have lifted a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The profit report, the first for the January-through-March
period, appeared in the Commerce Department's latest estimate of
first-quarter economic growth. The gross domestic product grew at
an annual rate of 4.1 percent, the report said, down somewhat from
the 4.5 percent rate reported last month and well below the 6
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending and investment rose strongly, or as Robert
Barbera, chief economist of the Hoenig Group, put it, ``The front
end of the economy remains strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were drags. Exports were lower than the Commerce
Department originally estimated for the quarter. That was also the
case for federal spending and for inventory accumulation, which is
the stockpiling of newly manufactured merchandise in anticipation
of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is not weakening, but there is a kind of bending
off in the growth rate,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers Inc. The GDP grew by 3.9 percent for the
year that ended with the first quarter, down from 4.3 percent for
the year that ended with the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate profits number produced by the Commerce Department
is hard to interpret. Yet many economists consider it perhaps the
most realistic measure of how much money American companies are
actually making.
</P>
<P>
   Each quarter, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis
calculates profits before taxes, and adjusted so that the value of
inventories and capital reflect their actual replacement costs.
Profits figured in this way rose by 3.9 percent in the first
quarter, to an annual rate of $853.5 billion. That was the biggest
quarterly jump in more than a year, and it followed a string of
quarters in which profits either declined or grew by less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco settlement, in which the companies reimbursed states
that had sued them for health costs, turned out to be the biggest
single factor in the first-quarter jump. The companies had paid out
$13.5 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, but only
$900 million in the first quarter. The swing cut into
fourth-quarter profits and produced a jump in the first-quarter
number.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's nonfinancial companies _ that is, companies
other than banks, brokerage firms, investment houses and the like _
the swing represented more than 60 percent of the profit growth.
But other factors, perhaps more enduring, were also in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wages rose, but so did productivity, or the amount that a worker
produces each hour on the job. And that extra output for the same
labor cost helped to improve profits, economists said. Nonlabor
costs, including raw materials, also eased off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting the tobacco stuff aside,'' Varvares said, ``profits
still seem to be in some sort of a rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the GDP report, the Commerce Department also produces
an inflation indicator that is broader than the Consumer Price
Index. Commerce's ``implicit price deflator'' rose 1.4 percent in
the first quarter, the same estimate published last month.
</P>
<P>
   In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said that
the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment
benefits was 300,000 last week, unchanged from the week before. The
number has held to 300,000 or less for 12 of the last 21 weeks, a
sign that the demand for workers remains robust.

INTEREST IN INTERNET STOCKS SHOWS SIGNS OF WANING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How much more do Internet stocks have to fall before
many investors lose interest? Not much, according to the latest
mutual fund data.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps convinced that buying on the dips would always pay off,
investors continued to pour money into Internet stock funds in
April and May, even as Internet stocks dropped about 30 percent
from their peak early last month.
</P>
<P>
   But that pace slowed sharply last week, as Internet funds pulled
in just $34 million in new money. They had swallowed an average of
more than $200 million a week, for a total of $1.3 billion, since
the sector's high in early April.
</P>
<P>
   In all categories, stock funds drew $25.5 billion in new money
in April _ usually a strong month because of contributions to
Individual Retirement Accounts _ according to data released on
Thursday by the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry
trade group. But overall fund sales have slowed considerably this
month, according to fund company officials. In fact, Trimtabs.com
Investment Research estimates that investors have actually pulled
more than $3 billion out of stock funds since the market turned
down on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   New investment in mutual funds has generally slowed somewhat
from the torrid pace of recent years _ in part because of the
increase in online trading of individual stocks. Now the very funds
that invest in the most popular stocks of online traders may be
losing some of their luster.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-stock funds took in $470 million in net new deposits in
the week ended April 14 _ the same week Internet stocks peaked _
more than ten times the $34 million recorded in the week ended
Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif.,
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drying up rapidly due to the volatile market, and more
specifically, this week's negative market action,'' said Robert
Adler, AMG's president.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much money has piled into the funds in recent months,
many people now have paper losses, even though the funds still
boast some of the top performances of the year. In some cases,
shareholders face hefty redemption charges if they decide to bail
out, encouraging them to hold on if possible for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little bit surprised the flows haven't turned negative
already. It seems like an awful lot of hot money,'' said Scott
Cooley, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in
Chicago. ``I've got to think a lot of people haven't made a lot of
money. People have definitely missed the bulk of the gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Internet-stock fund shareholders have invested a big part of
their wealth in these funds, one reason why more investors aren't
pulling out, said David Kugler, president of the Monument Funds
Group, which runs the Monument Internet Fund. ``The average
sophisticated investor says, `I understand the power of the
Internet, and I want to put a little money in this thing, but I
don't want to have a coronary when we suffer tough times,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, investors began pulling money from stock funds
almost immediately after the stock market began sliding from its
peak on May 13. About $3.5 billion has fled stock funds in the last
two weeks, according to Trimtabs.com, which tracks fund sales from
Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been panicky selling,'' said Carl Wittnebert,
director of research at Trimtabs. ``It's just been persistent.''
For May, new sales are estimated at $9.7 billion, according to the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of fund companies continue to get the lion's share of
sales. About $3 out of every $5 in net new fund investments last
month went to Vanguard Group, Janus Capital and Fidelity
Investments, according to the Financial Research Corp., a Boston
firm.
</P>
<P>
   All three fund groups said sales for May are decent but have
eased from the IRA spurt in April.
</P>
<P>
   Stock funds at Fidelity, owned by the FMR Corp., have had net
sales of $2.7 billion so far this month, and with three days to go
will almost surely finish down from the $4.4 billion in sales last
month.
</P>
<P>
   At Janus, a unit of Kansas City Southern Industries, stock funds
have $3 billion in net sales for May, down from $4.8 billion in
April. And Vanguard, whose index funds have made it the
best-selling group this year, reported $3.2 billion in stock fund
sales, s down from $5.2 billion last month.

BELGRADE'S INFAMOUS FIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL, KOSOVO-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Here are thumbnail sketches of the five
Yugoslav officials charged Thursday by the International Criminal
Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, with crimes against humanity:
</P>
<P>
   SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC, 58, president of Yugoslavia since 1997, has
effectively been the strongman of Belgrade since 1987. Then the
Communist Party chief, he staged a coup over his former mentor in
the party, Ivan Stambolic, and was subsequently elected Serbian
president for two terms, 1989 to 1997. As president of rump
Yugoslavia, elected by members of the federal Parliament, he is
also supreme commander of the Yugoslav army. A Communist Party
apparatchik all his life and a lawyer by training, he served as
general manager of Tehnogas, a gas pipeline manufacturing company,
and general manager of Yugoslavia's largest bank, Beobanka. A Serb
nationalist, he rose to power over the issue of Kosovo, and has
been largely blamed for the wars that have torn Yugoslavia apart
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   MILAN MILUTINOVIC, 57, president of Serbia since December 1997.
He is a trusted aide and longtime friend of Milosevic; the two were
law students together at Belgrade University. Born in Belgrade,
Milutinovic was proposed for the post of Serbian president by
Milosevic, and ran as the candidate for his Socialist Party. He
served as Yugoslav foreign minister from 1995 to 1997, and was for
five years Yugoslav ambassador to Greece. He also served as a
member of the federal Parliament and Serbian minister of education.
He has emerged as Milosevic's main negotiator and interlocutor with
the outside world, was present at Dayton to negotiate the end to
the Bosnian war, and led the Serb delegation to peace talks on
Kosovo in Rambouillet, France, last February. While indisputably
loyal, he has some weight as a politician in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   NIKOLA SAINOVIC, 51, Yugoslav deputy prime minister with special
responsibility for Kosovo for the last year, and a close aide to
Milosevic. Born in Bor, a large copper-mining center in
southeastern Serbia, he is a technical engineer by training. He was
a provincial Communist Party chief from 1978 to 1982, then minister
for mining. Since 1991 he has filled top level posts in the Serbian
government and the federal government, including president of the
Serbian government in 1993. In 1994 he became vice president of the
federal government. Since last year he has had special
responsibility for Kosovo, and spent many weeks in the province,
where he was the key liaison with the international observers. A
trusted lieutenant of Milosevic's, he took part in the peace talks
at Rambouillet, France. Reportedly, foreign intelligence
intercepted a telephone call between Sainovic and the Serb chief of
police in Kosovo, Gen. Sreten Lukic, allegedly discussing how to
cover up the evidence of the killings of ethnic Albanian civilians
at the village of Racak in January.
</P>
<P>
   VLAJKO STOJILJKOVIC, 62, Serbia's minister of internal affairs,
comes from Pozarevac, Milosevic's home town. A career policeman, he
became police chief in Pozarevac, and later general manager of an
agricultural complex of factories in Pozarevac. He headed
Yugoslavia's Chamber of Commerce until April 1997, when he was
appointed minister of internal affairs. A trusted aide to
Milosevic, as minister of internal affairs he commands Yugoslavia's
enormous police force, including the secret police and commando
units, all of which have served extensively in Kosovo, often
performing clean-up operations in the wake of the army.
</P>
<P>
   COL. GEN. DRAGOLJUB OJDANIC, 57, chief of staff of the Yugoslav
army, was born in the village of Ravni, near Serbia's border with
Bosnia. He trained at the Military Academy for Ground Forces in
Belgrade, and later taught as a professor there. He served as a
commander of a battalion and an infantry brigade, and when the war
broke out in Bosnia was commander of the Uzice Corps, which had
reservists in particular around Mostar. He commanded the corps
throughout the war. At the end of the war, he was appointed chief
of staff and then commander of the first army, based in Belgrade.
Much decorated, he is said to be close to the Yugoslav Left, the
party of Mirjana Markovic, the wife of Milosevic.

WRIGHT LIVES ON THE EDGE WITH HIS PITCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Almost every club in baseball wishes it had a
pitcher like Jaret Wright. Only 23, he throws a 97-mile-an-hour
fastball that hitters have learned to fear. Therein lies the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two seasons, Wright has become a regular in the
Indians rotation, helping Cleveland compile the best record in
baseball this season. But he also has developed a reputation as a
headhunter, a pitcher not afraid to push the limits of throwing
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams consider this a badge of courage. Others consider it
an invitation to battle.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has hit four batters in his career. One is Darren Lewis
of the Red Sox, whom he will face Friday night in a rematch of a
tension-filled game at Fenway Park April 23.
</P>
<P>
   That game produced hard feelings and suspensions for both teams.
Wright triggered a benches-clearing confrontation when he hit Lewis
with a pitch after buzzing Damon Buford following a Troy O'Leary
home run. The righthander was suspended for five games and fined
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't alter his habits. Last Saturday, Wright hit
Detroit's Tony Clark in the batting helmet with a pitch that set
the stage for a benches-clearing brawl a half-inning later.
Thursday he was fined an undisclosed amount, and American League
president Gene Budig took a further, extraordinary step: He
announced his intention to talk to Wright and Indians manager Mike
Hargrove next week about the pitcher's ``deportment on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright seems unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to get outs for my team and keep the game
close,'' he said. ``Baseball is baseball. You play hard and you
play the game to win. At this level, it's a war out there. You do
what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   How Wright goes about the job is symptomatic of what
commissioner Bud Selig considers an alarming trend.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said he understands the history of such skirmishes between
pitchers who throw at hitters and hitters who charge the mound in
retaliation. But he advocates stiffer penalties for both, perhaps
as soon as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the violence . . . throwing at players'
heads especially,'' he said. ``We're going to take some very
stringent action . . . there's much too much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians don't want any judicial tampering with Wright's
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret is always going to have to pitch in,'' said general
manager John Hart. ``It's a part of throwing the ball 96-97 miles
an hour. In no way is he a headhunter. But a reputatiion like this
is hard to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   ``His pitches are frequently up in the zone. When he's up and
away, nobody says a thing. When he goes up and in, there can be
problems. When Pedro Martinez was at Montreal, he was accused of
throwing at guys. But he settled down, and now his career has taken
off. I think Jaret will eventually get beyond it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have brought in veteran pitching coach Phil Regan to
help Wright with his mechanics. The youngster must figure out how
to avoid hitting batters who dive across the plate and how to deal
with statues in the box like Mo Vaughn who wear thick elbow pads
and shrug off inside pitches like gnats.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is to have command of all your pitches. It is all
that keeps Wright from moving up to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``To label Jaret Wright a headhunter is like going out and
saying the same thing about Roger Clemens or Pedro Martinez,'' said
Indians manager Mike Hargrove. ``Pedro did the same thing in
Montreal. I can go back to Bob Gibson or Nolan Ryan. These guys
were hard throwers and tough guys who established themselves
inside. That's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inner half is part of the plate. It always has been. It's
got to be. I don't care if you pitch 40 miles an hour or 400 miles
an hour, you've got to pitch in to be effective. Ninety-five
percent of the outs are made on pitches away. So people are working
outside to get people out, and don't think the hitters don't know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright reiterated several times this week that he has never
diliberately thrown at a batter. He is what some managers call
effectively wild. Last year he appeared in 32 games and posted a
12-10 record. But he gave up 207 hits and had a 4.72 earned run
average with just 140 strikeouts in 192 2/3 innings. With his
stuff, he should be doing better. This year he is 4-2 with a 6.08
ERA. As he says, he's still learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew where it was going all the time, then I wouldn't
have a 6.08 ERA,'' said Wright. ``Last year was my first full year,
and I pitched in a lot of games. This year I've been working on
other things with Phil Regan to iron out my mechanics so that I
know where the ball is going. A lot of hitters are diving over the
plate. As pitchers, we can't let that affect us. We've still got to
throw inside as much as we can. I think you have to throw inside to
be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's priority with Wright is to make him a better
pitcher. He has the talent to do it, Regan believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed his delivery a little bit and he's getting more
body into his motion,'' said Regan. ``He's changing speeds. He's
getting over to the lefthand side of the rubber. He's getting the
ball more outside to righthanders and more inside to lefthanders.
His changeup has been coming along real well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can throw a ball 97 miles an hour. But now he's pitching.
The other day in Detroit with (Bobby) Higginson up on a 3-2 pitch,
he took a little bit off his sinker _ down to 90 miles an hour _
and got the batter out front and got a ground ball. He's doing very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox may not agree.

SCIENTISTS REGROW SEVERED RAT SPINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have induced severed spinal nerves to regrow in
rats, demonstrating for the first time, they say, that cells in
mammals' central nervous systems contain the machinery to overcome
barriers to regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, scientists have achieved minimal spinal cord regrowth
in animals by tweaking the chemical environment of the damaged
spine, or by transplanting fetal cells or peripheral nerves as a
bridge for spinal nerves, which do not normally heal.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, published in the current journal Neuron,
indicates that spinal nerves have the intrinsic capacity to regrow
if a normally dormant genetic growth program is switched on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This finding represents a breakthrough in the sense that we
can now say that regrowth occurs without putting either peripheral
nerve grafts or embryonic tissue at site of injury,'' said Dr.
Clifford J. Woolf of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston,
who did the research with Simona Neumann. ``We haven't changed the
hostile environment. But we can get spinal nerve growth right
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolf said previous spinal regeneration experiments produced
only ``very limited'' growth, but in the MGH study ``a substantial
number of nerve fibers regrew.'' However, the researchers have not
yet shown that sensory function was restored _ a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the field said the MGH research is an encouraging step
toward a treatment that might help some of the 10,000 or more
Americans who suffer devastating spinal cord injury each year. Its
importance, they said, lies in directing attention on spinal
neurons' machinery for regrowth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises some exciting questions,'' said Dr. Evan Snyder of
Children's Hospital in Boston. ``What are the factors that these
cells are producing that makes them grow into the central nervous
system, and grow further than you'd expect? It reinforces what many
of us have always felt: that when you have spinal cord injury, it's
not necessarily the end of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This work is significant in that it helps us focus on neurons'
intrinsic capacity for regeneration,'' added Mary Ellen Cheung of
the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke in
Bethesda, Md. ``If you turn on the appropriate molecular machinery,
you get regeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Injured nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord do
regenerate, but those in the central nervous system are programmed
not to grow. Thus, cord injury can cause permanent paralysis and
loss of sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent research in spinal cord regeneration has focused on
overcoming the formidable obstacles to regrowth _ inflammation and
scar tissue at the injury site, and growth-inhibiting chemicals
that bathe central nervous system cells.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung cautioned that the MGH work involved sensory neurons,
which have long projections that lie both inside and outside the
central nervous system. Neurons that control muscle movement may
respond differently, she said, but Woolf believes that ``the same
rule will apply.''
</P>
<P>
   The MGH scientists' method of stimulating regrowth will never
become a therapy for human victims of spinal cord injury: They cut
a leg nerve that is connected to the animals' damaged spinal
neuron, either at the same time as the spinal injury or, even
better, a week beforehand. This seems to prime the spinal neuron to
regrow.
</P>
<P>
   However, the finding that spinal regeneration can be induced in
this way has set the researchers on an intensive search for the
precise genetic or chemical switches that control growth. Once they
know these switches, they hope they will be able to flip them on
when needed _ most likely in the immediate aftermath of a spinal
cord injury, not months or years later.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf said he is confident that scientists will eventually be
able to restore some function to patients with spine injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years back, the possibility of spinal cord regeneration
was total science fiction,'' he said. ``I think it is realistic to
say now that it can be achieved. Even quite modest regeneration
could transform a paraplegic's life.''

FEDERAL JUDGE CHASTIZED FOR DELAY IN HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For months Edwin Jones languished in a jail cell while
the judge he had repeatedly written to requesting a bail hearing
devoted much of his time to a protracted case involving
high-profile mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a rare breach of judicial etiquette, Chief US
District Judge William G. Young called the lapse by Judge Mark L.
Wolf, who apparently ignored Jones's appeals, ``inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be no excuse other than the press of other
important court business for not timely addressing this motion,''
Young wrote in a memorandum released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is crystal clear that Jones never received the prompt
hearing to which he was entitled,'' added Young, who nonetheless
refused to release Jones, an alleged drug dealer, from jail pending
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, he languished in custody for nearly a year before a
district judge even considered his detention status.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jones waited in jail, Wolf presided over lengthy mob
hearings that apparently crowded out other court business, such as
Jones's personal appeal for a bail hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the spring and summer of 1997 and continuing
sporadically into this year, Wolf has devoted much of his attention
to the legal claims of jailed organized crime figures Francis P.
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, boss of the New England Mafia, Winter
Hill Gang leader Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, and two
associates.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is asking that extortion and racketeering charges brought
against him be dismissed, asserting that as a longtime FBI
informant he had been given permission by his handlers to commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme, Flemmi, and their associates were indicted in January
1995. Wolf has yet to rule on the legality of the charges and no
trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his involvement with the mob case, Wolf has sent some
of his other cases back to the court clerk's office to be randomly
assigned to other judges.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite Wolf's inaction in Jones's case, Young refused to
release him pending trial, saying Jones was dangerous and might
flee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Young called Wolf's delay in holding a detention
hearing ``a serious matter.'' Young did not mention Wolf by name in
his memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was complicated, Young said, by the fact that
Jones's previous lawyer withdrew from the case without the court's
permission, leaving Jones in the lurch. Four letters Jones sent to
the court requesting a hearing apparently never reached Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Young said that occurred because the court's internal
computer-generated tracking system focuses unduly on motions, to
the exclusion of other types of correspondence, such as letters.
</P>
<P>
   Young promised to perform a ``searching review'' of court
procedures to ensure such mixups do not reoccur. He proposed
training docket clerks to recognize the importance of all motions
and letters pertaining to the detention of defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was arrested on May 29, 1998 and ordered detained on June
17, 1998 by US Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler. Jones's
then-lawyer, Jeremy Carter, filed a motion for a bail review
hearing on Sept. 10, 1998, 18 days before he withdrew as Jones's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Carter did not obtain court permission to withdraw,
but Carter insisted he had.
</P>
<P>
   During the months that followed, Jones wrote several letters to
the court requesting a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until a new lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro, was
appointed to represent Jones in January that the case was
transferred to Young for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said Thursday it was ``outrageous'' that Young refused
to release Jones. ``To say it is terrible that this happened but
then do nothing about it makes a mockery of the law,'' Shapiro
said.

RENO SAYS SHE WAS NOT FULLY BRIEFED ON PLAN TO WIRETAP SCIENTIST
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-NUKE)  
(sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual defense of her handling of a nuclear
espionage case, Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that
she was never fully informed of a dispute between the Justice
Department and the FBI over a proposal to wiretap a scientist
suspected of spying for China.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who rarely comments on internal disputes, said that FBI
Director Louis J. Freeh or her own intelligence staff should have
advised her of their disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is something serious, where Louis Freeh disagrees
with the findings, it should be discussed at my level,'' Reno said
at her weekly news conference, referring to the disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   She discussed the case after a congressional report determined
that the government had failed to plug security leaks at the
nuclear weapons laboratories over many years and that China had
systematically pilfered key design details of the United States'
most advanced nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   While she has testified in closed hearings in Congress, Reno's
comments on Thursday represented her most extensive defense in
public of her handling of the most serious case of suspected
Chinese espionage. Her remarks appeared to be an attempt to deflect
tremendous Republican pressure exerted against her in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   When Reno was asked on Thursday whether she knew about the
details of the FBI's request to wiretap the suspected scientist,
Wen Ho Lee, she said, ``I was not briefed on the details of the
application.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should you have been briefed?'' a reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   She replied, ``I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks came after lawmakers in both political parties have
held Reno responsible for failing to aggressively respond to the
espionage threat, accusing her of bungling the investigation of
Lee, a Los Alamos nuclear scientist who has been fired but has not
been charged with any crime. Lee has denied that he spied for any
foreign power.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have demanded Reno's resignation, but she said
on Thursday that she had not considered stepping aside. She said
she had called Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, who told
her that President Clinton had confidence in her stewardship.
Later, Ruff confirmed that he had told Reno that her job was
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expressed support on Thursday for Reno, saying
she had been unfairly singled out as a scapegoat. Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., who is experienced in criminal justice and
intelligence issues, said, ``The bottom line is that from my
standpoint, I don't know what else any other attorney general would
likely have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The theft of secrets from the country's nuclear weapons labs is
suspected to have occurred in the early 1980s. Energy Department
officials did not suspect Lee until 1995 and the FBI investigation
did not begin until mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
   But officials have said evidence against him was dated and
fragmentary, based primarily on his access to data believed to have
fallen into Chinese hands and on collateral evidence, like his past
travels to meetings with scientists in China.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997 the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence
Policy Review concluded that the evidence was so thin that it
refused an FBI request to apply to a special foreign intelligence
court for a warrant to put a wiretap on Lee's telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that John F. Lewis, a senior FBI official,
subsequently questioned the decision. Based on his concerns, Reno
said she ordered a second review by the Justice Department, which
also concluded that the FBI had failed to produce enough evidence
to justify asking the espionage court for a wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, in August 1997, Reno asked the Justice
Department's Executive Office for National Security to review the
decision. A lawyer in that office, Daniel Seikaly, agreed with the
earlier decision, she said. He communicated his opinion to the FBI,
but did not advise Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said FBI officials dropped the issue. For her part, Reno
said, ``I assumed that since I did not hear from the FBI, that the
matter had been resolved to their satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, FBI officials said that investigators decided to pursue
other avenues. An FBI agent posing as a Chinese intelligence
officer approached Lee, but the scientist rebuffed the invitation
to spy for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Not until this year did FBI agents obtain Lee's consent to
search his office computer _ finding, they said, that he had
downloaded from a classified to a unclassified computer system
thousands of lines of secret computer codes used in the design of
nuclear weapons.

BILL TO REGULATE FERTILITY PROCEDURES GAINS IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Italian parliament has approved a draft law on
assisted fertility that sets prison terms for doctors who use
donated sperm to perform artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was passed by the lower house on Wednesday,
requires Senate approval before becoming law. If approved, it would
be Italy's first law regulating artificial fertility procedures. It
has already reawakened a passionate debate over medical ethics,
family values and individual liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also signals the growing political influence of
the Roman Catholic Church on social and moral issues. The bill
includes nonbinding language, sponsored by a conservative Catholic
member of parliament, committing lawmakers to re-examine abortion,
which was legalized in Italy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives hailed the bill as a victory for law and order.
``The Chamber of Deputies took a big, decisive step forward to help
Italy emerge from the Wild West of assisted procreation,'' former
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the center-right
opposition in Parliament, said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Italy now has no laws governing artificial fertility practices,
and many critics complain that some private clinics operate without
supervision or ethical restraints. Italy has 298 fertility clinics,
of which 97 are private.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the draft legislation was sponsored by members of
the governing center-left coalition, who hoped to impose some
control over doctors and also broaden the choices for couples in
need of fertility treatments. But conservatives in Parliament, as
well as some Catholic lawmakers who broke with the majority over
this issue, reworked the draft, imposing harsh restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Veltroni, who leads Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema's
party, Democrats of the Left, called the law ``fundamentalist'' and
vowed that it would not pass in the Senate. It is not clear whether
he will gather enough votes to block it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill bans couples from using donor sperm or eggs, bans the
long-term freezing of embryos and sets the maximum age at which
women can seek donor eggs and hormone treatments at 45. Italy is
one of the leading countries in post-menopausal pregnancies, most
notably because of the work of Dr. Severino Antinori, who in 1993
helped a 61-year-old woman become pregnant through artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Antinori said that if the law passed, he would
leave the country. ``This is most illiberal law in the world,'' he
said. ``It is an ethnic cleansing against procreation. I can work
anywhere in the world, but what will happen to all those infertile
women? Where are they supposed to go?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a strong anti-abortion movement in Italy, but in a
country where 90 percent of the population consider themselves
Catholic, it is a movement dominated by the Catholic Church. The
church, which has not given up the fight to ban abortion, has also
lobbied heavily to prohibit in-vitro fertilization, because
embryos, which the pope views as human beings, are sometimes
destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The new law does not ban in-vitro fertilization, but it limits
its use. No donor eggs or sperm are allowed. Doctors can create
only three embryos in the effort _ usually, doctors make more than
six _ and they must be implanted within three months and cannot be
frozen for later use. If the father dies after a woman has banked a
frozen embryo, she cannot seek to become pregnant as a single
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows unmarried couples, as well as husbands and wives,
to seek fertility treatment, but only after they can prove they are
sterile. Single women, however, are almost entirely left out.
Italian law already prohibits adoption by single women. The draft
law would ban single women from almost any fertility procedure,
from artificial insemination to in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the lower house because it was supported
by the center-right opposition, and also by small Catholic parties
that usually vote with D'Alema's center-left party but defected
over this issue. The number of parties with ties to the Catholic
Church has grown since the old Christian Democratic Party collapsed
and splintered in the wake of corruption scandals in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats were pro-Catholic, but often failed to
block legislation that the church opposed, most notably in the case
of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in power, and they did for nearly half a century, the
Christian Democrats had to form alliances and coalitions, seeking
compromises right and also left. Now, no single party can claim to
represent Catholic interests fully, and each must compete to
attract Catholic voters and the favor of bishops.

FAGAN TO PLEAD GUILTY TO KIDNAPPING DAUGHTERS IN 1979 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a negotiated end to a case rooted in a bitter,
20-year-old custody fight, Stephen H. Fagan will plead guilty
Friday to kidnapping his daughters from his former wife's North
Adams home in 1979 and raising them under assumed names in Palm
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The plea deal for Fagan, nearly six months in the making and
similar to one rejected by a judge in February, doesn't require him
to serve any jail time, according to sources. But Fagan _ who
remade himself from a bar bouncer with a law degree to a
high-society patron who was a national security consultant _ will
be placed on probation and pay a fine.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will mark the first time in 20 years that Barbara E.
Kurth will see her two daughters in person. After he swept them
away from her as children, Fagan told the girls that their mother
had died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley and
Richard M. Egbert, Fagan's lawyer, sealed the agreement. Neither
Egbert nor Coakley's office would comment on the case or specifics
of the agreement, such as the length of his term on probation or
the size of the fine. Fagan faced up to 10 years in prison for the
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The current plea deal is similar to one both sides agreed to in
February, but it was never presented in court because the presiding
judge, Joseph A. Grasso Jr., raised objections in private that it
did not include any jail time for Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   However, Grasso was assigned to sit in Essex County under a
routine rotation earlier this month. As a result, the Fagan case
was taken by Judge Peter M. Lauriat.
</P>
<P>
   He has reportedly indicated he will approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark T. Smith, Kurth's lawyer, said Thursday that Kurth _ now a
molecular biologist at the University of Virginia _ did not oppose
the deal, even though Fagan won't go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that he makes an admission of the crime, Dr.
Kurth supports the agreement,'' Smith said. ``As for the other
parts of the agreement, that is a matter between Mr. Fagan and the
District Attorney's office.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Kurth and her lawyers have dodged when asked
whether she wanted Fagan behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that Kurth plans to attend the session and was
writing a statement that either she or Rooney would read in court.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughters, Rachel Martin, 23, and Lisa Martin, 21, who have
steadfastly remained by their father's side, are also expected to
accompany him to the 2 p.m. session.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Thursday that Kurth has not seen her daughters in
person since October 1979, when Fagan took them for a weekend visit
and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Fagan and Kurth had been divorced for a year but
were locked in a bitter custody battle. Fagan argued that Kurth,
then a homemaker, was an alcoholic and an unfit mother.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after their disappearance, the probate judge on the
case ruled in Kurth's favor and ordered Fagan to hand over the
children. By then, Fagan, who had changed his identity to William
Martin, and his daughters had arrived in Key West, Fla., where an
old female friend took them in.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, he moved to Palm Beach. While he never worked,
Fagan lived well: he married two wealthy women and passed himself
off as a top-echelon government consultant and CIA agent.
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts, Fagan was a good and nurturing father: both
daughters were top athletes and attended college. They have also
spurned overtures from Kurth.

INDICTMENT OF MILOSEVIC MAKES DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO WAR LESS
LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: We are planning a longer version of this story.)  (rm) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Publicly, the Clinton administration has applauded
the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic, a move that would appear to
change the Yugoslav president's status from potential deal maker to
an off-bounds pariah.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, administration officials say that the indictment
by the International Criminal Tribunal virtually derails their
efforts to find a diplomatic solution through the Russian envoy,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, and the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment on charges of crimes against humanity has
significantly diminished the hopes of using Ahtisaari as a
go-between who could win Milosevic's acquiescence in a settlement.
Viewed in recent weeks as the most likely candidate to succeed in
negotiations, Ahtisaari would now be extremely reluctant to go to
Belgrade to deal with an indicted war criminal, one colleague said.
</P>
<P>
   And one official described the track with Chernomyrdin as
``pretty shaky,'' a sentiment that seemed to be reflected by others
in the administration who believe the Russian efforts may have
mostly run their course.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more troubling for a White House that has been trying to
avoid the use of troops, the indictment will enhance the arguments
of those in favor of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   British officials were quick to point out Thursday that the
indictment forestalled the likelihood of cutting what they called a
shabby deal with Milosevic. ``We think it might be helpful in
stiffening their spine,'' a British official said of the
indictment's effect on the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said that with news of the
indictment, he called President Clinton in Florida and urged him
that this was the time to send extra U.S. troops that have been
pledged for the international security force.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the choice of sending ground troops into a
``non-permissive'' environment in Kosovo or of dealing at the end
of the air campaign with Milosevic, the White House was not ruling
out the possibility that a diplomatic solution could be reached
with an intermediary at a point farther down the line, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was notified on Tuesday of the indictment by
Louise Arbour, the war crimes prosecutor at The Hague. There was no
visible attempt by the administration, NATO diplomats said, to seek
a delay of the indictment to a more propitious moment.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lead time the administration was handed by Ms. Arbour,
there was time for officials to figure out the landscape ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But except for the consensus that the indictment made diplomacy
more complicated, there was no cohesive judgment on what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, said it was conceivable that
Milosevic would follow the Hitler model and take his country down
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 question is Milosevic's reaction and whether this
drives him into a fatalistic mode,'' the official said. ``Like
Hitler he may well try to wreak as much havoc on Serbia and the
region _ Bosnia and Macedonia _ as he can. He may hunker down and
take NATO's hits.''
</P>
<P>
   An analogy could be drawn between Milosevic and Hitler, in this
sense: Like Hitler, Milosevic does not care for his people, the
official said. ``Substitute the Albanians for the Jews and the
Serbs for the Germans and you've got the nightmare scenario that
comes from an isolated man who trusts only his wife and is trapped
in the bunker.''

GERMAN PHONE GIANT SEEKS TO REPAIR DAMAGE IN WAKE OF LOST ITALIAN

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Stung by the collapse of its $81 billion
attempted acquisition of Telecom Italia, Deutsche Telekom AG is now
scrambling to rescue a global partnership with France Telecom and
the Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Though peppered with occasionally angry questions about the loss
of Telecom Italia to Olivetti at Deutsche Telekom's annual
shareholders meeting Thursday, executives pledged to press ahead
with foreign takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deutsche Telekom's goals for the future will still be reached,
even if the merger with Telecom Italia doesn't take place,'' the
company's chairman, Ron Sommer, said. ``We are in a position of
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he defended the failed Italian acquisition, Sommer
announced the need to reposition a money-losing international
venture, Global One.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are immense. Owned jointly with France Telecom and
Sprint, Global One provides worldwide networking services for
multinational companies. But the venture lost hundreds of millions
of dollars last year and sales have been stagnant. And complicating
matters, Sommer has all but destroyed his relationship with the
chairman of France Telecom, Michel Bon, who was infuriated by the
bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Sommer's chagrin, Deutsche Telekom's biggest rival at
home consolidated its position a bit more on Thursday. Mannesmann
A.G., which is already buying out Olivetti's stake in Italy's
second-largest cellular phone carrier, announced that it is buying
out its minority partners in Arcor, the German concern that
competes with Deutsche Telekom in wired service.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives are now trying to reconstruct their strategy
amid the wreckage of the bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Global One sales are nearly insignificant compared with those of
Deutsche Telekom. But executives said it remains crucial for
retaining big corporate customers like Siemens or DaimlerChrysler.
If they cannot offer such customers worldwide networking, they fear
losing them as domestic customers, too.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the French and German telecommunications giants
are barely speaking with each other, neither is willing to ask for
a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, from Deutsche Telekom's perspective, would be
to either increase its stake or perhaps to buy Sprint itself.
Either would require approval from France Telecom, which appears
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom executives seem to be angling for a new
approach that would reduce the central role in the alliance of
Global One and give each partner more flexibility to market
multinational services on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to provide comprehensive service around the
world, they said, Global One would be better off by focusing on
particular regions with heavy traffic. Jeffrey A. Hedberg, Deutsche
Telekom's new managing director for international strategy, said
that to provide all services everywhere would be very expensive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens with Global One, Sommer insisted that
his futile bid for Telecom Italia had not lessened his interest in
international acquisitions. Indeed, he said that Deutsche Telekom
would have been interested in a merger with France Telecom, but
recognized that the French government would never have agreed to
relinquish its controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   Though executives of France Telecom insist that the two
companies never held discussions, German executives said they had
explored ways to ``accelerate'' the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer would love to buy more wireless companies, particularly
now that Mannesmann controls huge franchises in both Germany and
Italy and Vodafone PLC of Britain is buying Airtouch Communications
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He also placed heavy emphasis on Deutsche Telekom's Internet
business, T-Online, the largest access provider in Europe, and
which competes with AOL Europe, a joint venture of America Online
and Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed interest in companies that install and maintain
complex information networks, which has led to speculation here
that Deutsche Telekom might buy an American company like Electronic
Data Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sommer was peppered with criticism from some shareholders
at Thursday's meeting in Cologne, no one called for his
resignation. On Wednesday, the company's board issued a statement
of support and on Thursday his contract was renewed for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer seemed somewhat amazed at what he called the emotional
reactions by France Telecom and by many critics in Italy. ``I
believe it was personal reaction, not a business reaction,'' he
told reporters on Wednesday night, referring to Bon's anger. In the
United States, he said wistfully, ``it is much more pragmatic.''

 The Temps Strike Back  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
How do you tell the difference between an employee and a temp?
<P>
   That's not a riddle with a bad punch line: It's a modern-day
conundrum facing American businesses who want to use temporary
workers but fear getting in legal trouble over them.
</P>
<P>
   As companies use more nonpermanent workers than ever before,
they are facing a growing number of lawsuits claiming these temps
and contractors are really employees who deserve millions of
dollars worth of retroactive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile case so far has involved Microsoft Corp.
Two weeks ago, a San Francisco federal appeals court told the
software giant that it may have to give retroactive benefits not
just to a few hundred former independent contractors but to
thousands of temporary employees from staffing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft is far from alone in its temp troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area companies such as Pacific Bell and PG&AMP;E are also
grappling with lawsuits by former temps and contractors who claim
they should have received the same perks as regular employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the next wave of employment litigation,''
said Larry Shapiro, editor of the California Employer Advisor
newsletter in Tiburon. ``The Microsoft case sounds a siren of
alarm. Employers should be very careful because, later on, if their
contractors or temps are reclassified as employees, they may be
eligible for very expensive retroactive benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Temp Work on the Rise
</P>
<P>
   The evolving court rulings about temporary workers have a broad
impact because so many companies today rely on nonpermanent or
``contingent'' workers.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of the U.S. workforce employed by temporary agencies
rose from 0.5 percent in 1982 to 2.2 percent in 1997, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Together with independent contractors and employees of
contracting firms, temps now account for one of every 10 workers _
more than 13 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Many are traditional kinds of temp workers such as secretaries.
But others are highly-paid professionals such as computer
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Silicon Valley, the use of temps &LR;   &LR; and contractors is
rampant,'' said Mark Thierman, attorney for a group of former
temporary employees who are suing Pacific Bell for back benefits.
``It's a combination of the entrepreneurial spirit of people who
prefer to be contractors, and the psychological issue of companies
feeling that if you don't officially hire someone, it's easier to
fire them.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal risks of using contractors first hit the headlines in
the early 1990s, when the IRS ruled that Microsoft owed back
payroll taxes for hundreds of independent contractors who should
have been classified as employees.
</P>
<P>
   Later, many of those contractors filed suit against Microsoft
demanding the same benefits as regular employees _ including
participation in Microsoft's employee stock purchase program.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court
ruling in favor of the contractors.
</P>
<P>
   And on May 12, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco said that the company may also have to
extend its stock purchase program to long-term temporary staff who
were working through temp agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is appealing that ruling. But in the meantime, the
message to employers is clear: Longtime temporary workers may be
legally considered your employees even if they're on the payroll of
a staffing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier rulings have all pointed in the direction that if
a business uses temporary help over a (long) period of time, they
could be considered employees for benefit purposes,'' said Ed Lenz,
general counsel for the National Association of Temporary and
Staffing Services. ``The Microsoft decision moves the ball a little
further down the field toward that point,'' Lenz added. ``But
there's quite a way to go before we know how this will all work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled that Microsoft exercised enough daily
control over its temps to be considered their employer, even if
they were being paid by an outside agency.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal cases are also addressing the question of
temps-versus-employees _ but with conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   In one local case, more than a dozen clerical workers sued PG&AMP;E
in 1995 claiming they were legally employees even though they were
on the payroll of temp agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The temps worked side by side with permanent PG&AMP;E employees;
they used PG&AMP;E letterhead and business cards; they took part in
PG&AMP;E training and had their expenses reimbursed by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They missed out on the company's pretty generous pension plan,
a savings plan with matching contributions, and a wide range of
health and disability benefits,'' said Janet Brown, an attorney
with Sigman Lewis &AMP; Feinberg who is representing the workers.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed the temps' case on May 12, saying they
were not PG&AMP;E employees because they were paid by temp agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision seems at odds with the Ninth Circuit's ruling
in the Microsoft case _ and so the temps are planning to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of temporary employees filed a class-action
suit against Pacific Bell on May 18 _ citing the Microsoft ruling
that was handed down just six days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Bell plaintiffs include more than 360 longtime phone
company workers who were laid off during a downsizing in the early
1990s. They were then immediately re-hired to do the exact same
jobs _ but as temp agency employees without benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Thierman, who is representing the Pacific Bell workers, said the
suit covers a total of 1,700 temporary employees who lost out on
$30 million in pensions and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell declined to comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it remains unclear what the courts' final word
will be on who is the legal employer of longtime temp workers.
</P>
<P>
   While companies wait for an answer, legal experts advise them to
take a close look at their staffing practices: The more control a
firm exercises over its long-term temps and contractors, the
greater the risk that they will be considered employees.
</P>
<P>
   Employment law experts also advise them to review the
eligibility rules for their benefit plans. ``See if there's
anything that can be done to tighten up the definition of
`employee,''' said Shapiro of the California Employer Advisor.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms have hired outside human resource consultants to help
them steer clear of Microsoft-like legal messes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients are Fortune 1000 companies that are committed to
using contingent workers but want to manage them better so they
don't do what Microsoft did,'' said Terrie Weinand, senior vice
president of PrO Unlimited, which helps companies manage their
temporary workforces.
</P>
<P>
   At PG&AMP;E, HR executives have stepped up efforts to educate
managers on how to deal with temps and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our guidelines is that if you want a (temp) agency
worker to stay on a job longer than six months, it requires the
approval of a vice president or above,'' said PG&AMP;E spokesman Len
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No.1 rule is to remember that agency workers are employed
by the staffing company,'' Anderson added. ``If anything comes up
around performance or working conditions or wages, those
discussions need to be between the worker and the staffing
agency.''

 When the Boss Plays Favorites  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question:  &LR; I work at a large unionized company. My boss is a very
ambitious micro-manager who has a favorite employee and a
scapegoat. She constantly writes up the scapegoat and has
threatened to fire him, while she turns a blind eye to problems
caused by her favorite. The rest of us feel this is unfair. The
union says it can't do anything. What can we do?
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  This is one of those all-too-common workplace problems
where there's unfortunately no easy fix.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious. Has anyone in your department
talked to the boss about this? Sometimes there are good reasons _
such as fear of retaliation _ to avoid such a conversation, but
often people are just too cautious or fearful of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that can happen in union shops is that people don't
deal with problems in a person-to-person way, and instead look for
someone else to do it,'' said Rick Maurer, a Virginia management
consultant and author of ``Beyond the Wall of Resistance:
Unconventional Strategies that Build Support for Change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Choose an individual who has credibility with the manager,''
Maurer added. ``Then have them go forward and say they've noticed
this (scapegoating) and don't think it's productive or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of obvious advice is to talk to your human
resources department. Not all firms have an HR staff. And not all
HR people will have the authority to intervene in a situation like
this. But there's a chance that HR would be willing to confront
your boss or alert her superiors if she is clearly out of line.
</P>
<P>
   There also may be more that the union can do. If your colleague
is being written up without justification, the union should be able
to file grievances over those notices.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, it's possible there's no way to solve this
problem. Your boss' approach to the world has been formed over
decades and is unlikely to change overnight.
</P>
<P>
   You can offer the scapegoat friendly words or a shoulder to lean
on. These small gestures can make a big difference to someone who
feels under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the scapegoat may simply need to move on.
And if the work environment is really demoralizing, you may want to
move too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God it's a good time to find a new job,'' said Matt
Weinstein, a Berkeley management consultant with the firm Playfair
and author of ``Work Like Your Dog: 50 Ways to Work Less, Play
More, and Earn More.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have to take a radical measure like getting
out of there. And later you'll say, `Thank God for that untenable
situation, since it made me move on to a better one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've worked at a computer consulting firm for several years.
My boss recently asked me to sign a statement saying that if I
leave the firm, I will not work for any current client for two
years after I leave. Is this legal? Should I sign it?
</P>
<P>
   A: California's laws were written to give employees a lot of
freedom to seek work in an open job market. So California courts
typically throw out contracts that say employees can't leave their
job to work for a competing firm, or can't leave and work for their
current firm's clients.
</P>
<P>
   But the courts do allow companies to prohibit employees from
taking trade secrets (such as confidential customer lists) with
them when they leave.
</P>
<P>
   And the courts often allow companies to draft
``nonsolicitation'' agreements barring employees from actively
soliciting the firm's clients for a limited amount of time after
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss' statement says you can't  &LR; solicit &LR;  clients, that's
probably legal, although two years may be an overly long period.
``I think the courts would view six months to one year as more
reasonable,'' said Gary Moore, an intellectual property lawyer with
McCutchen Doyle Brown &AMP; Enersen in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   But if the statement simply says that you can't  &LR; work &LR;  for the
firm's current clients after you leave, that's legally shaky.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to avoid rocking the boat and sign the agreement,
knowing your boss probably won't be able to hold you to it. But
that's risky. Who wants to face a lawsuit _ even if the chances are
good that you'll win?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally a bad idea to sign something you think is
unenforceable,'' said Moore. ``Instead, I'd suggest talking to the
boss. You can say that you're sympathetic to the idea of a
nonsolicitation agreement, but it's inappropriate for the company
to say whom you can work for after you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   One note about nonsolicitation agreements: You're banned from
actively marketing your services to the firm's clients, but you're
allowed to notify them in writing that you're leaving the firm. And
if clients choose on their own to follow you to your new company,
that's fine.

 Guidelines on Difference Between Employees, Temps  &HT;       
 Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It would be nice if there were a simple definition of who's a
regular employee and who's a temp _ if, for instance, the courts
ruled that temps and contractors must be considered permanent
employees after six months on a job.
<P>
   But as of now, there's no clear and simple way to differentiate
employee versus temp.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly used guidelines so far come from the IRS,
which has what is called a ``20-factor test'' for determining who
are employees and who are independent contractors for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Some civil courts also have used the IRS definition to help
determine whether longtime temps should be eligible for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS' guidelines can be found in its Publication 15A
(Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide), available at
 &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov &LR; . In a nutshell, the IRS considers:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Behavioral control.  &LR; Employees generally are subject to the
company's instructions about when, where and how to work. They may
be trained to perform services in a particular manner. Independent
contractors, on the other hand, typically set their own schedules
and use their own methods.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Financial control. &LR;  Contractors tend to control the financial
aspects of their job; employees don't. For instance, contractors
are more likely to have unreimbursed business expenses and to
invest in their own work equipment. Contractors usually (but not
always) are paid by the job, while employees are paid by the hour,
week or month. And unlike employees, contractors can make a profit
or loss from their work.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Type of relationship. &LR;  Is there a written contract describing
the relationship between the worker and the company? Does the
company provide benefits such as vacation pay and insurance? Is the
relationship open-ended or for a fixed amount of time? Are the
services rendered by the worker a key part of the business' regular
activity, as opposed to a special project?

RANDOM HOUSE CANCELS BOOK ON EISNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broadway Books, a publishing division of Random House Inc., has
canceled its contract with Kim Masters, a contributing editor of
both Time and Vanity Fair magazines, to publish her book about
Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Co., and his
ascension to Hollywood power.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Fields, Ms. Masters' attorney _ who currently represents
Jeffrey Katzenberg in a dispute with Eisner _ contended Thursday
that Broadway Books canceled the book, ``Keys to the Kingdom,''
because Random House does not want to offend Eisner or the Walt
Disney Co. The cancellation was first reported on the MSNBC Web
site ``The Scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said, ``I found it strange that Broadway Books, having
publicly and privately raved about the book, mysteriously decided
that they did not want to publish it and we are gathering evidence
on why.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said the Walt
Disney Co. had no role in ``tampering with Broadway Books'
editorial integrity'' and questioned Ms. Masters' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going forward with the Kim Masters book because we
found the author's reporting to be sadly inadequate,'' Applebaum
said. ``When we acquired the book, Broadway was led to expect that,
upon completion, it would be a groundbreaking and wide-ranging
investigative book on the Disney company. It was anything but.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said there were several possible reasons for the
cancellation, including the fact that Random House published
Eisner's autobiography, ``Work in Progress,'' last year. (Ms.
Masters contracted to write the book with Broadway Books when it
was a division of Bertelsmann AG not affiliated with Random House.
Random House was purchased by Bertelsmann last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Random House has requested that Ms. Masters repay the first half
of her reported $700,000 advance. Editors at William Morrow &AMP; Co.,
which is owned by Hearst Corp., have offered to buy the rights to
the book when the dispute surrounding Ms. Masters' contract is
settled. Ms. Masters Thursday referred all questions to Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ferris, the executive editor of William Morrow, described
the reporting as ``solid,'' and anticipated that the book could be
a big seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book certainly holds up her reputation as a journalist,
and her ability to get a story in a way that no other reporter on
this beat seems to be able to do,'' Ferris said.

VISITING A SUSPECT SITE, U.S. FINDS ONLY AN EMPTY TUNNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. investigators in North Korea have discovered
that an underground site that Washington suspects could be used to
revive that nation's nuclear weapons program is a huge, empty
tunnel, the Clinton administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report by an inspection team should ease recent
tensions between the United States and North Korea that had
threatened the collapse of a five-year-old agreement meant to
freeze North Korea's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The American inspections began last week under an agreement that
required modest commitments by the United States to continue food
aid to North Korea and to begin a pilot project to help it grow
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials cautioned that while the tunnel is now
empty, it could still be used someday to hide the equipment needed
to build nuclear weapons. And they also noted that material inside
the tunnel could have been moved out in recent weeks in
anticipation of the American inspection, although the movement of
any major piece of equipment would probably have been detected by
American spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said initial reports from the
inspection team suggested that, apart from digging a huge hole in
the ground, the North Koreans had made no obvious preparations for
construction of a nuclear reactor in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday outlining the work of the investigators,
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the American
team began the inspection last Thursday and ended its work on
Monday, earlier then expected. He said the team credited North
Korea's ``cooperation for its unhampered access and the rapid
completion of the work plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The team found an unfinished site, the underground portion of
which was an extensive, empty tunnel complex,'' he said. ``A
careful technical analysis of the team's work will now take place
before further judgments can be made and reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached with North Korea in March, the United
States will be allowed repeated and regular visits to the remote
mountainous site at Kumchangri, about 25 miles northwest of
Yongbyon, a nuclear research center that has been under inspection
by the International Atomic Energy Agency for five years. The next
American inspection is scheduled for May of next year.
</P>
<P>
   A separate White House delegation led by former Defense
Secretary William Perry continued its visit to North Korea on
Thursday, with no clear indication that he would be permitted to
meet the nation's shadowy leader, Kim Jong Il, to offer an American
proposal to lift economic sanctions in exchange for North Korea's
agreement to scrap its long-range missile program.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Perry, the first presidential envoy ever sent to
North Korea, presented government officials there with a letter
from President Clinton for Kim outlining the American proposal.
Reports from the official North Korea news agency said Perry toured
Pyongyang today and visited a collective farm, where he watched
farmers transplant rice seedlings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   North Korea has repeatedly denied that the underground site at
Kumchangri is intended for nuclear research or production, although
the government has acknowledged that it was designed for ``a
sensitive military purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Some type of construction at the site was easily detected by
American satellites. Thousands of North Korean military workers
were seen excavating a huge area under a mountain. The shape of the
excavation led experts to conclude that the North's intention was
to recreate the installations at Yongbyon, which are under
intensive inspection by the Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The underground site had alarmed the administration and had
threatened to undermine the 1994 agreement that was supposed to end
North Korea's efforts to build a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the so-called Agreed Framework, the North Koreans were
promised billions of dollars in energy assistance, including two
new nuclear reactors, in return for a promise by North Korea to
shut down its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's threat to break the agreement unless an
American team was allowed to inspect the underground site led to
warnings from the North Koreans last year that the situation was
moving ``to the brink of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that the accord allowing inspections of
the site will quiet a rising movement in Congress to cut off
fuel-oil shipments to the North, a key provision of the 1994 pact.
The Pentagon feared that a fuel cutoff would lead North Korea to
resume production of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans had initially demanded a payment of $300
million from the United States for the right to a one-time
inspection of the tunnel. But they dropped the demand after the
United States offered new promises of food aid, which the State
Department insists is for relief purposes unrelated to the nuclear
agreement.

YOUNG CONTENT AS WHITE'S `CADDIE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The list included Jose Vizcaino, Mark Grudzielanek,
Devon White, Adrian Beltre, Todd Hollandsworth and Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane flight from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, Dodgers
leadoff hitter Eric Young thought it may be time for him to take a
shot at it.
</P>
<P>
   It's the No. 2 spot in the Dodgers lineup, and Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson spent the spring and the first two months of the
season trying to find a capable, consistent hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who wasn't warm to Johnson's idea of hitting second in
the spring, saw the offense struggling and reconsidered. Devon
White leads off in the new order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize Devo has led off before and he's been on a
championship team as a leadoff hitter,'' Young said. ``I don't have
an ego. If Devo can lead us to a championship, I'll be his
caddie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two games Young has batted second, the Dodgers haven't
mis-clubbed. They've won both and Young is 3 for 8 with three runs
scored and four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Young can do what the Dodgers' other No. 2 hitters haven't done.
He can hit behind a runner, take pitches, hit the ball to the
opposite field and bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the bat control to do it,'' Young said. ``I
feel pretty confident batting second. If we get hot, don't even
think about moving me back to the leadoff spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth batted first in the Dodgers' 4-3 win against
Cincinnati on Thursday, until an injury forced him out of the game.
But the ideal situation has center fielder Devon White leading off
with Young, who has good bat control, second.
</P>
<P>
   The White-Young sequence worked well in Wednesday's game. White
doubled to lead off the game, Young singled to right to score White
and went to second on the throw home. Young stole third and scored
when Reds third baseman Mark Lewis was late covering third and the
throw went down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called the feel of it ``100 percent championship
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got chills. What took me so long?'' Johnson said. ``There's
two ways of looking at it. You take a guy (White) that can hit a
double, it's the best way to lead off. If you're bunting and the
leadoff guy is an RBI guy, it offsets his on-base percentage. Those
two guys in the one and two spots is the best scenario we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth hurt: Hollandsworth left the game in the bottom of
the fifth inning with a rib cage strain. He suffered the injury
swinging at a pitch but continued his at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   However, after scoring from first on a double by Young,
Hollandsworth reached for his lower back on the right side. ``It
hurt to breathe,'' Hollandsworth said. ``Something popped.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hollandsworth is expected to miss three to five
days, but added the team would know more this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon returns: Dodgers reliever Pedro Borbon spent the 1995 and
1996 seasons pitching for the Atlanta Braves in Fulton County
Stadium, and each day he would see Turner Field and anticipate
pitching there.
</P>
<P>
   But Borbon hurt his arm late in the '96 season and spent the
next two years rehabilitating it after surgery. Though it's
unlikely he'll pitch today for the Dodgers given he's thrown the
past two days, Borbon figures to get to the mound at some point
during the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I think about is I never did step on the mound in a
real game there,'' Borbon said. ``I saw it being constructed but
never got a chance to be on the mound. I saw it being built from
scratch and it looked like a nice place.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Dodgers team psychiatrist Herndon Harding arrived
in the Dodgers clubhouse before the game and spoke with several
players. . . . Also before the game, Johnson talked briefly with
his former employer, Reds owner Marge Schott, in the Dodgers
dugout. . . . Cincinnati reliever Scott Williamson struck out all
six Dodgers he faced. Williamson has struck out the last seven
batters he's faced and nine of the past 10. The other batter
reached base on a walk. ``I might be able to find a spot for him,''
Johnson said. . . . Reds pinch-hitter Hal Morris was ejected after
striking out in the eighth and arguing with home-plate umpire C.B.
Bucknor.

 &HT;    Plaintiffs protest memo by Coke chief
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _A federal judge in Atlanta should order Coca-Cola to
notify all of its U.S. employees that the company cannot retaliate
against them for participating in a recently filed racial
discrimination suit, plaintiffs' attorneys said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys filed a motion seeking this order in the wake of a
Wednesday e-mail memo from Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas
Ivester. He told employees the company valued diversity and had
``no room'' and ``no tolerance'' for discrimination against any
worker.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story must decide whether Ivester's
message _ which focused on diversity without specifically
mentioning the lawsuit _ is an ``end run'' around a court order
regulating communications in the case, which is what the plaintiffs
allege.
</P>
<P>
   Story has told Coca-Cola to put a disclaimer on its e-mails when
sharing its views about the case with employees. The disclaimer
should say: ``The foregoing represents Coca-Cola's opinion of this
lawsuit. It is unlawful for Coca-Cola to retaliate against
employees who choose to participate in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola did not add this disclaimer to its memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't put a disclaimer on Wednesday's e-mail communication
because it was not about the lawsuit,'' said company spokesman
Robert Baskin. Instead, he said, it was about diversity at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs want Story to order Coca-Cola to send out a
corrective notice to all 10,000 U.S. employees. The notice would
express the principles outlined in the disclaimer and tell
employees that they are free to contact the plaintiffs' attorneys
to hear their side of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ivester's practice of sending messages to Coca-Cola
employees ... without any indication that an opposing viewpoint
exists or that employees are free to explore and to hold that
viewpoint, is coercive, improper and violative of the court's
order,'' the plaintiffs' attorney said in their motion.
</P>
<P>
   The four black plaintiffs, who allege discrimination in pay,
promotion, performance evaluations and terminations, seek
class-action status for their case. If successful, that could add
as many as 1,500 other black salaried employees as plaintiffs. It
is those prospective plaintiffs whom the attorneys said they are
trying to protect from coercion.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys also are asking the judge to ``caution
Ivester'' on his plans to hold small meetings about diversity with
employees ``in light of the extreme danger of coercion and
intimidation presented by such personal meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   They want Ivester to abide by a second ruling that the company
can only hold direct discussions about the lawsuit with black
salaried employees if they are managers with information the
company needs to prepare its defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Baskin, the Coca-Cola spokesman, insisted Ivester ``does not
intend to discuss the lawsuit at these meetings.''

 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Owen Hart came to the mat as a birthright,
the baby boy of the legendary ``first family'' of professional
wrestling. The ascent of Canada's Hart dynasty stretches over much
of the century and the modern history of a sweaty contest that has
devolved from sport to freakish entertainment worth billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the tale took a tragic twist Sunday when Hart, 34, died in a
60-foot plunge as he readied to swoop down on the wrestling ring on
a cable-and-hook contrivance suspended from the ceiling of a sports
arena in Missouri. The flying entrance had been meant to wow the
bellowing audience at a sold-out ``Over the Edge'' World Wrestling
Federation event in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Death was an unnerving deviation from the hyperviolent spectacle
called professional wrestling _ whose theatric duels offer fans
lots of thrills, but few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the looniness of the stunt that killed Owen Hart.
Most shocking in the minds of many was that he was the good guy,
fighting under the monicker ``Blue Blazer,'' the clear-eyed champ
who before bouts sternly enjoined kids to ``say your prayers, eat
your vitamins, and never ever swear.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martha Hart, his high school sweetie and wife of 10 years:
``Owen really lived like that, as clean as they come. He loved his
family, he loved our children. We had a storybook life. . . . He
was not a reckless person.''
</P>
<P>
   In the costume pageant of professional wrestling, good guys
seldom come to bad endings. And, if lose they occasionally must,
they most surely aren't supposed to be brought low so pointlessly,
slammed to the mat by mere gravity instead of a masked
supervillain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Blue Blazer was a Hart, and the Harts are winners
fabled across the wrestling world. ``Harts are supposed to be
invincible,'' said Paul Jay, the producer of a documentary film,
``Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows,'' about Owen's older
brother, Bret. ``The family is a living legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret ``Hitman'' Hart remains the most famous of eight brothers
and four sisters, all of whom followed their domineering dad, Stu _
now 84 but still presiding over the Calgary-based family empire _
into the tawdry realm of pro wrestling, either as fighters,
trainers, referees, or spouses of wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Owen was the plucky baby brother, the come-from-behind kid who,
after years in the ring, had finally wrassled out a low-key
reputation in his own right. He was the stolid, stubborn strongman,
never quite at ease with the flamboyant stagecraft of a career he
followed mainly because his father told him there could be no other
for a Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a phys ed teacher. I wrestled only to appease
my father,'' he told the magazine Saturday Night in a 1993
interview. ``I was compelled to get into the ring. Once I started,
there was the pressure of my family name.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no business quite like pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sport that is not a sport but a series of performances
stretching contest to contest, season to season, into a long drama
_ albeit one with plot lines simple enough to put comic books in a
league with Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys sneer, curse, and strut villainously while
employing cruel kicks, hellish holds, and sneaky jabs. They also
give the middle finger, fondle their crotches, and pretend to
urinate on their opponents or ringside fans.
</P>
<P>
   Referees gaze blankly into the middle distance as female
accomplices of the wrestlers suggestively straddle ropes and flaunt
their breasts to distract their guy's opponent. The good fellows,
meanwhile, seem not to have a clue _ but cheerfully wreak vicious
mayhem as they grapple with their sinister foes.
</P>
<P>
   It's all show, and some critics say it's a sick show. But if
professional wrestling is condemned, dismissed, or ridiculed by
many, it is also followed by millions of passionate fans across
North America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laugh all you want, but lots of people love this sport,'' said
Calgary sportscaster and family friend Ed Whelan. ``And they love
the Hart family.''
</P>
<P>
   That was plain this week as thousands of fans descended on
Calgary in an outpouring of grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to show the Hart family how deeply we're going
to miss Owen,'' said Bethany Gill, 27, of Taunton, Mass., who with
her boyfriend and sister drove nonstop across the continent to
place flowers near Hart House, the family's landmark residence in
this oil boomtown on Canada's western prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Hart House lies ``The Dungeon,'' where older Harts
trained younger Harts in the arcane arts of legholds and headlocks.
The school became notorious for its emphasis on ``submission''
wrestling, in which the idea is not just to defeat an opponent
through greater strength or dexterity but to inflict pain. The
Harts' academy turned out many of the top grapplers of recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The family's ascent to wrestling's sweat-soaked stratosphere
started with Stu Hart, born in 1915 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. An
all-around athlete, the patriarch-to-be played pro football with
Alberta's Edmonton Eskimos in the 1930s, but really shined as an
amateur wrestler, becoming Canada's national champion in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered a contender for an Olympic gold medal, but
World War II forced cancellation of the games. After the war, Stu
Hart headed for New York, where he wrestled professionally and, in
1947, also found a bride, Helen Smith, daughter of track star Henry
J. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Canada, settling in Calgary, where the senior
Hart launched a career as sports promoter by creating ``Stampede
Wrestling,'' a hugely popular road show that staged bouts across
Western Canada from the late 1940s until 1988. Stampede Wrestling
made the leap to television in 1957, a time when pro wrestling
still had vestiges of real sport.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Helen despised wrestling from the start, according
to family friends. But she had a flair for numbers, and she
shrewdly handled the financial side of the business while her
husband stuck to flashier stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Hart mercilessly drilled his eight boys in wrestling
technique, while the girls were encouraged to date wrestlers or
bodybuilders. The father hoped his sons would become amateurs of
Olympic caliber, but the money was on the pro side _ and that's
where they all drifted with varying degrees of renown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted every one of those kids to follow in his
footsteps,'' recalled Whelan, the family friend who served as
announcer for Stampede Wrestling events.
</P>
<P>
   Owen was thrust into the ring at age 4 and never found his way
out. ``He was definitely getting concerned about safety, and
planned to retire in two years,'' said Martha, who said her husband
doted on their two children, Oje, 7, and Athena, 3. ``We were
planning to move to a dream home in Elbow Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the theatrics dominating professional wrestling, the
Hart boys were trained to be serious athletes and bodybuilders, not
just grandstanders. If Owen was happy enough to dress up in silly
suits and mug for TV cameras, he also possessed genuine skills.
``He grew up with a certain style of wrestling, the art form of
wrestling,'' Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer magazine,
told Canada's National Post newspaper. ``He recognized that
wrestling was a business and more popular than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by Frank Ashley, professor of sports at
Texas A&AMP;M University, televised professional wrestling captures a
weekly worldwide audience of 40 million people. More than 70
percent are adults over age 18, and 30 percent have middle-class
incomes of more than $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling industry earns $1.1 billion a year, much of it
generated through TV pay-for-view. There were about 18,000 people
sitting in the stands at Kansas City's Kemper Arena on the night
Owen Hart was killed, but nearly 1 million were watching on cable
televison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We compete with Hollywood for entertainment,'' Vince McMahon,
president of the World Wrestling Federation, told the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the World Wrestling Federation competes
ferociously with archrival World Championship Wrestling, owned by
media mogul Ted Turner. That competition has engendered a drive for
increasingly outlandish stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Stunts like the one that killed Owen Hart.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Ellie Hart, attributes the tragedy to the scramble
for audience share.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died performing a dumb circus act that shouldn't have been
part of wrestling,'' she said. ``My poor brother was sacrificed for
the TV ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Brother Bret also blames the audience's lust for blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrestling fans have become like wild dogs,'' said the Hitman.
``They just clamour for more and more.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At Key Food in the Astoria, Queens, neighborhood
of New York City, a six-pack of Corona Extra costs $6.99 plus tax.
For the same beer, supermarkets here charge less than $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexicans who regard Corona as a humble, even low-rent beer,
it is something of a mystery why drinkers in the United States are
eager to pay so much for the mild-tasting brew of Corona. But last
year Corona soared past Heineken to become the No. 1 imported beer
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a decade, Corona's manufacturer, Grupo Modelo SA de
CV, has transformed a once-obscure Mexican beer into a global brand
whose name recognition _ if not its sales _ approaches that of
Coca-Cola and Marlboro cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Corona's triumph is a testimony to the power of clever
marketing. Some industry analysts credit its clear bottle, painted
white-and-blue label, even its taste. But the key seems to be
Modelo's shrewd tactics in appealing to a core group of Mexicans
living in the United States while giving Corona a special cachet
among American college students and twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to have it,'' said Theresa Endres, manager of J.
Paul's, a popular singles bar and restaurant in Washington's
Georgetown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing of Corona has been brilliant, whereas the
marketing of Heineken has become schizophrenic,'' said Philip Van
Munching, the author of ``Beer Blast,'' which chronicles the last
20 years in the American beer market. ``Corona's association with
the tropics and being drunk with a lime are indelible images that
work,'' said Van Munching, whose family imported Heineken from 1933
to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Corona is now the 10th best-selling beer in the United States,
according to the latest annual beer study by Impact, a beverage
industry monthly publication that forecasts that Corona will be
among the country's top 5 beers by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see a change in this brand's momentum,'' said Frank
Walters, research director at Impact. ``This is not a fad.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Modelo has been headed by Carlos
Fernandez Gonzalez, only 32, who started at the company as an
office boy at age 11. The nephew of Modelo's board chairman and
great-nephew of the company's founder, Fernandez continued to
work-part time at the company while studying industrial engineering
at Anahuac University, a private institution in Mexico City. Before
being named chief executive, he had worked in nearly every
department at Modelo.
</P>
<P>
   Modelo's management is dominated by families whose involvement
dates from early in the century. Two vice chairmen, Juan Sanchez
Navarro, who is 86, and Nemesio Diez Riega, who is 80, have each
been with Modelo for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very young, but lucky to have lots of age and experience
around me,'' said Fernandez Gonzalez, who sometimes goes around
unshaven, looking a bit like a perpetual graduate student. But he
is careful about his image and has proved to be a quick study in
his relatively new role as the top executive of one of Mexico's
most prominent companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're breaking the rules,'' Fernandez Gonzalez said in an
interview at Modelo's headquarters here. ``When most people think
of beer, Europe springs to mind more than Mexico, but this is
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Modelo's 74-year history parallels the consolidation of Mexico's
beer industry. A century ago, few Mexicans drank beer. Peasants and
workers preferred pulque, a rank-smelling drink made with the
fermented juice of the maguey cactus. But beer became more popular
as the country industrialized.
</P>
<P>
   By 1925, when a young bakery owner named Pablo Diez Fernandez,
who had immigrated to Mexico from Spain, founded Modelo in Mexico
City, the country was dotted with local breweries.
</P>
<P>
   Diez Fernandez headed Modelo for the next 46 years and worked
not only to distribute Corona nationally, but also concentrated on
acquiring regional competitors, among them the breweries that
produce the Victoria, Pacifico and Leon brands. Over the decades,
Modelo outpaced rivals to become Mexico's largest brewer.
</P>
<P>
   One key to Modelo's growth has been the company's consistent
refusal to take on debt, Fernandez Gonzalez said. Instead, the
company has financed its own expansion by reinvesting profits. As a
result Modelo has avoided the financial turmoil that has plagued
many companies here during Mexico's frequent financial crises and
currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Antonino Fernandez Rodriguez, then Modelo's
chief executive, steered the company on a new course, deciding to
concentrate on exports to the United States. He pitted Corona
against Heineken, Beck's and other European beers that dominated
the slice of the American beer-drinking market that went to
imports.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Corona's American sales were sluggish. But
during the mid-1980s, one of Modelo's two American distributors,
the Chicago-based Barton Beers Ltd., struck on a clever marketing
strategy: pitching Corona to young American beer drinkers, many of
them veterans of spring break at Cancun or Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Barton devised television ads featuring attractive young people
in tropical surroundings, under palm trees on sun-drenched beaches.
The ads appeal to the same group of young consumers willing to pay
premium prices for clothing from Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Barton and Corona's other importer, the San
Antonio-based Gambrinus Co., targeted another burgeoning market:
the millions of Mexicans living in the United States.
Spanish-language ads play a piece of classical music instantly
recognizable to Mexicans, Jose Moncayo's vigorous Huapango suite,
as images of Mexico's pastel-colored colonial cities and
pre-Colombian ruins flash across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Modelo set Corona's American prices above domestic beers but
slightly lower than Heineken and many other imports. That added to
Corona's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Sales fell in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Modelo and
its distributors faced unfounded rumors, possibly started by a
competitor, that Corona contained urine.
</P>
<P>
   But they took off again as the popularity of foreign beers have
boomed. Corona has been perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the rise
of a group of more selective drinkers who are not particularly
interested in developing a substantial beer belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People figure that if they drink less, they may as well drink
better,'' said Bill Hackett, Barton's president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The success of Modelo's exports has helped drive up the value of
the company's shares, which even rose during the severe recession
in 1995 and in the midst of the financial rout last year in Mexico
and other emerging markets after Russia defaulted on its debts.
</P>
<P>
   Modelo's shares rose 23.9 percent in 1998, even as the Mexican
stock exchange plunged 24.3 percent. The shares are up more than 19
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modelo has made the sale of its products _ something that at
first was a fad in the U.S. _ into an investment with incredible
returns,'' said Carlos LaBoy, a Latin American equity researcher
with Bear Stearns in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While Modelo is focused on the American market, company
officials do not want their reach to end at California beaches or
New York bars. The company is now pushing Corona in Europe, where
some of the strongest sales gains last year were in Bavaria, home
of the traditional German Oktoberfest. The company's annual report
also highlights rising sales in Israel, Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the same spring-break images that have worked so well
in the United States are at the heart of the European advertising
campaign, where the ritual is practically unknown.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Corona exports flowing, the company is building what
executives say will be Latin America's largest brewery, in the
state of Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   The world's growing appetite for Mexican beer has not gone
unnoticed by other brewers, particularly Mexico's largest maker of
all types of alcoholic beverages, Femsa SA de CV, which exports the
popular Dos Equis, a darker beer, and Tecate. Femsa hopes to do
with Sol, its own light lager brew, what Modelo has done with
Corona.

WITH AN SUV, THE KEY IS RESPONSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (l and f coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of testing autos, what a difference a day makes, to
coin a phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Climb down from the sprawling cab of the rumbling Ford F-250
Supercab pickup truck and wiggle straight into the tight cockpit of
the 2000 Audi TT, a whistling little sports coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a change in perspective. You go from looking down
onto and into virtually every passenger vehicle encountered to
looking up at all of them. The first time the Audi pulls up beside
a Ford truck, what you see is the truck's tires, right there at
window level.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrapuntal clash in the world of motorized steel. You
go from driving with an awareness of what the big truck you had
been driving might to do smaller vehicles to driving fully aware of
what some other large vehicle might do to yours _ and to you.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings up thoughts of the distaste _ or, in some cases,
shrill hatred _ with which many folks these days look at sport
utility vehicles. (A digression here to fine-tune our nomenclature:
Despite whatever manufacturers tell us, if an auto does not have
low-range four-wheel-drive _ as opposed to simple all-wheel drive _
and if it does not have hefty ground clearance, and if it does not
also have a certain bulk, it is not an SUV. In other words, Subaru
Forester owners, breathe easy for this debate.)
</P>
<P>
   The Ford F-250 Supercab that was just parked fits into this
debate because it is from this F-Series' platform that Ford will
build the biggest of all SUVs: The 2000 Ford Excursion. And because
it will be 226.7 inches long, weigh nearly four tons (2,000 pounds
more than the Chevrolet Suburban) and, in V-10 form, get around 10
miles per gallon, it is being dubbed the Ford Valdez by those who
are appalled by its creation and threat to the earth.
</P>
<P>
   So the Excursion will soon be walking straight into the
minefield of debate over the moral propriety of owning an SUV. And
for many folks, myself included, it truly is a moral debate because
it raises questions about safety (at least for those in smaller
vehicles) and environmental issues because of exhaust emissions and
fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any motorized vehicle or craft we drive, moral
issues can be answered with a simple word: responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long after I'd pulled away from the light at which
I'd sat in the Audi beside that big Ford truck that I encountered a
vehicle that frightened me far more: It was a mid-'80s Oldsmobile,
coming up on me fast, right up to my bumper, it seemed, before it
careened out to pass me, swaying on spongy suspension, hurtling on
what I was sure were bad tires, spewing black smoke from an engine
on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure a big pickup truck doing the same thing would have been
just as unnerving, though its engine would have been running
cleaner and its suspension would have been more agile, but in both
cases, it would have been the driver, not the vehicle, putting me
at risk. And that is where responsibility comes in.
</P>
<P>
   If you drive a big SUV, you have to drive it with an awareness
of just how big you are out there; how your headlights look in
someone's rear-view mirror; how your tires look to someone seated
in a low-slung car; how imposing your gleaming bumper can look.
Don't race up on people at high speed. Don't let the inevitable
feeling of invincibility that comes with driving an SUV turn you
into a bully.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs have their place on our roads, but it is fair to ask which
roads and what we use these big rigs for.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the city and own a big SUV, you're out of bounds
unless you keep it parked in private space and use it only for
family-filled trips into the country. It is not a city car because
it is at its most inefficient, space-hogging, and polluting worst
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In an insightful letter to the editor in this paper last week, a
gentleman discussed how much more efficient it is to haul an SUV
filled with as many as nine people on an outing, as opposed to two
or three smaller cars splitting the same load.
</P>
<P>
   An SUV filled with skiers or young soccer players is a good
thing. An SUV being driven by one person out to fetch milk or
papers or commute to work is a bad thing. That is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Do they pollute more than small cars? Certainly, because their
engines are bigger. But the government is continually tightening
emissions limits and there is no reason even the largest SUVs can't
be reined in as time passes. Already, many of them are far below
government emissions standards and as the line continues to blur
between car and truck and SUV, those numbers will naturally go down
even further. I just had a quick spin in the new Toyota Tundra
pickup truck, a V-8 powered four-door that is the first foreign
challenge to America's big trucks, and while it has the power of
the big rigs, it runs as clean and quiet as most cars.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, we should be environmentally conscious about what and
how we drive, and compared to where we were 10 and 20 years ago we
are far along that road.
</P>
<P>
   But it is humorous, sometimes, to read letters to the editor
from those who feel morally superior because they hate SUVs so
much; those who write in to say they are saving the earth because
they drive little Hondas or Subarus to and from their homes in the
suburbs around Boston. I always wonder how many of them go home
each night to a sprawling, restored Victorian or other house that
is arguably far larger than what their family requires, but is
instead what they want, and whose multiple rooms they gladly heat
all winter from a dwindling global fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when things are big. A big economy, big
houses, big cars and trucks. What is truly fascinating is that we
have had this expansion of jobs and homes and transportation and
still, somehow, managed to do it all even as we steadily have
cleaned our environment.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't had to ban big trucks any more than we have had to
ban big homes or big industry. Instead, we have set standards of
performance for all these things _ from insulation in our homes to
fuel standards for our vehicles to pollution from our factories _
and, though it may seem too gradual a process for some (or not
Draconian enough for others) it is working.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just the framework that's been laid out for us.
Within that framework, we can all live in as big a house as we can
afford and drive as big a truck as we want, but any one of us who
fails to approach these opportunities with responsibility is simply
a jerk. Heat that 12-room Victorian that is home to a family of
four to 72 degrees through the winter and you make the list.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a near-empty, gas-guzzling SUV around town for small
errands or to and from work and you make the list. Use it to
tailgate or intimidate smaller vehicles, you go to the top of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that responsibility, common sense, and courtesy are
often lacking on our highways, but when they are present there is
plenty of room out there on the road for all our automotive tastes
and the wonderful and ever-evolving array of the vehicles we get to
drive.

2000 AUDI TT: A SMOOTH, SULTRY SCAMPERER 
</HEADLINE>
   (l and f coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She stood at the edge of the road on her small suburban street
as the sleek silver sports car slid by; stood in a narrow patch of
fresh-turned black soil where her lawn met the street and where she
had been working on her flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   In one hand, she held a silver trowel, and in the other, a hose,
set to light spray and aimed at the flowers. As the car passed you
could see her slowly and purposely mouth the words: ``nice car,''
and then give it two thumbs up, the trowel catching late afternoon
sun in one hand, the light spray from the hose now misting unaimed
and back over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Audi TT coupe, a low-slung, exquisitely designed little
sports car, got attention everywhere it went last week. Stop for
gas and the woman pumping beside you would stop, walk over, and
ask, ``What is that car?'' Traveling salesmen would emerge from
convenience stores when you parked to get the newspaper, wondering
if this was the car for them. Other Audi drivers, recognizing the
four silver rings that mark the brand but not the model itself,
flocked to its presence.
</P>
<P>
   That is because this is a beautiful little rounded creature of a
car. The most hackneyed expression in auto writing may be to say
that a car ``looks as though it's ready to pounce.'' I'll avoid
that, but will say _ and allow you the inclusive phrase _ that from
its rounded paws of fenders at the front, to its arched, taut rear
fenders, this car sits there crouched.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing extrudes from its exterior with any sharpness. All is
roundness. The gas portal is silver and ringed with inset fasteners
that make you feel as tthough you are pumping fuel into an aircraft
rather than a car.
</P>
<P>
   Step back, and it looks just a bit like the Volkswagen New
Beetle _ though one that has been lowered, just so, to look like a
Porsche Speedster with its top up. In fact, this is a hybrid. Its
platform is derivative of both the New Beetle and the Golf. Its
name _ TT _ comes from the Tourist Trophy class of motorcycle races
in which some long ago permutation of the Audi company raced bikes.
</P>
<P>
   At $31,000, Audi has positioned it somewhere between the Honda
Prelude SH and BMW M coupe and Z roadster. Audi is looking for its
niche among these and the upcoming Honda 2000S and reincarnated
Nissan Z.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1.8-liter, turbocharged and intercooled, 4-in-line, 20-valve
engine sends it scampering subtly over hill and dale _ though its
throaty exhaust announces its presence at every downshift or
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   It is reminiscent of the 1980s Saab Turbos _ but without the
turbo lag or whine.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the BMW M coupe is all harnessed violence, the TT is
bottled and sultry snarl.
</P>
<P>
   Stomp the accelerator and there is a steady surge of power. No
kickbacks into the seat or sucking you toward the floor. Instead,
just straight ahead, subtle, but building acceleration. With the M
coupe, you knew where you were going as soon as you stomped the
accelerator, and at the same moment realized you were already
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the TT, there is the stomp, the time to gather bearings, and
then the realization _ surprise _ of how fast you are suddenly
going.
</P>
<P>
   The TT does 0-60 in 6.9 seconds _ almost a second slower than
the M coupe, but not bad given that it is a litre smaller and costs
about $10,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   The factory sets its top speed at 130 miles per hour and warns
drivers to call if the governoring system breaks. It is nimble in
commuter traffic, sure-footed on winding country roads, owing to a
stiff suspension that the turbocharged New Beetle ought to have.
</P>
<P>
   While the M coupe clings to corners as if it were on a rail, the
TT instead adheres as if it has been glued there. There is some
chatter from the front-wheel drive, turbo-torque that is inevitable
in cars of this design when they accelerate rapidly with the front
wheels turned sharply, but its ABS and antislip system perform so
well that even a rank amateur would be hard-pressed to lose control
or do damage in this or any other maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   If this car is rounded and eye-catching on the outside, inside
it is even finer. Its scrunched windshield and very low side
windows are true 1950s Porsche. It is all leather, aluminum, and
stainless steel. There is wonderfully strong thigh support at the
front of its seats (New Beetle designers try these out!) though for
the life of me I cannot understand why they would run stainless
supports from the dash to the console just ahead of the shift. A
few hundred miles of my right leg rubbing against this moderately
padded structure and my leg was sore to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   This sharp and painful angulation is odd because everywhere
else, everything is rounded, from the glinting cupholders that look
like they were pilfered from some trendy trattoria in SoHo to the
gauges and instruments themselves. Most are surrounded by the same
silver-dimpled rings you noticed on the gas cover outside. And most
are functional. Turn the air vent rings to open and close; turn the
console panel rings for seat heat, rear-window defogger, emergency
lights, antislip control.
</P>
<P>
   Climate control is handled by two simple ringed switches that
are clicked plus or minus for more heat or less, more fan or less.
The main instruments are analog-in-silver-circle just behind the
wheel and showing speed, rpms, fuel, and temperature. At their
center is a computerized trip guide that shows the outside
temperature, your radio frequency, time until next service, your
average speed, average fuel consumption, and how many miles to the
next fillup _ among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Airbags ahead of front seat passengers and beside them protect
them in crashes. This is billed as a four-passenger car, though in
truth the back seats are best suited for small children. I'd put
them down and use all that storage space between there and the
trunk. Even the front seats take some maneuvering to enter because
you truly wear this car once you are in it.
</P>
<P>
   But that is comforting at night when red lights bathe the
cockpit, and the Bose sound system _ revealed when you push and
raise an aluminum cover _ can be fine-tuned to the sharpest ear.
Crank it up to your favorite sounds, don't be afraid to push the
gas, push the car, and challenge those corners and this is truly a
fun car to drive.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, that fun may be amplified: Audi plans a
Quattro version of this car, and with all wheels powered, it should
be even better. And, just as VW plans for the New Beetle, Audi will
power this with a six-cylinder, 225-horsepower engine by 2002.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic advocates of gun control urged the House
Thursday to adopt even more stringent restrictions on firearms than
the Senate did, upping the ante for Republicans as the political
gamesmanship over the issue intensified.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Capitol Hill that represented a belated
victory lap for his tie-breaking vote on a gun-control amendment in
the Senate, Vice President Al Gore said the Senate's package of
regulations had not gone far enough. Gore was not specific about
what additional proposals he favored.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that ``for all the praise that's been heaped on the
Senate action,'' the Senate stopped short. ``What should be done
here in the House is a tougher bill, with tougher restrictions
related to guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on crime, House Democrats and representatives of the
Clinton administration called on the House to pass elements of
President Clinton's proposed gun-control package, like an
individual limit of one handgun purchase a month, that the Senate
did not even consider.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Democrats of meaningless grandstanding,
saying there was no proof that the Democratic proposals would do
any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dereliction of our duty as lawmakers to prefer sound
bites more than substance,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who
chairs the crime subcommittee. McCollum and other Republicans also
excoriated the administration for what they said was a failure to
enforce existing federal firearms regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of nerve,'' McCollum said, ``to bang your fist
and demand tougher juvenile gun laws while doing almost nothing to
enforce the ones that already exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the hearing, which was the first formal debate on gun
control in the House this year, and Gore's news conference showed
that despite emerging bipartisan consensus on many aspects of the
Senate gun-control package, there was still a hearty appetite among
Republicans and Democrats for sniping at each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle lines were neither neat nor clean. Just minutes
after Gore vaguely called for a more ambitious legislative push in
the House, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority leader, said he
would be pleased if the House simply passed the same gun-control
measures the Senate had.
</P>
<P>
   That humbler goal suggested that some Democrats remained
cautious about pushing too hard, in large part because of the
belief that advocacy for gun control helped cost them their
majority in Congress in 1994 by drawing the ire and attack
advertisements of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's news conference Thursday was so painstakingly
choreographed that a gaggle of Democratic aides spent about 10
minutes beforehand debating the precise arrangement of the five
American flags that would provide the backdrop for Gore's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore claimed that the refusal of Republican leaders in the House
to satisfy a demand by Democrats for votes on gun control this week
raised concerns that some Republicans were in thrall to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be under any illusions to what's going on
here,'' Gore said. ``At this very moment there are some on the
other side meeting behind closed doors, plotting to have more
delays in order to preserve loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they had already expedited the schedule
by promising gun-control votes in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle for those proposals is a juvenile crime bill written
primarily by McCollum. McCollum announced early this week that the
bill would include versions of all the gun-control measures passed
by the Senate, a sign of significant movement by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats at the hearing Thursday appealed for even
more. They variously advocated criminal penalties for parents whose
guns end up causing violence in children's hands; a legal limit of
one handgun purchase a month, and a raise in the legal minimum age
for all handgun purchases to 21 from 18, a measure that the House
speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, has advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, said that the federal response to concerns
about school violence should not focus too exclusively on gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conservative Republicans on the subcommittee,
Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, pointed to a copy of the 10 Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that if schools were allowed to display these
principles on their walls, ``We would not have had the tragedies
that bring us here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also grilled Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.
and James Johnson, an official with the Treasury Department, about
statistics that showed minimal enforcement of some existing federal
gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials conceded that of the thousands of
convicted criminals who tried illegally to buy guns over the last
year and were caught by background checks, only a handful were
federally prosecuted. But they noted increases in prosecutions
under the Clinton administration of other federal firearms
violations.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours of rival finger-pointing, Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy, D-N.Y., addressed other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm asking is that when you make your judgments and your
fights, you not be so partisan,'' said Ms. McCarthy, whose husband
was killed by gunfire. ``Remember the victims.''

NBA STILL GETTING RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of TV sports according to me:
</P>
<P>
   WAITING TO EXHALE: NBC has been one lucky peacock when it comes
to its 1999 NBA ratings. The Nielsens to date have been much
stronger than anyone anticipated considering the lockout, short
season and absence of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   NBC last weekend again showed gains over 1998. Saturday's
doubleheader averaged a 5.9 Nielsen, up 18 percent over the same
weekend in 1998, while Sunday's tripleheader posted a 7.0, up a
tenth (6.9). Sunday's numbers came despite two games closing out
sweeps and another that put a team ahead 3-0. (One ratings point is
worth 944,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   NBC's numbers are actually improving, comparison-wise, from the
overnights, which target only the top 35 markets. This indicates a
wider appeal for the product in mid-sized markets, like
Indianapolis, Portland and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   NBC can only hope this trend stays warm, because the comparisons
will now face their toughest test. NBC has lost its darling, the
Lakers, who were seen more nationally than any other team, but who
also produced NBC's biggest ratings. Maybe fans tuned in the Lakers
hoping they'd lose. Whatever the case, NBC has shown its last
sideline shot of Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nielsens now go head-to-head with '98 games that
featured Michael Jordan and a Utah-Lakers Western Conference final.
If Portland eliminates the Jazz, NBC will be left with one major
market team, the Knicks, and three outsiders. The network's
best-case scenario would be a New York-Utah series featuring one
major market team and another that is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer's best-case scenario, of course, would feature Ahmad
Rashad being assigned to cricket and Bob Costas being returned to
the pastoral setting of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Costas and Doug Collins, NBC's No. 1 team, have definitely found
a rhythm, a year after the Isiah Thomas experiment flopped and
Costas found rust on his basketball chops. Collins has proven
himself to be a much better sportscaster than coach, and that's not
a knock.
</P>
<P>
   But now Costas is talking too much. The rhythm of baseball that
allows for anecdotes and long story lines doesn't exist in
basketball. Costas is cramming telecasts with too many asides and
witticisms. Basketball is an analysts game. Costas could take a cue
from colleague Tom Hammond, who works a clean game and leaves the
repartee to Bill Walton and Steve Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help Costas at all, either, that he's forced to give
a network plug every 90 seconds. Costas pumped NBC's Noah's Ark
movie so often I swore I saw Shaquille O'Neal and Rebecca Lobo
board the boat in twos.
</P>
<P>
   CALL MISSING PERSONS: You knew Disney chief Michael Eisner was
enamored of ESPN, because he gushed over it when his company
purchased it and ABC from Capital Cities. But you never figured he
would let ABC's sports division go to seed as he has.
</P>
<P>
   When Disney negotiated a new NFL contract, it's priority was
getting the entire Sunday night package for ESPN. Since then, Dan
Dierdorf's Monday Night Football's contract was allowed to lapse
and the powers that be have vacillated on whether it will replace
him. This happens to come in a year, too, that marks MNF's 30th
anniversary and a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When Disney was faced with negotiations for the NHL, it overpaid
to keep the cable package in ESPN's hands. ABC Sports will air only
four regular season NHL games, or seven less than Fox has been
televising the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ABC just signed a multiyear deal worth $12 million a year for
the Indy 500 and a series of Indy Racing League events, again
ostensibly to keep the IRL events away from Fox Sports Nets. ABC
agreed to air a handful of the IRL events on ABC even though they
have no Nielsen track record.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also apparently has no intention of replacing the retired
Keith Jackson on ABC college football telecasts. It apparently
won't even designate a No. 1 broadcast team. Brent Musburger and
Brad Nessler will split most of the big games.
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, Bob Griese hasn't been reassigned to any particular
partner, and ABC this week lost studio analyst Todd Blackledge to
CBS, where he will replace Terry Donahue as CBS' No. 1 colorman.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, ABC will be pressed to keep the horse racing Triple Crown
away from NBC and Fox; it just bought a vain paid-for-TV golf match
between Tiger Woods and David Duval; and Disney's snit with
baseball over the ESPN/MNF issue could lead to ESPN eventually
being shut out of baseball altogether.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to know what Howard Cosell would have to say about
this.
</P>
<P>
   CHORTLES: ESPN's effort to rank the 100 greatest athletes of the
century has been sincere, but it's taking a lot of hits from
baseball fans agog that Mickey Mantle ranked 37th and that a horse,
Secretariat, was ranked 35th. Secretariat was a hell of an athlete,
but you leave yourself open to a lot of snorts by putting him on a
list with bipeds. ...
</P>
<P>
   Critics who panned Keith Olbermann's Fox Sports News exclusive
report that Michael Jordan was negotiating to buy into the
Charlotte Hornets should send their apologies in care of the FSN
anchor desk. He was correct, right down to saying the purchase
price for MJ was the potential linchpin to the deal. ...
</P>
<P>
   L.A. radio legend Bud Furillo is back on the air at KXPS (1270
am) in Palm Springs. KXTA officials aren't likely to take my
suggestion, but I'll make it anyway: Furillo would be a superb
addition to the show, considering his long history in Los Angeles
as a newspaper sports editor and talk show host and his ties to the
Dodgers from his KABC days. They may be separated by generations,
but Furillo's natural bite and attitude is much closer to the
spirit of Jim Rome's show than anything or anyone else KXTA airs.
...
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: NBC's Memorial Day schedule (all games 5 p.m.
ET): Saturday, Portland-Utah Game 7 or San Antonio-Portland Game 1;
Sunday, New York-Indiana; Monday, San Antonio-Portland or Utah.
Costas and Collins will work the Western Conference series,
Hammond, Walton and Jones the Knicks-Pacers series ... NBA Nielsens
on TNT and TBS are off seven percent, and it deserves to be noted
that Turner's two networks have been beaten by more than a 2-1
margin by wrestling ... Fox was miffed that it couldn't air a
Colorado-Dallas NHL playoff game last Sunday because of a
scheduling conflict with another event in Denver. Instead, it was
forced to air Buffalo-Toronto, a game destined to producer low
ratings with Toronto across the border ... NBC begins French Open
coverage with three hour shows Saturday and Sunday (11 a.m. each
day) ... Track and field live? No, really. CBS carries the
Prefontaine Classic Sunday at 10 a.m. Sprinters Michael Johnson and
Marion Jones are headliners ... ABC's Indy coverage Sunday begins
at 8 a.m. This will mark the first time in 11 years that Paul Page
won't do the play-by-play. He left ABC to work CART events as a
result of the snit between drivers and Indy 500 chief Tony George.
Bob Jenkins replaces Page ... If you happen to see the new film
``Trippin','' you will find veteran L.A. radio voice Scott St.
James cast in the role of the President. Supply your own intern
joke here ... The latest sign of ESPN's runaway ego: A recent
episode of ESPN's ``Up Close featured ESPN's Chris Berman.

CHINESE PRESS ATTACKS CREDIBILITY OF COX REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's official press on Thursday attacked the
credibility of the congressional report accusing China of extensive
military espionage, asserting that ``the specter of McCarthyism
looms large in the Cox report.''
</P>
<P>
   A commentary issued on Thursday by the New China News Agency
said that the report, released on Wednesday by a committee led by
Rep. Christopher Cox, provided ``no legally tenable evidence'' to
back up its accusations that China has stolen advanced nuclear and
missile technologies and used them in its own weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report uses ``many vague terms such as `may' and
`likely' to back up its accusations,'' the commentary said. Some
American experts have made similar criticisms of the report's
conclusions on matters that are still under debate among
intelligence specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox and his like, using the same base and shabby methods as
those used by Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, have managed to plunge
every overseas Chinese in the United States into a state of extreme
nervousness and anxiety,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate commentary appearing Thursday on the front page of
the People's Daily, the prime voice of the Communist Party,
expressed the dark view of American foreign policy that seems to be
taking hold here in response to the NATO bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia and the accidental attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's article said that the United States ``is launching a
new Cold War against socialist countries and the Third World.''
</P>
<P>
   China calls the NATO campaign an illegal intervention in the
affairs of a sovereign country. Officials here are especially
worried by NATO's sidestepping of the United Nations, where China
has veto power in the Security Council, and by the setting of a
precedent that could be used to justify foreign interventions in
crises over Taiwan or Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's commentary was the latest in a series of People's
Daily editorials that harshly portray American global intentions.
</P>
<P>
   These recent appraisals of the United States as a major threat
to China contrast sharply with the hopes for a ``constructive
strategic partnership'' that were constantly voiced here last year.
Dialogues on arms control and talks between the Chinese and
American militaries have been suspended as China awaits a more
complete explanation for the Belgrade embassy attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chinese officials say they want trade and
investment ties with the United States to continue unaffected. But
the talks over China's joining the World Trade Organization are in
limbo and diplomats from both countries are assessing how to repair
their relations.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Yugoslavia, Thursday's People's Daily editorial
said, ``is not an isolated or accidental phenomenon,'' but rather
part of an American strategy to dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever doesn't obey it, whoever doesn't accept its political
and economic model, will have pressure applied on them and even
war,'' the article said.

HOUSE MEMBERS URGE OUSTER OF BERGER IN WAKE OF CHINESE SPYING
SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With criticism mounting over the Clinton
administration's handling of the Chinese espionage scandal,
Attorney General Janet Reno ruled out resigning Thursday and blamed
subordinates for failing to consult her on a key decision in the
investigation of spying.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno offered an unusually detailed explanation of how the
Justice Department handled allegations of spying at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, more than 80 House members sent a letter to
the president calling for National Security Adviser Sandy Berger to
resign for being slow to react.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate adopted the first in what is expected to
be a several measures to counter Chinese espionage and tighten
security for U.S. nuclear secrets. The House, mired in partisan
bickering, postponed consideration of its own bill to better
safeguard the nation's strategic technology and left on a 10-day
Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   The action, or lack of it on the part of the House, came days
after a congressional report outlining lax controls over defense
secrets and accusing China of systematically stealing nuclear
weapons information from the United States over the past 20 years.
The Chinese government denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Urged by aides to mount a defense against calls for her
resignation from Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., Reno faulted subordinates at the Justice
Department and FBI for not consulting her two years ago when they
disagreed over whether to wiretap a Taiwanese-born scientist
suspected of spying for China.
</P>
<P>
   During her weekly press conference, Reno explained that when the
FBI first asked Justice Department attorneys to ask a federal court
for permission to put the Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, under
surveillance, the warrant application was turned down by her Office
of Intelligence Policy and Review. The FBI, working with Justice
officials, redrafted the application twice, adding information to
each draft.
</P>
<P>
   It was still rejected, each time for failing to satisfy
requirements in the Constitution and in the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act of 1978. ``Based on the facts reported to us in
1997, the department determined that the evidence was insufficient
to support a finding of probable cause'' to believe Lee engaged in
clandestine intelligence-gathering on behalf of a foreign power,
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, through his attorney, has denied engaging in espionage.
Fired from his Los Alamos post in New Mexico earlier this spring,
Lee has not been charged in any crimes but remains under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said then-Assistant FBI Director John Lewis complained in
August 1997 that his agency was having trouble getting the Office
of Intelligence Policy and Review at Justice to seek court approval
for putting Lee under surveillance, and she asked the agency's
Executive Office for National Security to review it. ``I was not
briefed on the details,'' Reno told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The application was reviewed by assistant attorney general
Daniel Seikaly, who agreed the application failed to establish
probable cause and informed the FBI no wiretap authorization would
be sought from the court. Reno said Seikaly never took up the issue
with her or with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI did not come back'' to her, Reno said. ``I assumed
that since I did not hear again from the FBI that it was resolved
to their satisfaction.'' Since she has come under fire from members
of Congress, Reno said she has stressed to aides that ``where there
is something serious, where (FBI) Director (Louis) Freeh disagrees
with the findings (at the Justice Department), I think that it
should be discussed at my level.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Reno said looking back now at the evidence
available in 1997, the decision to reject the wiretap application
was correct.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general also said she has not even contemplated
resigning, as insisted by Shelby and Torricelli. Reno said she has
talked to White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and ``he assures me
of the White House's confidence'' in her performance.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, congressional criticism seemed to shift to Berger
as 80 members of Congress sent a letter to Clinton demanding that
he dump Berger, blaming him for failing to keep the president
advised of the security breach at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Berger has failed in his responsibility as this nation's
national security adviser by not properly informing you of the most
serious espionage ever committed against the United States,'' the
lawmakers said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also expressed
misgivings about Berger's performance but stopped short of calling
for his dismissal. ``There has got to be some concern about what
Mr. Berger knew and how he acted and what did he say to the
president and when and why did they do some of the things they
did,'' Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the PBS program ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,''
Berger said he has no intention of resigning. ``I believe that
personally and within the White House, we acted appropriately when
this information was brought to our attention,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Although notified in April 1996 of suspicions that Beijing had
conducted massive espionage operations at U.S. nuclear
laboratories, Berger acknowledged that he did not discuss the
matter with Clinton until July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president retained
confidence in Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for the weekend, the Senate adopted on a voice
vote a series of proposals by Lott to improve security
investigations of nuclear laboratory employees and to increase
counter-espionage training at the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as amendments to a bill outlining $288 billion worth
of defense spending, the measures also would tighten security over
technology used to aid in the overseas launch of U.S. commercial
satellites. One proposal would require increased monitoring by the
Pentagon and beef up the role of U.S. intelligence agencies in
overseeing the launches.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of Lott's proposals would require the president
to notify Congress whenever an investigation is undertaken of a
possible violation of export control laws in connection with a
commercial satellite launch.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Senate Democrats managed to stall consideration of
Republican-sponsored legislation that would reorganize the Energy
Department. The proposal, which is opposed by the White House,
would create a new assistant energy secretary for defense programs
who would report directly to the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, debate was postponed on a dozen proposed
amendments to a similar defense authorization bill when the
Republican leadership lost support adopting a rule governing how
the debate was to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans bolted because the rule would have
prohibited amending the legislation to include a funding cutoff for
U.S. involvement in NATO's Kosovo campaign. Democrats were rankled
because the rule would not allowed consideration of amendments
supported by the White House.

 &HT;    Discovery rockets to the sky
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL _ Boosted by a ray of light as bright as the sun
rising alongside it, space shuttle Discovery rocketed into the sky
Thursday, headed for its first rendezvous with the infant
International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the bone-rattling roar of the shuttle's revved up
engines as it lifted off, one might have heard NASA officials
breathing sighs of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 6:49 a.m. launch was the first this year, ending one
the longest droughts in the shuttle program's 18-year history _ the
longest gap between shuttle launches since the deadly Challenger
explosion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The unmanned program has suffered tough times, too, with a
string of six launch failures worth more than $3 billion since
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy we're launching again,'' launch director
Ralph Roe said. ``It had been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   This trip almost didn't get off the ground, either. The launch
was delayed a week after a hailstorm punched 648 dents into the
foam insulation protecting the external fuel tank. Dotted with
patches, it dropped away, as scheduled, eight minutes after
liftoff. The 10-day mission is the second of 36 shuttle trips
planned to construct and stock the space station. The spacecraft _
with its crew of five Americans, a Russian and the first Canadian
to ride a shuttle _ is kind of an interstellar U-Haul, carrying
nearly 2 tons of supplies, including clothing, blankets, computers,
printers, drinking water and more to be used once the station is
inhabited.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's astronauts also will install two construction cranes
during a six-and-a-half hour spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The station, already bright enough to be seen in the pre-dawn
sky, is the mating of two modules _ a Russian control center and an
American connecting hub. The next piece of the $50 billion puzzle
was supposed to be the first Russian-built living quarters. But a
year of construction delays -- the primary reason for the gap in
shuttle launches -- forced the Americans to head into space anyway
and use a makeshift dock to link up with the station in order to
get things moving.
</P>
<P>
   The target date for the living quarters is now November and
another delay would throw off NASA's scheduling again. The first
crew is expected to move in early next year. ``Many of our flight
manifests are linked to the sequential assembly of the space
station,'' said Don McMonagle, manager of launch integration for
the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew will dock on Saturday and stay for six days.
The mission isn't just about building. There's already repair work
to be done on the fledgling station, which celebrated its six-month
anniversary on Thursday. The crew will try to fix a communications
problem and a battery problem.
</P>
<P>
   Also onboard: the STARSHINE project, a messy acronym for a
beach-ball-sized satellite covered with tiny mirrors _ 878 in all.
It looks like a disco ball and will be shot into orbit from
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The mirrors were hand-polished by students all over the world.
Thousands of students are expected to follow the progress of the
satellite and use it to gauge the changes in the density of Earth's
atmosphere. As sunlight bounces off the mirrors, it will glitter in
the sky and will be visible for six months until it burns up in the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Students from St. Michael's Independent School in Stuart were
among those who donated a little elbow grease.
</P>
<P>
   One of the crew's first jobs Thursday was to get some sleep. In
order to be prepared for the space station work, bedtime was set at
just before noon _ not necessarily too early considering their day
started around 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The next shuttle launch is scheduled for July 22. It will be
commanded by Eileen M. Collins, the first woman to command a
shuttle. Three more launches are planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is scheduled to return to Kennedy Space Center at 2:43
a.m. on June 6.

HATSOPOULOS GIVEN WARM SENDOFF BY HOLDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Thermo Electron Corp. shareholders, who have
seen a dramatic drop in the company's stock price in the past year,
nonetheless gave departing chief executive George N. Hatsopoulos a
standing ovation Thursday and welcomed his replacement, Richard F.
Syron, at its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Hatsopoulos, a Greek immigrant who co-founded the firm 43 years
ago and operated it for most of that time with his brother, John,
has come under attack of late for the company's unwieldy structure.
Thermo Electron, which manufactures industrial and laboratory
instruments, is the majority owner of 23 publicly traded firms it
has spun out over the years, with products ranging from airport
security devices to recycling technology.
</P>
<P>
   As shares of the the company's stock tumbled from a high of
nearly 42 1/2 just 13 1/2 months ago to less than 13 last month,
some stockholders revolted. Franklin Mutual Advisers Inc., which
owns 3.4 million shares, or about 2 percent of the company, has
been openly critical of Hatsopoulos and the company's structure. At
Thursday's shareholder session, Franklin senior vice president
David Marcus praised Thermo for taking steps to streamline the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, Thermo Electron has to be more responsive to
business trends and shareholders and ``not be a rest home for
friends and employees'' _ a statement that drew a hush followed by
some hissing from the packed crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Syron and Theo Melas-Kyriazi, Thermo Electron's chief financial
officer, outlined the company's plan to generate $200 million in
cash from the sale of a dozen smaller businesses by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The streamlining, Melas-Kyriazi said, includes a goal of
achieving a 20 percent return on invested capital from all its
operatons by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Syron stressed that Thermo Electron will stick with its core
values of backing individual ideas that can become commercial
successes and increase shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's strong technology and sound management resources
were the reasons I took the job,'' said Syron, the former chief
executive of the American Stock Exchange who will officially
succeed Hatsopoulos on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatsopoulos acknowledged that the restructuring was personally
painful for him, saying that selling 12 businesses and executing
the mandate to restructure the company all in a year is ``a
horrendous job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's recent poor performance, the standing-room
only crowd of generally older stockholders and Wall Street analysts
gave Hatsopoulos, who will remain chairman of the company, a warm
sendoff. At one point, a shareholder proposal that only members of
the Hatsopoulos family hold the top post came up for a vote. The
company opposed it and it was resoundingly voted down, prompting
Hatsopoulos to remark, ``I think some members of my family can't
believe that I opposed that proposal.''

FLIP TABLOID APOLOGY LEAVES ROYALS COLD 
</HEADLINE>

 By WARREN HOGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Sun on Thursday published a full-page apology for
having printed a picture of Prince Edward's fiancee, Sophie
Rhys-Jones, with a breast bared, but Buckingham Palace declined to
withdraw its official complaint against the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline ``Sorry, Sophie,'' the newspaper's editorial
page said, ``We admit it: topless photo was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The editors protested the palace's characterization of The Sun's
action as ``premeditated cruelty'' and asserted that its purpose in
printing the ``saucy, but harmless'' photograph of Ms. Rhys-Jones,
34, a London press agent, had been to portray her as ``a fun-loving
woman who is bringing a breath of fresh air to the Royals.''
</P>
<P>
   If this line of argument was meant to clear the freshening royal
air, it did not work. Buckingham Palace officials took note of The
Sun's response but said they would pursue their protest with the
independent Press Complaints Commission. A hearing is planned for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that The Sun printed on Wednesday was a private
snapshot taken on a business trip to Spain in 1988 when Ms.
Rhys-Jones worked for a London radio station. A colleague, Kara
Noble, took the photograph after another colleague had taken a
playful tug at Ms. Rhys-Jones' bikini top.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Noble sold the photo to The Sun for an estimated $165,000,
less than reported on Wednesday. The Sun promised Thursday night to
donate profits from the photo to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Chauveau, of the Press Complaints Commission, said that
even if it found against The Sun, the stiffest punishment it could
exact would be a written apology by the commission and The Sun's
editors.

NETANYAHU RESIGNS FROM PARLIAMENT BUT HINTS AT COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a defiant parting speech after his defeat in the
Israeli election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his
resignation from Parliament on Thursday but hinted at a political
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course we charted together will triumph in the end, and we
will all witness this victory,'' Netanyahu said to cheering members
of the central committee of his Likud Party in Tel Aviv. ``With
God's help, we shall yet return.''
</P>
<P>
   As supporters shouting ``We love you!'' wept and threw kisses,
Netanyahu announced that he was giving up his Parliament seat. He
stepped down from leadership of the Likud Party last week, when he
conceded defeat to Ehud Barak, the leader of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak resoundingly defeated Netanyahu in the May 17 election, 56
percent to 44 percent. Netanyahu remains in office as Barak forms a
new government, a process that could take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This evening I'm announcing my decision to resign my
membership in Parliament,'' Netanyahu, 49, said over shouts of
``No!'' and ``Stay!'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that I'm leaving Parliament, but I am by no means
leaving the battle for the future of the country,'' he added. ``I
will continue to work in my own way to insure this future, and I'll
continue to serve the national idea as I have over the last 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu gave no indication of his immediate plans, but his
spokesman, David Bar-Illan, said this week that he would most
likely write a book and go on the lecture circuit in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's resignation from Parliament will free him of limits
set by Israeli law on earnings by lawmakers from lectures and
similar fees.
</P>
<P>
   Received on Thursday night by long minutes of ringing applause
by the party faithful _ who sang ``Long live, Bibi, King of
Israel'' _ Netanyahu delivered a stern political testament to his
successors in government, reiterating his tough line on negotiating
peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we lower the exaggerated expectations of the other
side and its ability to threaten us, the closer Israel will get to
permanent peace,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us the Arabs won't agree if they don't get
everything they want,'' he added. ``I say the Jews won't agree to
demands that they give what they can't. And they must not agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now after the elections, Arab expectations are again on the
rise,'' Netanyahu warned. ``If Israel complies with their demands,
it will soon find itself dwarfed, shrunken, with its back to the
sea. Such a state will be a constant temptation to threats of
aggression and terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel might find that it enjoys much international
sympathy,'' Netanyahu continued. ``Its leaders will receive many
compliments, maybe even Nobel Prizes. But it will not have
permanent peace and security, because after a series of painful
withdrawals in the north, and after the establishment of an Arab
state in the heart of the country, the Arabs will come to us and
say just one short word: more.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu added, ``Whoever is unprepared to struggle in
negotiations, will find himself struggling on the battlefield.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as Netanyahu bowed out, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
swiftly took control of Likud, winning a unanimous vote to become
temporary party head until a new leader is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to rebuild the party, Sharon, 71, suggested that he
might run for the leadership of the party, a position that would
make him the Likud Party's candidate for prime minister in the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to have a candidate, bright as he may be,''
Sharon said in an allusion to Netanyahu, who tended to ignore Likud
in his campaign. ``A candidate needs to have a strong political
movement with him, and we will rebuild it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the election was clear, Sharon said: ``A united
Likud will win.''

SHUTTLE EN ROUTE TO RENDEZVOUS WITH SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle Discovery is headed for
a late-night Friday rendezvous with the international space
station, where seven astronauts from the United States, Canada and
Russia plan to spend six days setting up housekeeping for the first
permanent crew.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle lifted off its seaside launching pad at the Kennedy
Space Center at 6:49 a.m. ET Thursday to begin its pursuit of the
space station, which was flying parallel to the Carolinas'
coastline, northwest of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the failure of one of 44 shuttle steering jets,
considered a minor glitch, NASA officials said the shuttle's
nine-minute climb to orbit had been flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pristine vehicle,'' said Donald McMonagle, a launch
manager at the Kennedy center. This mission is the first flight of
a shuttle since December, when astronauts joined the first two
segments of the station that is to become a $60 billion outpost for
scientific experimentation by 16 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's crew will prepare the station for the arrival of
its first living quarters, the much-delayed service module being
built by Russia and scheduled to be launched on a Russian rocket
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The five men and two women on the shuttle crew are delivering
more than two tons of clothing, drinking water, laptop computers,
maintenance tools and other supplies before the first permanent
crew takes up residence early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is scheduled to dock about 12:21 a.m. ET on
Saturday after a 17,500 mph rendezvous and circling of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Two astronauts, Tamara Jernigan and Daniel Barry, will spend
more than six hours in the vacuum of space installing an
American-built construction crane and the mount for another crane,
made in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the external items, the crew will move more than
3,000 pounds of supplies through a corridor leading from the
shuttle into the space station, which is to be completed in five
years.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: INFINITY IS SET TO ACQUIRE OUTDOOR SYSTEMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cry of ``To infinity and beyond!'' heard in the
film ``Toy Story'' is coming true for Infinity Broadcasting, at
least in the booming realm of advertising seen and heard outside
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Infinity, the radio and billboard giant controlled by CBS Corp.
in New York, agreed Thursday to significantly expand its presence
in out-of-home advertising by agreeing to acquire the No. 1 company
in that field, Outdoor Systems Inc. in Phoenix, for about $6.5
billion in stock. Terms of the deal also call for Infinity, led by
the charismatic deal-maker Mel Karmazin, to assume about $1.8
billion in Outdoor Systems debt.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching beyond the front door is a rapidly growing industry
because the proliferation of choices among in-home media like
television and magazines is making it more difficult for
advertisers to reach consumers, particularly desirable demographic
groups like busy, two-income couples. That is why there are ads on
telephone kiosks, wrapped around buses, on postcards in restaurants
and even on the floors of supermarkets and drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe, and we've said this a lot, that reaching
the consumer when he or she is closest to the purchase is very
desirable,'' Karmazin, chief executive of Infinity and CBS, said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Infinity had already been the nation's fourth largest outdoor
advertising company through its ownership of TDI, which specializes
in selling ad posters displayed by subway, bus and commuter rail
systems. Now Infinity will add the 237,000 billboards, New York
City subway displays, posters, mall kiosks and other properties
owned by Outdoor Systems to form a powerful company concentrated in
the major metropolitan areas of North America that are the focus of
most advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Infinity will own radio stations and ad signs in 20 of the 30
largest American markets and 33 of the 50 largest; Outdoor Systems
also operates in 47 big Canadian and Mexican cities and TDI also
sells signs in Britain and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other Infinity and CBS media properties _ the CBS
television network, the CBS-owned television stations, cable
networks like Country Music Television, TV shows like ``Jeopardy''
syndicated by King World Productions and Web sites like CBS
Sportsline _ the cross-media advertising and promotional
opportunities seem, well, infinite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is a plus, a big plus,'' said Alan Gottesman, who
follows the advertising and media industries as managing director
of West End Communications/Consulting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more points of contact you have with a client,'' he added,
referring to the advertisers that buy commercial time and ad space
from media companies, ``the more you understand where a client's
business is going.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was signed Thursday morning after what Karmazin
called ``five intense days of negotiations'' that ended a year and
a half of on-and-off talks between Infinity and Outdoor Systems.
The deal, endorsed by the boards of both companies, requires
approval from shareholders and federal regulators; it is expected
to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is emblematic of the galloping consolidation
that has been remaking out-of-home advertising in this decade,
particularly in radio and outdoor media.
</P>
<P>
   Infinity, America's largest owner of radio stations with more
than 160, acquired TDI in 1996, the year Infinity was acquired by
CBS. Outdoor Systems has expanded by purchasing the outdoor
operations of, among others, the Gannett Co. and the Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top nine companies in outdoor advertising have 62 percent
of the industry revenue,'' said Nancy Fletcher, president and chief
executive at the Outdoor Advertising Association of America in
Washington. Outdoor ad revenue reached $2.3 billion last year, up
9.1 percent from 1997, the largest increase in 14 years, while
total out-of-home ad revenue climbed 9 percent to $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of the fragmentation of other media; demand
from advertisers in categories like entertainment, hotels and
resorts and retail; increases in new categories for us like
Internet and pharmaceutical advertisers, and technological
improvements,'' Ms. Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the improved graphic quality of many
signs because of the rise of computer painting, which now accounts
for more than 90 percent of signs, she estimated, compared with 5
percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to be at the mercy of the man with glasses painting
the sign,'' he said. ``The creative now has helped a great deal in
attracting fashion and show-business advertisers.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco was once the largest spender in outdoor advertising, but
those ads disappeared for good last month under terms of an
agreement between the cigarette makers and state attorneys general.
That negative is being turned into a positive, Gottesman said, as
outdoor companies cultivate other revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies were long-term clients probably paying
unbelievably low rates'' for their ad space, he added. ``Now other
advertisers can come in and pay market rates. It's like when a
rent-controlled apartment turns over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Outdoor Systems holdings will be added to the cross-media ad
packages that CBS offers under the name CBS Plus, which have been
bought so far by advertisers like Pennzoil and Taylor Made Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to go to advertisers and their agencies and make
it one-stop shopping if they want it that way,'' Karmazin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to take all of their money,'' he added, laughing,
``if they are willing to give it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And as the agencies have consolidated,'' Karmazin said, ``it's
better for the media to deal with them if we have a consolidated
position as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will mean that Infinity will derive about a third of
revenue from out-of-home advertising and two-thirds from radio, he
added, compared with the present proportions of 12 percent and 88
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As for organizational matters, Karmazin said, ``our feeling
right now is to let both'' Outdoor Systems and TDI ``operate
separately'' under present management, likening that to having each
of the many radio stations that Infinity owns in New York City,
with programming ranging from Howard Stern to ``golden oldie''
music to Don Imus, run by its own general manager.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal closes, Arte Moreno, 52, president and chief
executive at Outdoor Systems, is to become chief executive of the
Outdoor Systems subsidiary and join the board of Infinity.
</P>
<P>
   William Levine, 68, chairman of Outdoor Systems, will be
chairman of the subsidiary and also join the Infinity board. Both
have agreed to vote their shares, representing about 26 percent of
the outstanding stock of Outdoor Systems, in support of the
acquisition. William Apfelbaum is to continue as president and
chief executive of TDI.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal call for each share of Outdoor Systems to be
swapped for 1.25 shares of Class A common stock of Infinity, which
is 82 percent owned by CBS after a spinoff in December that made
Infinity a public company. CBS will vote its 96 percent interest in
Infinity in favor of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The share exchange valued Outdoor Systems at $32.50 a share, a
13 percent premium to the $26 closing price on Wednesday, the day
before the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, as the Dow
Jones industrial average plunged, shares of Outdoor Systems rose
68.75 cents, to $29.50, shares of Infinity fell 93.75 cents, to
$25.0625, and shares of CBS dropped 93.75 cents, to $40.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The Infinity deal contrasts with an announcement Friday by
Chancellor Media Corp. that it was considering the sale of its
outdoor operations, which were greatly expanded last year when
Chancellor bought Whiteco Outdoor Advertising and Martin Media.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Karmazin said that he remains a buyer rather than a
seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a believer in the power of advertising,'' he
said. ``Now more than ever, branding is the word and how do you
brand? You advertise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And who is the biggest pure-play advertising company?'' he
asked rhetorically, leaving the answer unspoken.

   Parents pamper tots as kids' market gets hip to designer duds,
silver rattles and high-end items
</P>
<P>
   By Alma Hill
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a baby boom rattling the fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Infants and toddlers have become the muse of the moment,
inspiring designers to produce pricey clothes and accessories that
give new meaning to the word ``pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, the upscale baby market has witnessed
the advent of handmade, sterling silver rattles and jewelry by Bali
designer John Hardy that sell for as much as $300.
</P>
<P>
   In November, BabyGap stores welcomed a new sibling called
BabyGap Luxe, for the newborn who needs everything from a $245
cashmere layette to a pair of $98 leather pants. Donna Karan's new
DKNY Infant and Toddler line arrived in stores this spring, and
DKNY Baby is scheduled for a June delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Karan entered the children's wear business in 1997 with DKNY
Kids. But she expanded the line to infants out of frustration.
Karan couldn't find items she liked when shopping for baby gifts
for close friends such as Jane Chung, her ``creative soul mate''
and DKNY design director.
</P>
<P>
   A baby was also behind celebrity makeup artist Bobbi Brown's new
skin care products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies are happening right now,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   When her third child, Duke, was born 10 months ago, Brown wanted
something special to rub on his skin and wasn't satisfied with
products already on the market. So she created Baby Essentials, a
quintuplet of skin care products that retails for $89 a set. The
line came out in late April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like Johnson &AMP; Johnson, because they remind me of my
childhood,'' Brown says, ``but I was ready for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity customers of Brown's, such as Cindy Crawford and
Marlee Matlin, apparently agree.
</P>
<P>
   Origins, a cosmetics and skin care company owned by Estee
Lauder, has also entered the fashionable baby fray by launching
eight all-natural products that range in price from $7.50 to
$13.50. Another entrant: handbag designer Kate Spade, who's
marketing a black nylon diaper bag that retails for $200.
</P>
<P>
   With celebrities such as Madonna, Jada Pinkett Smith, Holly
Robinson Peete, Christie Brinkley and Patricia Heaton cooing with
children, the costly merchandise has a natural audience. But models
and celebrities aren't the only people spending big bucks on their
young.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and industry analysts say America's booming economy,
and a growing appreciation of the difficulties attached to
later-in-life pregnancies, are what help fuel the sale of items
such as $25 cashmere booties and $100 cotton knit onesies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents see this segment of the market as an extension of
themselves,'' said Vanessa Groce, editor of Earnshaws, a New York
trade magazine for the children's wear industry. ``They buy better
products for themselves, so they want to buy it for their own kids.
It's better-educated, affluent people in urban areas. It's only a
small segment. It's not mainstream at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why BabyGap carries its luxury items only in selected
markets. While there is an entire store devoted to BabyGap Luxe
products on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, the BabyGap at Lenox Square
in Atlanta has Luxe only in newborn sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't discuss strategies in terms of store locations, but it
is based on where we have the greatest response,'' said Amy
Maniatis, director of Gap public relations. ``It's really driven by
our customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers at Neiman Marcus at Lenox like the high-end
merchandise so much that the store carries Hardy's sterling silver
baby collection, Karan's infant and toddler line and a French
couture collection called Babymini par Calimini. ``We're getting
more and more in because it is selling so well,'' said Amy
Doelling, Neiman's public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Greer, news anchor for Atlanta TV station WGNX, is one of
Neiman's regular customers. She also goes to baby boutiques to shop
for her sons, Kyle, 4, and Tyler, 7 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a boy, it's hard to find cute baby clothes,'' Greer said,
referring to the typical department store selection. ``So I usually
buy the Ralph Lauren and the Tommy (Hilfiger) and the Donna Karan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to spend a lot of money on my stuff, so I don't feel
bad when I spend money on the boys' clothes,'' she added. ``My
mother fusses, but they're only my kids once. I won't be able to
dress them in a couple of years, so I'm having fun now.''
</P>
<P>
   For many parents, though, tot-size designer items are for
special occasions only. Dr. Giselle Corbie-Smith, an internist for
Emory University at Grady Memorial Hospital, sticks to basic, more
affordable clothes for her children. The only upscale items her two
boys have are a Tiffany baby spoon she received as a gift when
4-year-old Noble was born and an engraved silver cup given to
17-month-old Aydan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a newborn, those kinds of keepsakes can be real special,''
Corbie-Smith said. ``But not for everyday use. I'm not going to let
him go to Woodruff Park with his silver cup.''

   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Gardening double can wear you out, but it has
its advantages; enjoying two springs is one of them. Weeks after
that soft, bright season danced through Atlanta, it waltzed around
the North Georgia mountains _ my second second spring. Reassuring
in its constancy, lovely as always, it showed me something special
this year about resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tiny, tender plants I put into the rocky ground on
this ridge seemed lost during winter's frigid days and nights. And
what didn't suffer from the weather _ a hot, dry summer took its
toll, too _ was bitten to the dust by deer and rabbits and who
knows what.
</P>
<P>
   Resigned to the prospect of having to repeat much of the
planting I had done over the past year, I am amazed at what
survived, thrived even.
</P>
<P>
   In Big Momma's garden, where the rose and the Rose of Sharon
grow, along with many other old-timey plants my grandmother loved,
there were several gratifying comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Two seedlings from my Atlanta Rose of Sharon, which some call
``trash'' (as a friend says about her men, I like my garden ``a
little on the trashy side''), are recovering from animal pruning
and pushing hard to catch the third, which has reached 2 feet.
Another ``trashy'' plant, the prickly pear, was the most surprising
victim of feasting animals; they apparently felt no pain from
pincushion pads. Well, prickly pear now grows new pads with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny burning bush that was nibbled down to nothing but nub
already has exceeded its original height of 6 inches, putting out
chartreuse-colored leaves much larger than its original foliage,
rushing to grow tall and tough enough to evade the grazers.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the other side of Big Momma's garden stand two mulleins
descended from a Celestine Sibley gift; their big gray-green leaves
had lain plastered to the ground in rain and cold but now have
risen to become the mothers of all mulleins, their stalks already 4
feet high, topped with big buds that will open purplish. Snuggled
next to the mulleins is the badly damaged rose campion, which had
been eaten to the ground. Inspired by the comeback mulleins, the
rose campion puts out gray-green leaves with steady determination.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a comeback creates novelties. All the horsetail reeds
were cut to the ground by animals, and all have put out new reeds
that rise from the ground like vertical caterpillars. One, clump,
however, has grown a single reed like none I've ever seen before:
half an inch in diameter, twice as fat as the others _ and twisted
so that its black rings resemble the spiral of a peppermint stick.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the cabin, in the Japanesque garden, the
hard-bit dwarf mondo struggles back with tentative green growth, as
does cast iron plant and Lenten rose (it produced one lonely
bloom).
</P>
<P>
   A baby azalea, one of the early chomping victims I noticed, has
new leaves right on top of the ground, as it was eaten down to 2
inches. Next to it, a yew has put out bright-green growth after
being nibbled within an inch of its young life.
</P>
<P>
   The poor corkscrew willow, grown from an Atlanta cutting, was
snack food sometime in the winter. Now, its new growth shoots in
myriad directions, desperately seeking escape from the next wave of
hungry animals. A few feet away, a clump of bloodgrass recovers
from its mauling, bloodied but unbowed.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road, where native plants grow a transition to the
woods, a butterfly weed (some name for such a majestic plant)
contributed by Lynn Greer bravely returned after a losing encounter
with some ravenous creature. Similarly, the beautiful beautyberry
survived its grazing and grows strong and promising again. And the
Japanese paper plant branches out after falling prey to a fungus
that wiped out its fragrant blossoms at midlife.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, life. Early, middle or late, it is for learning. This second
second spring has taught me much.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been skeptical about ``animal-resistant plants,''
but those grown from bulbs, rhizomes, corms and tubers may be just
that. Nothing ate iris, lily, anemone, shamrock, garlic. But maybe
they're just on the dessert list. In any case, I would not want a
garden made solely of such plants. Nor am I endorsing the notion of
having my plants chomped to inspire energetic growth; I can prune
them myself.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the garden's response to critters' hard
pruning is heartening; resilience is a thing of beauty.

 &HT;    Atlanta hosting national convention of business, political
supporters
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Americans for the Arts, the national assembly of
business and political leaders in support of the arts, opens its
convention in Atlanta this week, it will be a kind of homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   That is, a visit to the city that five of AFTA's leading figures
_ Fulton County Commissioner Michael Hightower, Fulton County Arts
Council director Harriet Sanford, Woodruff Arts Center director
Shelton g. Stanfill and Donald Greene and Adrian King of the
Coca-Cola Foundation _ call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a celebration of Atlanta's leadership,'' said
Robert Lynch, president of Americans for the Arts, from his
Washington office. ``Those five members of our policy board are the
most from any city, so it's quite a concentration of power down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is, in a sense, the birthplace of what Stanfill calls
``the nation's most prestigious arts support group.'' In 1995, when
Sanford was director of the National Association of Local Arts
Agencies, and Greene headed the American Council for the Arts
(private and corporate arts supporters), they were brought to-
</P>
<P>
   gether by mutual acquaintance and arts stalwart Jack Schultz of
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the wisdom of working together,'' Greene says, and the
two organizations were folded into the new AFTA.
</P>
<P>
   The combined clout is getting results. Advocating (Lynch prefers
that word to ``lobbying'') for the National Endowment for the Arts
by meeting with congressional leaders, AFTA clearly played a role
in the NEA's survival and growing support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drew up a resolution that said `art matters,' and over 300
mayors signed it,'' Sanford says. ``That gets attention in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention, which will be centered Saturday through June 8
at the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers, is a who's who. Co-chairmen
Hightower and Mayor Bill Campbell will welcome delegates. Featured
speakers include Johnnetta Cole, professor at Emory University;
U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.); and NEA Chairman William Ivey.
Representatives from the White House, the Conference of Mayors and
eight other arts-friendly organizations will sign an accord
authored by King, a statement of principles giving these groups a
unified voice in arts support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenor of this meeting will shift away from the culture
wars and defensiveness of the past,'' Stanfill says. ``The message
is going to be a more positive one about growth.'' The morning
session of June 7 is dubbed National Youth Arts Forum.
Representatives of the NEA, AFTA and the Justice Department will
demonstrate their collaborative project, the Youth Arts Tool Kit:
books and videos that show community leaders how to use the arts to
enhance academic performance and help at-risk youth.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta theater was selected as the convention's showcased art
form. Theater artists Dwight Andrews and Elizabeth Omilami will
speak on the panel ``Spirituality and the Arts''; both are
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Performances by Jomandi Productions, actor Tom Key and
Neighborhood Playhouse director Sondra Nelson will introduce
convention events. Next Sunday evening, conventioneers will have
the option of attending improv comedy at Dad's Garage Theatre, a
puppet show at the Center for Puppetry Arts or a musical drama by
the Freddie Hendricks Youth Ensemble (``a shining example,''
Sanford said, of the arts as a positive force for urban young
people).
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``Night on the Town'' will be followed by a dessert and
gospel concert at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where better,'' Sanford says, ``to get a sense of place and be
filled with the Atlanta spirit?''

   ATLANTA: this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some qualities he earmarks:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ability to take the ASO into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Good communication skills. What this really means is the
ability to talk from the podium _ something Levi doesn't especially
like to do. But ``Your Atlanta Symphony Orchestra'' (as it bills
itself) wants to appear more user-friendly. So several candidates
this season _ Alsop, David Robertson, William Eddins _ seized a
microphone and worked the crowd at Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An up-and-coming reputation. Bankoff's term is ``rising
star.'' After four years of conflict, first over labor disputes and
then over Levi's dismissal, the ASO's corroded image needs the kind
of replating that a charismatic young conductor could provide.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And, ``of course, musical competence,'' Bankoff says.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the ASO board isn't offering much, save exposure. In
addition to podium time, the ASO has a recording contract with
Telarc, though its continuance, without Levi and Shaw, is an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   Not many candidates would be coming here just for the salary.
The ASO board has grumbled that Levi's compensation is excessive,
and the betting among ASO insiders, including several longtime
board members, is that the next director will be paid half, or less
than half, of Levi's $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of compensation hasn't come up,'' says Bankoff.
But ``if someone just wanted to make money, he could do better in
New York.'' What the ASO has to offer, he says, is ``an attractive
package (in which) quality of life and an open environment'' play a
part.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million-plus salaries of Masur in New York and Sawallisch
in Philadelphia may make the ASO board quail, but it's the market
rate for a top-notch conductor today.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison's sake, note that Levi, perhaps the city's most
visible artistic figure, makes the same salary as Eddie Perez, the
Atlanta Braves' second-string catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the ASO's conductor candidates hear much about plans
for organizational growth; in the foreseeable future, the ASO has
none to speak of. The operating budget has remained frozen around
$20 million since 1995. The orchestra roster is fixed at 96
players, and this was reached only after the contentious 1997
episode of six players who sought tenure and fought for months to
get it. The standard size for a major orchestra is 106 players.
</P>
<P>
   The stagnation is largely caused by the ASO's accumulated
deficit, which topped $4 million six years ago, was retired in 1997
and crept up past $1 million this year. Much of the organizational
energy has gone toward coping with it, and few increases on the
expense side of the ledger have been allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The only real carrot the ASO can offer its next music director
is a new performance space in the renovated First Baptist Church, a
project that even its most enthusiastic supporter, ASO board
chairman A.D. Frazier Jr., estimates has a two-in-five chance of
approval by the Woodruff Arts Center board, which will be asked
next month to finance it.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the conductor who fits the ASO board's
requirements is someone young, glamorous, not too tendentious and
more interested in a career bounce than in the sweaty and thankless
process of orchestra building.
</P>
<P>
   And someone who will remain neutral about plans to reshape _
which probably means downsizing _ the ASO into ``the orchestra
Atlanta can pay for,'' in the reiterated words of former board
chairman L. Neil Williams, current president of the American
Symphony Orchestra League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra that Atlanta can pay for'' is probably not going
to attract the next Tilson Thomas. Or Masur. Or Levi. Conductors at
that level require much more, in salary and perks and recording
contracts. But orchestras such as Atlanta, Houston and Cincinnati,
on the brink of national name recognition but not quite willing to
pay for it, are looking to cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   With orchestras' schedules planned two or more years out,
settling on a conductor is no assurance that the baton will be
passed in time for the 2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably have to be a buffer period,'' says
Bankoff, ``probably two years.'' There may have to be one or more
interim music directors to take the ASO through the transition.
Frazier describes the next music director in terms of a ``successor
or successors'' to Levi.
</P>
<P>
   For an organization whose financial fortunes are dependent on a
charismatic figurehead, such a delay couldn't come as worse news.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this prospect hasn't sped up the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will emerge with a different set of expectations for the
music director than were expected of either Robert or Yoel,'' says
Bankoff. ``The role is in transition in lots of orchestras. ... And
I'd like to see Atlanta play a role in what it means to have a
meaningful orchestral experience in America. A handful of
orchestras will define what it means, and Atlanta should be one of
them.''

</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the cabin, in the Japanesque garden, the
hard-bit dwarf mondo struggles back with tentative green growth, as
does cast iron plant and Lenten rose (it produced one lonely
bloom).
</P>
<P>
   A baby azalea, one of the early chomping victims I noticed, has
new leaves right on top of the ground, as it was eaten down to 2
inches. Next to it, a yew has put out bright-green growth after
being nibbled within an inch of its young life.
</P>
<P>
   The poor corkscrew willow, grown from an Atlanta cutting, was
snack food sometime in the winter. Now, its new growth shoots in
myriad directions, desperately seeking escape from the next wave of
hungry animals. A few feet away, a clump of bloodgrass recovers
from its mauling, bloodied but unbowed.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road, where native plants grow a transition to the
woods, a butterfly weed (some name for such a majestic plant)
contributed by Lynn Greer bravely returned after a losing encounter
with some ravenous creature. Similarly, the beautiful beautyberry
survived its grazing and grows strong and promising again. And the
Japanese paper plant branches out after falling prey to a fungus
that wiped out its fragrant blossoms at midlife.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, life. Early, middle or late, it is for learning. This second
second spring has taught me much.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been skeptical about ``animal-resistant plants,''
but those grown from bulbs, rhizomes, corms and tubers may be just
that. Nothing ate iris, lily, anemone, shamrock, garlic. But maybe
they're just on the dessert list. In any case, I would not want a
garden made solely of such plants. Nor am I endorsing the notion of
having my plants chomped to inspire energetic growth; I can prune
them myself.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the garden's response to critters' hard
pruning is heartening; resilience is a thing of beauty.

 &HT;    Recipe for comfort: Haute cuisine couture
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 30.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So you think you're a gourmet cook. Your kitchen is
equipped with stainless steel restaurant-style appliances; your
pantry is stocked with the finest ingredients and your favorite
recipes are ultra-organized. Guests and family alike practically
applaud when you bring a dish to the table.
</P>
<P>
   But do you have ``the look?'' Have you added a pair of baggy
cotton pants with a whimsical food-themed print and a white chef's
jacket to your apron hook? Do you keep a pair of black leather chef
clogs near the stove? Do you even have coordinated oven mits and
chef hats?
</P>
<P>
   In an age when chefs are celebrities and cooking is more a form
of entertainment than a daily chore for many, fashion has become
the final touch for a perfect gourmet experience.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Chefwear, a company that was founded in 1990 as
an outfitter to food professionals, saw 20 percent of their sales
last year go to home cooks who aspire to have ``the look'' of the
chefs they see on television or in the open kitchens of their
favorite restaurants, according to Gary Fleck, chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to tap into the home market even more, Chefwear staged a
mini-fashion show this month in New York City to introduce a new
line of prints designed by Nicole Miller. It's the first time a
major fashion designer has been involved in creating garments for
chefs. Miller's prints -- Italiano, Vineyard, Habanero and Roundup
-- join Chefwear's other popular prints like Utensils and the
classic Black/White Houndstooth.
</P>
<P>
   Fleck's wife, Rochelle Huppin, first created the all-cotton
pants and jackets when she found the standard-issue polyester
uniforms used in so many professional kitchens uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   If the attire of Atlanta's top chefs at the Share Our Strength
charity event earlier this month is any indication, chefs love the
line. Virtually every chef there was sporting Chefwear pants,
including Nava chef Kevin Rathbun, who said he wouldn't wear
anything else in the kitchen. David Berry, chef of Horseradish
Grill, also is a loyal customer -- he was one of a handful of
national chefs to model at the Chefwear event in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Moore, owner of Cook's Warehouse in Atlanta, said while
most of her Chefwear sales goes to restaurants, more and more home
cooks are picking up the items. ``I had one man say he likes to
cook for his dates and greet them at the door with his chef outfit
on,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cook's Warehouse, Chefwear is sold at Chef Duds
in Alpharetta (Ga.) and Uniforms By Mindy in Norcross (Ga.).
Consumers also can order a Chefwear catalog by calling
1-800-568-2433 or visit www.chefwear.com on the Internet.

 &HT;    Journeys of the soul
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Saturday.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poets say summer is the season for love.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists claim it's a time for travel.
</P>
<P>
   But many others think the summer is the perfect time to deepen
your spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, people have used travel for renewal.
Ancient Greeks traveled to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi for
counsel. Eastern mystics sought solitude atop mountains.
Christians, Muslims and Jews have been making pilgrimages to holy
sites in the Middle East for many centuries. Such ``sacred travel''
continues to be a part of spiritual life and is the theme of a new
book, ``Sacred Roads'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $22, 268 pages), by
Nicholas Shrady that details his travels to the world's holiest
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a tourist returns from a holiday, they've added a couple
of pounds around their waist and they're rested, but there's
nothing that's changed their perspective,'' Shrady said during a
recent telephone interview from his home in Barcelona, Spain.
``When the pilgrim returns from a journey, the pilgrim is never the
same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacred travel is one road people are taking these days. But
there are many other spiritual paths, and the summer is a good time
to begin such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   All journeys should begin with a map. Below is a guidebook for
the summer with listings of music, books, films and retreat centers
that offer spiritual renewal for people who are open to change.

2 MORGAN STANLEY EMPLOYEES SUSPENDED IN WAKE OF SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the nation's largest
securities firm, suspended two executives Thursday in connection
with a $10,000 payment that led to the arrest of a former employee.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said in a statement that it had made a ``mistake in
judgment'' last year when it paid a middleman to broker a police
sting operation against the dismissed employee, Christian Curry.
Curry, who is black, was contemplating filing a discrimination suit
at the time. He filed that lawsuit last week, adding false arrest
to his claims and demanding $1.35 billion in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The development is the latest twist in a case that began more
than a year ago when Curry, the scion of a prominent New York
family, was dismissed from his job as a junior financial analyst at
Morgan Stanley. The firm said it dismissed him for abusing his
expense account abuses, but his termination came days after photos
of him appeared in a gay pornographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Curry was arrested by undercover police officers
who said they caught him conspiring to plant racist e-mail on
Morgan Stanley's computer system, apparently to bolster his
discrimination lawsuit. Last week, the Manhattan district attorney
dropped all charges against Curry and turned the investigation on
Morgan Stanley and Charles Joseph Luethke, the middleman, for their
roles in arranging Curry's arrest and the $10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's two leaders, Philip J. Purcell, chairman and
chief executive, and John J. Mack, the president, on Thursday met
with prosecutors in the district attorney's office and pledged to
cooperate with the investigation into the $10,000 payment. The firm
also appointed Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, a
Manhattan law firm, to lead an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of our investigation is to learn the facts as
completely and as quickly as possible. We are sorry for any
distress this entire episode has caused our many clients and
thousands of employees around the world,'' Purcell and Mack said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pending the outcome of that investigation, the firm said it had
suspended with pay two people in its legal department. It did not
reveal the names of the two and did not say why they were
suspended. But people close to the firm said they are Carol
Bernheim, a lawyer trained as a litigator, and Monroe Sonneborn, a
managing director. Both are named as defendants in Curry's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither returned phone calls seeking comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernheim and Sonneborn were not the main targets of the district
attorney's investigation, and the suspensions were entirely the
prerogative of Morgan Stanley, lawyers involved in the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell and Mack said in the statement that they themselves did
not know about the payment to Luethke beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either of us had known about Luethke's request for money,
no payment would ever have been made,'' the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   The Curry lawsuit, which asks for $1.35 billion in penalties and
damages, names as defendants Purcell, Mack, Ms. Bernheim and
Sonneborn, along with seven other senior Morgan Stanley employees.
It contends that Purcell had a personal role in planning to entrap
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was arrested last August, four months after his dismissal,
when undercover officers said they caught him conspiring to plant
racist e-mails on Morgan Stanley's computer system to bolster his
discrimination suit. Charges were dropped last week, a move that
the district attorney's office described as unavoidable after it
discovered that Morgan Stanley paid $10,000 to Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said Thursday that notwithstanding its expression
of regret for the $10,000 payment, it considers Curry's lawsuit
``without merit'' and said it will defend itself vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   But Benedict P. Morelli, Curry's lawyer, said that the firm's
armor is growing weaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is act one, scene one,'' Morelli said. ``We will prove
that our case has merit and theirs is totally without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Luethke has also maintained that Purcell had a role in Curry's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney continues to investigate both Morgan
Stanley and Luethke. Lawyers involved in the investigation said
they did not expect to reach a conclusion about whether a crime was
committed for at least several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with Mr. Purcell and Mr. Mack,'' said Daniel J.
Castleman, chief of the Investigation Division in the district
attorney's office. ``We regard our talks as a positive step in the
right direction. We will have to wait and see how the investigation
turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Curry affair began a year ago April, when Curry, in his
first year as a junior analyst in the firm's real estate finance
division, was fired. Morgan Stanley said that he was terminated
because he abused his expense account. But the firing took place
shortly after the explicit nude photos of Curry appeared in
Playguy, a magazine that specializes in gay pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he is not gay, but said that people at Morgan Stanley
thought he was when they fired him. Discrimination on the basis of
perceived sexual orientation is illegal in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Curry also claims that he was subjected to discrimination
because he was black. His lawsuit argues that he was excluded from
working on business deals that involved white southern clients, for
example, and that at a Christmas party he was asked to dress up in
an Afro-style hairdo and costume lips as a spoof to tease a senior
black banker who works there.

RAMBIS HASN'T EARNED THE JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Jerry Buss turned down Jerry West's attempt to trade
for Mitch Richmond in the middle of the 1997-98 season, there has
been a growing perception that the Los Angeles Laker owner no
longer is the free-wheeling, do-whatever-it-takes spender he was
during the team's Primetime era. And, if Buss retains Kurt Rambis
as his head coach, he will have proven without a doubt that this is
the case.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Rambis was a hard-nosed scrapper who dredged the
most out of limited skills.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, well, there is nothing he did during his brief
incumbency to indicate he was an improvement over Del Harris, or,
even worse, two other predecessors, Magic Johnson and Randy Pfund.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kurt Rambis has about as much business being head coach
of the Lakers as Kurt Russell, considering the numerous tactical
blunders he committed and his inability to motivate the Laker
players.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Jerry Buss getting tired of firing his coaches at
mid-season, as he did to Pfund and Harris and as he will have to do
again next season if he brings back Rambis, whose modest coaching
credentials are exceeded only by modest leadership qualities. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget Phil Jackson winding up with the Lakers. Pat Riley has
a greater chance.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   It's known Riley and wife Chris are thirsting to return to Los
Angeles and that Riley would be amenable to coaching the Lakers
again. Riley would be the perfect fit for a team that is in
desperate need of such a firebrand disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss has told intimates he never would rehire Riley, who's
making more than $8 million a year for the Miami Heat. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ If the hopelessly spoiled Shaquille O'Neal has even a morsel
of pride and one starts wondering if he does in light of his early
playoff exits each spring he should forget about all his
entertainment gigs in the off-season and concentrate solely on
practicing his free throws and going on a serious diet.
</P>
<P>
   The lumbering Shaq, who tires badly at the end of games, is 50
to 60 pounds overweight. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ In the span of one year, the Dodgers hold the distinction of
firing the hardest working coach in major league baseball, Mark
Cresse, and perhaps the nicest, Charlie Hough. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Oh sure, Hough, the defrocked Dodger pitching coach, has been
responsible for the staff's disappointing work this season. The
fact the team's pitchers just might be throwing to the worst
defensive catcher in baseball, Todd Hundley, is quite irrelevant,
of course. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ If Bill Russell still were around managing this underachieving
Dodger team, you can be sure the team's management would have been
taking terrible potshots at him and preparing for his ouster. But
Davey Johnson has a big reputation and multi-year contract, so no
one dares utter anything unflattering about him. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ When you spend as much money as the Dodgers have their payroll
exceeds $84 million and the team performs far below expectations,
those at the lower rung of the organization are sacrificed to
divert attention from those up high who made all the major
decisions responsible for such distress.
</P>
<P>
   Thus that pencil-pushing , CPA-turned Dodger president geek, Bob
(Don' Call Me Rocky) Graziano, and his top emissary, Kevin Malone,
remain unscathed as the Dodgers stumble and Charlie Hough is
cruelly detached. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ As I said before, the best break of the season for the Dodgers
came in the left elbow of Barry Bonds. If Bonds had been able to
remain healthy, the San Francisco Giants just might have run away
and hidden from the Dodgers by now in the N.L. West Division. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ The respect that the Long Beach State president, Dr. Robert
(Fightin' Bob) Maxson, engenders on the national athletic scene was
reflected recently when he was among 44 leaders selected from a
variety of sectors John Wooden, Tom Selleck, John Naber, Dan Gable,
Richard Brown were some of the others to participate in a three-day
Summit Conference in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was a discussion of ethics, character and honor
in athletics,'' relates Maxson, who was a signatory to the Arizona
Accord that was revealed Tuesday at a press conference at the L.A.
Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Maxson was present and didn't even miss any of his
school's graduation ceremonies. He was joined by Wooden, Naber, Tom
Crawford, director of coaching for the U.S. Olympic Committee and
Michael Josephson, founder and president of the Character Counts
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   For some strange reason, Fightin' Bob's one-time sparring
partner, Jerry Tarkanian, was not invited to participate in the
confab. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ As time goes on, I'm growing more impressed with Oscar De La

same exact feelings I once had for Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray
Leonard. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ The rampaging Cleveland Indians have been rolling over the
opposition in the same consistent manner that the New York Yankees
did last season. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Who would have thought that Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine would
turn out to be better in a TV commercial this season than they have
been on the mound for the Atlanta Braves?. . .

<P>
   _ Honestly, it's a draw who I find more nauseating to listen to,
NATO's Jamie Shea, or the NFL's Paul Tagliabue. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ How loony is major league baseball when it attempts to cancel
the final two years of its contract with ESPN? Talk about the old
cut-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face syndrome over a silly snit.
</P>
<P>
   Does major league baseball have any idea how much publicity ESPN
gives it on a daily basis? Who cares if ESPN shifted three
September Sunday night baseball games to its smaller ESPN2 outlet
in order to make room for its NFL telecasts?. . .

   _ Those loudly sticking up for the New York Knicks' beleaguered

surprising playoff success. . .

KOSOVO REBEL FORCE IS REVITALIZING, PENTAGON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kosovo Liberation Army fighters, led by more
experienced commanders and buoyed by NATO's escalating air
campaign, are waging increasingly effective hit-and-run attacks
against Yugoslav troops in Kosovo, Pentagon officials said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to be a resurgent group which has taken advantage
of NATO air strikes, general Western sympathy, and the groundswell
of volunteer fighters in Albania,'' said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson,
director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment on the Kosovo fighters came as allied warplanes
bombed the two main power transmission stations supplying Belgrade
with electricity late on Thursday, plunging most of the capital
into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO continues to pummel Yugoslav forces in Kosovo and
strategic targets like electricity distribution systems, with no
signs of surrender from the Yugoslav president, Sloboban Milosevic,
Pentagon officials say a subtle shift is beginning to emerge on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A broken, demoralized force of roughly 3,000 fighters just two
months ago, the Kosovo Liberation Army has swelled to between
15,000 and 17,000 soldiers in Kosovo, with another 5,000 training
in Albania, American officials estimated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New commanders, including an ethnic Albanian from the Croatian
army, are executing better tactical operations, the officials said.
In addition, new recruits and improved supply lines from Albania
have revitalized a rebel force that had been routed by Yugoslavia's
Third Army before and shortly after the air war started on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are still outgunned by the heavily armed Yugoslav
forces, which are equipped with tanks, artillery and armored
personnel carriers, Wilson said. But the growing number of Kosovo
fighters, coupled with the air war's forcing many of the 40,000
Yugoslav army troops and police to dig into defensive positions,
has started to equalize parts of the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the relative immobility of the Serb armored
mechanized forces, the playing field is somewhat more level,''
Wilson told reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensifying bombing, NATO and Pentagon officials
conceded that there are no signs that Yugoslav troops in Kosovo are
beginning to withdraw, one of NATO's main conditions for halting
the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have not destroyed their will to conduct what
they're doing in Kosovo yet,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials on Thursday reported heavy fighting in southwest
Kosovo, with the rebels launching a major offensive in the Mount
Pastrik area, pinning down Serbian forces there. Last week, the
rebels scored one of their biggest victories in the past two
months, overrunning a Yugoslav weapons depot in Jablanica,
capturing mortars, artillery and a large cache of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces continued their shelling overnight of Albanian
villages just across the Kosovo border, which Belgrade believes are
being used as staging areas for the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   Major clashes were also reported in and around Drenica, where,
Pentagon and NATO officials said, Yugoslav troops were continuing
to expel Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslav forces and rebel fighters battled, NATO warplanes
seized on clear skies to launch 308 bombing runs overnight against
command bunkers, anti-aircraft radars, radio relay stations and
heavy weaponry, including at least five tanks, six armored
personnel carriers, and 10 artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav gunners launched more than 30 surface-to-air missiles
and withering anti-aircraft fire, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good weather that is helping our pilots to see their
targets more easily is in turn helping them to detect our aircraft
and guide their missiles visually,'' Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO
military spokesman in Brussels, said of the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander,
has stepped up attacks on electrical transmission stations,
knocking out power throughout most of Serbia and shutting off the
pumping stations that provide water to most Yugoslav citizens.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the North Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm,
authorized l Clark to broaden his bombing campaign to a variety of
political and economic targets, including civilian telephone
networks that link the military's computer systems. Within hours of
the approval, allied fighter-bombers hit the first of several
telephone networks on the target list, a senior Pentagon official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day or every week he gains authority to strike a wider
range of targets,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said on
Thursday, without disclosing details of NATO's expanded target
list.
</P>
<P>
   Striking civilian phone systems will play havoc with the
Yugoslav military's computer networks and force commanders to speak
on cellular phones, whose transmissions can be intercepted by
eavesdropping satellites and Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior planner for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said that as of Wednesday, in the air war's first 64 days,
U.S. warplanes had conducted 52 percent of the 6,950 bombing runs
and 70 percent of the 20,300 reconnaissance, refueling and other
support missions.

 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For three years, the once-mighty United Farm
Workers of America has struggled to organize California's 20,000
strawberry pickers and packers _ who harvest more than 80 percent
of the nation's strawberries under often backbreaking conditions _
in an effort to revitalize the crusading spirit of the union's
founder, Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's hopes for its most important victory since
Chavez's death in 1993 were thrown into deep doubt Thursday when
the 1,500 workers of the Coastal Berry Co., the state's single
biggest strawberry employer, failed to produce a majority for
either the UFW or a rival group organized by Coastal Berry workers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome of the unionization vote, held in Watsonville and
Oxnard, Calif., raised the prospect of a runoff election, perhaps
as soon as next week, and all but guaranteed another round in the
state's long-running strawberry wars.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, the dispute has produced anti-union
violence and a contested vote that the rival union group, the
Coastal Berry Farmworkers Committee, won by fewer than 100 votes
last July. Those results were thrown out by state officials this
month because 162 workers who were eligible to vote had not been
notified of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue in this struggle no matter how long it
takes,'' Arturo Rogriguez, president of the UFW and Chavez's
son-in-law, said in a telephone conference call with reporters
Thursday. ``We're not going any place. It's a question of
reassuring the workers that we're committed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the UFW's fight illustrates the complex dynamics of the
state's $600 billion a year strawberry industry. The work at
strawberry companies is among the poorest paid, with wages
averaging only about $230 a week, or 12-to-16 cents a pint, and
labor so stooped and difficult that most workers are finished by
age 50.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW contends that it is hampered, after 16 years of strong
antiunion sentiment under two Republican governors, by deep
skepticism and lack of union experience among workers, most of them
Mexican immigrants, who are harassed by anti-union foremen and
fearful of losing their jobs. In the early and mid-90s, the UFW won
victories, only to have growers plow under their crops rather than
accept union representation.
</P>
<P>
   Growers counter that working conditions in the agricultural
industry have improved since Chavez began his organizing efforts
three decades ago. They say workers are better paid, more satisfied
and reluctant to surrender 2 percent of their wages to a union
whose glory days of solidarity are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is probably the biggest black eye that the UFW
has ever suffered in its history,'' said Rob Roy, president of the
Ventura County Agricultural Association, a grower group. ``With all
the money and the effort they've put into it, they had every
conceivable opportunity to win this election and they didn't. I
don't think they've won the hearts and the minds of the workers out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the timing of the election was set by the UFW,
apparently confident of victory, after it mustered petition cards
from 50 percent of the workers last week.
</P>
<P>
   But in secret-ballot voting in the fields on Tuesday and
Wednesday, the UFW received 577 votes, compared with 646 for the
Coastal Berry Farmworkers Committee. The UFW suggests that the
Farmworkers Committee was organized with the support of antiunion
foremen and backing from other growers _ an assertion the committee
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   There were 79 votes for no union, and 60 ballots not counted
because of eligibility challenges, most of them lodged by officials
of the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, who conducted the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The board's regional director now has 48 hours to resolve the
challenged ballots, but if neither side wins a majority of the
ballots cast and accepted, a runoff election will be held, within
seven days if possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Oxnard, in the coastal plain of Ventura County about 60 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, the UFW won a majority of 309 votes to
230 for the Farmworkers Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in Watsonville, 70 miles south of San Francisco on the
fertile central coast, where antiunion sentiment is stronger and
where an antiunion group attacked UFW supporters in the fields last
summer, the Farmworkers Committee won, with 416 votes to 268 for
the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW contends that the Farmworkers Committee has taken no
steps to organize its operations and has no proven experience in
representing workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the workers charged in the violence, Jose Guadalupe
Fernandez, became the first president of the Farmworkers Committee,
but he was later dismissed by the company and the presidency of the
group has yet to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   The group's lawyer, James Gumberg, said Thursday that the
challenged ballots alone might give the Farmworkers Committee an
outright victory, without a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think a runoff clearly favors the committee,'' Gumberg
said. ``I think what you're going to see is the UFW and the company
get together to do everything in their power to stall this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Coastal Berry is hardly hostile to the UFW. Its average
pay of $8.40 an hour is about $2 above the statewide average. Its
owners, a group led by a suburban Washington investor, David
Gladstone, bought Coastal Berry from the Monsanto Co., with the
support of the UFW and a bevy of Democratic politicians, including
Vice President Al Gore, on a pledge of neutrality to unionization.
The powerful Western Growers Association has actually accused
Coastal of excessive sympathy for the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate issue is just putting some finality on a long
organizing campaign,'' Coastal's president, Ernie Farley, said
Thursday. ``We've spent an awful lot of time managing this process
rather than managing our business, and now we're right in the
middle of the harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFW chose Coastal as the first big organizing target because
of the presumed sympathies of its new owners, and because it is the
industry's largest direct employer, producing 10 percent of the
national strawberry crop. But the union's real target is Driscoll's
Berries, a consortium that operates here and in Florida and
produces nearly one-third of the nation's strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   If the union had won this week, officials had hoped to begin a
public relations campaign urging consumers to buy Coastal's berries
_ and implicitly to boycott Driscoll's _ in an effort to bring
pressure on the rest of the industry. Now all such plans remain on
hold.

DEMOCRATS FORCING REPUBLICANS INTO DEFENSIVE POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the Capitol lawn Thursday, gleefully defiant
Democrats announced a petition drive to force the House to consider
a bill to regulate health maintenance organizations. In another
corner of Capitol Hill, Vice President Al Gore demanded that House
Republicans enact even more restrictions on guns than the Senate
reluctantly did.
</P>
<P>
   And at midday, the House left early for the Memorial Day recess
when Republicans could not gather the votes needed to start debate
on a $289 billion military bill they had planned as a showcase of
their support for strong national defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a grand partisan paroxysm on the eve of a Memorial
Day vacation. But the confluence of events did illustrate the
developing dynamic of a Republican-controlled Congress largely
shaped by a Democratic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, Republicans are taking a defensive stance.
They are trying to slow down Democratic initiatives, defuse other
popular issues long associated with the Democrats, or draft their
own, milder versions of Democratic bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear to me as though they have anything to put on
the agenda themselves,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ intentional or not _ is that this Congress so far
is looking more moderate than the Republican Congresses that came
before it. Republicans are taking some surprising stands, if only
because they are constantly being caught in an inactive or reactive
posture.
</P>
<P>
   So if gun control once was anathema to the Republicans, today
the party's senior leadership has endorsed some limited measures.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans once fought hard against increases in the minimum
wage, today some House Republicans are working to draft their own
plan for an increase in the minimum wage, coupled with a business
tax-cut package. Their goal is to keep the Democrats from gaining a
popular campaign issue with their call for a $1 increase in the
minimum wage over two years.
</P>
<P>
   And where the Republicans once wanted to abolish the Department
of Education, now they are rallying around some education spending
measures to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most adamant conservative Republican understands _
just like the most liberal Democrat _ that the country likes
moderate evolutionary changes,'' said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for this shift, ranging from the public
mood to the Republicans' small majority in the House and the
tactical skill of the Democratic minority. In part the times have
left the Republicans without their traditional issues: the economy
and the battles against communism, welfare and crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the extraordinary economy has dimmed the public's enthusiasm
for tax cuts. President Clinton took steps that cured his party's
vulnerability on welfare and crime. And until the air war against
Yugoslavia, the end of the Cold War had diminished public attention
to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the issues that have risen to the top of the public
agenda, like education, Social Security, Medicare and health care,
are ones that are historically more associated with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for the Republicans is that nearly all the issues
that hit home with the voters are issues the Democrats have
cultivated and built real credibility on,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a
Democratic pollster. ``The one possible exception is the
reemergence of foreign policy as an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Republicans have worked hard to try to neutralize these
issues. On Social Security, for example, they have backed away from
Republican legislation to remake the Social Security program into a
system of private investment accounts. Instead, they are intent on
trying to look more committed than the Democrats to protecting
Social Security tax receipts from being used for other programs or
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for the Republicans is that even if they wanted
to go on the offensive, their House majority is so small that it is
unlikely they can do so. The difficulty of doing anything in the
House when a five-vote shift can doom any legislation was on
display this week when Republicans lost control of the floor and
could not pass either an agriculture bill or a military measure.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Democrats have become skilled at pressing tactical
advantages. They outmaneuvered the Senate Republicans on gun
control, leaving some Republicans complaining that their leaders
need to do more than stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to get out on front of a number of these issues,''
said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``We know they are going to come
down the line, and we might as well do it in an orderly manner
instead of looking as though we're only reacting to negative
Democratic tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still far from clear whether Republican moderation means
that anything more will get done this year than in more ideological
years.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, even small differences on an issue can be
difficult to surmount. Take the minimum wage. If Republicans come
up with a package that provides only small increases and couples
them with large tax breaks, the Democrats could very well vote
against such a bill. On the other hand, conservative Republicans
would probably remain opposed to any increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats relish pointing to congressional inactivity. And
particularly in the House, there is a tension between those
Democrats who want to pass legislation and those who think they
would be better off running against a ``do-nothing Congress'' next
year.
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, even as they demanded action on legislation to
regulate health maintenance organizations, Democrats could not
resist ribbing the Republicans for their inactivity. Joked Rep.
Robert Andrews, D-N.J.: ``It's hard to tell whether we are in
recess or not.''

   THE SPIRIT OF YITZHAK RABIN. The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin
forced much of Israel to re-examine its humanity, to return to its
capacity to feel and speak from the heart, writes Bill Maxwell, New
America's African American columnist currently on assignment in
Israel. This re-found sentimentality, he noticed, was palpable at
Rabin Square last week, where, significantly, Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak spoke to cheering crowds. Unquestionably, Barak felt the
presence of Rabin's spirit. ``We are meeting here at this place of
memory,'' he said, ``and with hope, in order to embark on our
journey toward unity, peace, security and prosperity. I see myself
as continuing his path.''
</P>
<P>
   PROFILING: THE CRIME OF DRIVING WHILE HISPANIC (OR BLACK).
Profiling is an illegal practice, used by most police in America
for stopping motorists that appear to be criminals by the color of
their skin or their gender, notes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.
To legally pull people over, an officer must have ``probable
cause.'' That didn't stop the highway patrol nabbing Contreras on a
California interstate one night recently. For what? As it turned
out, for nothing _ other than Driving While Hispanic. ``Will it
ever stop?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   `INDIANS, HERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, ARE NOT GOING AWAY.' A
letter published recently in a South Dakota newspaper accuses:
``Even after countless payments for the Black Hills and other Sioux
benefit checks, we are tired of the `poor me' syndrome portrayed by
the Indians. No one else gets a free ride anymore.'' ``What this
writer, and others like him, do not understand,'' columnist Tim
Giago is quick to respond, ``is that our claims are based on
treaties the U.S. government signed with the Indian nations. And,
the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1980 that the Black Hills were
taken (from the Sioux tribes) illegally.'' The Sioux tribes, he
points out, have never been paid a single penny for them.
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING TRACK OF ANTI-GAY HATE. Hate crimes against gays _
violent attacks and other anti-gay incidents _ showed a ``modest
decline'' of 4 percent in 1998, according to a recent nationwide
study, reports columnist Chuck Colbert. But the bad news is that
the number of `serious' and `violent' anti-gay incidents rose
dramatically. ``This year's report indicates that the severity and
intensity of the violence toward lesbians, gay men, and people of
transgender experience has increased significantly since last
year,'' noted Clarence Patton Jr. of the New York City Gay and
Lesbian Anti-Violence Project.
</P>
<P>
   CASTANEDA CHARTS AN AMBITIOUS COURSE IN MIAMI. After nearly 25
years as editor-in-chief of Puerto Rico's El Nuevo Dia, Carlos
Castaneda has assumed the titles of publisher and editor of El
Nuevo Herald in Miami. His immediate goal for the newspaper? ``To
create a publication that's easy to read and visually oriented for
the TV generation,'' he told Tim Dougherty of Hispanic Business.
But, he added, ``the focus of our paper is not just Miami. To make
a great paper _ that is my great interest and my great challenge.''

THE SPIRIT OF YITZHAK RABIN
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He
is currently in Israel on special assignment. He can be reached on
the Internet at maxwell(at) sptimes.com) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TEL AVIV _ Israel's tough political and military veneer belies a
complex sentimentality that assumes many faces.
 &HT;    It was clearly evident in 1996, when Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu
was running for prime minister against Labor's Shimon Peres, who
took office after Yitzhak Rabin was murdered by religious fanatic
Yigal Amir.
 &HT;    Israel's future then was unclear mainly because Rabin and,
subsequently, Peres had earnestly pursued a policy of peace with
the Palestinians and had agreed to implement terms of the Oslo
accords. Netanyahu and his supporters, on the other side, had
declared war on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
 &HT;    Terrorists, furthermore, had done their job effectively _
frightening and angering most Israeli Jews, making them wary of
peace negotiations and, therefore, susceptible to the allure of
Netanyahu's ``peace with security'' campaign slogan.
 &HT;    Back in Israel again, I have witnessed Netanyahu's defeat, a
precipitous fall that is matched only by the prime minister's
meteoric rise to power.
 &HT;    On May 16, the day before what may go down as Israel's most
important election ever, I revisited the site of Rabin's murder.
Today, the entire city block, along with the government facility
there, is called Rabin Square _ a permanent shrine replacing the
crude, flower-strewn one I saw in 1966.
 &HT;    Studying the new monument, I believed Netanyahu had run against
the dead Rabin in 1996 and was running against Rabin's ghost again
in 1999 _ even though Rabin's name had been noticeably absent from
all public debate during Netanyahu's three years as prime minister.
 &HT;    I noticed, too, that the building and other structures in the
square were devoid of the campaign signage littering the rest of
the nation. Netanyahu's image, along with that of his opponent Ehud
Barak, was nowhere to be found. I suspected campaign bosses in both
camps decided that Rabin Square was special and that its dignity
must be maintained.
 &HT;    Netanyahu, of course, steered clear of Rabin Square, perhaps
fearing that he would hear voices from the past. But the victorious
Barak, along with tens of thousands of his supporters, reflecting
one side of Israel's sentimentality, came here shortly after his
opponent conceded defeat, to affirm his message of national
``unity.''
 &HT;    Like Netanyahu, Barak felt the presence of Rabin's spirit. ``We
are meeting here at this place of memory, and with hope, in order
to embark on our journey toward unity, peace, security and
prosperity of the people of Israel,'' he said to the cheering
crowd.
 &HT;    ``I came here to Rabin Square,'' he continued, ``to the place
where our hearts were broken when a stone blocked the gate just
when we were about to embark on a new era; I came to pledge to you,
citizens of Israel, to you, my friend and commander Yitzhak Rabin,
that this is indeed the dawn of a new day.''
 &HT;    The next day, with hordes of journalists from around the world
in tow, Barak visited the Western Wall, Israel's holiest site, and
Rabin's grave on Mount Herzl. Again, he revealed a sentimentality
that Israelis had quietly longed for during these times of ethnic,
religious, political and cultural fractiousness.
 &HT;    Speaking at Rabin's graveside, the prime minister-elect said of
his mentor: ``I see myself as continuing his path.''
 &HT;    The sentimental journey came full circle when, at Barak's side
at the square on election night, Leah Rabin, the late prime
minister's wife, held back tears. She said that the election
results gave her the first happy moments since ``that horrible
night,'' when her husband was slain.
 &HT;    ``I like Ehud Barak very much,'' she said. ``I trust him that he
will be following in the path that my husband was taking. He was
very close to my husband. My husband trusted him and loved him and
had great esteem and respect for him.''
 &HT;    ``Like,'' ``love,'' ``trust,'' ``very close,'' ``respect,''
``great esteem'' _ these are words that rarely surface in the
public sphere of Israeli politics. Now, however, they have been
spoken to international audiences.
 &HT;    The assassination of Rabin forced much of Israel to re-examine
its humanity, to return to its capacity to feel and speak from the
heart.

PROFILING: THE CRIME OF DRIVING WHILE HISPANIC (OR BLACK)
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I was standing like a gawking tourist, looking up at the
skyscrapers of Downtown Dallas. I was dressed in a suit, carrying a
brief case, wearing dark glasses, as Californians are wont to do
and looking forward to the air conditioning inside the office I was
expected in shortly.
 &HT;    The policeman ordered me to lean forward and place my hands on a
building wall. He kicked my legs apart, then promptly and rudely
frisked me. His partner took my wallet, looked in it and counted
two hundred dollars. I was arrested and booked into jail. My crime,
violation of Texas law: Possession of money by a Mexican.
 &HT;    I woke up startled. My dream _ really a nightmare _ was just
that, a dream.
 &HT;    What wasn't a dream, however, was my getting on the I-15 in
suburban Escondido heading south to San Diego shortly after 10:00
p.m. one night recently. Turning onto the on-ramp right behind me
was a California Highway Patrol car. About two miles down the road,
his lights started flashing and I pulled over and stopped. I kept
both hands on the steering wheel, as taught by police officer
friends wary of trigger-happy cops.
 &HT;    The highway patrolman came to the passenger side, asked me if
there was something wrong with my car, for it seemed, he said, to
be weaving from side to side. He shined his flashlight on my hands
_ still on the steering wheel _ and throughout the car while asking
me the question.
 &HT;    No, I replied, nothing was wrong. I hadn't noticed my car
weaving on the freeway. He shined the light in my face and told me
to have the car checked. He walked back to his car. I drove off. I
hadn't noticed my car weaving, because it wasn't.
 &HT;    I had just been ``profiled.''
 &HT;    Profiling is a method used by police everywhere in the country
to pull people over on no other basis than gender, race or
ethnicity. To legally pull people over, an officer must witness a
traffic violation, or crime, or have a specific description and
notice that the suspect car has been stolen or involved in a crime.
In other words, an officer must have ``probable cause'' to stop
someone. Profiling is illegal.
 &HT;    As to whether or not profiling actually does go on everywhere,
the state of New Jersey is a case in point. Complaints by black and
Hispanic drivers in New Jersey drew heated denials by the state
police chief. However, a court ordered study conclusively proved
that blacks and Hispanics were stopped in far higher proportions
than their percentage of total drives along interstate highways.
Racial profiling was rampant along the interstates of New Jersey.
The culprits? Troopers under the command of the man denying it
happened at all. New Jersey Governor Christy Todd Whitman, fired
the chief.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, the chief of police states that most profiling
stops are actually done by minority officers on their own people.
The chief, himself, is black. The chief is in denial.
 &HT;    Police officers ignore probable cause and use profiling to stop
people, particularly single males at night _ because they may be
driving under the influence, and black men _ because they may be
drug runners, drug sellers, drug addicts, criminals and/or, simply
because they are black. This has come to be known as ``DWB'' _
Driving While Black. The same is true of ``Hispanic-looking''
males, who have the added burden of being stopped by Border Patrol
officers for the crime of looking Hispanic.
 &HT;    In Arizona, two separate class action lawsuits are working their
way through the courts. One suit alleges that Border Patrol agents
arbitrarily stop cars with Hispanic looking drivers or passengers.
The other suit alleges that Border Patrol officers stop all cars at
night on certain roads but only detain Hispanic looking drivers or
passengers for questioning.
 &HT;    The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly ordered the
Border Patrol to cease stopping people on the basis of skin color
and ethnicity alone. The Court recently ruled that ethnicity could
be one of several factors, but not the only factor.
 &HT;    Let's see: I was a single male driving an expensive car at
night. Did the patrolman know I was of a `minority' persuasion? No,
he couldn't have, for he wasn't close enough to see me, nor was
there any light. Did he know that I might have just left a bar? No,
but he was curious enough to illegally stop me. Was the car
reported stolen, or used in a crime? No, and he knew that because
he would have radioed in for an instantaneous computer check of my
license plate. Given that the car wasn't stolen, why did he stop
me?
 &HT;    He profiled me. How many times does this happen every day in the
United States? How many state troopers, highway patrolmen, county
sheriff's deputies and city police in Everytown, USA, rise from
their boring routines, to pull over a black lawyer, or teacher, or
police officer for the crime of DWB? Near our southern border, how
many men get pulled over because they are Hispanic looking? As for
the Border Patrol, forget them, that's all they do.
 &HT;    Will it ever stop?

 `INDIANS, HERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, ARE NOT GOING AWAY.'
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is CEO of book publishers Lakota
Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian
name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service  &HT;    A letter published recently in the Sioux Falls (S. D.) Argus
Leader demands an answer and an explanation.
 &HT;    The letter stated: ``Even after countless payments for the Black
Hills and other Sioux benefit checks, we are tired of the `poor me'
syndrome portrayed by the Indians. My suggestion is to do away with
the reservations as an out-dated concept and incorporate the
Indians into the 21st century. No one else gets a free ride
anymore.''
 &HT;    The writer added, ``Other minorities have been dumped on just as
bad as the Indians. Blacks as slaves, Chinese with the building of
the railroads and the Mexicans losing land in the southwest states.
But you don't see them always looking for a handout. They ask for
equality instead.''
 &HT;    Let me respond by declaring that the Sioux tribes have never
been paid a single penny for the theft of the Black Hills. The
Black Hills were taken illegally according to a ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court in a 1980 decision. Aside from the Black Hills, more
than 50 million acres were taken either through treaty or by theft
from the Sioux Nation since the signing of the Fort Laramie Treaty
of 1868.
 &HT;    The treaty clearly spelled out that the Sioux Tribes would be
paid for the land by the government by providing health care and
educational benefits. That treaty is still in effect. The Indian
health services and other benefits are not free. They were paid for
by millions of acres of prime real estate taken by the American
government. Other lands were simply stolen. The meager funds the
tribes receive for health and education are not charity. They are
paltry payments for lands surrendered or stolen.
 &HT;    The Sioux Nation, as all other Indian nations, has one thing
that the Chinese, African-Americans and the Mexicans did not have.
The Indian nations had legal treaties signed between themselves as
sovereign nations with the government of the United States. They
also live on lands with clearly defined borders and boundaries over
which most state governments have no jurisdiction.
 &HT;    The writer of this letter would have us believe that Indians are
funded from cradle to grave. If that is so why were three counties
in South Dakota, all upon Indian lands, declared the three poorest
counties in the United States in the 1990 census? They sure aren't
benefiting from this ``free ride.''
 &HT;    The United States government has been trying to ``do away'' with
the Indian reservations for 200 years. Who does the writer believe
suffers most from these efforts? Certainly not the non-Indian.
 &HT;    Let me bury another myth here. Indians pay federal income taxes.
They pay a sales tax every time they purchase a car, appliance,
clothing or food off the reservation. They pay this sales tax even
though not a single penny of it is used for their benefit. It all
goes into the state coffers. When they register their cars or put
license plates on them, they pay a state imposed tax. They pay all
of the taxes other citizens of the United States pay except taxes
on their land on their respective reservations. The tribal
governments have the right to impose taxes on reservation lands
should they choose to do so. They also have the right to
manufacture their own vehicle license plates should they choose to
do so.
 &HT;    The Indian nations of America have been upon this land for
thousands of years. We are not going away. The best thing that can
happen is that we learn to live with the non-Indians and have
respect for each other.
 &HT;    Letters such as this one only aggravate the situation.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hate crimes against gays _ violent attacks and other anti-gay
incidents _ showed a ``modest decline'' of 4 percent in 1998,
according to a nationwide study released earlier this month by the
National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), a voluntary
network of 26 community-based organizations and programs that
monitor and respond to anti-gay violence.
 &HT;    Among the study's sixteen local summaries, the total number of
incidents dropped from 2,665 in 1997 to 2,252 in 1998. Those
summaries included 12 cities _ Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, El
Paso, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, Orlando, Providence, St.
Louis, San Diego, and San Francisco _ three states _ Colorado,
Massachusetts, and Minnesota _ and the Central Coast region of
California.
 &HT;    That's the good news from the NCAVP's fifth annual report.
 &HT;    The bad news is that the number of serious and violent anti-gay
incidents rose dramatically. ``This year's report indicates that
the severity and intensity of the violence toward lesbians, gay
men, and people of transgender experience has increased
significantly since last year,'' said Clarence Patton Jr. of the
New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project in an
Associated Press story.
 &HT;    For example, the number of anti-gay murders more than doubled,
from 14 in 1997 to 33 in 1998. By contrast the nation's overall
murder rate has dropped to the lowest level in decades.
 &HT;    Serious assaults on gays in which victims sustained broken bones
and other major injuries rose by 12 percent, while the number of
assaults generally dropped by 11 percent. Moreover, reported victim
inpatient hospitalization rose by a whopping 108 percent.
 &HT;    The study also shows assaults and attempted assaults with guns
used against gays and lesbians rose 71 percent from 1997 to 1998;
the use of bats, clubs, and blunt objects by 47 percent; vehicles
by 150 percent; ropes and restraints by 133 percent; and knives and
sharp objects by 13 percent.
 &HT;    ``What this (trend) may be indicating is that perpetrators are
getting bolder; ... their actions are becoming more premeditated
since ... you have to make a decision to leave your house with a
baseball bat,'' Richard Haymes, executive director of the New York
anti-violence project, told the Associated Press.
 &HT;    Still, the speculation and statistics tell only part of the
story. ``As horrible as these statistics are, they don't tell us
about the bloodied and bruised faces behind the numbers,'' said
Dave Shannon, senior advocate for the Violence Recovery Program, at
the Boston-based Fenway Community Health Center.
 &HT;    But the numerous incident narratives of the victims'
experiences, also contained in the anti-violence study, do tell
that story. For example:
 &HT;    _In Massachusetts, an assailant attacked a 46-year-old gay man
he had met on America Online. The attacker punched the victim in
the face, kicked him to the ground, and beat him. During the
beating the assailant and a cohort called the gay man ``fag'' and
``queer.'' They also taunted, ``I bet this wasn't what you were
planning on, fag.'' The victim suffered cuts on his face and
bruises across his entire body; he also required stitches in his
lip.
 &HT;    _Two young, twenty-something men assaulted a gay man in his late
30s while he was roller-blading in a residential section of
Houston. The assailants called him ``fag'' and ``queer.'' The
victim lost an eye as a result of the attack. He said later, ``My
injury was so bad, sometimes I wished they had just killed me. But
I feel they didn't want me to die ... like living with only one eye
would be a constant reminder of the attack and control they had
over me.''
 &HT;    The release of the fifth annual anti-gay and lesbian violence
study came on the day after a man pleaded guilty to the slaying
last fall of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming.
Ironically, the study did not include the high-profile murder of
Shepard because no agency or system tracks such crimes in that
state.
 &HT;    For that matter, of the 40 states that have hate crime laws,
only 21 cover sexual orientation. While there is federal hate
crimes legislation, it only covers race, color, religion, and
national origin. Last year the Hate Crimes Prevention Act _ a bill
that would expand existing federal legislation to include gender,
sexual orientation, and disability _ died in committee in the House
and Senate. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has reintroduced the
bill, and the president endorsed their efforts the same day as the
release of the anti-violence study.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about whether people have a right ... to pursue
their lives and dignity ... free of fear, without fear of being
abused,'' Clinton said.
 &HT;    Let us hope that the anti-violence study and the brutal murders
of Matthew Shepard and Billy Jack Gaither encourage Congress to do
something _ pass this much needed federal legislation.

 c. 1999 Hispanic Business 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After nearly 25 years as editor-in-chief of Puerto Rico's El
Nuevo Dia, Carlos Castaneda has assumed the titles of publisher and
editor of El Nuevo Herald in Miami.
 &HT;    First published in 1988, El Nuevo Herald served as the
Spanish-language insert of the Miami Herald until last year. The
two publications are now distributed separately.
 &HT;    A Cuba native, Castaneda has distinguished himself as a
journalist and consultant in the United States and throughout Latin
America over the past four decades. Recently, he discussed his
plans for El Nuevo Herald with HISPANIC BUSINESS.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q. What are your goals for El Nuevo Herald?
 &HT;    A. To create a publication that's easy to read and visually
oriented for the TV generation. We've already redesigned the
newspaper, both cosmetically and in terms of content to provide
more news and better local coverage. We've added sports pages
because we believe society's heroes are most often athletes and
television personalities, at least when we're fortunate enough not
to be at war. And we've begun a Sunday section devoted to cultural
developments, complete with book reviews and art criticism. I'm
also determined to minimize jumps, given that 70 percent of them
are never read. Therefore, we have just one jump, from page 1 to 2.
Everything else starts and ends on the first page.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q. What are the main challenges confronting your newspaper?
 &HT;    A. We are becoming increasingly independent from the Miami
Herald, a process begun last year. In the past, the two papers were
packaged together, but now they're sold separately. This year, for
the first time, we are going to have a circulation manager
reporting directly to El Nuevo Herald, and we expect to see a
corresponding increase in circulation. In addition, we are looking
for an advertising manager who is responsive to the tremendous
possibilities of the Hispanic market in Miami. We are home to the
third-largest Hispanic market in the country, and it's an educated,
affluent community. More than 40 percent of Hispanics in the Miami
area have attended college or earned a degree, and 56 percent are
homeowners.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q. You're credited with dramatically increasing the circulation
of El Nuevo Dia. Do you see similar growth opportunities at El
Nuevo Herald?
 &HT;    A. Miami is a smaller market but I think El Nuevo Herald has
great potential. Without having made a market study, my feeling is
that we should be selling 130,000 copies daily in a few years. We
now sell about 88,000 on Sundays and 83,000 daily. I'm now
concentrating on improving the editorial product, which should help
the circulation cause. Sometime soon we'll have audit figures. With
the new product in hand we expect to boost circulation
significantly.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q. Is the future bright for publications that serve Hispanics?
 &HT;    A. It's a broad question because there is no single Hispanic
market. The one in South Florida is distinct from the one on the
West Coast, for example. But I think Miami has great potential in
this respect. Miami is and will continue to be a link to Latin
America, including Cuba. In fact, the Cubans call Miami Havana
North, meaning many of them will remain here and others will come
regardless of what happens in their native country. Miami has the
potential to be a great center for commerce and business in
relation to Cuba of the future.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q. You've been quoted as saying that you'd like to make El Nuevo
Herald the hemisphere's most important newspaper within two years.
What did you mean?
 &HT;    A. Miami is a focal point for Latin America. The number of Latin
Americans who come here is impressive, and they come because they
feel at home.
 &HT;    But many South Americans also feel that we should provide a type
of International Herald Tribune, something published here but also
sold throughout the region, featuring a general view of what is
happening in the world.
 &HT;    For that we have to make enormous changes. First, we're going to
develop a network of stringers (freelance reporters) to provide
better coverage of Latin America.
 &HT;    We already have a daily section that provides several pages of
such news. And we've begun sending people to where the main news is
being developed. We had somebody in Colombia for the meeting of the
president and the guerrillas, and we just came back from Cuba for
the anniversary of the Pope's visit.
 &HT;    This is the type of material that I would like future readers to
expect to find in El Nuevo Herald, stories that South Americans
would like to read as well.
 &HT;    The focus of our paper is not just Miami. To make a great paper
_ that is my great interest and my great challenge.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Publicly, the Clinton administration has applauded
the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic, a move that would appear to
change the Yugoslav president's status from potential deal maker to
an off-bounds pariah.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, administration officials say that the indictment
by the International Criminal Tribunal is likely to cripple their
efforts to find a diplomatic solution through the Russian envoy,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, and the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment on charges of crimes against humanity has
significantly diminished the hopes of using Ahtisaari as a
go-between who could win Milosevic's acquiescence in a settlement.
Viewed in recent weeks as the most likely candidate to succeed in
negotiations, Ahtisaari would now be extremely reluctant to go to
Belgrade to deal with an indicted war criminal, one colleague said.
</P>
<P>
   And one official described the track with Chernomyrdin as
``pretty shaky,'' a sentiment that seemed to be reflected by others
in the administration who believe the Russian efforts may have
mostly run their course.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more troubling for a White House that has been trying to
avoid the use of troops, the indictment, by complicating the
diplomatic prospects, will enhance the arguments of those in favor
of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   British officials were quick to point out Thursday that the
indictment forestalled the likelihood of cutting what they called a
shabby deal with Milosevic. ``We think it might be helpful in
stiffening their spine,'' a British official said of the
indictment's effect on the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said that with news of the
indictment, he called President Clinton in Florida and urged him
that this was the time to send extra U.S. troops that have been
pledged for the international security force.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the choice of sending ground troops into a
``non-permissive'' environment in Kosovo or of dealing with
Milosevic on the fine points of a settlement, the administration
was likely to go for the latter unsavory but practical choice.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's initial reaction on Wednesday to word of
the indictment was that it would not preclude direct negotiations
with the Yugoslav leader, but officials acknowledged the
awkwardness of negotiating with a man who has been indicted on war
crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Thursday that the White House was
not ruling out the possibility that a diplomatic solution could be
reached with an intermediary at a point much farther down the line.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was notified on Tuesday of the indictment by
Louise Arbour, the war crimes prosecutor at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lead time the administration was handed by Ms. Arbour,
there was time for officials to figure out the landscape ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But except for the consensus that the indictment made diplomacy
more complicated, there was no cohesive judgment on what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, said it was conceivable that
Milosevic would take his country down with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 question is Milosevic's reaction and whether this
drives him into a fatalistic mode,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official, with less experience in
the Balkans, said he believed that the indictment would weaken
Milosevic among his people.
</P>
<P>
   This could make Milosevic more susceptible to diplomatic
pressure, as well as military pressure, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision ``deepens his isolation, weakens him, makes
him very uncertain about his situation,'' this official said. ``He
has to shore up his strength, and he can't by taking an
intransigent position. If he takes a crazed extremist view, he'll
be all alone pretty soon,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   With Milosevic increasingly isolated among his people, NATO's
air campaign, plus the decision to begin to deploy troops for the
international security force, would have far greater potential for
forcing the Yugoslav leader to cave to NATO's demands, according to
this reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Biden, who met with the national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
on Thursday, also said it was possible that the indictment had the
``potential of further isolating Milosevic within Serbia'' and
causing further discontent there.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator, who met with Milosevic in Belgrade in 1993 and
called him a ``war criminal'' to his face, said that he ``wouldn't
bet the farm'' on his being so isolated among the Serbs that he
would be forced to seek an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Although the timing of the indictment was awkward, Biden said it
carried the ``good news of verifying what NATO is doing.'
</P>
<P>
   The British government, which since the beginning of the air
campaign has been much stronger in painting Milosevic as a man not
to be dealt with, seemed to take great pleasure in Ms. Arbour's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track with Chernomyrdin was an uncertain bet, a
senior British official said, because Chernomyrdin seemed uncertain
in his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Chernomyrdin was trying to do a deal with a man incapable
of delivering,'' he said in reference to Milosevic. ``This pushes
the equation forward on troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration was taken somewhat by surprise that
Milosevic's right-hand man, Milan Milutinovic, the president of
Serbia, was also indicted. From a negotiating point of view, this
vastly complicated the picture, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Milutinovic meant that the administration and
NATO had no real replacement with authority with whom to make a
final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being considered by some senior administration
officials was the effect the indictment would have on Milosevic's
wealthy inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have criticized Milosevic publicly is Bogoljub
Karic, who runs television stations and owns a bank.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some ways to persuade pals of Milosevic, like
Karic, that it would not be helpful to their future to stick with
the regime, one official said. ``Mr. Karic could be reminded of the
Nuremberg example _ where industrialists were considered class A
war criminals,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing appeared fairly clear. The indictment made it
immensely difficult to do a diplomatic deal with Milosevic, for the
simple reason that to do so would undermine the authority of the
war crimes tribunal, the very body to which the Clinton
administration and the British government provided intelligence
information for use in formulating the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   And from Milosevic's point of view, the most obvious maneuver
would be to request immunity from prosecution before making any
settlement arrangements, an impossible scenario for the West to
consider.

MILITARY SPENDING BILL CLEARS SENATE HURDLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Thursday night easily passed a $289
billion military authorization bill that tightens security at the
nation's weapons laboratories. But the House, faced with a nearly
identical bill, collapsed into chaos and abruptly adjourned for the
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with furious partisan bickering, Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, realizing that the Republican majority did not have the
necessary 218 votes to bring the bill to the floor, shut down the
House and sent its members home.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders blamed Democrats for blocking the bill.
The Democrats, in turn, said conservative Republicans had bolted
from their leaders over a provision barring funds for ground troops
in combat or peacekeeping in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That measure was deleted overnight by the Republicans at the
insistence of the White House, which threatened late Wednesday to
veto the entire military spending bill over the provision. That
move, in turn, infuriated conservative Republicans who wanted to
debate the issue of ground troops on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost part of their right wing, the Republicans needed
votes from the Democrats to bring up the bill. But Democratic blocs
also walked away after the Republicans refused to consider
amendments to support steps by the Clinton administration to step
up security at the weapons laboratories, cut the number of American
forces in Europe and set aside contracts for minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that partisanship stopped at the water's edge,''
sighed Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., on the House Armed Services
Committee. But partisanship compounded by ideological divisions
among the Republicans approached a high water mark this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was halted ``due to Democrat opposition,'' said Rep.
David Dreier, R-Calif. Dreier, chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said the opposition surfaced Thursday ``despite the
assurances provided last night by the Democrat leadership and the
president's staff'' that most Democrats would support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, called Dreier's
explanation ``an excuse for ineptitude.'' The minority leader,
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said, ``Every time the Republican
leadership finds itself unable to beat back the extreme right wing
within their own party, they blame the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The military authorization bill was the fourth major spending
bill Hastert had scheduled over the past three days that the House
Republicans were unable to move, due in large part to dissent
between their right wing and their moderates.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the military measure faced a far smoother path,
winning passage by a 92 to 3 vote Thursday night. It would
authorize $288.8 billion in military spending for next year, $8.3
billion more than the White House and the Pentagon sought.
</P>
<P>
   The measure includes $89 billion for new weapons, including $3.7
billion for various missile defense programs. It also includes a
4.8 percent raise for military personnel and blocks the military
from closing bases over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to reports of Chinese espionage aimed at the nation's
nuclear weapons laboratories, the Senate added provisions intended
to plug any leaks from the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved, by a voice vote, measures inspired by this
week's House report on China's acquisition of American military
technology. They are intended to ``change the mindset at the
Department of Energy,'' which oversees the weapons labs said Sen.
Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   They would tighten export controls on high-tech items, require
the Central Intelligence Agency to review applications for overseas
launches of American satellites, monitor Chinese rocket launches
and expand American launch capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to take a look at reorganizing the way the
Department of Energy as a whole operates,'' said the majority
leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi. ``We need to look at some
way to reimpose the export administration regime. There's got to be
some balance between commercial desire, trade and national
security.''

2 WOMEN AND LAWYER ACCUSED OF RUNNING BABY-SMUGGLING RING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y., _ Federal prosecutors on Thursday accused two
Long Island women and a prominent lawyer on the Arizona-Mexico
border of running a baby-smuggling ring in which at least 17
Mexican infants were illegally sold to unwitting adoptive parents
in the New York area for $20,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, the Long Island women, Arlene
Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, lured desperate would-be parents
with promises of safe, easy, legal adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the adoptions turned out to be anything but legal,
prosecutors say. The lawyer, Mario Reyes, forged birth certificates
and consent forms, bribed Mexican officials to look the other way,
and still ultimately failed to receive the necessary approvals from
U.S. immigration officials, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
said on Thursday that the children would be allowed to remain with
their adoptive parents and that the government would work to
legalize their status.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lieberman, 48, and Ms. Reingold, 46, who live a few doors
from one another in a middle-class neighborhood in Medford, in
Suffolk County, were arrested on Thursday morning at their homes,
according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of
New York. Reyes, 40, a dual citizen who practices law in Agua
Prieta, Mexico, less than 100 feet from the border with Douglas,
Ariz., was arrested at his home in Douglas on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three are charged with conspiring to violate various
immigration laws and to commit mail and wire fraud. They face
maximum prison sentences of up to 10 years for each child smuggled
into the United States. Their lawyers could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not yet determined whether the 17 children
brought through Agua Prieta, one of the chief smuggling points
along the Mexican border, were stolen from their families, turned
over for adoption voluntarily or sold by one or both of their
parents. Selling children is a crime in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mexican border region may have been the source for
some of the children. Clustered around border towns are dozens of
assembly plants, called maquiladoras. Most of the workers in these
plants are young, single Mexican women. And recent investigation by
the U.S. Department found that some plants actively discourage
their employees from having children, routinely subject women
applicants to pregnancy tests and deny them jobs if the tests are
positive.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Elliot Spitzer filed a civil lawsuit on
Thursday against Reyes, the two women and their husbands, and their
company, International Adoption Consultants, seeking to permanently
bar them from the business of adoption placements.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state court papers assert that Ms. Lieberman and Ms.
Reingold went into business in 1990 under the name Stork
International, ostensibly to provide information and referrals
only. But after state officials received repeated complaints that
they were running an unlicensed adoption agency, the two formed a
second company, Adoption Choice, in 1992, and then a third,
International Adoption Consultants, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were never licensed as adoption agencies, yet
prosecutors say they continued to place place children with
adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Reingold have assisted in more than 500
international adoptions since 1990, according to a 66-page
affidavit released by the U.S. attorney's office. Not all of the
children adopted through the agencies were smuggled, however.
</P>
<P>
   Before making contact with Reyes and focusing on Mexican
children, the two women brokered adoptions of children from
Guatemala, Paraguay and other countries, in accordance with
Immigration and Naturalization Service rules, the federal court
papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Only the placements of the 17 babies smuggled from Mexico are
under federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, according to the federal affidavit, the three
charged would-be parents as much as $22,000, plus thousands more in
consulting fees, travel and translation expenses.
</P>
<P>
   One parent told investigators that he had asked for a reduction
in the fee, but was told by one of the women that Reyes had
responded: ``I am not Monty Hall and this is not `Let's Make a
Deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   The federal affidavit paints the two Long Island women in no
less callous terms. Another parent attempting to adopt a baby
recounted how the girl had arrived in New York gravely ill, the
apparent victim of sexual abuse: ``Her eyes did not focus, she
smelled terribly, her stomach was markedly distended and she
appeared to have no neck,'' she said, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl's behavior was also troubling: she licked the walls
and woke up from sleep screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The distraught adoptive parent called Ms. Reingold, ``who said
that there was nothing wrong with the girl: all she needed was a
little love and good food,'' the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the adoptive parents, who the authorities say were
duped by the three defendants, said they had been emotionally
devastated by the experience. Rosalie Liberto, who adopted a
daughter, Gabriel, in July 1997, said she did not learn that her
daughter, now 5{, had entered the country illegally until nearly a
year later. ``We about died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were petrified that the government would take her away from
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thorne, a spokesman for the INS, said the agency had ``no
intention of removing the children who are innocent victims and who
were sold to the defendants. We will work with the United States
attorney's office and the individual attorneys of parents involved
to see that these children's status is legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   But other parents said they remained fearful that the true
origins of their adopted children could change things _ if it
turned out that they had been kidnaped, for example. ``Our biggest
fear is that something's going to happen to make us lose her,''
said Sara Kruchkow, 46, of Queens, over the telephone on Thursday
night as her daughter Maria Soledad, now 3, murmured to her in the
background.

SERBS DISMISS INDICTMENT AS JUST ANOTHER ENEMY TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav government scornfully
dismissed the indictment Thursday of President Slobodan Milosevic
and four other top leaders on war crime charges and repeated its
desire to solve the conflict in Kosovo through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a Yugoslav minister without portfolio, called the
indictment a political event directed by Washington and designed to
step up pressure on the Belgrade government to agree to a less
favorable deal over Kosovo. He said the tribunal had no standing to
indict the officials because his country was not engaged in war,
but in an internal police action.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Belgrade was concentrating on the visit
planned for Friday by the Russian peace envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who will be bringing a more detailed draft of a possible settlement
to end the war. In an interview, Matic said he hoped that NATO
remained serious about negotiating a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Matic accused Washington officials of using the international
war crimes tribunal in The Hague to go after those who disagreed
with them. ``The Hague tribunal belongs to the sort of inquisition
used by the U.S. to annul sovereignty and legal order in other
countries which they dislike,'' he said at an earlier news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they cannot kill them when they hit their residences, they
can ask for their exclusion from the international community in the
countries which they control via NATO,'' he said. He was referring
to a NATO missile that hit Milosevic's bedroom last month, two
nights after he had last slept there.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic himself made no comment on the indictment, nor would
he, said senior Yugoslav officials. He met the former Greek prime
minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, who said Milosevic seemed
unruffled by the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared that he did not care,'' Mitsotakis said. ``I
believe that this decision will strengthen his position in the same
way that the NATO bombings did.''
</P>
<P>
   In an official statement issued by the state news agency,
Tanjug, the indictment was called ``just another way of stopping
diplomatic attempts to solve the crisis through peaceful political
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, as
``a puppet in the hands of the masters of war,'' the statement
called the indictment ``another attempt to mislead the world
community in order to conceal who is really responsible for the
genocide against the Yugoslav people.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic told Tanjug that Yugoslavia wanted peace, ``which
means an early solution of problems should be transferred from the
military to the political sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mitsotakis insisted that ``the Yugoslav leadership is ready
to take a constructive approach to the proposals of NATO and the
international community that are going to be presented'' by
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still problems, but the Yugoslav leadership is ready
to contribute for their solution,'' he said. ``NATO must contribute
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   There were few details available here of what proposals
Chernomyrdin might be bringing as a result of his discussions in
Russia with the deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, who flew
on to Bonn, Germany, with the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   But the makeup of an international force to police a Kosovo
settlement is a key issue, and Chernomyrdin is said to be
concentrating on non-American troops, like German and Italian ones,
as the core of a NATO contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The official state radio and television led their broadcasts
with the Mitsotakis visit, showing Milosevic appearing confident
and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was given broad coverage, though the
concentration was on Russian, Greek, Chinese and other criticism of
its validity and timing. There was also a series of interviews with
ordinary, unnamed Serbs on the street, who generally said that the
indictment would backfire against NATO, that Milosevic represented
the country and that he should pay no attention to what the
``aggressors'' did.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday evening, NATO strikes again took out electricity
in Belgrade, another attack on essentially civilian services that
most people here regard as a cruel and inhumane form of collective
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Even Serbia's democratic opposition parties were critical
Thursday of the timing of the indictment, suggesting that it put
Milosevic into a corner and would reduce his willingness to make a
serious compromise for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Democratic Party, Slobodan Vuksanovic,
called the indictment ``a disaster for democrats and for the nation
in general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a signal sent by the international community
and NATO that they don't want to stop the attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vuksanovic said: ``There was hope yesterday. Today there is not.
We think the accusation from The Hague comes at the wrong moment.''
</P>
<P>
   His party is led by Zoran Djindjic, who has fled to Serbia's
sister republic, Montenegro, where he said the most important
priority was to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday if any Serb believed that Ms. Arbour and the
international tribunal were acting independently of NATO and
Washington, Matic, the Yugoslav minister, said: ``Maybe Zoran
Djindjic. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Serbian Civic Alliance of opposition
parties, Goran Svilanovic, accurately predicted that the state-run
media would portray the indictment as an attack on the Serbian
people, not on Milosevic and the government, and said it would
further strengthen the president's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksa Djilas, a historian, said it would be better for all
concerned if Milosevic ``dies a peaceful death in his bed.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO kills him ``or puts him on trial in The Hague, he will
be a martyr and a hero to most Serbs,'' Djilas said. ``And he will
then in this way rule Serbia from his grave or from his prison
cell.''
</P>
<P>
   One Serbian analyst who requested anonymity saw the indictment
as an invitation to a coup against Milosevic, but then pointed out
that anyone in a position to mount such a coup had also been
indicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In general, ordinary Serbs regard the actions of their security
forces in Kosovo as a war against the insurgent Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting to separate the Serbian province and make
it independent. They consider the expulsion or flight of ethnic
Albanians to be a regrettable aspect of that war against a popular,
village-based insurgency. And they consider a large part of the
charges by NATO and the tribunal to be unproved or propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Dacic, the spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist Party, said
that Yugoslavs and Milosevic were simply defending their country
against outside aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precedent in world history,'' he said, ``when
someone defending his country is accused of war crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dacic called the indictments ``just a show directed by NATO
criminals who are trying to throw dust into the eyes of their
publics and the world in order to hide their own crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Belgrade's position on a settlement remains the same, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the continuation of the political process, with the
aim to find a peaceful solution through diplomatic means on the
principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and
Yugoslavia, and equal status for all national communities in
Kosovo.''

YUGOSLAV ARMY AGAIN SHELLS VILLAGES IN NORTHEAST ALBANIA

<P>
   KRUME, Albania _ For the second day, Yugoslav forces shelled
villages in northeast Albania Thursday, heightening tensions along
the main crossing point for refugees fleeing from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rasim Sheta, 52, a relative of the two people killed in the
attacks in Cahani on Wednesday, stood beside two fresh graves in a
small cemetery here and said that Albanians would be forced to
fight back if the shelling continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all ready to fight,'' he said. ``We won't allow the
Serbs to attack our villages or get inside our land. We know that
we must keep cool, but we have to defend our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he spoke, gunfire rattled around the hills, and Sheta
looked up to see a huge black explosion rise from an Albanian
village on a nearby hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two shells landed at the house of his cousin, Musa
Cahani, 59, killing him and his daughter, Merita, 20. The family
could find only the daughter's leg and hand but buried them all the
same in a grave next to her father.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning Thursday, the sound of gunfire and
shelling echoed around the border post of Morini, where 606
Albanian refugees from Kosovo nonetheless had crossed by late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   During one attack around 10 a.m., a sound engineer from Chile _
one in the pack of journalists who wait by the border for refugees
to cross _ was shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the 30-year-old engineer, whose name was
not released, was in a coma and being transported to Italy for
medical treatment. Other reporters said he had arrived only the day
before and was working on a documentary about war correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there was this whistling and this guy hit the
ground,'' said David Guttenfelder, a photographer with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He had been standing on a rise in line with a Yugoslav army
bunker several hundred yards away, and it was unclear if he had
been hit by stray gunfire or was shot intentionally by snipers from
the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The border area buzzed with military activity as Albanian tanks
and trucks, some manned by soldiers in camouflage, moved between
Morini and Kukes, the main town where the refugees are staying,
some 10 miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   The activity was in preparation for Albanian military exercises
planned for Friday, in which tanks and artillery will fire live
ammunition into the hills along the border.
</P>
<P>
   First Capt. Albert Mullai, spokesman for the Albanian military,
said the exercises had been planned before this recent spike in
tension along the border. But he said the maneuvers would
nonetheless demonstrate to the Yugoslav army across the border the
capacity of Albanian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of show of force,'' Mullai said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it would only complicate the job of NATO, Albanian
officials say they do not intend to get involved militarily in the
conflict in Kosovo despite almost daily incursions of Yugoslav
forces into Albanian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks have come in areas with a heavy presence of
ethnic Albanian fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, the rebels and Yugoslav soldiers have
been fighting just across from the Morini border post, in what
rebel leaders say is a major offensive on their part to open a
route from Albania into the heart of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But some of that fighting has spilled over the border. Thursday,
Yugoslav forces shelled Cahani and Kishaj, said Andrea Angeli, a
spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. The two villages were among four shelled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse at the hospital here, Hate Kadriaj, 35, said the attacks
in this area had increased since NATO began bombing Serbia and
Serbian positions in Kosovo on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of the people who treated Cahani, who had been hit
while drinking coffee on his front porch and while his daughter
tended to the family's cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has now started in this region,'' she said. ``It is a
very tense situation.''

PROSECUTORS FINISH CASE AGAINST REMAINING OFFICERS IN TORTURE
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prosecution wrapped up its case Thursday against
the four police officers still on trial in the Abner Louima
brutality case, but without presenting the kind of directly
incriminating evidence that it did against Officer Justin Volpe,
who pleaded guilty in mid-trial this week and threw himself on the
mercy of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The case appears to be speeding toward a quick conclusion. After
the prosecution rested, just two days after Volpe pleaded guilty to
all the charges against him, the defense case began _ and quickly
ended for two of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Officer Thomas Bruder called no witnesses and
Officer Charles Schwarz's lawyer called only one. Officer Thomas
Wiese's lawyers said they would call a couple of character
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sgt. Michael Bellomo's lawyer has said he will present a
major witness during the defense case _ the sergeant himself. Judge
Eugene Nickerson told the jurors Thursday that closing arguments
could begin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case against the other defendants is based in
part from Louima's own account of how he was beaten and brutalized,
though he did not identify any of the other officers directly.
Prosecutors also used testimony from fellow officers and police
records to try to tie the other defendants to the abuse of Louima
and subsequent efforts to cover up what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence presented against the four remaining
defendants, in three weeks of testimony in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, focused on Officer Charles Schwarz. He is charged with
holding Louima down in a restroom in the 70th Precinct station
house in Brooklyn while Volpe rammed a stick into Louima's rectum,
inflicting severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses testified that they saw Schwarz leading Louima
toward the restroom shortly before the attack, and prosecutors
sought to link him with Volpe in the minds of jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Thompson, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, told
the jury at the beginning of the trial, ``Justin Volpe and Charles
Schwarz began to inflict their own special brand of punishment,
their own special brand of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiese and Bruder are charged with joining Volpe and Schwarz in
beating Louima in a police car before he arrived at the station
house, although Louima could not identify any of the officers he
says beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo is accused of trying to cover up the beating in the
police car as well as a second assault by Volpe on another man,
Patrick Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence against Schwarz, 33, came from Louima himself
and two police officers who testified for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Louima did not directly identify Schwarz, but said that the
officer who held him down during Volpe's attack in the restroom was
the same officer who had driven him to the station house. Police
records show that Schwarz was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers, Eric Turetzky and Mark Schofield, testified
that they saw Schwarz walk Louima, his pants down, toward the the
restroom on the morning of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen Worth, vigorously cross-examined
witnesses. Worth has said that Schwarz was never near the restroom,
that Louima was wrong in saying it was the driver of the police car
who had held him down. He also underscored that Turetzky and
Schofield did not testify that they saw Schwarz taking Louima into
the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyers, Joseph Tacopina and Russell Gioiella, also
largely waged their cases through cross-examination, and when
Thursday's court session ended, they were in the midst of
presenting the several character witnesses who are expected to be
the only witnesses they will call.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against Wiese, 35, includes Louima's testimony that
two of the officers who beat him in the police car were the same
officers who took him to the station house. He did not identify
those officers, but police records show that he was taken by Wiese
and Schwarz. Wiese's lawyers contend that Louima's account of being
beaten in the police car was not to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, had told the jurors in his
statement at the start of the trial that they would not be hearing
much from him: ``There will be many witnesses in this case that I
may not cross-examine or that I may not cross-examine for a lengthy
period of time. That's not because I accept their testimony. It is
because it doesn't affect my client.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima testified that Volpe and a second officer, whom he did
not identify, approached the police car in which he said he was
beaten and joined in the assault. Police records show that Bruder,
33, was Volpe's partner that morning, and records of police
communications also place Bruder at the scene of the reported
beating.
</P>
<P>
   London also said that Louima was not credible in his account of
being beaten in the police car. Among other things, the lawyer
said, and the prosecution agreed, Louima gave the wrong location
for the beating in which Bruder is accused of taking part, and he
argued that the only reason his client was even charged was that
``he was Volpe's partner that night.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, from the office of Zachary Carter, the U.S.
attorney in Brookyn, have told the jury that Louima, a 32-year-old
Haitian immigrant, was beaten in the police car and attacked in the
station house restroom because Volpe and three officers still on
trial mistakenly believed he had punched Volpe in the face,
knocking him down, during the street melee. Bellomo is not accused
of taking part in either of the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   That Louima is black and the officers and sergeant are white has
added a bitter racial dimension to the case.

COMMUNITY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM TRANSFORMED MANAGER'S THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brandon is one of those mostly forgotten children. A
first-grader and one of 10 children in a fatherless family, he
arrives at a school on Chicago's South Side every day in a state of
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   His nose is perpetually running. His sweater is dirty. His shoes
are always untied.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Peters, a manager with United Parcel Service's Northwest
region, can't get the little boy off his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday, I'd tell him, `Son, you've gotta keep your shoes
tied, because otherwise, you're gonna trip and fall,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peters tutored Brandon and other children for four weeks during
a recent internship as part of a senior management training
program. During those four weeks, he learned more about management
than he has in years of wrangling with adult employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bar none, it was the most transforming experience of my
personal life,'' said Peters, a 23-year UPS veteran. ``I was
completely overwhelmed with the people I worked with.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, based in Seattle, is one of about 50 UPS managers who
will go through the company's intensive ``community internship
program'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which started in 1968, is designed to immerse an
elite group of managers in communities with problems that, on the
surface, differ from their own. They leave their jobs and families
to live and work at sites in New York City; Chicago; Chattanooga,
Tenn.; and McAllen, Texas. They don't go to observe. They pitch in,
doing anything that's needed, whether tutoring reading or teaching
interviewing skills, counseling youth or feeding the homeless. In
the process, they build problem-solving and communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn how to break down barriers,'' said Don Wofford,
national director of the internship program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the program is designed to increase understanding
of difficult social issues ranging from poverty and gang
involvement to unemployment and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them (the managers) to be more sensitive to these
issues, and to become involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same types of conditions in their own personal
back yards.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS, the national shipping company now based in Atlanta that was
started in Seattle's Pioneer Square, has spent $12 million since
1968 on its community internships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to avoid the quick look,'' Wofford said.
``Volunteers painting houses on weekends is great, but when people
are housed in the environment and see what goes on day and night,
and what individuals who live there face day to day, it makes a
different impression.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience has changed Peters' outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a macro-issues, project person,'' he said. ``I change
processes and make things work better. But in this experience, the
only thing that could change was me. These problems are so huge,
the only thing I can do is make a personal difference in how I
conduct my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And one way he learned to do that is by talking less and
listening more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've advanced to where I am because I've been a good seller of
ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered I have to be a buyer of ideas as well. You've got
to be a good listener. The more I concentrated on listening, the
more solutions appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   It also extended his concept of diversity in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in the workplace today and talk about diversity,
it's about race and gender,'' he said. ``But diversity of ideas is
really important. This experience reinforced that to me. Diversity
infuses a workplace with new and challenging ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience showed him the importance of gathering ideas from
many different people in an organization. ``The best ideas come
from the bottom up,'' he said. ``Very seldom do the best ideas come
from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who already volunteers in the community, is planning to
increase his involvement, especially in literacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can do is affect an individual or a couple of
individuals,'' he said. ``And you can hope someday that it will
have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his internship, Peters saw Brandon one last time.
It had been several days since he'd last been with him.
</P>
<P>
   Excited, the little boy ran up to greet Peters. Then he stopped
and knelt down.
</P>
<P>
   And tied his shoe.

2 MORGAN STANLEY EMPLOYEES SUSPENDED IN WAKE OF SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs 4th graph to clarify that Morgan Stanley and Luethke are
being investigated; subs 13th graph to delete redundancy; last two

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the nation's largest
securities firm, suspended two executives Thursday in connection
with a $10,000 payment that led to the arrest of a former employee.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said in a statement that it had made a ``mistake in
judgment'' last year when it paid a middleman to broker a police
sting operation against the dismissed employee, Christian Curry.
Curry, who is black, was contemplating filing a discrimination suit
at the time. He filed that lawsuit last week, adding false arrest
to his claims and demanding $1.35 billion in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The development is the latest twist in a case that began more
than a year ago when Curry, the scion of a prominent New York
family, was dismissed from his job as a junior financial analyst at
Morgan Stanley. The firm said it dismissed him for abusing his
expense account abuses, but his termination came days after photos
of him appeared in a gay pornographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Curry was arrested by undercover police officers
who said they caught him conspiring to plant racist e-mail on
Morgan Stanley's computer system, apparently to bolster his
discrimination lawsuit. Last week, the Manhattan district attorney
dropped all charges against Curry and began investigating Morgan
Stanley and Charles Joseph Luethke, the middleman, for their roles
in arranging Curry's arrest and the $10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's two leaders, Philip J. Purcell, chairman and
chief executive, and John J. Mack, the president, on Thursday met
with prosecutors in the district attorney's office and pledged to
cooperate with the investigation into the $10,000 payment. The firm
also appointed Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, a
Manhattan law firm, to lead an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of our investigation is to learn the facts as
completely and as quickly as possible. We are sorry for any
distress this entire episode has caused our many clients and
thousands of employees around the world,'' Purcell and Mack said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pending the outcome of that investigation, the firm said it had
suspended with pay two people in its legal department. It did not
reveal the names of the two and did not say why they were
suspended. But people close to the firm said they are Carol
Bernheim, a lawyer trained as a litigator, and Monroe Sonneborn, a
managing director. Both are named as defendants in Curry's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither returned phone calls seeking comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernheim and Sonneborn were not the main targets of the district
attorney's investigation, and the suspensions were entirely the
prerogative of Morgan Stanley, lawyers involved in the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell and Mack said in the statement that they themselves did
not know about the payment to Luethke beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either of us had known about Luethke's request for money,
no payment would ever have been made,'' the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   The Curry lawsuit, which asks for $1.35 billion in penalties and
damages, names as defendants Purcell, Mack, Ms. Bernheim and
Sonneborn, along with seven other senior Morgan Stanley employees.
It contends that Purcell had a personal role in planning to entrap
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against Curry were dropped last week, a move that the
district attorney's office described as unavoidable after it
discovered that Morgan Stanley paid $10,000 to Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said Thursday that notwithstanding its expression
of regret for the $10,000 payment, it considers Curry's lawsuit
``without merit'' and said it will defend itself vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   But Benedict P. Morelli, Curry's lawyer, said that the firm's
armor is growing weaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is act one, scene one,'' Morelli said. ``We will prove
that our case has merit and theirs is totally without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Luethke has also maintained that Purcell had a role in Curry's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney continues to investigate both Morgan
Stanley and Luethke. Lawyers involved in the investigation said
they did not expect to reach a conclusion about whether a crime was
committed for at least several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with Mr. Purcell and Mr. Mack,'' said Daniel J.
Castleman, chief of the Investigation Division in the district
attorney's office. ``We regard our talks as a positive step in the
right direction. We will have to wait and see how the investigation
turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Curry affair began a year ago April, when Curry, in his
first year as a junior analyst in the firm's real estate finance
division, was fired. Morgan Stanley said that he was terminated
because he abused his expense account. But the firing took place
shortly after the explicit nude photos of Curry appeared in
Playguy, a magazine that specializes in gay pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he is not gay, but said that people at Morgan Stanley
thought he was when they fired him. Discrimination on the basis of
perceived sexual orientation is illegal in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Curry also claims that he was subjected to discrimination
because he was black. His lawsuit argues that he was excluded from
working on business deals that involved white southern clients, for
example, and that at a Christmas party he was asked to dress up in
an Afro-style hairdo and costume lips as a spoof to tease a senior
black banker who works there.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley now has to juggle an internal investigation, the
district attorney's criminal investigation, and Curry's civil
lawsuit. Lawyers close to the investigation say that the firm will
be under pressure to reveal how the decision to pay $10,000 to
Luethke was made, and who made it.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the criminal investigation depends in part on how
the district attorney resolves a tangle of relationships at the
heart of the case. Among these are the ties between Luethke and
Curry. The two met when they were attending Columbia University,
and they remain in contact to this day. But Luethke also worked
with Morgan Stanley to catch Curry in the act of infiltrating the
firm's computers, authorities say. Morgan Stanley paid the $10,000
to Luethke days after the arrest.

MOSCOW, SEEING OBSTACLE, SENDS ENVOY TO BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After an intense round of talks with his American and
European counterparts, Russia's special Balkans envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, heads on Friday to Belgrade to meet President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's indictment Thursday by a U.N. tribunal was denounced
by the Russian Foreign Ministry as ``politically motivated'' and an
``additional obstacle'' to peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the ministry said the indictment raised
``serious concerns'' here but would not stop Russian efforts to
seek a ``possibly rapid political solution to the conflict around
Yugoslavia, including with the participation of President Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's fourth trip to Belgrade was to have begun
Thursday. But it was postponed after he and Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov continued negotiations with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland throughout the
day in an attempt to align Russia and the West on an eventual
settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, whose ties to its traditional Serbian allies are central
to the three-way talks, has insisted that NATO should have only a
limited role in any international peacekeeping mission in the
Serbian province. Russia has also balked at NATO insistence that
Belgrade withdraw all its security forces from Kosovo, and it has
called for a preliminary halt to the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement was announced Thursday evening, as Talbott and
Ahtisaari, the European Union Balkans negotiator, left for Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ahtisaari told a Finnish news agency that the last
round of meetings had brought progress. ``Our views are approaching
each other, and the facts that bind everyone have been
recognized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Chernomyrdin said Chernomyrdin and Ivanov, in a
joint report to President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin Thursday evening, had analyzed ``points of contentions''
and discussed the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion-page column Thursday in The Washington Post,
Chernomyrdin underscored Russian investment in a negotiated
settlement, but said that he would advise Yeltsin to pull out of
the process if the bombing did not stop soon.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SUSPECT FORMER OFFICE MANAGER OF KILLING
PROMINENT ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One day after federal officials released an
affidavit that accused him of participating in the abduction and
slaying of the missing atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, her former
office manager pleaded guilty in federal court to two weapons
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee, David R. Waters, 52, has not been charged
with any crime in the September 1995 disappearances of Mrs. O'Hair,
76, her son, Jon Garth Murray, 40, and her granddaughter, Robin
Murray-O'Hair, 30.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is the first time the federal government has
revealed that they suspect him of killing the missing family.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit of Edmund I. Martin, a special agent with the
Internal Revenue Service, says that Waters and three other men
``executed the scheme to abduct, kidnap and murder Madalyn Murray
O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray and Robin Murray-O'Hair for the purpose of
stealing at least $600,000 from the United Secularists of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit, which was used to obtain a search warrant for
Waters' apartment during an IRS investigation of fraud and
money-laundering triggered by the O'Hairs' disappearance with more
than $500,000 in gold coins, quotes a confidential source who said
that Waters hated Mrs. O'Hair: ``He spoke about seeing Madalyn
suffer and snipping off her toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters' attorney, Patrick R. Ganne, derided the affidavit,
saying it ``looks like a script for Oliver Stone's next movie. It's
full of speculation and guesses and nothing more. They don't have
any direct evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Carruth, the assistant U.S. attorney for the Western
District of Texas, expressed satisfaction with Waters' guilty plea
on the weapons charges but refused to comment on the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal investigators believe the O'Hairs are dead,
they have not been able to find their bodies. According to the
affidavit, Waters; Gary P. Karr, who was arrested on March 25 on
charges of possessing stolen property; Danny Raymond Fry, who was
killed in 1995, and Gerald Lee Osborne of Fort Worth, were all
involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was employed in 1993 and 1994 at the American Atheists
General Headquarters in Austin. He was arrested on March 24 after
federal agents found 119 rounds of ammunition in his apartment. He
is prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition because he is
a convicted felon. In 1965 he was convicted of murder in Peoria,
Ill. He has also been convicted of assault, forgery, theft and
weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   Waters faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.
Sentencing is scheduled for July 30.

OHIO JUSTICES STRIKE DOWN VOUCHER PLAN IN CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Maine, Wis.)  (jt)

<P>
   The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Cleveland can no longer
offer vouchers that enable low-income children to attend private
and parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   But in ending the nation's second-largest program of its kind
after two years, the court ruled only on a technical issue, that
the program was paid for improperly, through the state budget
rather than a separate authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The court, which announced its decision on Wednesday, said the
Cleveland program did not breach the separation of church and state
in either Ohio or federal law. As a result, voucher proponents said
Thursday, new legislation is being prepared that would allow the
program to be restored in the fall for the next academic year.
</P>
<P>
   This year the $5.25 million program provided scholarships to
about 4,000 children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Bolick, litigation director for the Institute for Justice,
a nonprofit public-interest law firm in Washington that argued in
defense of the voucher program, along with lawyers for the state,
said he was pleased that the court had left the door open to
reauthorizing the program and had not objected to financing
religious education.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by the Ohio Federation of Teachers and the
Ohio Education Association, assisted by the American Civil
Liberties Union, People for the American Way and Americans for the
Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans for the
Separation of Church and State, praised the court for striking down
the program. But he said the court ``completely missed the point on
the church-state issue,'' adding, ``The justices struck a blow at
the heart of the First Amendment and ignored clear and unambiguous
language in the state Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the nation's only other broad voucher system is in
Milwaukee. Wisconsin courts have no objections on church-state
grounds. But in Maine, courts ruled against vouchers for those
reasons. In Minnesota, parents can get a tax credit for vouchers.
In Arizona, people who donate money to programs that provide
vouchers can take a tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Florida recently passed a statewide voucher system for private
and religious schools. It is to go into effect later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Viteritti, research director of the Wagner School at
New York University who has written a book on school choice issues,
predicted that the Ohio law would be challenged again, which could
provide enough conflicting litigation for the United States Supreme
Court to consider a voucher case.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, opponents of the Milwaukee program took the case to
the Supreme Court, but the justices declined to hear it.

IRL'S GEORGE ON THE EDGE WITH MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Goodrich, the ABC producer of Sunday's
Indianapolis 500, as he has been for the last 14 Memorial Day
weekends, doesn't sweat the thought of having his press credentials
suddenly jerked out from under his headset.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's one of the comforts of having your network pay the
racetrack about $10 million a year for the immunity/privilege of
televising the event. But Goodrich's track record is by far a
greater gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, every other media outlet seems to be subject to the
whims of Tony George, the Indy Racing League's grand pooh-bah and
Indianapolis Motor Speedway president who last week tried to block
the entrance of Sports Illustrated. George was mighty upset that SI
motor sports writer Ed Hinton, whom he called ``a danger to himself
and to the sport he covers,'' wrote an eight-paragraph story in the
May 10 issue about an IRL crash in North Carolina that killed three
spectators nearly a month ago. Even more disrespectful, in George's
mind, was an Associated Press photo showing one of the victims in
the grandstands, under a blanket and in a pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   George's censorship edict lasted two days. A threatened boycott
of the race by several major newspapers caused even more bad
publicity for the irrational IRL ring leader, who admitted he was
trying to make a statement and picked this way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In light of King George's attempt to teach the media beast a
lesson, will there be second thoughts about how Goodrich and ABC
approach Sunday's race? Will Goodrich err on the side of even more
conservatism and tether his replays? Will he be on the phone with
Boss-Hog Tony to get his OK on information released about injuries
and/or deaths?
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich claims that won't happen as ABC does Indy for the 35th
straight year and 12th time live. And we're going to have to
believe him on this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never come to us and criticized us, and we have
criticized things about the IRL,'' Goodrich said from Indianapolis
this week. ``Some owners have said, `Gosh, why did you say this
about that?' But the IRL, never, and no one from Indy has said
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any repercussions after George's actions last week,
Goodrich said: ``I don't think so. We think it's an isolated case
that doesn't involve us as long we do responsible journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   And will Goodrich address the SI-George controversy in the
telecast?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How it's done: Goodrich says there's a simple philosophy he's
had for years about the way TV should handle a race accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You journalistically cover what has to be covered and do it in
good taste,'' he said. ``You don't over-replay things. I've tried
to do what I thought was best. And that's really the only guideline
I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaels, who will be included in this year's Indy race
coverage for the first time as a host, has similar thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to document it, but I don't think you can go in with
a hard-and-fast rule because each situation is unique,'' Michaels
said. ``You use your instincts and see how much is too much and how
little is too little.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels remembers all too vividly when he, Jackie Stewart and
Chris Economaki covered the Indy time trials for ABC in 1982, as
Gordon Smiley was killed in an horrific collision that left so much
debris Indy's Accident Prevention Committee could only make a guess
as to what caused it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie described it as an `aircraft accident,''' Michaels
said. ``Total disintegration of the car and Smiley was almost in a
rag-doll mode in the middle of the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did, as I recall the scene becoming so graphic, is
take one replay to see how he lost control, and that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be judicious. It's a tough choice for a
producer because you have to show how something happened and in
effect, you've just begun the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Your opinion counts: Hinton's story on the May 1 North Carolina
tragedy under the headline ``Fatal Attractions'' pointed out how it
was the second time in nine months that spectators were killed as a
result of crashed open-wheel cars. He suggested ``they should
ignite a public outcry that doesn't dissipate until track officials
devise a plan to prevent further episodes of this nature.'' Hinton
also wrote that the best solution to curbing these tragic accidents
is simple but unlikely to happen: The IRL and CART should stop
competing on high-speed oval tracks _ but that would cause the IRL
to ``rethink how it does business.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hinton is considered by many to be a fair and unbiased
reporter, IRL driver Eddie Cheever, last year's Indy 500 winner,
has sided with George on this controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times in my career I've been troubled by a magazine or a
journalist taking an opinion that's not in good taste or
responsible,'' Cheever said this week. ``I've often felt a
one-sided story is for people with a different agenda. From the
view of a racing driver, I think most coverage of that tragedy was
done tactfully and factually, but what Sports Illustrated did was
in extremely bad taste and I believe the journalist was borderline
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've offered to discuss things in the past with him, but he
hasn't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Business matters: While the Hinton-George debate was going on,
the IRL was doing business with ABC and its new sports chief,
Howard Katz. ABC announced a five-year extension in the
neighborhood of $65 million of its contract with the Indy 500. The
previous contract would have ended after this race.
</P>
<P>
   Although ratings for the Indy 500, as well as other IRL and CART
events, have not increased despite the popularity of racing, the
thinking is the sport will be more valuable if rumors of the IRL's
union with CART come to fruition. It would be in ABC's best
interest if they did.
</P>
<P>
   The last Indy 500 involving CART drivers had an 8.4 rating. Last
year's race, the fourth straight with the IRL-only, no-name
drivers, was a 5.5.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will also do the CART race this weekend, the Motorola 300 in
St. Louis, at noon Saturday. Paul Page, who has been at the last 25
Indy 500s and broadcast the last 10 for ABC, will be at this race
instead. Bob Jenkins, who's doing all the IRL races this year,
calls his first Indy 500. &QL;

_ Highlight from the pod race from ``Phantom Menace'' when one of
the two-headed announcers says: ``I don't care what universe you're

_ Despite breaking a bone in his left foot and tearing ligaments in
his left ankle during a jogging mishap Sunday, ESPN NHL analyst
Bill Clement says he will not miss a shift covering the Western
Conference finals between Colorado and Dallas (Game 4 is tonight,
4:30 p.m.). ``I'm lucky that it's a clean break and the injury is
far from my mouth,'' said Clement, who's on crutches for about 10
days. &QL; 
_ KNX-AM 1070 longtime sportscaster Fred Gallagher was treated to a
retirement party Thursday at the station. He's leaving after nearly
20 years at the station and a few years short of 50 years in the

_ Dan Noel , a sports producer at KCBS Channel 2 for almost 20
years, has left to become the senior producer for Television Games
Network, known as TVG, which on July 1 launches as a channel to
watch and place bets on horse races across the country. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_ Don't go away mad, Dennis Rodman . Just go away. Yesterday's news
is today's magazine cover story (that's the nature of the beast) as
Jerry Buss ' former Lakers buddy poses proudly for the June/July
issue of (appropriately named in this case) Detour with the
headline ``Burned! Dennis Rodman Tells All.'' And the ``all''
amounts to still being able to conjugate four-letter words, he
still has fun with

<P>
   Carmen Electra and his new flick, ``Simon Sez,'' will be coming
out in July. The story ends: ``Look, no matter what happens to me,
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna survive. The more (expletive) up
things I do, the more famous I get. That's pretty (expletive) up,
right?'' Yes, it is.

   PRATT, W.Va. _ Excitement seems to reach this little town
southeast of Charleston about every 90 years or so, not counting
the fire truck that rolled into the Kanawha River a few summers ago
because someone forgot to set the emergency brake.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, a 75-year-old union organizer named Mary Harris Jones,
known as Mother Jones, was imprisoned here on charges of inciting
riots after protesting unfair labor practices by coal mine owners.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Wesley B. Nugent, a freshly minted graduate of
West Virginia University who wants to be mayor of Pratt, a sleepy
little town where two-thirds of the 680 residents, the incumbent
mayor among them, are senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks around town, including the mayor, Paul D. Slack, 69,
who is seeking a third two-year term in the June 8 election, say
Nugent's candidacy is a noble but fanciful idea. Nothing wrong
here, they say, other than the need for a few new sidewalks and
maybe an after-school program for children.
</P>
<P>
   But Nugent, 22, who majored in international relations, looks
around and sees a town flirting with extinction _ not this year,
perhaps, but eventually.
</P>
<P>
   As the elderly die, he wonders whether Pratt, with its tidy
little homes and streets, will stay viable or fade away as so many
other places in rural America have when there are no jobs to keep
people from moving away. The pattern is especially acute in West
Virginia, where state officials have been adjusting to a once
mighty coal industry that now relies less on men than machines.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pratt, which has no traffic lights or parking meters,
shells of old businesses line Route 61, leaving Fowler's Market,
Sherry's Beauty Shop and a gas station as the town's only
commercial enterprises. Most of the working residents drive to jobs
in nearby Montgomery or even to Charleston, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Nugent says, he sees himself as a symbol of
small-town renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to portray myself as that way,'' he said, sitting on a
bench not far from where Mother Jones was imprisoned. ``I've
traveled extensively and was always drawn back here, to the
beautiful scenery and the close-knit community. So many West
Virginia students don't come back to be a community leader. They
don't find it challenging enough or competitive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reflection of his desire to change that cycle, Nugent said
he turned down job offers in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and
elsewhere to run as the Republican candidate for mayor, opposing
two Democrats, Slack and Gary Fields, 51, a former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the younger residents welcome Nugent's enthusiasm.
``He's a pretty smart guy,'' said Jason Veazy, 23, a
great-great-grandson of the town's first mayor, Oscar Veazy. ``He
could be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Slack, a retired power company salesman, bristles at the idea
that he has lost what it takes. Gearing up for a door-to-door
campaign, he has a letter for distribution, detailing the $1.5
million in state and Federal money he has helped secure for various
public works programs in town.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was especially proud of the part he played in helping
neighboring towns without a sewer system hook into Pratt's. The
connections are scheduled to open next year, and that means four
additional jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, a gas company manager, said he planned to emphasize his
skills as a communicator, which he might need. In his two terms in
office, from 1988 to 1992, voters tried to remove him after he and
his wife were charged with spraying Mace on a neighbor's child and
trying to run over people with a truck. Those charges were dropped
but they pleaded no contest to drunken driving charges and were
sentenced to a day in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Trying a political comeback two years ago, Fields lost to Slack,
166 votes to 95.
</P>
<P>
   To Nugent, the visions of his opponents are too narrow to suit
the future needs of the town. He talks about Federal money that
could be secured to buy a fourth police cruiser, repave streets and
clean up the eyesores on Route 61 ``as a way to draw business in.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else, he fears, the town might go the way of Mrs. Carney's
Boarding House, where Mother Jones was locked up. Several years
ago, town officials got it listed as a National Historic Landmark.
But efforts to raise money to restore it failed, and the house was
razed.
</P>
<P>
   In its place are garden apartments where many older residents
live.

BESIEGED GUCCI WINS ONE IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Gucci Group NV triumphed Thursday in the latest round of
a struggle to thwart a hostile bid by its bigger rival, LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, when a Dutch court upheld Gucci's sale of
shares to the French department store group
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute SA.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in the Netherlands, where Gucci is incorporated,
removed the last obstacle to Gucci's plans to transform itself into
a major multibrand luxury manufacturer. But the court invalidated
another weapon Gucci had used to help repel LVMH, a plan to sell
shares to employees, and ordered Gucci to compensate its workers.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH refused to acknowledge defeat. ``All options are open to
us,'' said James Lieber, an American lawyer who is a senior LVMH
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   He said LVMH was considering whether to ask another Dutch court
to declare the Gucci deal with Pinault-Printemps illegal, as well
as long-term maneuvers that would utilize LVMH's 20 percent stake
in Gucci to subvert the company's efforts to become LVMH's main
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci shares fell 6.5 percent to 64.50 euros ($68.37) after the
announcement. Pinault-Printemps shares rose almost 6 percent to
169.80 euros ($179.29). LVMH shares fell almost 8 percent to 257.10
euros ($271.47).
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in the Netherlands became necessary after Gucci
announced the deal to sell a 40 percent stake to Francois Pinault,
owner of Pinault-Printemps. Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman,
asked the court to invalidate the Pinault-Printemps deal. At the
same time, LVMH offered $81 a share, which compared with $75
offered by Pinault-Printemps, for the Gucci shares it did not own.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover struggle began last January after LVMH amassed a
sizable stake in Gucci, then unsuccessfully sought representation
on Gucci's board.
</P>
<P>
   The Gucci fight reflects deep changes overtaking European
business, pitting two French billionaires against each other for
control of an Italian fashion house with a corporate base in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and a chief executive, Domenico De
Sole, who is a Harvard-educated lawyer advised by Wall Street
investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Pinault has pledged to help transform Gucci into a major
competitor to LVMH. In response, Arnault has launched bitter
personal attacks on Pinault and Gucci management. The two
executives are now suing each other in French courts over
accusations by Pinault that Arnault slandered him.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole, the architect of the Gucci defense, said he was
delighted by the court's decision. ``We will move ahead with
Pinault,'' he said. Michael Zaoui, a Morgan Stanley banker who
helped Gucci's defense, said ``we look forward to advising them on
their expansion plans.''
</P>
<P>
   De Sole said Gucci will use the $3 billion Pinault-Printemps is
paying for its Gucci stake to shop for luxury brands, most notably
in Italy and France. In March, Pinault paid $1 billion for Yves
Saint Laurent and a stable of French perfume brands that are
expected to be sold to Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   But LVMH's Lieber promised that LVMH would exploit its unusual
position as Gucci's largest minority shareholder and biggest
competitor to make life difficult. The drop in Gucci's share price,
he said, reflected a ``transfer of value'' from Gucci to
Pinault-Printemps. He said the deal gave Gucci no advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see whether they can deliver our primary goal, which
is to create shareholder value,'' he said. ``We will be there if
the strategy fails, if they don't have the staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Hernandez, a luxury goods analyst at ING Barings in
Paris, said Gucci faces big challenges in integrating Yves Saint
Laurent and expanding. She called it ``a big change in the mix of
activities for Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   LVMH officials said they had not decided whether to seek a seat
on Gucci's board. But De Sole ruled that out, saying: ``There was a
war over that, and they lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ford, Gucci's chief designer and De Sole's main helper in
restoring Gucci's name in the fashion industry, said the struggle
had been ``extremely time-consuming in the last five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about LVMH's potential for disruption, he replied,
`'Clearly, they might not be your shareholder of choice, to be
honest. But we're going to be running the company in a completely
autonomous manner.''

BIL TO REGULATE FERTILITY PROCEDURES GAINS IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to remove contradiction from 1st sentence of 8th graf.)  
(gm) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Italian parliament has approved a draft law on
assisted fertility that sets prison terms for doctors who use
donated sperm to perform artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was passed by the lower house on Wednesday,
requires Senate approval before becoming law. If approved, it would
be Italy's first law regulating artificial fertility procedures. It
has already reawakened a passionate debate over medical ethics,
family values and individual liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also signals the growing political influence of
the Roman Catholic Church on social and moral issues. The bill
includes nonbinding language, sponsored by a conservative Catholic
member of parliament, committing lawmakers to re-examine abortion,
which was legalized in Italy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives hailed the bill as a victory for law and order.
``The Chamber of Deputies took a big, decisive step forward to help
Italy emerge from the Wild West of assisted procreation,'' former
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the center-right
opposition in parliament, said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Italy now has no laws governing artificial fertility practices,
and many critics complain that some private clinics operate without
supervision or ethical restraints. Italy has 298 fertility clinics,
of which 97 are private.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the draft legislation was sponsored by members of
the governing center-left coalition, who hoped to impose some
control over doctors and also broaden the choices for couples in
need of fertility treatments. But conservatives in parliament, as
well as some Catholic lawmakers who broke with the majority over
this issue, reworked the draft, imposing harsh restrictions.
</P>

   Walter Veltroni, who leads Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema's
party, Democrats of the Left, called the law ``fundamentalist'' and
vowed that it would not pass in the Senate. It is not clear whether
he will gather enough votes to block it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill bans couples from using donor sperm or eggs, bans the
long-term freezing of embryos and sets the maximum age at which
women can seek hormone treatments at 45. Italy is one of the
leading countries in post-menopausal pregnancies, most notably
because of the work of Dr. Severino Antinori, who in 1993 helped a
61-year-old woman become pregnant through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Antinori said that if the law passed, he would
leave the country. ``This is most illiberal law in the world,'' he
said. ``It is an ethnic cleansing against procreation. I can work
anywhere in the world, but what will happen to all those infertile
women? Where are they supposed to go?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a strong anti-abortion movement in Italy, but in a
country where 90 percent of the population consider themselves
Catholic, it is a movement dominated by the Catholic Church. The
church, which has not given up the fight to ban abortion, has also
lobbied heavily to prohibit in-vitro fertilization, because
embryos, which the pope views as human beings, are sometimes
destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The new law does not ban in-vitro fertilization, but it limits
its use. No donor eggs or sperm are allowed. Doctors can create
only three embryos in the effort _ usually, doctors make more than
six _ and they must be implanted within three months and cannot be
frozen for later use. If the father dies after a woman has banked a
frozen embryo, she cannot seek to become pregnant as a single
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows unmarried couples, as well as husbands and wives,
to seek fertility treatment, but only after they can prove they are
sterile. Single women, however, are almost entirely left out.
Italian law already prohibits adoption by single women. The draft
law would ban single women from almost any fertility procedure,
from artificial insemination to in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the lower house because it was supported
by the center-right opposition, and also by small Catholic parties
that usually vote with D'Alema's center-left party but defected
over this issue. The number of parties with ties to the Catholic
Church has grown since the old Christian Democratic Party collapsed
and splintered in the wake of corruption scandals in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats were pro-Catholic, but often failed to
block legislation that the church opposed, most notably in the case
of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in power, and they did for nearly half a century, the
Christian Democrats had to form alliances and coalitions, seeking
compromises right and also left. Now, no single party can claim to
represent Catholic interests fully, and each must compete to
attract Catholic voters and the favor of bishops.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department intelligence official who
first raised the alarm about China's theft of American nuclear
secrets will receive a special award Friday from Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson for persisting in his inquiry despite numerous
bureaucratic roadblocks, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Notra Trulock, will be given $10,000 and the
Energy Department's Special Act Award just days after the release
of a congressional report that endorsed Trulock's findings on the
scope of Beijing's nuclear espionage against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Notra Trulock deserves credit and recognition for
discovering the problem and for his persistence for pursuing the
issue within the bureaucracy,'' Richardson said in an interview.
``He's performed a service to the country that needs to be
recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   The award for Trulock is significant because his work still
remains at the heart of the controversy over the Clinton
administration's handling of Chinese nuclear spying.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's findings have been attacked by some administration
officials, who have asserted that he exaggerated the strength of
the evidence to support his conclusion that China had obtained
nuclear design information belonging to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When he presented his conclusions to the White House in 1997,
for example, an official at the National Security Council sought
out an alternative analysis based on the evidence from the CIA,
helping ignite a debate within the government over Trulock's
conclusions. That debate continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock will receive the award from Richardson just days after
he testified before Congress that he believed his conclusions about
Chinese nuclear spying had been challenged by some officials at the
National Security Council, the Energy Department and the
government's national weapons laboratories because the conclusions
interfered with Clinton administration and Energy Department
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Trulock told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee that he gave 60 briefings within the government on the
evidence in a case involving the possible theft of nuclear data
from Los Alamos National Laboratory and was ``challenged twice'':
by ``some NSC officials'' in the fall of 1997, and by NSC and
laboratory officials in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he believed those officials were ``motivated
by a desire to limit the political damage'' from the Chinese
espionage matter, and that differences between the CIA analysis and
the Energy Department's findings were magnified ``by policy
officials for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the ``climate of skepticism and outright denial''
of the problem within the Energy Department and the national
laboratories represented ``the politicization of intelligence at
its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Trulock even remains a controversial figure within the Energy
Department and at the government's national weapons laboratories,
where some officials believe he overstated the espionage case. Last
year, Trulock was removed as chief of intelligence at the Energy
Department and given his current position as acting deputy chief of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock has praised Richardson's handling of the espionage
threat since taking office last fall, but he has criticized the
Energy secretary's predecessor, Federico Pena, for not moving more
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe secretary Pena and the office of the secretary did
not act expeditiously on the information that we were bringing to
them at the time,'' Trulock told the Senate panel last week.
</P>
<P>
   While rewarding Trulock, Richardson is on the verge of
announcing disciplinary actions against other Energy Department and
laboratory officials for being too lax in their handling of the Los
Alamos espionage case. Richardson has not yet decided who shall be
disciplined, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, Trulock was informed by weapons designers from
Los Alamos that they believed that China may have stolen American
atomic design technology. An analysis of China's nuclear tests
strongly suggested that Beijing was developing new, miniaturized
nuclear warheads based on American designs.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after opening an investigation into the possible
theft of nuclear data from Los Alamos, Trulock and his team at the
Energy Department were told that the CIA had obtained a Chinese
government document that included detailed, classified information
about American nuclear warheads. That document was given to the
agency by a Chinese ``walk-in,'' who the CIA now believes was a
double agent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Trulock and his team were able to prove that the classified
information about American warheads included in the document was
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pointed to the fact that Trulock had already begun
his investigation by the time the document came to the CIA as one
reason he should be singled out for credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, he and DOE discovered this before the
walk-in document and there is documentation to prove that,''
Richardson said.

INDIANA, LIKE KNICKS, HAS HURTING CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Rik Smits trudged off the Market Square Arena
floor, grimacing enough for his teammates to notice. He is not in
constant pain, but the 7-foot-4-inch center does have something in
common with Patrick Ewing: he's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The big toe on his left foot, which was fractured in Indiana's
first-round sweep of Milwaukee, has limited his mobility and raises
concerns about how effective he can be in a four-of-seven-game
conference finals with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My broken toe is giving me a lot of trouble,'' Smits said
Thursday after practice. ``I was hoping the days off would help it,
but I don't really feel that it has. I feel my weakness now is back
to the basket, pivoting. Recovery time is not as good as it used to
be. Jumping ability is pretty much gone, not that I had much to
begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It will probably be the summer before the feet start
feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers will have had a week off before Game 1 on Sunday. To
break the monotony, they are planning a scrimmage on Friday for
their fans. Smits has used the time off to rehabilitate the injury,
but the concern over his health is building as the series
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Smits had his
way with Ewing. Falling for the simplest of shot fakes, Ewing was
unable to guard Smits effectively. The Knicks went out in five
games mainly because Indiana exploited the mismatch in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Smits averaged nearly 15 points in the three games
the teams played, but he is averaging only 11.1 points in the
playoffs. His highlight came in Game 2 against the 76ers, in which
he scored 25 points and played 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have often made other Pacers beat them offensively,
allowing Smits to get into a flow rather than allowing Reggie
Miller to catch fire from the perimeter. ``It is usually because
they had single coverage on me and I got a chance to do some stuff
in the low post,'' Smits said. ``This season they would keep a
forward on me and keep Ewing down low. Sometimes they had Larry
Johnson on me, and that gave me a big height advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bad toe, Smits may see a new defensive look thrown at him
on Sunday. Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy has entertained the idea of
using the reserve Chris Dudley to defend Smits, whose offensive
repertoire always gives Ewing problems. Dudley would most likely
take Kurt Thomas' spot in the rotation, thus freeing up Ewing from
having to guard Smits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd relish to be given that challenge down the
stretch to stop him,'' Dudley said. ``But I have confidence in him
as well,'' he added, referring to Ewing. ``I do hope I get put in
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In last year's pivotal Game 4 at Madison Square Garden, Smits
erupted for 14 points in the final quarter as Ewing struggled to
gain any rhythm on both sides of the floor in only his third game
back from the wrist surgery. Van Gundy wants to avoid a repetition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smits really hurt us in the fourth quarter of Game 4, and
that's why we started Dudley against him when we played him this
season,'' Van Gundy said. ``Smits made a great adjustment against
Chris and scored pretty easily the second time we played him at
Indiana, so now it's up to Chris to adjust to what Smits did to
him.''  &QL;

BERTELSMANN IS REORGANIZING RANDOM HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (Eds: Please note that this story is on the financial front page,
not the DISNEY-BOOK story, which moved earlier).  
 (af)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a year after Bertelsmann AG bought Random House and
blended it with existing holdings into the nation's largest
publishing house, top executives moved Thursday to consolidate
several long-established publishing units. Critics called the move
a triumph of corporate organization over literary values.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, including the abrupt departure of a top Random
House publisher and editor, came despite earlier assurances that
the union of Random House with Bertelsmann's Bantam Doubleday Dell
would not erode the independence of the units.
</P>
<P>
   When Bertelsmann announced its plan to buy Random House last
year, Peter Olson, who later became chief executive of Random
House, said: ``The various imprints and divisions are not going to
be affected by this. If anything, our hope is to enhance their
effectiveness and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   With its announcement Thursday, Random House said it intended to
merge eight of its publishing units into four groups or divisions,
including a combination of Bantam Books, the mass-market paperback
publisher with roots dating back to 1945, and Dell Publishing, the
half-century-old publisher of popular authors like Danielle Steel
and Thomas Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that reorganization was taking place partly to
reflect current trends in the book market such as rising sales of
religious books and the waning popularity of the mass-market
paperback, ``which is not a growth format.'' By merging units like
Bantam and Dell in one group and Doubleday and Broadway Books in
another unit, Olson said that Random House was reorganizing to
create ``two mass-market powerhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the reorganization was ``complete for the
foreseeable future'' and that any layoffs would be decided by the
heads of the individual units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cost-driven exercise,'' Olson said. ``It's more
about marketing effectiveness. We have a lot of publishers
competing for limited shelf space and the attention of our buying
and reading public. And the question is how can they be most
effective. That's what drives it. What we want to do is grow
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics reacted with apprehension, saying that the
consolidation of publishing units could reduce competition for
books because there could be fewer bidders for the manuscripts of
authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply distressed,'' said Jean V. Naggar, a literary
agent in New York who is the president of the Association of
Authors' Representatives. ``I think that once again the market for
authors has shrunk. I think diversity has been diminished. And I
think that all of the fears that we had when this merger was
announced have come home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the reorganization, one prominent executive, Carole Baron,
Dell's longtime publisher and editor, lost her job. William
Shinker, the publisher of Broadway Books, announced his resignation
earlier this month and has declined to comment on the reasons for
his departure.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization could affect the often delicate relationship
between authors and publishers. Critics said they thought it unfair
that Ms. Baron had to leave the company at a time when she appeared
to be on the brink of a major success. Dell is days away from
publishing a book that is expected to sell more than a million
copies _ ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris' third book in the Hannibal
Lecter series.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Janklow, the literary agent for Harris and for Danielle
Steel, said Ms. Steel might object to the change because Ms. Baron
had edited the author's books for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a problem for them I think,'' he said,
adding, ``This has created great consternation among many authors
because they have great affection for Carole.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who is ordinarily reluctant to be interviewed, issued a
short statement criticizing the reorganization. ``Relieving Carole
Baron as president and publisher of Dell in order to follow some
mechanical blueprint of corporate structure is a mindless waste of
the company's best resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Random House said it had tried to find Ms. Baron a new position
within the company, but Ms. Baron said she was leaving the company
after 18 years simply because ``my job doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Random House is home to more than 50 imprints that publish
popular books for adults. Those imprints are then organized in
groups such as the Random House trade group or Knopf Publishing.
Within these various fiefs, editors have the power to bid on and
acquire manuscripts, sometimes in competition with other publishers
that are part of the same corporation.
</P>
<P>
   That system has provided authors more opportunity to find
markets for their work and, often, higher advances _ which is why
literary agents are wary of the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, Random House said it would also combine two
religious imprints, Water Brook Press and the Doubleday religious
unit, as well as two trade book publishers, Anchor Books _ which
was founded in 1953 _ and Vintage Books. The Vintage Anchor
publishing division, as it will be called by Random House, will
become part of Knopf Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, views at Random House were mixed on how these various
publishers would blend. Stephen Rubin, who was appointed president
of the new union of Doubleday and Broadway, said both units would
maintain separate editorial staffs while sharing functions such as
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   However, Irwyn Applebaum, the publisher of Bantam Dell
Publishing Group, the new hybrid of Bantam Books and Dell
Publishing, said he was not prepared to address the issue of
editorial identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not choosing to talk about the editorial role of how we're
going forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a natural concern about shrinkage and loss of
freedom,'' he said. ``But here at Bantam we're going to define
freedom in a manageable form. And to me that means nurturing the
most interesting books that we can publish. The consumer doesn't
care whatever imprint is on a book.''

SAMPRAS FALLS AGAIN AT FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ For the 10th straight year, Pete Sampras concluded his
annual business trip to the French Open, the only Grand Slam where
his greatness has yet to leave its imprint, in Sisyphean fashion.
He fell from contention early, and he fell hard.
</P>
<P>
   After scratching and clawing his way through the opening round
in a four-hour 18-minute marathon against the unrelenting if
unremarkable Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica, the second-seeded
Sampras imploded in the second round Thursday afternoon, ground
into submission, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, by Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine,
the former top 10 player now ranked 100th.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was not only an out-and-out failure in his attempt to
win his first French Open, a milestone that would prove him a
champion for all surfaces at long last, he also failed to land the
Slam title that would tie him with Roy Emerson's record of 12 major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   For an athlete who measures his years in Grand Slam victories,
Sampras' 1999 season is now half over, and he has come up empty
after skipping the Australian Open and skidding to a premature stop
here in the second round, the same juncture he exited from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Roland Garros, the name Sampras is still synonymous with
futility. And the player, now 28, is still trying after a decade
after his initial visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He returned quite well, made me hit a lot of low volleys,''
Sampras said of his opponent. ``I just couldn't get it going. I
just need to go out and play my tennis, slip and slide a little
bit, but just keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   He waved off the suggestion that he could use a clay court guru
like Jose Higueras, the coach who girded Michael Chang for this
title in 1989. ``I know what I need to do,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Medvedev did what he needed to do Thursday.
Unlike Sampras, the Ukrainian calls clay his favorite surface and
reveres Roland Garros, where he went to the round of 16 as a
qualifier in his 1992 debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is the greatest player on earth that's ever picked
up a tennis racquet, but I don't think he played his best tennis
today,'' said a gracious Medvedev, whose sole victory against
Sampras in six prior meetings was in their only encounter on clay.
``So I really cannot be unbelievably proud for what I've done. I
mean, it's not his favorite surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay is not the surface of choice for Lindsay Davenport either,
and Davenport, the second-seeded woman here, was nearly ousted
Thursday by a clay court natural, 16-year-old Justine Henin, a
Belgian who won the first WTA Tour event she entered two weeks ago
in Antwerp and won the junior French Open crown as a wild-card
entrant in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now ranked 121st, and in her first-ever main draw slam event,
Henin used her racquet like a blowtorch, sending a blaze of
one-handed backhand winners past the frustrated Davenport. Henin
didn't fizzle until she served for the match at 5-4 of the third
set. There her adrenaline ran out, and Davenport managed to squeak
through to the third round, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like I'm glad to be still in the tournament,''
Davenport said. ``It was a struggle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   She handled her struggle better than eighth-seeded Mary Pierce,
who fell to Conchita Martinez, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, and ninth-seeded
Nathalie Tauziat, beaten 6-2, 6-4 by Gala Leon Garcia of Spain. But
Sampras' struggle was the most monolithic.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was close to tearing the head off his racquet by the
time he'd elbowed a final forehand return into the net, a flummoxed
Sampras vowed to bear no hard feelings toward the Slam event that
perennially trips him up despite his record six-year reign at No. 1
from 1993-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some ways I might put too much pressure on myself
here,'' Sampras said, ``but I'm never going to give up on it: I've
won all the other majors; this is the one that's my biggest
challenge, and challenge is something that there's no question that
I need right now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sampras' game does not fit well with the challenge posed by
Roland Garros, where the deadening effect of the red clay on his
high-impact style has been further exacerbated by the use of
softer, fluffier balls for this year's event. Sampras also admitted
that he came into this tournament with less than ideal preparation:
a 10-5 match record, 3-2 on clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a little bit of everything, not having won many
matches this year, playing on clay, you know, it's a struggle for
me,'' Sampras said, ``and I guess I'm thinking about that when I'm
playing, that I'm struggling, just struggling really to find my
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It eluded him Thursday just as it has since his first visit in
1989, with the exception of his stellar run to the semifinals in
1996, a campaign he launched just three weeks after the death of
his former coach, Tim Gullikson. That year, Sampras tackled and won
three five-set matches.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, hobbled by a perverse refusal, or inability, to slide
and glide on the grit underfoot, and so unsure of his tactics that
he second-guessed himself into 10 double-faults and 61 unprovoked
errors, Sampras moped through the final set like a man who wanted
to be anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a numb feeling,'' Sampras said. ``I really feel
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the five-setter against Marin on Tuesday was to
blame for Thursday's lethargy. Instead, he pointed an accusatory
finger at his game in general: it's come undone at just the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes on clay my instinct is not the right call,'' he
said. ``On clay I get into a hole where I kind of want to serve my
way out of holes.'' His five aces provided insufficient artillery
today.

IBM EXECUTIVE DESCRIBES PRICE PRESSURE BY MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ A senior IBM executive testified Thursday that
the Microsoft Corp. had repeatedly raised the prices it charged the
International Business Machines Corp. for its Windows operating
system and had enforced other onerous licensing terms in
retaliation for IBM's refusal to stop competing with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft repeatedly said we would suffer in terms of prices,
terms, conditions and support programs, as long as we were offering
competing products,'' said the executive, Garry Norris, a manager
in IBM's PC division from 1995 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a seven-hour deposition taken here Thursday as part of the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft, Norris described
several instances in which he said Microsoft had followed through
with threats so that ``we were severely disadvantaged in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris will testify as a witness for the government when the
trial resumes next week. His testimony here Thursday suggested that
he will offer compelling new evidence bolstering the government's
case, the core of which is that Microsoft uses its monopoly
position in personal computer operating systems to force companies
into compliance on other competitive issues. Until now, no computer
manufacturer has testified about such threats.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's willingness to testify is just the latest volley in
longstanding antagonism between the two companies. IBM set
Microsoft on its course to power and riches in 1980 when it adopted
the then-tiny company's MS-DOS operating system for the new PC it
was introducing.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship soured as so-called clone makers grabbed
huge chunks of IBM's new consumer and small-business markets by
making machines that ran MS-DOS. The operating system then became
more important than IBM's computer design _ and eventually, far
more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The final split came in the early 1990s, when Microsoft pulled
out of a collaboration with IBM to develop OS/2, a powerful
successor to MS-DOS. After both companies had invested several
years and many millions of dollars in OS/2, Microsoft decided that
its Windows would replace DOS.
</P>
<P>
   IBM decided to go it alone with OS/2, and the antagonism Norris
described Thursday resulted largely from IBM's continuing to offer
OS/2 as an alternative to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers conducted Thursday's deposition, and their
questions suggested that IBM was in large part to blame for the
hostile relationship between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Norris described how Microsoft had stalled IBM for
many months in 1995, refusing to sign a licensing agreement
allowing IBM to install Windows 95 on its personal computer
products until 15 minutes before the launch of Windows 95, on
August 24, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he asserted, IBM was the last computer manufacturer
in the world to get Windows 95, putting the company months behind
its competitors and costing IBM its position as the largest seller
of PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also ended up charging IBM more for Windows 95 than it
charged other, smaller personal computer manufacturers, Norris
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Microsoft lawyer, Rick Pepperman, pointed out that at the
very time that the two companies were dickering over a license
agreement in 1995, Microsoft discovered that IBM had been
under-reporting its sales of Windows 95's predecessor, Windows 3.1,
by 15 percent, costing Microsoft more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's resistance to Microsoft's demand for an audit, Pepperman
said, contributed to the Windows 95 license delay.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began, Norris said, at a meeting in November 1994
at which Microsoft offered IBM lower prices and more cooperation if
it would eliminate or reduce shipments of OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Norris said, IBM executives said they intended to step
up OS/2 sales and ``ship it on as many units as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris said a Microsoft executive told IBM that Microsoft's
chairman, Bill Gates, was ``surprised and upset'' by the decision,
and after that, Microsoft was ``unresponsive to phone calls and
very slow'' in supplying advance versions of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But Pepperman recalled IBM's ad campaign against Windows 95
asserting that OS/2 was faster than Windows 95 and would crash less
often. ``Why wait for Windows 95?'' IBM's ads asked.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperman produced a record of a phone call to senior IBM
executives in July 1995 in which Gates was irate over ``IBM's lack
of respect for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most useful testimony for the Justice Department
concerned Norris' contention that Microsoft charged IBM higher
prices for Windows as a penalty for competing with Microsoft _
exactly the sort of evidence needed to support antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said Microsoft charged IBM $9 for each copy of Windows
3.1. But after nine months of bitter altercations, the per-copy
price of Windows 95 rose to $45.90, boosting IBM's licensing costs
to $220 million a year from $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also insisted that IBM sell 300,000 copies of Windows
95 in the first five months, which IBM said was impossible, or face
a 20 percent price increase. In the end, IBMsold only 100,000
copies, and Pepperman said that Microsoft did not carry out its
threat. Instead, Norris said, the per copy price went up to $46.60,
costing IBM $3.5 million more each year.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperman said that IBM had been given a special price for
Windows 3.1 as part of the a previous cooperative arrangement.
Norris said that both Compaq and Hewlett Packard, among other
``first-tier companies'' paid less than IBM. He testified that a
Microsoft executive had told him that Compaq paid less ``because
Compaq doesn't compete with us.'' &QL;

PACERS' JACKSON HAS KNICKS HUDDLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ There was chaos on the court for the New York
Knicks about this time last year as a tipped ball was swung calmly
from the Pacers' Chris Mullin to Mark Jackson to Reggie Miller in
three swift motions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scattered and harried Knicks, Chris Childs found
himself lost in this Bermuda triangle of Indiana talent, failed to
rotate on defense and left Miller alone on the wing, right in front
of Spike Lee, to deliver a 3-pointer with 19.3 seconds left in Game
4 of the Knicks' second-round series against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shot that tied the score and led to an overtime victory
by the Pacers at an eerily quiet Madison Square Garden. It was a
deflating moment the Knicks could not overcome as they went on to
lose the series in Game 5. And it was one more illustration of how
Jackson _ who was marginally open, but smartly deferred to Miller
for the wounding shot _ has continually displayed the right snap
decisions against the Knicks over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as the Knicks prepare for the Pacers in Game 1 of
the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals on Sunday, they
are searching for a way to dilute Jackson's impact as a 3-point
shooter, post-up threat and precision passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think definitely the Jackson matchup has been critical,''
Coach Jeff Van Gundy said Thursday after a three-hour film and
practice session at the Knicks' facility at SUNY-Purchase. ``It's
up to us as a staff to have a better plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to develop a strategy for a boxy point guard who can
bang and post up either Charlie Ward or Childs like he is bumping a
car door shut. At 6 feet 3 inches and 185 pounds, Jackson is an
earth mover as a point guard. Van Gundy could put the 6-7,
235-pound Larry Johnson on Jackson, but that experiment resulted in
a 3-point binge by Mullin _ who was shadowed by Ward _ during the
Knicks' loss to the Pacers on May 2. More likely, Ward and Childs
will be left to guard Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real good and real strong,'' Ward said. ``I guess we're
going to have to lift more weights this week and get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   From his planted post position, Jackson can whirl inside for a
shot; or, if he is double-teamed, he can find an open man without
so much as craning his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to double him,'' Childs said. ``I'll guard him by
myself, and if he's going to beat us in the post then let him beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs is feeling a little invincible these days as the guide to
the Knicks' up-tempo bench and as half of the defensive clamp on
opposing point guards. Childs and Ward shut down Tim Hardaway in
Round 1 and Mookie Blaylock in the second round. But Jackson has
done more damage to the Knicks in recent years than either Blaylock
or Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two seasons, including the playoffs, the Pacers are
8-3 against the Knicks. In that span, Jackson has averaged 8.7
assists and 12.3 points a game and has made 16 of 28 shots from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shoots extremely well against us,'' said Ward, who has been
slow at times to close out on Jackson. ``It's not so much something
we do or don't do. He just plays well against us. I've seen him
play against other teams, and he misses shots.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something about the Knicks that seems to put an extra
edge on Jackson's mentality. He was a Knick until he was traded by
Pat Riley on the ground that his defense was not tough enough. But
what Jackson lacks in speed and quickness _ which are on display in
his backup, Travis Best _ he makes up for in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's instincts on both sides of the ball have been critical
to the Pacers' success in this year's playoff push. Jackson has
done to Milwaukee and Philadelphia what he has done to the Knicks
time after time. In the Pacers' seven playoff games, Jackson has
averaged 10.6 points and 10.3 assists a game and has done a lot
with limited shot taking by making &QC; 9 of 18 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is similar to us,'' Ward said. ``Chris and I aren't
looking to score much. We're looking to penetrate, and we don't
shoot that much. He's similar to what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson has done it much better. In the playoffs, Jackson
has 72 assists to 19 turnovers. Ward and Childs have combined for
68 assists to 23 turnovers. But Ward and Childs seem undaunted by
their task. This series is a chance to further change the
perception that the Knicks' big weakness is at point guard. Last
year, particularly in Game 4 against the Pacers, that was evident.
</P>
<P>
   With clarity of thinking, Jackson made the right decision under
pressure, and Childs, assigned to Miller at the time, did not.
Childs does not need a game film to remind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see it,'' Childs said. ``I know what I did
wrong. I rotated to Mark and gave Miller an open 3. I know that
can't happen again.'' &QL;

AFTER A COMPUTER-AGE WINDFALL, WORKERS REINVENT THEIR LIVES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. _ Within the modest headquarters and
computer memory factory of the Kingston Technology Co. is a living
laboratory in how people react when blessed with windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, nine years after Kingston's start, its Taiwanese
immigrant founders, David Sun and John Tu, sold 80 percent of the
company to the Softbank Corp. of Japan for $1.5 billion. The
founders _ now fabulously wealthy _ generously set aside $100
million from the sale's proceeds for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in January 1997, they lavished $38 million upon 530
employees, giving them bonuses that ranged from $2,000 to six
figures, depending on seniority, pay and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, an additional $20 million was divided among 700
workers, and a like amount is expected to be distributed to more
than 1,000 employees in July.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the bonuses, the founders gave workers memos advising
them to pay off debts and become homeowners. While most employees
paid some heed, many also went on spending sprees.
</P>
<P>
   Most have remained on the payroll and are intensely loyal to the
founders. But some have seen the bonuses as a once-in-a-lifetime
way out of a humdrum existence _ not that work at Kingston is all
that humdrum. Thanks to the founders' management style, the company
still has free Friday lunches, 100 percent health coverage and
unstinting retirement benefits _ Kingston puts $3,000 a year in
each employee's 401(k) and then matches employee contributions of
up to $2,000, dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that cries for independent financial advice.
Asked what his counsel would be for the employees, Mark D. Wilson,
a certified financial planner in Newport Beach, Calif., said, ``I'd
like them to realize what a wonderful gift they've been given.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with the founders that home-buying and eliminating
short-term debt would be prudent uses for the money, but he pointed
out that several of the employees had invested some of the money
for their children but had not put any of it away for their own
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he would advise workers to invest half the bonus,
after taxes, for their own retirements _ a far better use than
whittling down mortgages, he said, because mortgage interest is
tax-deductible. For a young employee, he added, a long-term
investment could grow enough to allow an early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He was not surprised, however, that some recipients did not see
things that way. ``Since they are young, I'd expect them to take
the money and run,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bonus was a turning point for Darin Farriola, a four-year
product manager at Kingston who had written a screenplay after
hours. ``There's no more excuses,'' said Farriola, who quit
Kingston in 1997, shortly after receiving a bonus equal to a
half-year's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that he could cover his bills for awhile, Farriola
began looking for investors to bankroll his film. ``The only thing
I ever directed before was traffic,'' said Farriola, who is 32.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he succeeded in attracting backers for the film,
``Ivory Tower,'' a drama about corporate America. A private showing
for Kingston employees at a local theater received raves. Recently,
broadcast rights were sold to the Showtime cable network, which has
scheduled the film to run sometime in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingston was the best opportunity I ever had in my life,''
Farriola said. ``But it's not a world I'd go back to.'' The film
work, he said as he worked in his office on stories for movies yet
to come, ``is something I want to do the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the financial planner, applauded his choice. ``Following
your dream is wonderful,'' he said. ``Whether he's successful or
not, it's not blowing the money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Jaime Chavez, whose family in Mexico City owned a moving
company, America initially was a mean place. For four years, he
endured $4-an-hour landscaping jobs. Digging ditches made his hands
sore, and he got so tired that he fell asleep during lunch breaks.
After asking a boss about unpaid overtime wages, Chavez said, he
got the pay but lost the job.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His fortunes improved after a cousin working at Kingston told
him of a one-day job that soon became full-time, paying $9.50 an
hour. Now, Chavez is the company's maintenance and warehouse
supervisor, managing 12 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you opportunities even if you are inexperienced,''
said Chavez, 34, who sends his parents in Mexico up to $1,000 a
month from his paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   His bonus, which moved him and his family solidly into the ranks
of the middle class, became the down payment on a 2,200-square-foot
home in Costa Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a good move, Wilson said. It also meant that his wife,
Marisol Chavez, who is now pregnant with the couple's third child,
did not have to return to work as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself lucky,'' Chavez said. ``What I have right
now is thanks to Kingston.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year before Kingston awarded its first bonus, the mother of
Roseanne Carrillo, a sales manager, died unexpectedly from liver
disease. Ms. Carrillo, 40, borrowed $9,000 for a modest funeral and
buried her mother in an unmarked grave. ``That weighed very heavy
on my mind,'' Ms. Carrillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus paid for an elaborately engraved, $5,000 green
limestone grave marker. ``It was my tribute to her,'' said Ms.
Carrillo, whose father, 69, is Kingston's oldest employee.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the workers are referrals from others, and many
family members work alongside one another. She intends to use her
next bonus to buy the plot next to her mother's.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary payouts instill security, said Ms. Carrillo,
who also erased her credit-card debt. ``Money is such a big worry
for a lot of people,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tim R. Westland, 35, Kingston's Webmaster, said the
bonus made him a cash-and-carry consumer, free of car payments and
monthly credit card bills for the first time in a decade. And he
intends to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   From a bonus worth more than a year's salary, Westland put 40
percent aside for the education of his 10-year-old daughter. He
also indulged a little, replacing two older-model cars with new
ones and taking a return trip to Maui with his wife, Marci, and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortune smiled on me,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brandi LaPlante, 29, does not expect in her lifetime to see
another paycheck as big as her sole Kingston bonus, which totaled
three times her annual salary. Even so, Ms. LaPlante, who joined
the company at age 20 and in her six years there worked up to a
senior network sales job, left Kingston in 1997 for a start-up
concern where she expected better opportunities for advancement.
She cried on her last day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before she received the bonus, she and her husband
had moved into a new home. Much of the bonus went toward
improvements like carpeting, wood floors, custom landscaping and a
patio cover. The couple also opened savings accounts for each of
their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Other money went toward new cars _ and a $1,500, 32-inch
television, a gift for Ms. LaPlante's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I've seen my dad cry,'' she said.

FRONT DESK? SEND UP A COMPUTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We may know how much to slip the bellhop for
dragging the bags upstairs, but the modern hotel evokes a new
question: How much do you tip him for tech support?
</P>
<P>
   Consider Alex Peshev. He showed up at my room about 9 p.m.
toting his wireless headset (used for communicating with the front
desk) and found me muttering expletives as I struggled to work the
television-based e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can trouble-shoot almost anything,'' Peshev said patiently.
No surprise. He has a bachelor's degree in computer science and
spends his days as a network administrator, which apparently will
be a job requirement for the hotel worker of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a night's stay at the W Hotel, a stylish new 31-story
hotel in downtown San Francisco that is your home office away from
home. Like dozens of hotels trumpeting themselves as high tech, it
offers Internet access, in-room computers and a wireless keyboard
to send e-mail via TV, and thus reinforces the tension that
computer and Internet users feel everyday: Sometimes technology is
a panacea, and sometimes a real pain.
</P>
<P>
   The science-fiction-like amenities at the W were fine on the
surface, but they required elbow grease, too. The radio crackled
with static at first, Web access through the television was fuzzy,
and the wireless telephone signals crossed when I tried to call the
front desk. I wound up having an interesting conversation with a
Norwegian fellow named Andre in room 1415.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, who is this?'' I responded cleverly. It turns out that
Andre Backen is a computer game maker from Oslo and an Internet
aficionado. It took him a half-hour to figure out the Internet
access in his room. I should have sent Peshev, but he was probably
busy upgrading the Unix computer in baggage storage.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the W had just opened, and at least it's trying,
although in that regard it is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, hotels are slowly adding technological
amenities _ making data ports a default setting, offering a fax
machine in every room, making high-speed Internet access as
pertinent as a pillow mint. After all, what good is fresh breath if
you can't e-mail home about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way from when there was a telephone by the
side of the bed and maybe `Magic Fingers' where you put 25 cents in
and get a little shake,'' said John A. Marks, president and chief
executive of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation waxed philosophical. I mourned the fact that
hotels no longer seemed a haven for business travelers but rather
an enabler for the workaholic. Should a night's stay at a hotel
really have to involve user manuals?
</P>
<P>
   Marks countered that hotels are justifiably responding to market
demand. He argued that travelers _ particularly executives _ cannot
afford to fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but they will in most places. Big chains like Hyatt,
Marriott, Wyndham and Hilton are just dipping their toes into
technology with pilot projects: computers in some rooms or
high-speed Internet access at one or two hotels like the Hyatt San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block is cost. Jonathan M. Tisch, president and
chief executive of Loews Hotels, said it could cost several hundred
thousand dollars just to add high-speed access lines to a single
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As for the W, owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide,
the gadgets offered a marked upgrade over a traditional business
night's stay _ once they were up and running. The $199 room
included a CD player (with remote control and a selection of CDs
delivered from the front desk), a VCR (movies cost $10), Compaq
computer (I had to order it specially) and a Hewlett-Packard color
printer/fax/copier (in 15 percent of the rooms).
</P>
<P>
   Had I been so inclined, I could have started an e-commerce
business, filed for an initial public offering, then retired rich
in time for cocktail hour.
</P>
<P>
   Among other features of the W was a sensor that detected if I
was in the room. Hotel employees carry a device that looks like a
garage-door opener. When pointed at a door, it indicates whether
the room is occupied, so an employee knows whether to enter.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, I was immersed in a moment of pure gadget bliss: I
was listening to a Dave Matthews CD on the stereo, using the TV to
switch back and forth between the New York Knicks game and surfing
the Net, and sipping a Heineken from the minibar. Like I'm not
executive material.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest asset of the place was its employees (and that
isn't the beer talking), about a half-dozen of whom stopped by
during the evening to make sure everything worked smoothly. I
promise you, if Mother Teresa had a degree in engineering she
couldn't have been as helpful. At one point, two employees came by
just to refresh my towel supply and offer me a fortune cookie _
which required no tech support to open.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the high-tech hotel was a net plus, even if it does
have some electronic bugs to work out. That was something that even
Peshev, the bellhop/computer scientist, conceded. For example, he
hates to wear his wireless headset to communicate with the front
desk, because the ear piece is too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night my ear hurt so much, I couldn't even sleep,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he added, ``technology can be more of a headache
than a help.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded tense. I tipped him $5. But maybe what he really
needed was a quarter for the Magic Fingers.

   Priced Right Out Of the Mailbox? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered how the banks that inundate Americans with credit
card offers can afford all those come-on letters and tempting
introductory rates? Perhaps some of them can't. The mailbox of the
future may still groan under the weight of credit card
solicitations, but they will come from a smaller number of banks,
Moody's Investors Service says.
</P>
<P>
   Just as big airlines can drive new carriers out of business by
temporarily lowering prices, bigger lenders can do the same to
smaller banks by temporarily lowering the price of borrowing money,
and that is what they are doing with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutthroat competition between issuers remains the rule,'' said
David Fanger of Moody's, the credit rating agency, ``while the
prevalence of teaser rates continues to encourage consumers to
surf'' for new cards. All of that shaves profit margins and gives
an advantage to the big lenders that can afford to stay longer in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of just signing up a new customer now ranges from $90
to $110, double the cost six years ago, mostly because of the
expense of mass mailing, according to The Nilson Report, a credit
card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. That may decline as
issuers turn to the Internet: ``Acquiring a new customer over the
Internet may be only half as expensive,'' said David Robertson, the
president of Nilson. But smaller issuers who cannot match the
low-rate offers from big lenders may not be in the game long enough
to realize the Internet savings. &QL;

   Reversing a Roth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you rolled your retirement savings into a Roth IRA last year,
and then realized that you were not eligible, you have until Oct.
15 to undo your mistake, the Internal Revenue Service says,
acknowledging that it made a mistake when it told people the
deadline to fix such errors was April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Rollovers to Roths were allowed only for taxpayers whose
adjusted gross income was less than $100,000. Those who made more,
and married taxpayers who filed separately, were ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   If you improperly converted to a Roth, you have until Oct. 15 to
have your investment house undo the deal and until April 15, 2002,
to file an amended tax return, said Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to undo an improper Roth conversion makes all income
taxes due immediately and, if you are under 59{, you must pay a 10
percent penalty.

FROM BRAZIL TO WALL ST. AND BACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The United States has had only two
Federal Reserve chiefs in the last two decades, but boom-and-bust
Brazil has had 20, an average of one a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three months into the term of the newest head of Brazil's
central bank, Arminio Fraga Neto, a soft-spoken former hedge fund
manager for the billionaire investor George Soros, Brazilians hope
that the roller-coaster ride is smoothing out. They also hope that
Fraga, like the United States' departing Treasury secretary, Robert
E. Rubin, can use his experience from the high echelons of finance
to forward his government's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was in need of a respected trader, and Fraga filled
this gap,'' said Fernao Bracher, a former president of the central
bank who is now the head of Banco BBA Creditanstalt, an investment
bank here.
</P>
<P>
   But Fraga, who is 41, brings more than trading experience to his
new post. While overseeing emerging-markets investments for Soros,
he also taught part-time at Columbia University. Now, back in
Brazil, he has been credited as the driving force in restoring
Brazil's credibility with foreign investors in the wake of a
currency crisis earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga's course in bringing the country back from the economic
brink was relatively straightforward: Knowing that the devaluation
of Brazil's currency would make imports more expensive, he sought
to pare consumer demand by raising interest rates to 45 percent.
The high rates also helped attract foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga, who holds both Brazilian and United States citizenship,
then traveled to the United States, where he convinced large banks
to renew credit lines to Brazil. Since then, interest rates have
declined rapidly, to a nine-month low, and Fraga has signaled that
they have further to fall. But with last week's 10 percent tumble
in Brazil's stock market, more work may be needed before they do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arminio was very bright and very tough, and he had a hard time
choosing between university and the private sector,'' said Winston
Fritsch, his former colleague on the faculty of Pontifical Catholic
University here and now president of the Brazilian operations of
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fraga has kept a foot in both camps since receiving a
PhD in economics from Princeton University in 1985. Before working
for Soros, he was at Salomon Brothers and Banco Garantia, a leading
Brazilian investment bank now owned by Credit Suisse First Boston.
In 1984, he worked for the Federal Reserve's research division in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The international finance course Fraga taught at Columbia
illustrates how his varied experience helped him prepare for
leading the central bank, where he worked in a lower-level job in
the early 1990s. Students wrote a a hypothetical memo to the
finance minister of a country of their choice, diagnosing the
country's problems and proposing solutions. Next, they wrote an
investment report about a country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factoring in this whole globalization thing helped people to
think of how markets would react,'' Fraga said in an interview at
the central bank's branch here, his relaxed manner and careful
choice of words seeming more suitable to a professor than a fund
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approaching problems from both sides of the fence is
necessary,'' he added. In Brazil, Fraga hopes to continue teaching,
with a similar course planned for later this year at the Fundacao
Getulio Vargas, a prestigious local economics institute.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fraga has captured the public imagination in a way his
19 recent predecessors never did, he has also faced challenges.
When he appeared before a congressional committee considering his
nomination, an issue was made of his dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga, who grew up in Rio in a family of doctors, responded that
it was because his mother was an American, which had little
relevance to his ability to protect Brazil's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, an opposition politician compared him to a fox
guarding the chicken coop because of his previous work for the type
of hedge fund that can wreak havoc on emerging markets' currencies.
During later testimony, he often appeared tired while explaining
the workings of the central bank to senators with little knowledge
of the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to the public speaking and the politics and all
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, his aides were denying a critical report in the
nation's leading news magazine, Veja, that he had been dismissed by
Soros because of bad bets on Asia. They said there were bad bets,
but no dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   In another congressional appearance, he had to rebut accusations
that the central bank, under his predecessor Francisco Lopes, acted
improperly during the sharp shift in exchange-rate policy in
January. Nevertheless, his greatest political strength may well be
that he was not involved in that change.
</P>
<P>
   Politics notwithstanding, Fraga is settling back into life in
Brazil. Like many high-ranking officials, he chose to live away
from Brasilia, the capital city deep in the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he moved his family to Rio and takes an hour-and-a-half
flight each Monday and Friday. In Brasilia, he stays in an
apartment and tries to take walks before work _ an activity that he
says helps him think and sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   During weekends in Rio, he has become a fixture at the Gavea
Golf Club, where he plays golf with his 13-year-old son, Sylvio. As
for his staying power at the central bank, Fraga remains cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing the third hole in a 72-hole tourney,'' he said.
``It's a good start but that's all it is.''

IN THE SHADOW OF THE BOSS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am a middle manager in a medium-sized company
where nothing happens without the chief executive's approval. She
is detail-oriented and strong-willed. Though some members of my
staff get a charge from knowing that the chief is monitoring their
projects, I wonder whether citing her wishes too often will
undercut my own authority. This is of particular concern on those
occasions when my staff and I are of one opinion, but the chief has
other ideas. Should I present the boss's position as if I shared
it, or make clear that I'm only carrying out her plans?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's one thing to let people know that the big boss is
interested in their work. It's quite another to emphasize that
she's micromanaging every part of the show. Keep it up, and someone
will eventually ask: So what do we need (italics)you(end italics)
for?
</P>
<P>
   Constantly invoking the boss's name weakens your position, said
Andrew J. DuBrin, a professor of management at the Rochester
Institute of Technology and author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide
to Leadership'' (Macmillan, 1997). ``You become a conduit instead
of an authority in your own right.''
</P>
<P>
   By highlighting your lack of autonomy, you lose the respect of
people both below and above you, said Roger Fritz, president of
Organization Development Consultants in Naperville, Ill. ``The
people that report to you will start asking, legitimately, `Why is
she here? The company is always talking about saving money, so why
do we have to have this superfluous person around?''' And as for
the chief executive, Fritz said, ``in her heart of hearts, she's
not going to respect you, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Start to change things by leaving your boss's name out of
planning discussions with your staff. ``Take the plans and
decisions and personalize them,'' DuBrin advised. Have the
confidence to tell the staff why you think Plan A is the right
course without using the boss as backup.
</P>
<P>
   When you and the boss don't see eye to eye, resist the urge to
distance yourself publicly from her plan. You should, of course,
discuss your objections with her and look for compromise. But once
a decision has been made, accept it. ``It's very important to show
unity in an organization,'' DuBrin said. ``It undermines your
character as a leader to say, `I don't really believe in this; it's
just what the boss wants.''' That not only makes you look weak, he
added; it also undermines the chief executive's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Look for ways to convey the boss's interest in a project without
conveying her meddling tendencies, DuBrin suggested. ``Say things
like: `The CEO is very excited about what we're doing.' Or, `She
thinks our plans fit right into the corporate strategy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, changing people's perceptions is only part of the
struggle. For the sake of your own career development, you should
keep working to increase your independence and authority. While
having the boss make all the decisions may make your job easier in
the short term, Fritz said, ``it's unlikely that you're learning a
whole heck of a lot being a conduit for an egomaniac.'' &QL;

A NEW KIND OF FED WATCH: THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During a House Banking Committee hearing earlier
this month, Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., warmly praised Robert E.
Rubin, the outgoing Treasury secretary. Then he turned to Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who was sitting beside
Rubin at the witness table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to put you under protective custody,'' Bachus told
Greenspan. ``I hope you're well guarded and have good doctors
advising you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Greenspan does not have many enemies these days, and at 73
he is apparently healthy and shows no signs of decamping to a
retirement condo. But Bachus had a point.
</P>
<P>
   Especially with Rubin's resignation, Greenspan is the embodiment
of economic policy in the United States. His departure, under any
circumstances, would create a crisis of confidence. And it is hard
to see an obvious replacement waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's third four-year term as Fed chairman will expire in
just over a year. He has not given any public hint about his plans.
The betting in Washington is that he will choose to stay for
another term, that President Clinton will be happy to nominate him
and that the Senate will confirm him expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan could still prove to be less out of the Cal Ripken
mold _ an Iron Man soldiering on, but at risk of playing past his
prime _ and more of a Michael Jordan, choosing to retire while on
top of his game. For an economic policy maker, on top might be
defined as next year, when the current expansion will become the
longest in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, since Greenspan's willingness and ability to serve
another term are not sure things, speculation has begun about who
will be tapped to succeed him, whenever he goes. Here is a
handicapper's guide to likely entries in the race. (The list would
look very different if that moment comes after a new president is
elected, especially if it is a Republican.)
</P>
<P>
   _ William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, is on nearly everyone's list. He is the leading
candidate from within the Federal Reserve, if only because of the
key role the New York Fed plays in monitoring the financial system
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A former banker and diplomat, he played an important part in
orchestrating the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management last year,
and is active in efforts to strengthen global banking standards.
But while he is well known on Wall Street, he is little known in
Washington. And although he votes loyally with Greenspan on
interest rate policy, he has never established a strong public
reputation as an inflation fighter. Early line: 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   _ As vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alice M. Rivlin
is an obvious candidate, and within the White House the notion of
appointing a woman to the post has some appeal. But while she is a
well-respected economist, she is viewed with some suspicion on Wall
Street, and she may have diminished her influence within the Fed by
spending much of her time helping the District of Columbia clean up
its finances. Early line: 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Janet L. Yellen, chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers, is also seen by administration insiders as a
viable candidate. A former Fed governor, she has a strong
reputation among academic economists as well as Washington
experience. But some analysts question whether she has the
leadership qualities a Fed chief needs. Early line: 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other long shot candidates include Laurence H. Meyer, who was
appointed a Fed governor by Clinton and is the board's most
outspoken proponent of orthodox inflation fighting (20-1). Outside
of the Fed, Clinton could turn to a corps of executives who move
between the worlds of Washington and finance. Among them is
Franklin D. Raines, the former White House budget chief, who is now
chief executive at Fannie Mae (25-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Of course, Clinton has two other candidates he can call on in
a pinch. One is Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy Treasury secretary
and Clinton's nominee to succeed Rubin. A brilliant economist and a
forceful personality, Summers has all the gravitas the Fed job
requires and seems to be learning the art of keeping his mouth
closed when circumstances dictate, a requirement for any Fed
chairman. Among his fans is Greenspan, who publicly endorsed his
nomination as Treasury secretary. Should Clinton need him more at
the Fed than at Treasury, Summers would be the clear favorite
(2-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Then there is Bob Rubin. The outgoing Treasury secretary shows
no signs of wanting to come back to Washington. Moreover, he is not
an economist, and could find the intricacies of monetary policy
heavy going. But his reputation on Wall Street is second only to
that of Greenspan. And if there were a crisis, and the president
called ... (a lead-pipe cinch, but only under those unlikely
circumstances).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, is there a second to that motion for protective
custody?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLTON, Kan. _ How important are General Motors' full-size
pickups? Check out Wall Street's numbers or Main Street's traffic.
These are the company's most popular products, with some 700,000
sold annually.
</P>
<P>
   They are lucrative, returning several thousand dollars in profit
for each one sold. They also serve as the basis for a fleet of big
sport utilities that account for another 400,000 even more
profitable sales.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with demand exceeding supply, GM hopes to ramp up
production this year to build an additional 300,000 trucks and
sport utilities. If it succeeds, it could end up with $30 billion
in annual sales off this platform _ enough to rank 34th on the
Fortune 500 list, exceeding the value of all the microchips from
Intel, all the drugs from Merck, all the sodas and snack foods from
Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   GM can use a runaway hit, particularly as it loses its longtime
ranking as the world's largest industrial company. Ford will claim
that title this week as GM spins off its huge Delphi parts
operation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer anecdotal evidence to raw numbers, look at the
streets of Middle America. In this town of 4,000 a half-hour from
Topeka, where the economic focus long ago shifted from farming to
commuting, one thing has not changed. A lot of the folks here,
where I grew up, like Chevy pickups.
</P>
<P>
   You see them in many of the parking spaces around the monumental
county courthouse, and they are lined up at the Dairy Queen
drive-through. Along some streets there seems to be a pickup
wearing a Chevy bow tie in almost every driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks account for 6 of every 10 sales at Clark Chevrolet
Oldsmobile Pontiac Buick, said Bernie Clark, who co-owns the
dealership with his two brothers, and 90 percent of those trucks
are full-sized Silverados. Once relegated to the farm or job site,
they now routinely provide family transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Like most truck owners, Clark's customers are stubbornly loyal;
about 80 percent are repeat buyers. Over the years _ the family's
ties to the dealership date to 1947 _ some customers have driven
away in as many as 15 pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Such loyalty helps to explain why GM has changed everything
about its full-size trucks except the essential way they look. The
styling is new, sure, but even a trained eye must look twice to
tell a '99 from a '98. GM says this is by design, and it marshalls
surveys indicating that many consumers find the Ford F-Series too
cute and the Dodge Ram too brutal. But one has to believe that
others, after plunking down as much as $33,000, want the neighbors
to know they've sprung for something new. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And under the skin, the Silverado certainly is new. After a
10-year run for the C/K series, GM put its might into making its
replacement a success. It came up with new engines, a new frame,
new brakes. The crowning touch is a classy cabin that makes the
competition's look, well, truck-like.
</P>
<P>
   The Silverado isn't perfect but it is genuinely pleasant, and it
sets new standards for pickups. Not that the C/K is bad _ it
remains, despite its dated design, one of the more pleasant pickups
to drive _ but the Silverado handles more securely, accelerates
more briskly, consumes less fuel and provides far more comfort and
convenience. (The C/K is still being built in two plants, alongside
Silverados, to fill fleet orders.)
</P>
<P>
   There are five engine choices: The 4.3-liter V6 is carried over,
but the 4.8- and 5.3-liter V8's are new, though based on the
aluminum Corvette engine. There is also a new 6-liter V8 for
three-quarter-ton trucks. And, for those who want to move
mountains, there is a 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8 producing 440
foot-pounds of peak torque. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices start around $16,000 for a plain two-wheel-drive model.
The truck I drove in Kansas, a two-wheel-drive LS 1500 extended
cab, had a list price of $26,692; in New York, I had a
four-wheel-drive LS priced at $32,203. I also tested an
extended-cab GMC Sierra SLT _ except for its nose, the Sierra is
much the same _ with a rounded Sportside bed; its sticker was just
over $33,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All three test vehicles were equipped the way most of these
trucks will be, with the 5.3-liter V8. It is a honey, another
example of how GM has put new life in old pushrod designs. Ford,
meanwhile, has switched to more modern overhead-cam V8s that will
allow it to cut truck emissions next year to the stricter level
required of cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy engine is smooth and gutsy, producing 270 horsepower
and peak torque of 315 foot-pounds, and it ought to please most
everyone from hockey mom to cattle hauler. The torque curve has
been flattened for more pulling power at a wider range of engine
speeds. And in the event of coolant loss, the truck can be driven
to a garage. The four-speed automatic transmission (a five-speed
manual is standard) felt rugged and workmanlike; it offers a
``tow/haul mode'' that shifts at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel-drive pickups are available with a transfer case that
engages all four wheels automatically when it senses a loss of
traction, along with a standard four-wheel setting and a low range
for serious muck.
</P>
<P>
   Silverados now come with either of two types of steering.
Lightweight two-wheel-drive models get a nimble rack-and-pinion
system, while four-wheel-drive trucks have a conventional
recirculating ball that can stand up to heavy use. The latter
system can seem numb at times, but I still prefer it to the
detached feel of the Ford or the Dodge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Silverado still handles like a pickup, but its behavior is
honest and balanced. The chassis keeps you aware of its limits,
giving you confidence in how the Silverado will behave in any
maneuver. A dignified highway cruiser, the truck is quite
maneuverable in town and unruffled on winding back roads. Some cars
should do so well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with the brakes, never before anything to brag
about. There are disks front and back with 40 percent larger pads.
A four-wheel anti-lock function is standard. Stops are sure and
straight and the pedal is firm now, not spongy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ride, too, is car-like, refined and quiet on all but the
worst roads. The optional firm-ride suspension indeed stiffens the
ride, but it adds little to the handling.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the improvements, the cabin stands out; a lot of thought
went into the needs of pickup owners. The outside mirrors are large
and handsome and the inside door handles are big and easy to grip.
The glove box is split into compartments (even the cargo box can be
divided by thirds).
</P>
<P>
   The gauges are large and legible, and there is an information
center that relays up to 18 messages, from ``cargo lamp on'' to
``transmission fluid hot.'' The knobs are durable and the buttons
are big and chunky. Window and lock controls are lighted at night,
just like those in a nice sedan. Power is retained after the key is
switched off, letting you roll up the windows or catch the end of a
song. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are some sour notes, but they are fairly minor. There are
so many pieces to the dash and console that there seems to be seams
everywhere; imagine trying to clean up a spilled Coke. The optional
CD player is down near the center console, far from the radio. The
ashtray, lighter and two auxiliary outlets reside under a
top-hinged lid that hides them even when open.
</P>
<P>
   The usual GM cruise control switches on the turn signal stalk
are awkward to use and, typically, the cruise had trouble holding a
set speed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One design oddity: The most prominent place on the overhead
console is a blank panel. Buttons for GM's Onstar driver service
may eventually go there; meanwhile, it is a waste of prime real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   And, shucks, I have more gripes: The door locks engage as the
truck moves, but when you stop you have to unlock them manually;
once parked, a handle pull should suffice. The console box is huge
and deep, but the lid won't stay open. And, as usual with GM
vehicles, the combination of daytime running lights _ I'm not a fan
_ and automatic light control can be baffling: Are the headlights
on, or the driving lights? Do I need to switch the lights off, or
will they go out on their own? Why do the lights have to be on if I
want to idle inconspicuously?
</P>
<P>
   My favorite thing about the Silverado may be the optional
six-way power seats, which just could be the best ones GM has ever
put in an American vehicle. Accommodating for anyone up to World
Wrestling Federation size, they are highly adjustable and good
looking. The headrests are good and the lumbar adjustments are
great, taking the lower backrest from pillow-soft to rock-hard.
Safety belts are mounted to the seats, simplifying access to the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the back seats in extended cabs have ranged from
unpleasant to ridiculous. But here finally is a rear seat where
adults can sit in reasonable comfort. The bottom cushion is 2.4
inches longer, and there are four more inches of leg room.
</P>
<P>
   The backrest is slanted, not bolt-upright, and there are even
two headrests, a cup holder and ventilation ducts. There is a price
to pay for this spaciousness, though; the cab's longer roofline
looks a bit ungainly.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from these nits, does the Silverado have an Achilles heel?
Aside from the conservative styling, there's just one thing: Until
fall, you cannot buy a Silverado with a fourth door. This is no
small oversight: Buyers of extended-cab pickups have expressed a
clear preference for two small rear-hinged doors. The Silverado's
third door, on the passenger side, always seemed to be where the
cargo and passengers were not.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that it wanted to be sure it had a safe, solid
design before it brought out a four-door Silverado. That is
commendable. But after Dodge brought out its Ram Quad Cab, Ford
quickly matched it, then offered four doors for all its trucks.
GM's tardiness points up, once again, how slow reaction times force
the company to keep playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, GM has done a remarkable job of fundamentally remaking
the modern full-size truck. But it will rest at its peril; already
Toyota is showing off its new, full-size Tundra. Toyota's last
effort, the T-100, was, uncharacteristically, a disappointment, but
this is a company that doesn't make the same mistakes twice.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time Ford and Dodge remake their big trucks in a few
years, you can bet they'll have dissected the Silverado down to the
tiniest screw. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: One door short of star status. &QL;

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Regionalism has been a powerful force in China
from time immemorial. In the best of times, cities and provinces
sniff disdainfully at one another and implement policies to guard
their resources from their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst of times, regions battle for land and power. Under
the People's Republic, regionalism has been contained but not
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial governments still set up checkpoints to keep locally
grown grain from being transported to other provinces. Cities
require taxicab fleets to buy locally produced cars and foreign
companies to purchase locally made parts. Every coastal city has to
have its own deep water port and every province its own airline.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the strangest regional competitions yet, every
city that can afford one suddenly wants its own world-class opera
house. Now leading the competition is Shanghai, whose gleaming
Grand Theater opened last September. The $150 million building in
glass and steel is up to the minute technologically, with French
design, German construction, a Japanese stage and American
acoustics. A separate concert hall is to open by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Shenzhen, a city of four million people that
just 15 years ago was a fishing village, an opera house is also to
be completed by Jan. 1. In Nanjing, bidding is under way for a
grand theater to serve the province of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed at being left behind, the central government in
Beijing has resuscitated plans for a National Grand Theater, with a
2,500-seat opera house as well as a concert hall, a theater and a
chamber auditorium. Expected to cost $400 million, it will be twice
the size of the Shanghai Grand Theater.
</P>
<P>
   But although the project has been planned since 1958 and was
most recently scheduled to be completed in 2002, two rounds of
bidding have so far failed to produce a design on which China's top
leaders can agree. Beijing's inability even to settle on a
blueprint, while Shanghai presents operas, orchestras and ballets
from around the world in its new theater, has further fueled the
barely civil rivalry between China's two major cities.
</P>
<P>
   When the failure of the second round of bidding was announced,
Internet chat rooms in which young residents of Shanghai and
Beijing usually insult each other's soccer teams suddenly turned to
a discussion of opera houses. While many from Beijing attacked
Shanghai for selling out to foreigners with its French design,
those from Shanghai crowed that Beijing shouldn't even try to
construct an opera house because anything it builds would
inevitably collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (Beijing's new train station, touted as the best in Asia when it
opened in 1996, has been crumbling at an alarming rate, and six
people involved in its construction have been arrested for
corruption.)
</P>
<P>
   This sudden urge to build ``grand theaters'' with opera houses
as their centerpiece has little to do with opera, and few pretend
otherwise. Rather, an opera house is seen as a means for a city
``to distinguish itself not only for its industry, commerce and
finance but also for its culture,'' in the words of Chen Zhili,
when she was deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Every city in China wants to be seen as modern and cultured, and
an opera house is considered the best way to project that image.
Yet once an opera house is built, the spotlight necessarily turns
from the structure itself to the opera that is supposed to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting for an opera house since the beginning of
New China,'' said Zhou Xiaoyan, the director of the Zhou Xiaoyan
Opera Center at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. ``And now
there's an opera house, it's a great thing, and we are happy. But
an opera house is not a piece of jewelry to look at. It must have
things inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhou is one of a small group of Chinese artists who have
devoted their lives to Western opera. Educated by Italian Catholic
missionaries, she developed a love for opera early in life. She
went to Paris to study voice in 1938 only to find herself trapped
there during the German occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to China in 1947, she became famous as a teacher and
singer, performing a repertory of Chinese and Western songs. But
when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, her love of opera and
her overseas education caused her to be labeled a ``cow ghost and
snake spirit'' and sent to the countryside to live in a ``cowshed''
for intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   She never sang again after the Cultural Revolution, but she was
rehabilitated in 1976 and resumed teaching, and in 1988 she founded
her opera school. Though well past retirement age, she is at her
piano, teaching, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The tortuous path of Ms. Zhou's career reflects the brief
history of Western opera in China. It was introduced in the early
part of this century by Chinese students who had studied in Japan,
Wang Shiguang, the president of the National Opera and Ballet in
Beijing, explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really there are two roots to China's modern opera, the
800-year history of Chinese opera and the introduction of European
opera by Chinese students,'' Wang said. ``Then with World War II
and other special circumstances, modern opera developed. European
opera is easier to move people's hearts, and Verdi is good for
encouraging struggle, too. So many more modern operas were
created.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, China's first opera company was established in Beijing.
It consisted mainly of amateur artists who had worked in
anti-Japanese propaganda troupes. Many musicians had left for
Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek, so orchestras had to be rebuilt and
Western instruments acquired. Opera professionals from the
Tchaikovsky Institute in Moscow came to help, and soon China's
conservatories began to produce instrumentalists and singers.
</P>
<P>
   Several operas by Chinese composers were presented in the early
1950s, followed in 1958 by ``La Traviata,'' the first full foreign
opera staged in Communist China. (``La Traviata'' was also the
first opera staged in old China, performed by Russians at the Lu
Xun Theater in 1920. Its popularity undoubtedly stems as much from
that of its source, Dumas's ``Dame aux Camelias,'' which in 1893
became one of the first foreign novels translated into Chinese, as
from Verdi's struggle-inspiring music.) Opera continued to develop
in the early 1960s, with an emphasis on Chinese-created works,
until the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cultural Revolution was a catastrophe for us,'' Wang said.
``Everything we had done was ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophe was nationwide. Shanghai's company did not
perform at all between June 1966 and May 1976. Recovery took
several years, and a generation of performers was essentially lost.
Since there were few opportunities in China even after the Cultural
Revolution, talented singers sought scholarships to study overseas
and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera in China was like a desert until 10 years ago,'' said
Chen Xiaoqun, a young soprano who studied in Salzburg for six years
and recently returned to Shanghai. ``Now things are more open. We
perform more foreign operas. Before it was all Chinese. We have
more exchanges with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen, like Ms. Zhou and Wang, supports the construction of
new opera houses in China as essential for furthering international
exchanges and allowing Chinese audiences to see how opera should be
performed. But she also believes that much more needs to be
invested in maintaining companies and mounting productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a waste if we invest so much in hardware but nothing
in software?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her complaints are echoed by virtually everyone in opera, from
performers to administrators. Financing for the arts is an
emotional issue in every country, but Chinese operatic artists have
sounder reasons than most to complain. The base monthly wage of an
opera singer in Shanghai is less than $50, the price of the
cheapest ticket to hear Jose Carreras when he sang at the Grand
Theater last September. (The best seats cost nearly $200.)
</P>
<P>
   Even with supplemental bonuses factored in, opera singers in
Shanghai do not earn enough to live on, and the situation in
Beijing is no better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Shanghai Opera has an audition, nobody tries out,''
Ms. Zhou said. ``They make no money, so they are all singing in the
Hilton. If you have no money, you can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, of the National Opera and Ballet, says that the government
has reduced his financing every year since 1988. What he did not
say, but many opera professionals do, is that the government has
not reduced its control in proportion to its financing. China's
opera companies, like all its performing arts troupes, are relics
of the Maoist system in which art was completely subservient to
politics but artists were completely supported by governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the current era of ``reform and opening,'' this system has
been recognized to be unsustainable. ``Reforms'' have included
merging arts groups, significantly reducing their subsidies and
requiring them to give annual tests to performers. Arts troupes
continue to labor under burdensome production quotas, and are not
allowed to release employees they do not need.
</P>
<P>
   Government approval, usually from the culture and propaganda
bureaucracies but sometimes from the Communist Party itself, is
still needed for new productions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most performing arts companies devote all their
energies to finding ways to meet salary and pension requirements
for current and retired employees. They open schools, run
restaurants and travel agencies or go into real-estate development.
Trying to do something new or creative that might sell tickets is
almost certain to invite opposition from one leader or another, so
few bother.
</P>
<P>
   Performing arts companies with their own theaters can mount
small productions cheaply, but neither the National Opera nor the
Shanghai Opera has its own theater. Theaters in both cities belong
to different bureaucracies and must be rented; staging an opera or
even presenting one in concert costs much more than it earns.
</P>
<P>
   Performing in public is thus the last thing many performing arts
groups choose to do. (The production quotas required to retain
subsidies can be met by staging small shows in schools and
factories.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem is so serious that before the Grand Theater was
built, the Shanghai Opera staged one major production a year; last
year it presented two, both co-productions with overseas companies.
As it stands now, nearly all opera in Shanghai is produced and
sponsored by an opera lover named Bonko Chan, who manages a
state-owned freight-forwarding company. Chan is also supporting one
of the two productions so far scheduled for this year, ``The Flying
Dutchman,'' with the Dusseldorf Opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bonko stops, opera stops,'' Ms. Zhou, of the Shanghai
Conservatory, said.
</P>
<P>
   Although corporate sponsorship of the arts is certainly
desirable, it should ideally not depend on one well-connected
person at one company. Opera artists, knowing the role tax
incentives and foundations play in supporting opera in the United
States, dream aloud of such a system here. Some also hope that
professional producers will enter the market, but they probably
will not so long as any mid-level bureaucrat can order a production
to be rewritten, recomposed, recast, redirected or canceled for any
reason, as is now the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, government-arranged co-productions, which draw
financial support from foreign governments and corporations, seem
sure to remain the primary vehicle for staging opera in both
Shanghai and Beijing. This arrangement appears at first glance to
be a good thing, and many support it. Co-productions bring
international directing, conducting and singing talent to China:
perhaps the best example is the ``Turandot'' staged last September
in the Forbidden City in Beijing by the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino
under the baton of Zubin Mehta and the direction of Zhang Yimou.
(The production, taped for video, will be telecast by PBS on June
9.)
</P>
<P>
   But some artists argue that co-productions deny Chinese singers
any opportunity to sing principal roles; principals are almost
always brought from overseas, and local principals are forced to
sing in the chorus. Audience expectations are raised by
co-productions, a good thing in itself, but in the current
situation, those expectations can never be met by a domestic
production.
</P>
<P>
   So nobody wants to see domestic productions, nobody wants to
stage them, and they will never improve. The situation is even
worse for Chinese-composed operas, which have little chance of
being staged in a co-production format.
</P>
<P>
   Few artists actually oppose co-productions; on the contrary,
most value the opportunity to work with outside professionals. But
many object to the government-controlled system that makes a
co-production the only viable way to stage an opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has the talent,'' said a Beijing-based director. ``We
could do it. But because of these cadres, these leaders, it's a
problem of the entire system. The officials' power is too great and
there is nothing we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Western opera in China has come a long way in a short time. But
if the nation's costly new opera houses are to be anything more
than pieces of jewelry, in Ms. Zhou's term, the system that governs
opera must be changed, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese city that truly wants to distinguish itself for its
culture and win the battle of the opera houses might do so with a
little more support for human talent and a little less interference
in artistic affairs.

SECURITY BROKER PLEADS QUILTY TO PERJURY AND FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hartley T. Bernstein, a well-known securities lawyer
in New York, pleaded guilty Thursday to securities fraud conspiracy
and perjury in Manhattan Federal court and agreed to forfeit
$850,000 in illegal proceeds made as an insider in five fraudulent
public stock offerings, federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's guilty pleas are the latest development in the
investigation by Mary Jo White, the United States attorney for the
southern district of New York, into Sterling Foster, a defunct
brokerage firm in Melville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Ms. White secured an indictment against Randolph
Pace, the former principal of Rooney Pace, a brokerage firm
expelled from the industry in 1988, which charged that Pace and
associates obtained more than $100 million in illegal profits
through six purportedly fraudulent offerings taken public by
Sterling Foster. The indictment also charges that Pace, who has
been barred from the securities industry, secretly controlled
Sterling Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Pace has denied wrongdoing in the matter. But the guilty pleas
by Bernstein, who prosecutors say was part of the Sterling Foster
inner circle, almost certainly turn up the heat on Pace. Robert G.
Morvillo, the lawyer representing Pace, expressed shock when told
of the pleadings. He declined to comment until he had read the
pleadings.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, 49, the former partner of Bernstein &AMP; Wasserman,
represented Sterling Foster and various companies that issued stock
to the public through the brokerage firm between 1994 and 1996. But
in addition to providing legal advice to his clients, according to
the United States attorney, Bernstein made loans totaling $150,000
to four companies that were later taken public by Sterling Foster:
Advanced Voice Technologies Inc., Com/Tech Communications
Technologies Inc., the Embryo Development Corp. and Applewoods Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein also received shares in Perry's Majestic Beer Inc.,
before it became a public company in an offering underwritten by
VTR Capital Inc. and Investors Associates.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a secret agreement, Bernstein received securities in
advance of the public offerings in return for his loans. Under the
arrangement, Bernstein agreed to sell his securities back to
Sterling Foster at the time of each offering at prices
substantially above his cost but below those paid by the investing
public.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the underwriters earned tens of millions of dollars
in illegal profits, representing the difference between the
below-market price paid to Bernstein for his shares and the market
price paid by public investors.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was kept secret from investors because in each
offering statement it was noted that those who had received stock
from the issuers in return for pre-initial public offering loans
were subject to lock-up agreements prohibiting them from selling
their securities until as long as two years after each offering.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, following the Applewoods stock offering, Bernstein
sold his securities through other brokerage firms at pre-arranged
times. He then kicked back the proceeds from these sales indirectly
to Sterling Foster, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bernstein committed perjury in testimony he gave before
the Securities and Exchange Commission in January 1998 relating to
whether any agreements existed surrounding the sale of his stock in
Perry's Majestic Beer.
</P>
<P>
   A former assistant in the Manhattan district attorney's office,
Bernstein represented small investors in securities arbitration
cases against brokerage firms during the 1980s. He changed sides in
the 1990s when he began representing small brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein represented Stratton Oakmont, a brokerage firm that
was closed by regulators in 1996, and Biltmore Securities, a
brokerage firm in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which has also been the
subject of numerous regulatory actions.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the plea deal, Ms. White said: ``Complicated criminal
schemes such as these often require the expertise of lawyers,
accountants and other professionals, whose credibility and
expertise are used to sell the scheme to the unsuspecting public.
For that reason, dishonest professionals pose a special danger to
the investing public and will continue to be aggressively
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein faces a total of 15 years in prison and fines of
$750,000 as a result of the guilty pleas. His lawyer, Scott Edelman
of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, did not return a phone call
seeking comment.

THE PENTAGON OPPOSES ONE BID BY LITTON, BUT NOT ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La.)  (rk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Defense Department said Thursday night that it was
recommending against Litton Industries' unfriendly bid for Newport
News Shipbuilding Inc. on the grounds that the proposed union would
cause too much concentration in the military shipbuilding business.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the findings of the Navy, the Pentagon has told the
companies involved in the deal that it would oppose the takeover,
which Litton announced earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Pentagon will not oppose a separate bid by
Litton, which already makes Navy destroyers, to acquire Avondale
Industries, a New Orleans-based maker of auxiliary naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has indicated to all interested parties that the
Navy, in principle, has no objection to Litton's acquisition of
Avondale Industries,'' said a top Pentagon official. ``The
Litton-Newport News transaction is more complex and presents
numerous challenges for the Navy'' that the official said ``could
not be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton, which is based in Woodland Hills, Calif., had proposed
earlier this month to acquire Newport News for $1.3 billion, plus
the assumption of $600 million in debt, and to buy Avondale for
about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Navy was concerned that there would be two
competitors, not three, for most classes of Navy ships and it was
not convinced that possible cost savings from a Litton-Newport News
merger would be sufficient to justify the reduction in competition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Navy was concerned that the bulk of its
research and development dollars would largely be directed to one
shipyard if the Litton-Newport News deal were approved.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Defense Department spokesman, said
that the Pentagon was not asked to make a formal evaluation of the
proposed deal but, ``when we learned of the merger plan, we made
this preliminary assessment and this is how we came out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have informally conveyed these preliminary views to these
three companies and to interested parties on the Hill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday said that with the Litton-Avondale merger, ``there
were no significant anticompetitive effects and there was
substantial potential for savings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a Litton-Newport News merger, he added, ``the
effects on competition were in no way offset by the savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's decision comes at a time of musical chairs in the
military shipbuilding business. First, Newport News made a bid for
Avondale. Then, General Dynamics made a bid for Newport News _ and
found that bid blocked earlier this year by the Pentagon on
antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Litton is finding that the Pentagon will let part of its
double bid for Newport News and Avondale to go through, while
opposing the biggest part of it.
</P>
<P>
   This turn of events leaves Avondale in the position of now
having two suitors _ a $500 million offer from Litton and a $470
million offer from Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   It would also leave the nation with, potentially, three large
shipbuilders: General Dynamics, best known as a maker of nuclear
submarines; Newport News, the sole maker of nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers, and Litton, one of two makers of Navy destroyers
and the eighth largest military contractor before this round of
bidding began.

   LOS ANGELES _ On a cool spring Sunday in the Watts section of
Los Angeles, the photographer Dana Lixenberg watched as Monique
King Cade, a longtime resident of the Imperial Courts housing
project, looked through a box of 50 postcard-size portraits. They
were taken six years ago by Ms. Lixenberg during the second Rodney
King trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King Cade, known as China, barely looked at the photograph
of herself, in which, her hair in rollers and sporting large gold
earrings, she appears lost in thought. She chose instead to look at
others Ms. Lixenberg had photographed and talk about their fates.
Some were dead; some, she said, were ``in the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Amsterdam and now a commercial photographer in New York,
Ms. Lixenberg, 34, had returned to these two-storied, faded-aqua
apartments to pass out invitations to her first American
exhibition, which opened at the Los Angeles Center for Photographic
Studies in Hollywood on May 15 and remains on view through June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Her 40-by-30-inch Imperial Courts portraits, hanging alongside
another series taken in 1998 of women living in a homeless shelter
in Jeffersonville, Ind., look disconcertingly formal. They are
indicative of a new documentary photography that is turning its
back on the often graphic, verite styles of the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Lixenberg's photographs are reminiscent of the more
studied approach used by photographers earlier in this century.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strong tradition, practiced by, among others, a
photographer Ms. Lixenberg admires, August Sander, who set out to
catalogue all of German society. The tradition has strong roots in
this country, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American photographers, such as Prentice Herman Polk
working in Tuskegee, have a long history of photographing ordinary
people in formal circumstances,'' said Carla Williams, the
co-author with Deborah Willis of ``The Black Female Body in
Photography.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Pitts, the director of photography at Vibe magazine,
pointed out that Ms. Lixenberg exhibits more than formalism in her
work. ``She brings a degree of compassion while at the same time
maintaining a detachment,'' he said. ``This allows a viewer to come
into the picture and understand the emotions of those she's
photographing.''
</P>
<P>
   These qualities appealed to Aleim Johnson, a member of
Knowtribe, the arts organization sponsoring Ms. Lixenberg's
exhibition. ``Her photographs allow for a complex understanding of
lives which are dehumanized on an almost daily basis,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for these portraits came in late 1992, when Ms.
Lixenberg went to Los Angeles for the Dutch weekly Vrij Nederland
to photograph a story on the aftermath of the riots. When she
departed, she said, she felt she ``had only documented the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, when asked to submit some photographs to an
exhibition organized by Foto Festival Naarden in her homeland, she
decided her subject would be portraits of gang members in Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Los Angeles, Ms. Lixenberg enlisted the help of
Tony Bogard, a community activist who was involved in negotiating a
truce between the Crips and the Bloods gangs. (He was murdered in
January 1994 by a member of the P.J. Watts Crips.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony asked me if this was some kind of sociological project,
and he wanted to know what they were going to get out of it,'' Ms.
Lixenberg recalled. She had no idea how the project would evolve,
but she assured her interrogators that she was determined to
produce photographs that would challenge the prevailing view of a
daily life made up solely of one violent act after another.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing weeks, Ms. Lixenberg drove to the Imperial Courts
every afternoon, parked her car in the same small lot across 115th
street, set up her camera and took portraits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I felt like `the other,''' she recalled. ``I was
this white girl, and I represented a group of people that they
didn't view in such a positive light, but I didn't feel any
negative attitude toward me.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``not being a white American certainly made a
difference.'' This not only helped her gain acceptance but
influenced her own perceptions. ``I was not weighed down by certain
preconceptions that a photographer from some other part of Los
Angeles might have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning in Watts, Ms. Lixenberg decided to abandon what
was then the staple of the documentary photographer, the 35-mmr
single-lens reflex camera. She wanted to work with the larger
format 4-by-5-inch field camera, which meant using a tripod. The
time involved in composing each picture insured that everyone would
be a full participant in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a 35-millimeter camera, people never know when they are
being photographed,'' Ms. Lixenberg said. ``This can make a great
picture, but it might not have anything much to do with the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lixenberg avoided placing her subjects against backdrops
laden with meaning _ a graffiti-covered wall, for example. ``I
didn't want to use the environment to illustrate a point,'' she
said. ``I wanted to cut everything away and focus on the person.
And I hoped that viewers, even if they didn't know anything about
Watts, would see these photographs simply as portraits and then
take the time to really look at the people in them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since she undertook this project, Ms. Lixenberg has
acquired a considerable reputation as a commercial photographer.
Her celebrity assignments for magazines have ranged from Sean
(Puffy) Combs to Barbara Walters to Paul Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard to reconcile,'' Ms. Lixenberg said. ``It's not
that I've made money on the Imperial Courts pictures, but they have
done a lot for me. They helped deepen my work. Yet when I go back
there, I can see that life hasn't moved forward much in six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that time has stood still in Watts. When, on her return
visit, Ms. Lixenberg showed Wyking West his portrait, he was
startled. Taken during a period of high gang tension, the
photograph shows West, known by his neighbors as Lee-Capone,
wearing an unbuttoned black shirt that exposed a silver chain and
ring of large beads.
</P>
<P>
   West projects a range of seemingly contradictory emotions:
defiance, anxiety, as well as a sense of fleeting peace.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Sunday afternoon, West, who now works the night
shift at a bookbinder, was more casually dressed in a short-sleeved
checked shirt, a golf hat pulled low and baggy blue jeans. As he
examined his own portrait, he remarked, ``I look better now than
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. Lixenberg approached a group of young men washing a
car. Looking through the portraits, they reacted, often humorously,
to the superficial changes, especially weight gain or loss and the
passing of gang fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But like everyone else encountered this day, they asked Ms.
Lixenberg for one particular photograph, that of Spider, fatally
wounded some years before. This image of an almost smiling young
man, wearing a shower cap and taking a drag from a cigarette, is
how they wanted to remember their friend.

BASEBALL COACH WAYNE GRAHAM USHERS IN A NEW RICE AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Wayne Graham was growing up on Houston's North Side, his
father had the most marvelous job he could imagine. He was an usher
at Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' said Graham, now 63. ``For a kid then, it was
just fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the heyday of the Jess Neely football teams, and I got
to go to all the games free. They were a national power and they
had huge crowds, and I got to see all those guys ... George
Walmsley, Tobin Rote, Froggie Williams, Dicky Maegle ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And I always thought, `Gee, what a wonderful place, what a
great school. How could it ever get any better than this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Owls' athletic programs have hit a bump or two in
the intervening years. But ever since Graham returned in 1992 as
the baseball coach, one vestige of the old days has been rapidly
gathering steam:
</P>
<P>
   In college baseball today, Rice is about as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Owls (52-11) open play as the top-seeded team in
Lubbock today, they will be appearing in their fifth consecutive
NCAA regional baseball tournament. They finished the regular season
ranked first, first, second and third nationally in the four major
polls and swept through the Western Athletic Conference tournament,
running their three-year record in that venue to 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, they have won 230 games and produced
four first-round draft picks. The 1997 team won the regional in
Lubbock to earn the school's first berth in the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. This year's team has set a school record for
victories and is regarded as having a strong chance to produce
Rice's second CWS team. In addition, construction has begun on a
new $6.5 million stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Bubba Crosby, who last year followed Jose Cruz
Jr., Matt Anderson and Lance Berkman as first-round picks in the
amateur draft, ``They owe all of this to Wayne Graham; what he has
done at that school is amazing.''  &LR; subheds:Building a reputation
When he enrolled at San Jacinto College, a two-year college, four
years ago, Damon Thames wasn't thinking much about Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in this \RHouston\S area, I had heard of him,''
said Thames, the Owls' senior shortstop. ``I knew he had built up
the program at Rice, but that's all. But I sure learned a lot about
him when I got to San Jac. His name is all over that campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Transferring to Rice last year, Thames hit .424 with 36 doubles,
26 home runs and 115 runs batted in. He was named the national
player of the year by the American Baseball Coaches Association and
was drafted by the New York Yankees. He chose to return to Rice for
his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, everybody knows it's a great school,'' he said. ``But
the thing about this program is that you come here, and you get
better. Coach Graham has pretty much done it all _ he played
professional baseball, he was in the major leagues, he won all
those national championships \Rfive\S at San Jac, and you learn a
lot from him and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they're doing, and you just keep getting
better. Besides, I wanted to win a national championship, and I
think we can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same thing Graham said seven years ago. It seemed a
quaint notion at the time, since the Owls had never won a Southwest
Conference title, let alone anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham had played college baseball for Bibb Falk at Texas
and later sat on the New York Mets bench next to Casey Stengel. He
had turned the San Jac Gators into the most feared junior college
baseball team in America, launching his run with a promising young
pitcher named Roger Clemens. Graham was not joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought we could win here \Rat Rice\S,'' he said. ``I
knew we would always have to pay more \Rin tuition\S for fewer
players; that we would probably not have any depth, and there would
be no margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough school academically, and I knew we would not have
access to some of the most promising recruits because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But \Rassistant coach\S Jon Prather has done a superhuman job
in recruiting, and with Chris Feris, we have a very close-knit
staff. We work well together.''  &LR; subheds:Learning from top teachers
After his career at UT, Graham spent a decade in the minor leagues
_ seeing the world by bus, along with three years of winter ball in
South America. He made two brief trips to the majors with the
Phillies and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on his wall is a cherished memento _ a picture of him
receiving the ``most popular player'' award when he hit .316 with
the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers in 1962 in the American Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I got it was because the guy who was really
the most popular player got called up to the majors,'' Graham said.
``But I learned a lot in those days. I played alongside guys like
Luis Aparicio and Jim Fregosi, and when I went to the Mets I spent
a lot of time sitting next to Stengel on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was amazing. Throughout the entire game he would be
pointing out little things that nobody else saw. After the game,
when the writers showed up, he would go into that mumbo-jumbo
routine that made him so famous _ but during the game he was all
business. And he knew a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you could say that anyone molded my coaching style, I
guess it was Falk. People now characterize me as being very blunt,
and that's the way he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the style, it works. Almost from the beginning _ with
the recruitment of Cruz and those who followed, the program got
better.
</P>
<P>
   For Graham, the pivotal moment came at the end of the '95 season
when the Owls _ making their first appearance in a regional _
rolled into Baton Rouge, La., and defeated host LSU twice, ending
the Tigers' season. Rice went on to lose in the regional finals to
California State-Fullerton, the eventual national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the defining moment for this program,'' he
said. ``After that, we knew we were headed in the right
direction.''  &LR; subheds:Visit to Omaha In '97, led by Berkman, who
hit .431 with 41 homers and 134 RBI, and Anderson, whose fastball
was clocked at 97 mph, that direction took them all the way to
Omaha and the CWS. The team's chances died in the opening game,
when LSU _ en route to a national title _ beat Anderson with a
ninth-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team was actually a little thin on pitching,'' Graham
said. ``Also, it was our first time up there. If we can get there
again, we may do better.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new regional-super regional format designed to favor
teams with strong pitching, the Owls _ with a starting rotation of
Mario Ramos (12-1), Jeff Nichols (13-2) and Kenny Baugh (10-2) _
could be in good shape. The fourth starter, Marc Gwyn (7-1), has
recently defeated seventh-ranked Baylor and won the final game in
the WAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham, who has worn uniform No. 37 throughout his career
because he saw Doak Walker play against the Owls a half-century
ago, retains the ability to think a little like that awe-struck
kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago,'' he says, ``a guy came up and shook my hand and
told me how proud everyone was of the job we were doing. It was
Froggie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. ``Froggie Williams''!''

WASHINTON JUSTICE WITHDRAWS NOMINATION TO 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washinton State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Durham is set to
withdraw her nomination to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
telling Sen. Slade Gorton Thursday night that her husband is
suffering from a terminal heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Durham was recovering from eye surgery Thursday and was not
available for comment. It was not certain whether her husband's
illness would cause her to step down from the state Supreme Court
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Durham was nominated to the federal appellate court by President
Clinton earlier this year. It was part of an agreement between the
state's two senators and the White House aimed at ending a long
logjam in judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Under provisions of the deal, worked out by Gorton and White
House Counsel Charles Ruff, the GOP senator agreed not to block
judicial candidates backed by the Clinton administration. In
return, the White House agreed to nominate Durham, a conservative,
to the 9th Circuit and to give Gorton a role in choosing district
court judges.
</P>
<P>
   Top aides for both Gorton and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said
that the agreement will remain in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to Senator Murray's office and the White House,
and both express concern and sadness about the situation,'' said
Tony Williams, Gorton's chief of staff. ``What we suggested is that
Slade would like to provide a handful of prominent people to
consider as a replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Desimone, Murray's top aide, voiced general approval but
added that ``the eventual (9th Circuit) nominee would have to be
acceptable to both senators.''
</P>
<P>
   This marks the second time Gorton has been frustrated in an
effort to pick a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he backed the U.S. District Court nomination of
Seattle lawyer Monty Gray. Gray was forced to withdraw, however,
after it was disclosed that as a student at Princeton in the 1960s,
he headed a student group that defended segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Durham, a self-described ``conservative Republican,'' faced a
confirmation battle, which she was favored to win. A legal advocacy
group, the Alliance for Justice, announced it would fight the
nomination on grounds of her ``inappropriately zealous advocacy''
of capital punishment and conservative rulings on workplace safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Justice criticized appearances that Durham made
on a Seattle radio talk show during her 1996 re-election campaign.
On one program, she discussed a ``notorious example'' of a
California death penalty case in which ``the liberal justices on
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals'' granted a stay of execution to a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Durham has been a state Supreme Court justice since 1985 and
recently completed a term as chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate has been slow to confirm
judicial nominees. Counting six nominations made Thursday by
Clinton, a total of 44 judicial nominees currently await a hearing
and vote by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two local judicial nominations are currently before the
committee. Seattle attorney Ron Gould awaits confirmation to the
9th Circuit, and King County Superior Court Judge Marsha Pechman is
waiting for confirmation to the U.S. District Court bench. Pechman
was picked by Murray and Gorton to replace retiring U.S. District
Court judge William Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
has held up confirmations this year in an effort to force Clinton
to pick his nominee to a U.S. District Court vacancy in the
senator's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has pushed the nomination of Ted Stewart, chief of staff
to Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt. He is, however, strongly opposed by
environmental groups because of policies he pursued as Utah's
natural resources director.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said recently that he spoke with Clinton by phone to argue
for Stewart's nomination. Hatch has said in interviews that the
president assumed that his nominations were being held hostage to
Stewart's nomination ``and I did not disabuse him of that notion.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28 judges of the 9th Circuit _ five of whom sit in Seattle _
have become major shapers of environmental and social policy across
the American West.
</P>
<P>
   It was the appellate court that upheld Washington's law against
assisted suicides. The 9th Circuit recently ruled that the U.S.
Forest Service failed to conduct adequate environmental studies on
a sweeping land exchange with Weyerhaeuser. A three-judge panel is
currently considering whether to overturn a $5 billion damage
judgment against the Exxon Corp. stemming from the 1989 Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   But the court has seven vacancies. And the Senate has moved at a
particularly glacial pace to fill vacancies on the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle trial lawyer M. Margaret McKeown had to wait more than
two years to be confirmed to the 9th Circuit. University of
California law Professor William Fletcher was confirmed after a
three-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   One 9th Circuit nominee from California, Judge Richard Paez, has
waited more than three years and has yet to get a confirmation
hearing. Gould was nominated to the appellate court in September
1997.

TLC BEATRICE TO SELL REMAINING DIVISIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a quiet finale to what has been a sometimes stormy saga, the
remaining businesses of TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. _
potato chips and ice cream _ will be sold by the end of the summer
and what was once one of the nation's largest black-owned companies
will close its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Thursday that a Spanish company, La
Industrial Carbonica SA, a unit of Iberian Beverages Group, had
agreed to pay about $191 million for the ice cream business, which
is centered in Spain and the Canary Islands. TLC Beatrice's partner
in the business, Don Delfin Suarez, has an option to buy it at the
same price.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, TLC Beatrice is also seeking buyers for its
Tayto potato-chip business, based in Ireland. When both divisions
are sold, the proceeds will be divided among the shareholders in
TLC Beatrice. The company, formed by Reginald F. Lewis, who died in
1993, will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Loida Nicolas Lewis, who has been chief executive of TLC
Beatrice since 1994, said she had mixed feelings about the final
days of the company her husband put together after a $1 billion
leveraged buyout in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis _ who wrote an autobiography called ``Why Should White
Guys Have All the Fun?'' _ became a symbol of African-American
business success, to the point that Michael R. Milken named him as
an example of junk bonds benefiting minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it is closing a chapter on Lewis' life and
saying goodbye to a lot of business associates who were with the
company from the start,'' she said. ``At the same time, I am
relieved because I believe I have achieved the goals Lewis had when
he did the LBO, which was to maximize returns for the shareholders
while at the same time keeping the businesses he bought healthy and
ready for the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lewis, 56, took over the company a year after her husband
died of a brain tumor when he was 50. He had built TLC Beatrice
(the initials stand for ``The Lewis Company'') into a $2 billion
enterprise that did all of its business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The company's holdings included Franprix and Leader Price, two
supermarket chains in France, and a wholesale food business there.
There were also beverage companies in Holland, Belgium, Thailand
and France, in addition to the ice cream and potato-chip
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lewis, an immigration lawyer by training, quickly moved to
trim down the TLC Beatrice operation. She laid off employees, sold
the company jet, moved the New York headquarters into a lower floor
in the building at 9 West 57th St., where her husband had a
spacious office with views of Central Park, and by 1997 decided to
sell the supermarkets and the wholesale division.
</P>
<P>
   The leveraged buyout had left the company with a mountain of
debt, and proceeds from the sale were used to pay down that debt,
she said. Last year, the company had sales of $322 million.
</P>
<P>
   After Lewis died, the company was sued by one of its biggest
investors, Carlton Investments, which was a partnership formed by a
group of former Drexel Burnham Lambert executives. The partnership
had feuded with Lewis over what it termed his excessive
compensation, and the lawsuit challenged a $22.1 million payment he
received in 1992. Mrs. Lewis agreed to settle the suit and returned
about $15 million to the company because it was ``in the best
interest of the shareholders,'' she said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said that suit was totally without merit because he
earned his compensation,'' she said. ``What he took, he earned. As
far as I am concerned, he paid for it with his life. I was totally
indignant that they would not acknowledge that.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern for the shareholders led her to liquidate the company's
remaining assets, she said. About 51 percent of the company is held
by Mrs. Lewis and her two daughters, ages 19 and 26. ``It's now 12
years since 1987,'' she said. ``Lewis and his investors came
together in 1987, and now in 1999, it's time to get out together.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how well the various investors had done, she recalled
something her daughter said recently, regarding the sale. ``My
daughter said Dad would say, `Mom, go on with your bad self,''' she
said. ``It means I hit a home run.''

SMOKE-TRIBES (Phoenix) _ Former Navajo Tribal Chairman Albert Hale
has gotten 30 Indian nations around the country to sign on to a $1
billion lawsuit against tobacco companies. Hale expects to file the
suit next month. The suit is very similar to the state lawsuits
that led to billions in settlements.

POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS STILL CONTROL MILOSEVIC'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (With KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In handing up an indictment of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, the prosecutors have spoken. But, as has been
the case since the outbreak of the wars in the former Yugoslavia,
Milosevic's fate is still in the hands of politicians and
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he asked me what to do, I'd say just ignore the whole
thing, at least the legal aspects of it,'' said Alexandros
Lykourezos, a Greek lawyer who has advised Gen. Ratko Mladic, the
Bosnian Serb military commander who was indicted by the war crimes
tribunal in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pure political problem now,'' Lykourezos added in a
telephone interview from Athens.
</P>
<P>
   His assessment is shared by several international human rights
lawyers, who can easily list the political problems of trying to
enforce an indictment against someone like Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is legally important, that the head of state responsible
for massive human rights violations can be held personally
responsible by a criminal court, but it is going to require the
political will of the major states in the world to make it
meaningful,'' said Michael Posner, director of the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like the U.S. Supreme Court, the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia has no marshals to enforce its rulings.
So NATO, or some international police force, will have to muster
the political will to arrest Milosevic, and the four other Yugoslav
leaders whose indictment was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the political will that has been lacking with respect to
others indicted on charges of war crimes, such as Mladic and
Radovan Karadzic, political leader of the Bosnian Serbs, who remain
at large.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest warrants have been issued for the five, and they will
severely circumscribe the defendants' ability to travel. But if a
country like Iraq decided to give Milosevic asylum, he would be
relatively safe, because there is no body to enforce the order.
</P>
<P>
   The war crimes tribunal Thursday also issued an order to the
member countries of the United Nations to freeze assets belonging
to Milosevic and the other men. But its effectiveness will also
depend on whether countries want to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   American and European officials have said that Milosevic has
hidden assets in Greece, Switzerland, Russia, Lebanon and Cyprus,
which asserted this month that it had looked unsuccessfully for any
assets that belonged to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the indictment does not do is present any legal bar to
negotiating with Milosevic, legal experts said. But the United
States and NATO would not be able, as part of any negotiated
settlement of the Kosovo conflict, to grant Milosevic immunity from
prosecution, experts said. Such an agreement would not be binding
on the tribunal, because it is an independent body created by the
Security Council of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Lykourezos, the Athens lawyer, said that the only possible way
for Milosevic and the other defendants to obtain valid immunity
agreements would be for the Security Council to pass a resolution
granting the protections.
</P>
<P>
   Other international law experts questioned whether the Security
Council could do this, and Lykourezos acknowledged that there was
no legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
was established in 1993 to prosecute war crimes in the Balkans. All
U.N. countries are obligated to comply with tribunal orders, which
means that member countries would be required to arrest Milosevic
if he traveled inside their borders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Security Council has not taken action against countries
that decided to look the other way. For a long time, for instance,
Croatia refused to turn over several people who had been indicted
by the tribunal, and the Security Council did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe reported that ``there has been no notable
progress in Croatia's cooperation'' with the war crimes tribunal,
and that Croatia was still refusing to extradite two people who
have been indicted by the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unlikely that Milosevic would travel to another
country where he might risk arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Milosevic secure in Belgrade, however uncomfortable
that might be, unless NATO or some international force goes after
him.
</P>
<P>
   That seems highly unlikely considering that the Clinton
administration and other NATO governments have been unwilling to
use their forces in Bosnia to arrest Karadzic, who was indicted in
1995 on charges of genocide and other war crimes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Karadzic has been living in Pale, a mountain village in the Serb
region of Bosnia, near Sarajevo. The area is under the control of
French forces, and American officials often blame the French for
not arresting him.
</P>
<P>
   But, unwilling to risk any casualties, the Pentagon and White
House were long opposed to a military operation to seize him.
</P>
<P>
   In her visit to Washington last month, the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, urged that Karadzic be arrested, a plea
that she made in European capitals as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic and the others are eventually brought before the
tribunal, the case against them will be fairly easy to establish,
said Aryeh Neier, an expert on international war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be necessary to show that Milosevic participated in
the atrocities, or even ordered them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the power, and if you know the crimes are being
committed, and you do not do everything that is feasible to prevent
and suppress the commission of those crimes, then you are
culpable,'' Neier said.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic would certainly not be able to claim that he was
not aware of what was happening in Kosovo, Neier said, given
widespread public knowledge of the events.

NETWORKS' RATINGS SLIDE CONTINUES IN 1998-99 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the close of the 1998-99 season Wednesday night, the TV
broadcast networks have passed two more milestones in their long
descent.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, it seemed as if the entire nation was glued to
big-ticket network shows like ``Gunsmoke.'' Now, it seems as if
Dodge City has become the graveyard Boot Hill.
</P>
<P>
   This season, for the first time, no TV series averaged a 30
percent share of the viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER,'' the top-rated series _ a distinction the NBC medical
drama also held in the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons _ finished the
season with a 29 share. Last season, ``ER'' averaged a 34 share.
</P>
<P>
   In the heyday of network TV, through the 1970s, a 30 share was
considered a benchmark. A series that could not command a 30 share
was marked, unofficially, for early cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the mid-1980s, the phenomenally popular ``Cosby
Show'' regularly rattled off weekly shares between 50 and 60.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmentation of the television audience, thanks to the
spread of cable availability and proliferation of cable channels,
has diluted network ratings and shares.
</P>
<P>
   The second milestone also reflects that long-term trend. For the
first time, all of the networks fell to single-digit rating
averages.
</P>
<P>
   CBS ousted NBC and laid claim to the prime-time ratings crown
for the first time since the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
   CBS won with a 9.0 Nielsen rating average and 15 percent share
of the audience. NBC barely trailed with an 8.9 rating and 15
share. ABC averaged an 8.1 and 13. Fox finished with a 7.0 and 11,
the WB with a 3.2 and 5, and UPN with a 2.0 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   (A rating represents a percentage of the nation's 99.4 million
TV households. A share is a percentage of the households with the
sets actually in use. For example, ``ER's'' 29 share meant that on
average, it was seen in 29 percent of the households where sets
were turned on.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS also won the season, which began September 23, in a separate
category, total viewers, but ranked only fourth in the key
demographics, viewers 18 to 34 years old and viewers 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, CBS leads in household ratings because it is strongly
favored among viewers 45 and older, while its rivals compete for
the younger audience coveted by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   CBS has been trying to convince advertisers for years that older
viewers are no less desirable commercial targets than younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   David Poltrack, CBS research chief, said this week that people
45 and older are the most affluent, fastest-growing segment of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, because its viewers are older, CBS is not
able to charge as much for commercial time as its competitors. But
CBS approaches that liability with an interesting strategy: If you
can't join them, beat them. In other words, corral higher household
ratings by avoiding the overcrowded battle for younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going the `Central Park West' and younger route,''
Les Moonves, president and chief executive officer of CBS
Television, said in a telephone interview this week. The reference
was to the 1995-96 season, when CBS tried to skew young and took a
beating in the ratings. ``Central Park West'' was one of its failed
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said almost a third of the newly announced fall series
on other networks will be teen or ``twentysomething'' shows all
dealing with the lives and problems of young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shows deal with adult angst,'' he said, ``which is
something I can deal with a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said of this season's ratings victory: ``This caps a
four-year battle from the bottom. When I came to this place a few
years ago (in 1995, as president of CBS Entertainment) CBS was the
pariah network.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves added that CBS will post a profit this year, something
the network failed to do last year.
</P>
<P>
   But even in rising from third place in 1995, CBS has lost
ratings as part of network television's downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   In the '98-99 season, its ratings declined 6 percent. NBC
suffered worse, though. Its prime-time ratings fell 13 percent,
partly because it lost last year's top-rated series, ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   The only network that boosted its ratings this past season was
the WB, which posted a 3 percent gain. The WB primarily focuses on
teenagers with such shows as ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Felicity'' and
``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Jesse,'' starring Christina Applegate, was the season's
highest-rated new series, finishing fifth among all shows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Jesse'' was deemed less than a creative triumph, and
NBC has promised to make revisions for its sophomore season. It's
high ratings are attributed to its placement between ``Friends''
and ``Frasier'' on NBC's Thursday night lineup.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the more legitimate new hit was ``Providence,'' also
on NBC. The Friday night drama about a young doctor who returns to
her hometown was jeered by most critics and had no schedule help.
Yet it finished the year as a top-20 show.
</P>
<P>
   Although the networks continue to bleed ratings, the news isn't
all bad for them.
</P>
<P>
   Business is reportedly brisk, for one thing, in the so-called
up-front sales market of advertising time for the year's fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible hopeful sign is the fact that 11 of last fall's
new TV series, along with a handful of midseason shows, will return
for a second season in the fall. That is a relatively high survival
rate. Twenty-six new series from last fall were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Also, strangely enough, the networks might be able to turn a
negative _ their declining ratings _ into a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that as proliferating channels spread the audience
thinly across the TV landscape, the networks deliver the medium's
closest approximation of a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the four major networks and the two ``weblets'' _
WB and UPN _ claim an average of 62 percent of the prime-time
audience.

SAFIR SUGGESTS YOUTH SHOT BY POLICE WAS OUT TOO LATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Thursday that
the shooting of an unarmed 16-year-old boy by a member of the
Police Department's Street Crime Unit appeared to have been an
accident, and he questioned what the youth had been doing out on
the streets of the Bronx after midnight in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the youth, Dante Johnson, and a friend ran from
three uniformed officers who had approached them early Wednesday
morning because the officers had thought the youths might have been
be armed, Safir said, ``You have to wonder why they're running, why
they're out at 12:30 at night hanging out with a group of people
with criminal records.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks drew an angry response from Johnson's family, who
said the commissioner appeared to be blaming the victim. He
remained in critical but stable condition Thursday at a hospital in
the Bronx with a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are out late at night in the Hamptons and no one
questions what they're doing at 12:30 at night,'' said the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who held a news conference with members of Johnson's
family outside the hospital. ``The issue is not whether or not
Dante should have been home. He had a right to be on that street,
he had a right not to be shot, he had a right not to be presumed to
be a criminal. And that is the issue: not what he was doing, but
what was the policeman doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Safir did offer an apology of sorts for the shooting, which will
be reviewed by a grand jury. ``If it in fact turns out to be an
accidental shooting, I'm certainly sorry; it was an accident,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the incident began when three officers from the
Street Crime Unit, who were patrolling the Morris Heights section
of the Bronx, saw Johnson and a friend, Kyle Thompson, 16, standing
near a large crowd. The officers thought they saw one of the young
men adjusting his waistband, leading them to suspect that he was
armed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers approached the youths in an unmarked car,
police said, they ran away. Officer Michael Fraterrigo, 27, and
Sgt. Terrence O'Toole, 41, jumped out of the car and caught
Thompson on a highway overpass. The third officer, Mark Conway, 32,
chased Johnson in the car.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is not exactly clear, because investigators
have not yet questioned Conway, police said. What is clear is that
he caught up with Johnson near the intersection of Undercliff and
Sedgwick Avenues, grabbed him through the car window and fired a
single shot that struck him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A bus driver who witnessed the shooting told detectives that he
had seen Conway reach out of his car window and grab Johnson while
the car was still moving, a police official said. The driver said
he had seen Johnson trying to break free by wriggling out of his
jacket, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway is quoted in another police report as telling the first
officer to arrive at the scene, Fraterrigo, ``Mike, we were
struggling with the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing a fleeing suspect from a moving car does not appear to
violate department policy, Safir said. But he added, ``I question
some of the tactics.'' He refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of an unarmed teenager has drawn more criticism of
the Street Crime Unit, which became the subject of a federal civil
rights investigation after four of its members fatally shot Amadou
Diallo, an unarmed man, on Feb. 4 in the Bronx, firing 41 bullets
at him. The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, said Thursday
in a statement, ``This incident raises serious questions once again
about the Street Crime Unit and its adherence to NYPD
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended the unit. ``I think the Street
Crime Unit has to do its job,'' he said. ``The shooting is one that
is being looked at, but before people cast any judgments or start
to point fingers at people or see this as the usual knee-jerk,
antipolice reaction, they should wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Johnson had been on probation for a grand larceny
arrest stemming from an April incident involving a stolen wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Safir questioned Johnson's behavior. ``You have to wonder why
somebody runs from a uniformed officer,'' he said. ``You have to
wonder why somebody struggles with a uniformed officer. I believe
families should wonder about kids hanging out at 12:30 in large
groups and wonder where their children are, especially if they're
on probation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton replied, ``For him to question why Dante was out at
12:30 at night rather than question how a policeman can drive a
car, grab a young man and hold a gun all at the same time shows
that he's far more inclined to try and desecrate a victim's family
than try and set policy in policing in this city.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE STREAK WITHOUT A RECORD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Yankee Stadium Thursday night, the primary plot
was not merely Roger Clemens' first start as a Yankee against the
Red Sox but also his success in extending his streak of consecutive
victories to 19 over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But a strange streak also was extended. With two singles
Thursday night, Derek Jeter has now been on base in each of the
Yankees' 45 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens knows the major league record he was approaching: Carl
Hubbell's 24 consecutive victories for the New York Giants from
July 17, 1936 to May 27, 1937.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jeter's streak, no record exists. Of the thousands of
records in ``The Book of Baseball Records,'' the blue-covered bible
published annually by the Elias Sports Bureau, there is no record
for ``consecutive games, on base safely.'' And there may never be
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to have a play-by-play of every major league game
going all the way back more than 100 years,'' said Seymour Siwoff,
the Elias emperor and the keeper of the keys to baseball records.
``And nobody has that.''
</P>
<P>
   During an inquiring conversation with Siwoff Thursday, it was
established that Joe DiMaggio was on base safely in 74 consecutive
games in 1941, a streak created primarily by his most memorable
record: hitting safely in 56 consecutive games that season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter obviously has a long way to go to even approach that
74-game streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``But DiMaggio's 74 games may not be the major league record,''
Siwoff said. ``It might not even be the Yankee record. Because
nobody knows what the record is.''
</P>
<P>
   By clicking their computers, the Elias figger filberts were able
to certify that Jeter's streak was the longest for a Yankee going
back to the 1961 season.
</P>
<P>
   But in that era before computers, somewhere sometime another
Yankee or another major leaguer might have put together more than
the 74 games in DiMaggio's on-base streak.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are obvious: Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig, Ted
Williams, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it could be a nondescript player,'' Siwoff said.
``Somebody who was a decent hitter and who got a lot of bases on
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   It might even be DiMaggio, who perhaps had a longer on-base
streak in, say, 1939 when he was hitting over .400 in September
before skidding to .381 for the American League batting title. But
any search for the on-base record would start with DiMaggio's
56-game streak in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees center fielder was stopped on July 16 in
Cleveland, he went 0 for 3, grounding out twice to third baseman
Ken Keltner and bouncing to shortstop Lou Boudreau for a double
play. But in the fourth inning, the Indians' starter, left-hander
Al Smith, walked him.
</P>
<P>
   After that hitless game, DiMaggio put together a 16-game hitting
streak before failing to get on base in eight at-bats in an Aug. 3
doubleheader sweep by Johnny Niggeling and Bob Harris of the St.
Louis Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's look at what DiMaggio did in the games before the
56-game streak began on May 15 with a single off Edgar Smith of the
White Sox at the Stadium,'' said Siwoff, opening a scrapbook of
newspaper accounts and box scores. ``The day before, he got a walk
off Mel Harder of the Indians, but the day before that, against Bob
Feller, he went 0 for 4 with no walks.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to 74 consecutive on-base games: the walk in the
game against Harder, the 56-game hitting streak, the walk by Smith
in the game that stopped the streak, then the 16-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' Siwoff said, ``that an on-base safely streak would
not include getting on first on a forceout at another base. And if
you could establish an on-base safely record, you might have to
include getting hit by a pitch or being awarded first base on
interference. But it wouldn't be a record unless we could
authenticate it as a record.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Pedro Martinez, the ace Red Sox right-hander, had a
streak of seven consecutive games with at least 10 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard some people call that a `presumed record,''' Siwoff
said. ``But there's no such thing as a `presumed' record. It's
either a record or it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roger Clemens knows, Carl Hubbell has the record of 24
consecutive victories. But for Derek Jeter, there is no on-base
safely consecutive-game record.
</P>
<P>
   And there may never be one.

INTRIGUE BUILDS FOR BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 1997, when the popular gray Silver Charm mounted the first
Triple Crown threat of the decade and missed by less than a length,
the question was how the Belmont Stakes could top that.
</P>
<P>
   Then came '98, the second coming of Bob Baffert, the bobbing
nose that kept Real Quiet from making history, and the question was
how the Belmont could top (begin ital)that(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   In '99, it might have found a way.
</P>
<P>
   The June 5 Belmont can't guarantee another photo finish, but the
pre-race drama promises to be even richer than the past two years
as Charismatic _ whose rags-to-riches story puts Real Quiet's to
shame _ prepares to face as many as 13 colts and one filly.
</P>
<P>
   The colts include Menifee, who finished second in both the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, gaining on Charismatic at the finish.
Menifee is trained by Elliott Walden, whose Victory Gallop spoiled
the Triple Crown for Real Quiet, so there's a natural story line.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what turned the ``intrigue'' dial to 11 was Baffert's
commitment to enter the filly, Silverbulletday, who will try to
make history not merely as a Triple Crown spoiler but as the first
Belmont winner of her gender since Tanya in 1905.
</P>
<P>
   A Baffert decision is never final until the starting gate opens,
but assuming he intends to run Silverbulletday against males for
the first time after 12 races and 11 wins, it's a mysterious
choice, inviting speculation about an ulterior motive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baffert and owner Mike Pegram think Silverbulletday
might be the nation's best 3-year-old, they withheld her from the
Kentucky Derby (too many horses, too long a race at 1\ miles) and
the Preakness (bad post position). It sounded as if they wanted to
polish her reputation with a lot of talk and were afraid to test
her.
</P>
<P>
   But after Baffert had ruled out the Belmont, especially if
Silverbulletday would have to run in a 12-horse field, the trainer
changed his mind this week, earning the ridicule of writers like
the New York Daily News' Bill Finley, who called him ``The Waffle
King.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would Baffert question her 1\-mile stamina and then race her
1{? Why did he chicken out in Kentucky and Baltimore if he really
thought she was better than the colts? Does he secretly pray for
the hoof bruise or unlucky draw that would give him an excuse not
to run her in the Belmont either?
</P>
<P>
   And is it too late to enter her in the Indy 500 (and then
withdraw her, inspiring speculation on the lines of, ``She coulda
beat those Chevies!'')?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that this is nothing but a way for Baffert to sneak
back into the spotlight after having to read about Charismatic
trainer D. Wayne Lukas for a couple of weeks?
</P>
<P>
   What can we say except, it's working?
</P>
<P>
   The prospects: Charismatic's possible Belmont opponents include
Preakness losers Menifee (second), Stephen Got Even (fourth),
Patience Game (fifth) and Adonis (sixth); recent stakes winners
Best of Luck (the Peter Pan), Lead Em Home (the Sir Barton), and
Vision and Verse (Illinois Derby); and Lemon Drop Kid, Pineaff,
Port Bayou, Prime Directive, Silverbulletday, The Groom is Red, and
Walk That Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Jock of all media:!off! Chris Antley looks tired these days, and
no wonder. It's been one print, radio and TV interview after
another, a dozen on Thursday alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't feel sorry for me _ I'm glad to be in position to do
it,'' Antley said.
</P>
<P>
   Antley, who will fly to New York on Tuesday, said he'll keep up
his hectic schedule through Wednesday, then rest Thursday and
Friday, when he has agreed to ring the closing bell at the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Who's No.35?!off! ESPN took a lot of ribbing for including
Secretariat among the men and women on its list of the century's
top 50 athletes.
</P>
<P>
   One thought: Horse racing's athletes deserve to be recognized
somehow, and if not on that list, then which?
</P>
<P>
   Another thought: Man o'War, not Secretariat, would be a more
sophisticated choice for the top thoroughbred. But ESPN put Man
o'War at No.84, behind Secretariat (No.35) and ahead of Citation
(No.97).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a TV network is going to choose the
most-photographed, most-filmed horse in history. Another reason not
to rely on a TV network for perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend:!off! Hollywood Park will offer seven stakes worth
$1.375 million during the long Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The first of note is Saturday's Californian, which will serve as
the Hollywood Gold Cup prep for Puerto Madero (Kent Desormeaux),
racing for the first time since his poor fifth in the Santa Anita
Handicap. His opponents include Budroyale, Hal's Pal and Old
Trieste.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Charles Whittingham Handicap _ the former Hollywood
Turf Handicap is renamed for the Hall of Fame trainer who died last
month _ finds River Bay (Alex Solis) trying to regain his form for
trainer Bobby Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Out of town, the holiday weekend highlights are Saturday's
Massachusetts Handicap, with Real Quiet (Gary Stevens) facing
Behrens while trying not to look ahead to the June 27 Gold Cup, and
Saturday's Met Mile at Belmont Park, with top-weighted Affirmed
Success taking on Cat Thief, Lil's Lad, Rock and Roll, Crafty
Friend, Lord Grillo and others. &QL;

APPEALS COURT NOMINEE WITHDRAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barbara Durham, a prominent conservative Republican
who was nominated by President Clinton to an important federal
appeals court as part of an extraordinary political deal, is
withdrawing her name, congressional officials said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durham, a supreme court justice from the state of
Washington, was nominated last year to a vacancy on the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals by the president in exchange for
Republican agreement to stop blocking some of his judicial
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Durham has told congressional officials that she cannot
serve because her husband has serious heart problems. The
congressional officials said they did not know if she would
continue to serve as a state Supreme Court justice, although she
suggested in her withdrawal letter that she would do so.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said last year that they would not have
considered putting Ms. Durham on the federal bench if they did not
need help in getting some of their own judicial choices confirmed
in the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durham was the choice of Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who
told the White House that unless she was nominated he would
continue to block the confirmation of professor William Fletcher,
an old Clinton friend, to the same court.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Fletcher, who taught at the University of
California Law School at Berkeley, was blocked for three years.
After the president agreed to make the bargain, Fletcher was
quickly confirmed as a judge on the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Though the process of nominating and confirming judges is rife
with politics and trade-offs, the Clinton-Gorton arrangement was
highly unusual in that the president ceded to a senator of the
opposition party what is traditionally a closely held presidential
perquisite: the right to choose federal appeals court judges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fletcher's confirmation, Republicans agreed to
confirm two other nominees, only one of which has occurred so far.
But with Ms. Durham's withdrawal, the most pressing question is
whether Gorton still retains the right to fill that seat on the
federal appeals court. His aides said Thursday night that he
believes he does, but White House officials would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durham did not return calls placed to her office.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gorton and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Ms. Durham
said, ``In the past few days I have received the upsetting news
that my husband has a serious heart condition. After much
soul-searching, I realize that I would not be comfortable with a
travel schedule that would take me away from Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the state court, Ms. Durham need not travel far
from home, but federal appeals judges are obliged to travel
throughout the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, the largest of the nation's 12 regional circuit
courts, just below the Supreme Court, covers California,
Washington, Hawaii and six other Western states, plus two Pacific
territories.

A GLARING CLEMENS TAMES RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Those New York Yankees bearing baseball-sized lumps
from Roger Clemens made peace with the Rocket in spring training,
forgiving the beanballs he had thrown in the past, assuming he
would throw many more on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens didn't pitch inside or intimidate in his first six
starts of the season, surprising a few of his teammates. Was it
coincidence that when Clemens did throw a couple of knockdowns
Thursday night, he was pitching against the Boston Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   Pumping his fist and glaring and zipping some head-high
fastballs, Clemens held Boston to two hits over seven innings in a
4-1 victory at Yankee Stadium Thursday night, maintaining his
perfect record against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has won 19 consecutive decisions, an American League
record that is five short of Carl Hubbell's major league record,
set in 1936-37. Clemens, who will face the Cleveland Indians next
week, is assured of going more than a calendar year without
recording a defeat; his last loss occurred on May 29, 1998, versus
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Tarasco, who made his first start for the Yankees since
being summoned from the minors on Tuesday, drove in a run; and
Jorge Posada hit a seventh-inning home run. The Yankees (26-19)
have won five of their last seven games and appear to be in the
process of regaining their former dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who had seven strikeouts and walked three, has two
victories since being activated off the disabled list last week.
And for the first time, he threw like the nasty, intimidating
pitcher the Yankees had faced for years.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Clemens' strikeouts came in the first two innings, and
in the bottom of the third, Boston's Pat Rapp hit Chuck Knoblauch
in the ribs. In the top of the fourth, Clemens threw two quick
strikes to Reggie Jefferson _ and then fired a fastball molar-high,
Jefferson ducking out of the way and many of the 27,631 fans
ooohing. Jefferson struck out, Nomar Garciaparra struck out, and
through four innings, the Red Sox had just one infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco was born in New York, and before moving to California at
an early age, he lived in Washington Heights. Tarasco was a Yankees
fan _ his favorite player was Willie Randolph _ and shortly after
Tarasco broke into pro ball with the Atlanta organization, he found
himself during one spring training sitting between Willie Stargell
and Chris Chambliss, the latter a hitting instructor with the
Braves at the time. Except Tarasco didn't recognize Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you name the Yankees' starting lineup from when you were a
kid?'' Stargell asked him, and Tarasco rattled off all but one name
among the regulars. ``I could never pronounce the name of the first
baseman,'' Tarasco said, in earnest, and Stargell keeled over with
laughter, at Chambliss' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco is 28 now and with his sixth organization and knows his
situation: he is a role player who sits most of the time, and if he
wants more, he must seize the day when he does start. He played an
inning of defense Wednesday and afterward, Torre told him he would
start in left field in Thursday night's game. ``I want to get him
involved,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco, inserted in left field, would be in the midst of action
all night, when the game could have turned with just about any
at-bat, any decision, any mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and Rapp dominated the early innings and the Yankees and
Red Sox were scoreless into the bottom of the fifth inning, when
Chili Davis led off with a single. Rapp stared in for the sign on
the next hitter, never bothering to glance at the 39-year-old Davis
leading off first.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing this, Davis began to break for second base, and when
Rapp continued to hold the ball, he stopped, about 25 feet off
first base. Unaware of Davis' activity, Rapp began his delivery and
Davis resumed his course toward second, and even with the big jump,
the throw from catcher Creighton Gubanich beat Davis to the bag.
But with his slide, Davis kicked the ball out of the glove of
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. Safe.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Tarasco grounded the ball through the middle and
Davis chugged home with the first run. One run for the Rocket, who
allowed one hit and struck out five in the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But wildness had infected Clemens in the fifth _ he had gone to
a full count on all three hitters he faced. He walked Trot Nixon to
open the sixth, and one out later, Jeff Frye walked.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fell behind John Valentin, 2-0, had to throw a fastball
and Valentin whacked it to left, where Tarasco hesitated in
charging the ball before throwing homeward. Posada caught the ball
and swung his gloved hand at Nixon passing by. Too late. Tie game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees responded immediately, running aggressively once
more. Derek Jeter started the bottom of the seventh by ripping a
single to left, and stole second. When Gubanich's throw bounded
into the outfield, Jeter jumped to his feet and scrambled to third
base.
</P>
<P>
   With a runner at third and nobody out and Paul O'Neill, Bernie
Williams and Tino Martinez coming to bat, Boston manager Jimy
Williams had a puzzle to solve.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the Red Sox infield to come in with O'Neill batting.
O'Neill, who came into the game with 2 hits in his last 27 at-bats
with runners in scoring position, lined out, Jeter holding at
third.
</P>
<P>
   Williams could have had Rapp intentionally walk Williams and
then called on left-hander Mark Guthrie to pitch to Martinez. But
he stuck with Rapp and kept the infield in. Williams grounded to
first, and Jeter again had to hold at third. Two out.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's infield moved back. Williams had the option of going to
Guthrie, but he had come this far with Rapp and stayed with him.
Martinez smashed a bullet off the right-field wall, Jeter trotted
home, the manager watching from the dugout with his arms tightly
wrapped against his chest. Yankees 2, Boston 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens now had separation, and he recovered his control in the
seventh, retiring the Red Sox in order, racking up his seventh
strikeout.

20TH CENTURY AMERICAN DRAMA HAS PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of the attention at next Sunday's Tony Awards ceremony in
New York, the last of the century, will be trained on a pair of
American dramas that opened 50 and 60 years ago. Arthur Miller's
``Death of a Salesman'' (1949) and Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman
Cometh'' (1939) are rivals for best play revival and occasions for
lauded star performances by Brian Dennehy and Kevin Spacey,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Williams' ``Not About Nightingales,'' a 1938 work
receiving its premiere in a spectacular staging, is a contender for
the best new play Tony. Some Broadway handicappers give it decent
odds against a pair of imports from across the Atlantic, ``Closer''
and ``The Lonesome West,'' and American Warren Leight's ``Side
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miller-O'Neill faceoff, alongside a ``new'' Tennessee
Williams play, inspires some layered millennial musing on American
playwriting itself. Exciting as it is to encounter classics in
vigorous new productions as the century ends, revivals renew an
anxiety about what the American theater has achieved and where it's
heading.
</P>
<P>
   Do ``Salesman,'' ``Iceman,'' Williams' leading works and the
other titles on the accompanying list of 50 American plays
represent a measure of enduring greatness? How will the writers of
our own time _ David Mamet, Tony Kushner, August Wilson, Edward
Albee _ stack up in another 50 years, or 500?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that we just don't know yet. American drama and
comedy in the 20th century tell a continuing story of discovery, a
series of thematic and theatrical thresholds met with an energetic
rush toward the unknown and unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   From the dark, psychological interiors of O'Neill's brooding
marathons to the scintillating works of sexual and racial identity
by Kushner and David Henry Hwang, American playwrights have
continually stretched the borders.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Williams' shimmering, self-destructive heroines _ no
one had ever written female characters in quite that way before.
Arthur Miller, like Clifford Odets before him, used common-man
realism to pry open new questions about the social order. Anna
Deavere Smith inherited the mantle and wore it, all by herself
onstage, in a startling new fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton Wilder and William Inge discovered the rapture and
heartache of the small town. Lillian Hellman pulled the lid off
lesbianism and Southern venality.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Hansberry showed the tenderness and LeRoi Jones the
rage of the black experience. Wilson's multiplay chronicle couldn't
have happened without them.
</P>
<P>
   David Rabe gave the Vietnam era its agitated voice. Mamet made
sentence fragments and obscenities a precise and expressive
language.
</P>
<P>
   In assembling my list of 50 great American plays (I'm gun-shy
about the ``best'' epithet), I favored works that broke new ground
in some way. That, more than anything, seems a uniquely American
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   There's a vigor in these plays _ from the sun-baked violence of
``The Great Divide'' (1906) and expressionist clamor of ``The
Adding Machine'' (1923) to Kushner's sprawling ``Angels'' (1992)
and Mabou Mines' nervous collage on nuclear power, ``Dead End
Kids'' (1980) _ that reflects the American spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Form isn't a matter of formalism steeped in centuries of
dramatic precedent. American playwrights innovate and break the
rules because that's the way, the only way, to get something said
that hasn't been said before. ``Our Town'' soars from provincial
slice-of-life to transcendent meditation on the strength of the
Stage Manager's lean, Yankee detachment. Sam Shepard blends deadpan
bleakness with a surrealistic glow that lights up the forlorn
beauty of the American West as if for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   America is still a young culture as it enters the new
millennium. We're still finding out who we are and where we belong.
Royall Tyler's ``The Contrast,'' widely regarded as the first fully
formed American play, opened in 1787. Years of melodramas and
mindless entertainments followed.
</P>
<P>
   England had already had its Elizabethan and Jacobean flowering,
its Restoration comedies and post-Restoration reaction. The
Comedie-Francaise was 200 years old when ``The Contrast'' opened.
Spain's Golden Age was long over. American playwrights were just
getting started and produced little of significance before World
War I.
</P>
<P>
   For some critics, the century or so of serious American
playwriting hasn't borne much fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not come anywhere near a Golden Age of the American
stage,'' Emory Lewis wrote in his 1969 book ``Stages: The
Fifty-Year Childhood of the American Theatre.'' Thirty years later,
in a recent New York Times broadside, Matthew Gurewitsch hadn't
found much improvement. Fixated on losers and failure, he wrote,
the great American dramatists lack the stature of Shakespeare,
Ibsen and Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But then it's useful to remember that Shakespeare
wasn't an icon when he was alive. He was a playwright writing for a
company of actors and an audience eager for something new.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Plays acquire their true weight and value over time. A quick
scan of the Pulitzer Prize record offers ample proof that judgments
made at the moment are often faulty. ``The Glass Menagerie'' lost
out to ``Harvey'' in 1945. ``Mourning Becomes Electra'' and ``Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' are among the many prominent Pulitzer
also-rans. Giving awards and making lists is an inherently risky
business.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years isn't much time, but it's proved how thrilling
certain landmark plays are for an audience. Watching ``Death of a
Salesman'' on Broadway or the American Conservatory Theater's ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' a few seasons back, I felt an almost
physical pull of inevitability and dread.
</P>
<P>
   Great plays do that when they're performed and staged as well as
these productions were. Familiarity gives the plays a suspenseful
sense of urgency. ``Salesman'' and ``Streetcar'' feel freshly
written, raw and exposed, flaws and all. They're unmistakably
American.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, whose unrivaled ambition and scope seems inextricably
bound with his difficulty, is harder to reawaken onstage. Neither
the Broadway ``Iceman'' nor ACT's recent ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' conquered the length and fixated redundancies of the
scripts. Some of O'Neill's plays, including his undeniably great
ones, seem dauntingly resistant to production.
</P>
<P>
   So, no doubt, are others on this top 50 list. I'm not sure I'd
much care to see ``The Petrified Forest'' or ``The New York Idea.''
But they belong here, taking their place in a legacy of American
writers pressing into new territory. There are other titles,
including ``The Show-Off'' and ``Aunt Dan and Lemon,'' that could
take the stage tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   People look back when the calendar turns, especially to a big
even number. In the spirit of American playwrights, we ought to
look forward as well. A century's worth of plays is just the start
of a great theatrical culture. Let a new one begin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

FIFTY FOR THE CENTURY: A CRITIC'S LIST OF GREAT AMERICAN PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With THEATRE-CENTURY)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30)  
 By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here, in chronological order, are my 50 great American plays of
the century. The absence of musical librettos (``The Cradle Will
Rock,'' ``Sunday in the Park With George'') and adaptations from
other works (``Of Mice and Men,'' ``The Green Pastures'') helped
narrow the field. But not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The omissions may be glaring. So, perhaps, are some of the
inclusions. Any ``best'' list, whether made at the end of a year or
a century, is a snapshot of a critic's judgment and era. One can
only hope that it won't fade too badly over time.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The New York Idea'' &LR;  by Langdon Mitchell (1906). A
prescient satire peels away the deceptions of marriage and divorce
in upper-crust Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Great Divide'' &LR;  by William Vaughan Moody (1906). Moody,
who also wrote ``The Faith Healer,'' finds ``whiskey, the sun and
the devil'' at the bottom of his raw tale of a Wild West rape.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Adding Machine'' &LR;  by Elmer Rice (1923). Mr. Zero is the
technology-tormented hero of an Expressionist landmark.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Show-Off'' &LR;  by George Kelly (1924). A Philadelphia
mother and son-in-law face off in a still stage-worthy comedy of
the American family.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``What Price Glory'' &LR;  by Maxwell Anderson and Lawrence
Stallings &LR;   &LR; (1924). It's not exactly an anti-war play, but this
trip into the World War I trenches was an unsentimental
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Strange Interlude'' &LR;  by Eugene O'Neill (1928). In an
astonishing psychodramatic feat, the characters voyage to the
subconscious in a nine-act marathon of adultery and interior
monologues.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Mourning Becomes Electra'' &LR;  by Eugene O'Neill (1931). This
heroic Americanization of the Oresteia got a rare and memorable
production by San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Children's Hour'' &LR;  by Lillian Hellman (1934). Behind
the hush-hush sensationalism of lesbian teachers at a girls'
school, Hellman taps the primal themes of innocence and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Petrified Forest'' &LR;  by Robert Sherwood (1935). Marxism
comes to Arizona in a heated stew of '30s political passion.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Winterset'' &LR;  by Maxwell Anderson (1935). This lyrically
anguished piece, in blank verse, was written in response to the
Sacco and Vanzetti trial.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Awake and Sing!'' &LR;  by Clifford Odets (1935). The
playwright's spryest and most likable play unfolds around the
kitchen table of a Bronx apartment during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Waiting for Lefty'' &LR;  by Clifford Odets (1935). This anatomy
of a taxi strike has become a museum piece, but its sense of
socially committed urgency inspired plenty of successors.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``You Can't Take It With You'' &LR;  by George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart (1936). The play celebrates the eccentric American striver;
for today's audiences it's a rich indulgence in ensemble acting.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Women'' &LR;  by Clare Boothe Luce (1936). The playwright
laced her feminism with pitiless satire on the foibles of her
heroines.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Philadelphia Story'' &LR;  by Philip Barry (1939). This poor
little rich girl romance has never lost its insouciant charm and
comic composure.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Little Foxes'' &LR;  by Lillian Hellman (1939). Heartless
greed drives the Hubbard clan in a brazen affront to Southern
gentility.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Our Town'' &LR;  by Thornton Wilder (1939). Wilder gives a New
England small town a timeless transcendence in his sweet, formally
rigorous masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Iceman Cometh'' &LR;  by Eugene O'Neill (1939). Flophouse
denizens play out their haunted pipe-dream melodies in O'Neill's
prolix chorus of the down-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' &LR;  by Thornton Wilder (1942).
Dinosaurs roam the Antrobus house in an allegory ripe for a major
reassessment and revival.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Glass Menagerie'' &LR;  by Tennessee Williams (1945). In a
single, autobiographical stroke, Williams invented the American
memory play and cast his spell of theatrical poetry.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``All My Sons'' &LR;  by Arthur Miller (1947). Clunky as it is,
Miller's back-fence drama called out urgently for personal
responsibility and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' &LR;  by Tennessee Williams (1947).
Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski aren't just characters; they're
sexually magnetized force fields in Williams' most gripping work.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Death of a Salesman'' &LR;  by Arthur Miller (1949). Willy
Loman's long march to the end swells into a great, bruising tragedy
of the common man.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Picnic'' &LR;  by William Inge (1953). The playwright has
drifted out of fashion, but his hothouse plays catch a uniquely
Midwestern kind of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' &LR;  by Tennessee Williams (1955).
Forget the deplorable film; the play is Williams' funniest and most
probing dissection of a family.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Bus Stop'' &LR;  by William Inge (1955). Like O'Neill before him
and Lanford Wilson after, Inge felt the gravitational pull of
misfits filling the air with stories and lies.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' &LR;  by Eugene O'Neill (1956).
O'Neill wrote his most personal play in 1939-41 and wouldn't let it
be produced in his lifetime. It remains a difficult, obsessive,
feverish look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Raisin in the Sun'' &LR;  by Lorraine Hansberry (1959). It
shows its 40 years, but the inside-out view of black poverty opened
eyes and hearts on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Night of the Iguana'' &LR;  by Tennessee Williams (1961).
This is a cut below Williams' best work, but there's still a
furious energy and grace.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' &LR;  by Edward Albee (1962).
The academic world never looked the same after Albee's dissection;
neither did marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Dutchman'' &LR;  by LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka) (1964). A blond
woman taunts and murders a black intellectual on a subway train in
an explosive short work that opened the floodgates for black
writers.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Odd Couple'' &LR;  by Neil Simon (1965). The kudos Simon got
for his later ``Brighton/Biloxi/Broadway'' autobiographical trilogy
felt like a lifetime achievement award; this oil-and-water duet
remains a comic archetype.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Hogan's Goat'' &LR;  by William Alfred (1965). This surging
verse drama is set in the brackish world of Boston Irish Catholic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Delicate Balance'' &LR;  by Edward Albee (1966). There's a
deep, tender melancholy in Albee's bemused family and neighbors,
beautifully renewed in a Broadway revival a few seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The House of Blue Leaves'' &LR;  by John Guare (1971). Guare
mounts a jolly assault on the Catholic church and the American cult
of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``American Buffalo'' &LR;  by David Mamet (1975). In their blunt,
strangled language, Mamet's small-time crooks articulate the ruse
of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Streamers'' &LR;  by David Rabe (1976). The third panel of a
trilogy completes a deeply disillusioned picture of the Vietnam
era.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Curse of the Starving Class'' &LR;  by Sam Shepard (1978). From
here to ``True West'' and beyond, the playwright found the psychic
emptiness in the great open spaces of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Buried Child'' &LR;  by Sam Shepard (1978). In his best play,
Shepard gives his young protagonist a chance to crack the family's
daunting secrets.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Dead End Kids'' &LR;  by Mabou Mines (1980). An early work by
the enduring collaborative ensemble takes an arresting, prismatic
view of the nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Soldier's Play'' &LR;  by Charles Fuller (1981). A crackling
courtroom drama, in a military setting, cuts through the fog of
racism and received wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' &LR;  by David Mamet (1983). Real estate
is an American way of life in Mamet's taut, exhilarating reduction.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Aunt Dan and Lemon'' &LR;  by Wallace Shawn (1985). In this sly,
disturbing work, the century's unfinished business with the Nazis
seeps in like a poison.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' &LR;  by August Wilson (1986). The
playwright's musical language finds its most satisfying medium in
this haunted evocation of a Pittsburgh boarding house in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``M. Butterfly'' &LR;  by David Henry Hwang (1988). The true story
of a French diplomat duped by a Chinese drag queen becomes a hall
of brilliant theatrical mirrors on race and gender, art and
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Prelude to a Kiss'' &LR;  by Craig Lucas (1988). Shaped like a
fairy tale, this delicate work about an old man and a young bride
trading places achieves a rare spiritual transformation.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Six Degrees of Separation'' &LR;  by John Guare (1990). A smart
black kid cons a rich liberal white couple in this telling comedy
of contemporary manners.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Angels in America'' &LR;  by Tony Kushner &LR;   &LR; (1992). The sweeping
two-part saga about AIDS, fear and courage made the American
theater feel vital and essential in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other &LR; 
 &UR; Identities'' &LR;  by Anna Deavere Smith (1992). In a bravura,
pseudojournalistic solo, a race riot becomes the multifaceted lens
of a modern American kaleidoscope.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Three Tall Women'' &LR;  by Edward Albee &LR;   &LR; (1994). There's a
cubist logic to this play about a woman seen, simultaneously, at
three different times in her life; Albee makes the picture hum with
irony and affection.

   NASDAQ PLANNING TO TRADE 100 BIG STOCKS IN EVENING
</P>
<P>
   The board that governs the NASDAQ market approved a plan to add
an evening session for trading of the 100 largest NASDAQ stocks,
beginning perhaps as soon as September. In response, the New York
Stock Exchange has said that it, too, might add an evening session.
</P>
<P>
   By extending their hours, the exchanges would cause untold
changes in the lives of thousands of traders, clerks and others who
work in and around Wall Street. But the change would also touch, in
ways yet to be seen, millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to add an evening trading session puts new pressure
on newspapers, wire services and television networks already
competing to get the latest market information to their readers and
viewers.

   MORGAN STANLEY SUSPENDS WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley suspended two executives in connection with a
$10,000 payment that led to the arrest of a former employee.

   TLC BEATRICE PLANS TO SELL UNITS
</P>
<P>
   The remaining businesses of TLC Beatrice International Holdings
_ potato chips and ice cream _ will be sold by the end of the
summer, and what was once one of the nation's largest black-owned
companies will close its doors. Loida Nicolas Lewis, who has been
chief executive of TLC Beatrice since 1994, said she had mixed
feelings about the final days of the company her husband put
together after a $1 billion leveraged buyout in 1987.

   LAWYER PLEADS GUILTY IN FRAUD CASE
</P>
<P>
   Hartley Bernstein, a well-known securities lawyer in New York,
pleaded guilty to securities fraud conspiracy and perjury and
agreed to forfeit $850,000 in illegal proceeds made as an insider
in five fraudulent public stock offerings, federal prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS DROP FOR 5TH TIME IN SIX DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell for the fifth time in six sessions. The Dow
Jones industrial average tumbled 235.23 points, or 2.2 percent, to
10,466.93, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.35
points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,281.41. Losses were more modest on the
NASDAQ composite index, which edged down 8.03 points, or
three-tenths of a percent, to 2,419.15.

   IBM OFFICIAL BOLSTERS U.S. CASE
</P>
<P>
   A senior IBM executive testified that Microsoft repeatedly
raised the prices it charged IBM for its Windows operating system
and enforced other onerous licensing terms in retaliation for IBM's
refusal to stop competing with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   GDP GREW 4.1 PERCENT IN FIRST QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of weak growth, corporate profits
rebounded in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported.
The profit report, the first for the January-through-March period,
appeared in the department's latest estimate of first-quarter
economic growth. The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate
of 4.1 percent, the report SAID, down somewhat from the 4.5 percent
rate reported last month and well below the 6 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter of 1998.

PROGRAM TAPS INTO THE MUSIC, ART TALENTS OF DISADVANTAGED,
STRUGGLING KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a rehearsal studio near Seattle's Fremont Bridge,
14-year-old Tyler Musgrave and Shorecrest freshman Tom Miller are
no longer just kids.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is a drummer, a human metronome whose left foot can be as
relentless as a dripping faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom is a piano player whose fingers sing of Bill Evans and
Thelonious Monk, with a little Herbie Hancock on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Give them a beat to follow and stand back.
</P>
<P>
   The boys and their surroundings are part of a music and art
program developed in Seattle by jazz pianist Bill Rossi.
Participants learn not only how to play, they learn why teamwork is
important when all there is to share is a downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi's organization, Youth Advancement Through Music and Art,
or YATMA, recently was awarded a $25,000 grant from the William H.
Gates Foundation. The money will help to underwrite lessons for
kids who can't afford them at a time when many schools can't
either. While the state has designated ``the arts'' as core
academic subjects to be taught right along with reading, writing
and arithmetic, they remain on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arts are always the first to go,'' said retired Seattle
School District music teacher Don Castagna. ``You're supposed to
teach it anywhere at any time. You don't need a desk or tools like
math, or if a kid wants to play an instrument, play it in a closet
or in the bathroom or the hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Cluett, associate director of the Gates foundation, said
YATMA was awarded the grant ``because it offers opportunities in
music and art to kids who haven't had them. And we were very
enthused by the young people we observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossi is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in creating the next great recording
artist,'' Rossi said. ``We do want to help kids deal a little
better with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossi's 4-year-old organization operates from a small house on
Seattle's Nickerson Street, but its programs have spread to include
the Seattle Children's Home, the Seattle Art Museum, the Langston
Hughes Cultural Arts Center, and the Delridge Youth Group, a
program of Southwest Youth &AMP; Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   YATMA's lessons are available on a sliding scale depending on a
family's ability to pay. They can continue for years _ or as long
as it takes to turn a child around. Some lessons are private.
Others take place at a classroom level or in groups of three to
four children. The school's present enrollment across the city is
about 300.
</P>
<P>
   At an address on Delridge Way Southwest, single mother Donna
Johnson and two of her three daughters, Tina, 11, and Trish, 12,
arrive weekly to take half-hour turns with YATMA instructor Gregg
Robinson, a jazz pianist with a master's degree in social work.
</P>
<P>
   In a basement, Robinson coaxes his students to play by ear on an
upright piano, copying tunes and tempos they may have heard as
toddlers to the fingering he sometimes provides, but not always. He
lets them plunk around. ``I often start with Happy Birthday. We all
know how it goes,'' he said. ``They get it because their ears know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The method is a YATMA trademark, a plank in Rossi's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting her turn at the piano, Tina and her mother begin
dealing from two-deck stack of playing cards, and identify their
game as Pennsylvania Rummy. ``It's great for their math,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   So is music _ whole notes divided into half notes, half notes
divided into quarters, eighths and sixteenths.
</P>
<P>
   Studies at the University of California-Irvine showed that
preschoolers with just eight months of piano training demonstrated
a 46 percent boost in the kind of reasoning required to succeed in
math. Irvin studies also showed that piano keyboards were superior
to computer keyboards in generating math skills.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results were demonstrated recently in keyboard studies
at McGill University in Montreal, and in studies of kindergarten
kids in Kettle Moraine, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   In an Auburn University study, music and art heightened a
participant's self image, while similar results were obtained in a
Minnesota program. At the conclusion of a program that included
music, movement, drama and art for at-risk kids, they all liked
themselves better.
</P>
<P>
   YATMA's founder is a 1970s graduate of Boston's Berklee School
of Music, who believes music and art to be ``as natural to a child
as walking and talking, and should be a fundamental building block
in the schools, but rarely is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to help change that, but it's been an uphill
battle,'' Rossi said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the arts are listed as a core subject in Washington
state's latest set of academic standards, they remain largely on
the periphery in many school districts, including Seattle's, where
budgets are tight.
</P>
<P>
   The record is indelible: Lose a tax levy and cut the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Until a series of levy failures began jolting the Seattle School
District in 1975, however, exemplary music programs were the rule
districtwide and drew observers from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Acox heads one of them. Chairman of the Garfield High
School music department, Acox oversees a program that ranges from
choir to the renowned Garfield Jazz Ensemble, and considers himself
``one of the lucky ones.'' He added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had principals who support music all the way All
our schools should. Tragically, they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Acox, recruited from Southern University in 1971, isn't
reaching everyone at Garfield. Hip-hop fans, in particular, don't

PEPPERDINE, USC OPEN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A college coach rarely memorizes a national
ranking, and they almost never admit to it.
</P>
<P>
   But Pepperdine head baseball coach Frank Sanchez remembers where
the Waves were placed among the nation's top 100 teams by one
prominent magazine in the preseason _ number 67, one spot ahead of
San Diego State and one behind Old Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Waves got out to an amazing start, winning 30 of their
first 33 games, and suddenly they were ranked No. 3 _ by that same
publication.
</P>
<P>
   As his team prepares for this weekend's NCAA first-round
regional at USC, Sanchez downplays both rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to prove anybody right or wrong until the
season is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (43-14) hopes the end doesn't come this weekend. The
Waves, who play Harvard (28-18) tonight at 7, are the top seed in
the regional. The host and defending national champion Trojans
(33-23) are the No. 2 seed and play Virginia Commonwealth (40-18)
in the regional's opening game at 3 p.m. The round-robin format
continues Saturday with three games and ends Sunday at noon with
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the West Coast Conference championship last
weekend at Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine is having its best season
since 1992, when the Waves won their only national title.
</P>
<P>
   Senior third baseman G.J. Raymundo, who leads the team with a
.391 batting average and 15 home runs, isn't worried about
overconfidence; this is Pepperdine's first playoff appearance in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a little more is at stake now,'' he said. ``We all
know what we have to do ... They gave us the No. 1 seed and we have
to finish there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine won 33 games last year but didn't get an NCAA bid.
Sophomore right-hander Jay Adams, who starts against Harvard, said
he noticed a change in the returning players in the fall workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys' attitudes were different,'' Adams said. ``We were
working harder. Guys were staying after practice.''
</P>
<P>
   That ethic didn't change during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about the same amount of enthusiasm today as we had
opening day,'' Sanchez said. ``Very few teams, 20 weeks into the
season, are still chomping at the bit, are still excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-ranked Waves may have been a surprising No. 1 seed, but
they aren't a fluke. Pepperdine's record against teams that made
the playoffs is 12-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to pass a lot of teams (in the Baseball America
poll) to be where we needed,'' Raymundo said. ``We beat a lot of
good teams to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   USC hosts a regional for the first since 1991, and the Trojans
didn't win it that year; they were eliminated by Hawaii. Head coach
Mike Gillespie said he is worried the Trojans are looking past
Virginia Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a crystal ball to know what they really think,''
Gillespie said, ``but my concern is they think they have to beat
Pepperdine to win this thing. Maybe I'm overly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   His worries are valid. The Rams pounded USC pitching for 20 hits
in a 14-4 upset win in last year's regional at Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll get a little payback,'' USC catcher Eric
Munson said. ``That would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The USC coaching staff decided to start right-hander Justin Lehr
(6-2, 4.48 ERA) today instead of All-American left-hander Barry
Zito (11-2, 3.46). It wasn't a snap decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agonized over that,'' Gillespie said. ``We simply felt that
Lehr, even though his wins and losses aren't like Zito's, has
pitched really outstanding for us. We felt if we were going to win
this this thing, this was the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Keyes, VCU's head coach, doesn't think last year's win over
USC has anything to do with today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams are different,'' Keyes said. ``They've lost quite a
few players and we have lost quite a few players.''

VAN BOXMEER'S INTERVIEW WENT WELL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Sometime in the coming weeks, the Kings will hire the 19th coach
in their history to lead them into their 33rd NHL season, their
first at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that Ice Dogs coach John Van Boxmeer did nothing
to hurt his chances of getting the job when he interviewed Tuesday
with Kings general manager Dave Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good interview,'' Van Boxmeer said
Thursday. ``I was comfortable with it. I have a lot of respect for
Dave Taylor. Dave is a very straight shooter. It's very important
in the coach-general manager relationship to have trust. I have a
lot of trust and confidence in Dave Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two seasons, Van Boxmeer has had frequent dealings with
Taylor because the Ice Dogs have had a limited affiliation with the
Kings, an affiliation expected to continue next season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players under contract to the Kings who have played
for Van Boxmeer in Long Beach are Pavel Rosa, Jamie Storr, Jan
Nemecek, Jaroslav Modry, Jason Podollan, Dan Bylsma, Nathan
LaFayette and Manny Legace. Additionally, when he was in the
Buffalo Sabres' organization, Van Boxmeer worked with current Kings
Philippe Boucher and Donald Audette.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor acknowledged Wednesday that Van Boxmeer's familiarity
with the Kings was a definite asset in the Ice Dogs' coach and
general manager's bid for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was feeling me out on a lot of different subjects, what
kind of game I like to play, how I handle certain situations,'' Van
Boxmeer said of Tuesday's interview. ``We've worked together for a
couple of years. It's not like he doesn't know how I handle things
and handle people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he and Taylor are in accord on the sort of game they'd
like to see the Kings play, Van Boxmeer said, ``I think so. I think
we both like skilled guys who compete hard. I like to get it deep
and forecheck. I like to be aggressive on the forecheck and cycle
the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer said one topic touched on during the interview was
whether he'd want to bring an assistant coach with him if he is
hired. Former Kings defenseman Mark Hardy, a long-time Taylor
teammate, has been Van Boxmeer's assistant in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Taylor) asked me if I had anybody in mind,'' Van Boxmeer
said. ``Mark's name came up. But in Mark's best interest, it may be
better for him to stay in Long Beach and be a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer was the second person to interview for the Kings'
job, which became vacant April 19 when Taylor decided not to bring
back Larry Robinson for a fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor interviewed former Sabres coach Ted Nolan last week. He
may interview Detroit assistant Dave Lewis, along with a couple of
other candidates, in the next week. After that, Taylor is expected
to conduct follow-up interviews and make a decision.
