<HEADLINE> Four Still Missing After Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- They are the missing: Tram Bui, a  
23-year-old woman who was blown from underneath a highway overpass, 
motorist Mark Edward Nelson, and Barbara and John Potton, a British 
couple who vanished while traveling in a motor home. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of those still unaccounted for after Monday's fierce  
tornadoes that killed 46 people in Oklahoma and Kansas has been 
narrowed to four. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson of Midwest City was put back on the list today because a  
reported sighting of him after the storm turned out to be false. 
The medical examiner's office said Nelson was last seen driving a 
van in the path of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pottons, in their 60s, haven't been heard from since calling  
relatives a few hours before the tornadoes struck, Ray Blakeney of 
the state medical examiner's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we're concerned about them is they always contact  
their family every day that they are traveling,'' he said. He 
didn't know their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bui of Seminole was last seen trying to shelter herself from the  
storm beneath an Interstate 35 overpass. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Nate Tarver said their fate may never be known.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what a tornado does with people,'' he said.  
``Some people are picked up and dropped with no injuries. And 
others are never seen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton arrived in Oklahoma late this morning to  
survey the damage. He added five counties to the state's disaster 
declaration, bringing to 16 the number qualifying for federal 
assistance, Gov. Frank Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadly weather didn't stop in the central Plains -- on  
Tuesday and Wednesday, storms killed four people in Tennessee and 
one in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers planned to search the rubble again today. More than  
10,500 homes are estimated to have been destroyed or damaged in 
Oklahoma. In Kansas, 1,500 buildings were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind that demolished those structures reached 318 mph, some  
of the most intense ever recorded, said Joshua Wurman, assistant 
professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a pretty reliable estimate,'' Wurman said of his  
preliminary radar data. ``It's possible we'll go through every scan 
we have and find higher wind speeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous highest speed recorded by Wurman was 286 mph in an  
Oklahoma tornado in 1991. Wurman gathers his data with radar units 
mounted on trucks, a program called Doppler on Wheels funded by the 
National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City police allowed people to bring in bulldozers and  
heavy equipment Friday to clear areas that had previously been 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the state Board of Education decided to cancel the  
rest of the school year for students of Mulhall-Orlando Elementary 
School, which was destroyed by a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patching together something for 11 days would not be  
beneficial to the students and the time would be better spent 
building towards next school year,'' said Dennis Smith, 
superintendent of the school district 40 miles north of Oklahoma 
City.

<HEADLINE>  NL Umpire `Heartened' by Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just 11 weeks after quintuple bypass surgery, NL umpire Wally  
Bell returned to work Friday night when the Atlanta Braves played 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Stationed at second base, he had a play right away, calling out  
Atlanta's Andruw Jones on a steal attempt in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to be able to be here is more exciting, just working with  
the guys,'' Bell said after the Padres' 4-3 victory. ``It's fun to 
get back. It felt good out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck took the first ball out of play,  
and planned to have all the umps sign it before presenting the 
souvenir to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 34, was only 2 1/2 weeks away from leaving for spring  
training when his heart problem was detected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors said that if I had gone to spring training and  
worked in the heat, I might've checked out,'' Bell said last week. 
``Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell had surgery on Feb. 18 near his home in Boardman, Ohio.  
Doctors told him genetics were a major cause of his trouble, 
although an umpire's lifestyle of constant travel, late meals and 
stressful conditions also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bypass patients often take about 3 1/2 months to get back to work.  
Bell changed his diet, stuck to his rehabilitation plan and was 
able to return ahead of schedule -- cleared by his doctors, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard at this,'' Bell, who sports an 8-inch scar down  
the middle of his chest, said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, he added, there was the support of ``my two families.'' It  
came from his wife, Vickie -- expecting their first child in August 
-- and his relatives, along with encouragement from all the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell worked with crew chief Bruce Froemming, Hunter Wendelstedt  
and Hirschbeck in his first game back. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bell played golf with his partners. Later,  
he went with Froemming and Hirschbeck to talk baseball with kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great to see him out there,'' Hirschbeck said  
before the game. ``Sure, you'll watch him the first couple of times 
he runs, that's natural. But the anxiety, the nervousness, that 
will all go away after the first couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Froemming: ``You certainly don't think of something like  
that happening to a person as young as Wally is. It's always nice 
to see someone come back from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is in his seventh year on the NL staff. He was originally  
supposed to work his first game this season on April 5, the Randy 
Johnson vs. Kevin Brown matchup at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched part of that game from his living room, knowing he  
was not yet ready. Now, he's prepared to return, both physically 
and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	As in, he's set for the booing from fans, the complaining by  
players and managers -- and the razzing by his fellow umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's back because I need someone I can beat in  
backgammon and golf,'' Hirschbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it's like opening day for him,'' Froemming said. ``We've  
all been out here working.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras Searches for Clay Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Pete Sampras won't just be battling the clay at the  
Italian Open this year. He also has to deal with rust. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras comes to the tournament after four weeks off because of  
a back injury, making his annual quest to succeed on the slow red 
clay that much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian Open, which begins Monday, features its top men's  
field ever with 29 of the world's top 30 players, and a good week 
here would be a lift for Sampras, whose power game is dulled by 
clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Results on the surface have become hard to predict. No one has  
won more than one clay title this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Open starts eight days after Rome wraps up and is the  
only Grand Slam tournament played on clay. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the only major title Sampras has never won.  
</P>
<P>
	He has 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's record,  
with five at Wimbledon, four at the U.S. Open, and two at the 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras skipped this year's Australian, in January, citing  
fatigue after playing a string of tournaments at the end of 1998 to 
ensure he would retain the No. 1 ranking for a record sixth 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	He pulled out of the Barcelona, Spain, clay event in mid-April  
with an aching back and has not played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Kafelnikov capitalized, taking the title at Melbourne --  
even thanking Sampras for staying home -- and eventually sliding 
into the top slot in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Russian, who won at Roland Garros in 1996, has not been  
playing like the world's best. He has lost seven straight matches 
since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras did manage to win the Italian Open in 1994, beating  
Boris Becker in the final. Since then, the American has tumbled out 
in the first round twice and in the round of 16 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov, along with the last two French Open champions,  
Carlos Moya and Gustavo Kuerten, should pose a threat to Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcelo Rios will be back to defend his Italian Open crown, but  
the diminutive Chilean has struggled with injuries all year. He's 
without a title in 1999 and his ranking, which briefly reached No. 
1 last year, has slipped to No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	And Andre Agassi, twice a finalist at the French Open, could  
again resurrect his game long enough to make a good run. He was 
among the first men in Rome, arriving Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong's Play Gives Magic a Jolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- One cup of coffee loaded with seven lumps  
of sugar before each game, two pieces of candy at halftime, run all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Call Darrell Armstrong superstitious if you want, but the wired  
Orlando Magic guard has developed into a top candidate for the 
NBA's Sixth Man and Most Improved Player awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a little guy who didn't play basketball until he was  
a senior in high school, then left home for college with a dream of 
becoming a pro football player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flash, Baby Boy, whatever we call him. Coffee Man, Chocolate  
Man. He brings a lot of energy,'' teammate Nick Anderson said. 
``His energy means a whole lot to this team. You have guys who 
don't have it every night. Here's a guy who brings it all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has become a human caffeine jolt for the Magic. It's  
as if he plays on a pogo stick that never stops bouncing, so pumped 
he picks up the entire team and leaves opponents dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Former teammate Shaquille O'Neal called Armstrong Orlando's best  
player after he scored 17 points and had 11 assists against the Los 
Angeles Lakers on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights later he scored a career-high 28 points against  
Charlotte, then followed with a team-high 25 points and seven 
assists against Cleveland on his way to joining Elliot Perry and 
Michael Adams as the only graduates of the Continental Basketball 
Association to earn NBA player-of-the-week honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's their little energy bunny. He's a pest,'' Sacramento's  
Chris Webber said. ``I think he gets his teammates going. They know 
if they don't pick up their energy they might get embarrassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong averaged career highs of 13.8 points, 6.6 assists, 3.6  
rebounds and 2.1 steals per game this season, helping the Magic to 
a surprising 33-17 record and a first-round playoff matchup with 
Philadelphia, starting Sunday in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 30-year-old guard scoffs at the suggestion that he's  
emerged from nowhere since spending four years in the CBA, USBL, 
Global Basketball Association and playing overseas in Cyprus and 
the Spanish League. 
</P>
<P>
	A former college place-kicker who twice kicked school-record  
field goals of 48 yards at Fayetteville State, Armstrong originally 
signed with the Magic only a few weeks before Orlando went to the 
NBA Finals in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	His role with the team increased two years ago and he was having  
the best season of his career in 1998 when he was sidelined after 
48 games by a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Satisfied that he had fully recovered from the injury, the Magic  
rewarded him with a five-year, $18 million contract after the NBA 
lockout ended in January. The most he made before was $350,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people had doubts that I was coming back,'' Armstrong  
said. ``I didn't have any doubts. My therapists said I had the best 
attitude of anybody they ever worked with. All the things I've been 
through, that was probably the easiest thing to come back from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong appears smaller than his entry on the Magic roster,  
6-foot-1, 180 pounds. He credits much of his success to his mother, 
who raised him and two brothers in Gastonia, N.C., his wife, Dee, 
and two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	He still owns a 1966 Volkswagen beetle he bought and restored a  
few years ago. With some of the money from his new contract, he 
bought a new home for his mom in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a single parent and worked two jobs all her life. She  
instilled in me how hard you need to work once you're out here in 
real life for your family and yourself,'' he said. ``When you work 
hard, good things happen. She showed me that. She raised three 
boys, and we all turned out fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's family has always been there for him -- and vice  
versa. After the GBA folded in December 1992, he found himself back 
in his home state working in a yarn mill for $250 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll flip burgers ... if it means putting clothes on my  
family's backs and food in their mouths,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year he was back in basketball, playing for Atlanta of  
the USBL when he caught the attention of Magic general manager John 
Gabriel, who was captivated by his relentless hustle and 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	It took him two years to get into Orlando's rotation, but that  
was OK, too. Playing in Europe and bouncing around the other 
leagues taught him a lot about patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an incredible story,'' Magic coach Chuck Daly said.  
``He's got a heart bigger than his chest. ... He's been our spark. 
He knows his role. He's terrific at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong moved into a starting role late this season when  
injuries forced Daly to juggle the lineup. Predictably, there was a 
period of adjustment as the Magic went through a five-game losing 
streak before winning four in a row to finish the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The change has given Penny Hardaway an opportunity to play more  
at shooting guard, a role the three-time All-Star feels best suited 
for, and Armstrong's tenacity has made the Magic a better defensive 
team from the opening tap. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pesky. He gets in your head. Guys don't like it when you  
get picked up full-court and every time you turn around somebody's 
in your face. That's what Darrell does to you,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added forward Horace Grant: ``I don't know how to explain it,  
but when he runs by you, you can feel like an electric shock. It 
just gives the whole team a lift at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one appreciates the season Armstrong has had more than  
Hardaway, who no longer feels he has to lead the Magic in scoring 
every night while also running the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear people yelling from the stands, 'Score more points  
Penny, score more points.' I don't have to. If it takes Darrell 
leading us in scoring to win, I'm all for it. ... He's not going to 
score 25 every night, but he's going to give us a lot of defense 
and distribute the ball well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Daly who originally suggested that Armstrong try drinking  
coffee before games to try to adjust to later starting times on a 
West Coast road trip. The idea worked so well that Armstrong made 
it part of a regular routine that includes eating two -- ``not 20 
like everybody thinks'' -- chocolate candies at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the mind tells you, 'Let's go,' and your feet and  
body tell you, 'No,''' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be a little superstition there. But you have to look  
at it as it giving me energy. One of the two is going to work. If 
the coffee doesn't, the Hershey Kisses will. If the Hershey's don't 
work, the coffee will. Both of them usually kick in together.''

<HEADLINE> Sailor Gets Kick to Finish Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A booming cannon and three red flares marked  
the end of the grueling 27,000-mile Around Alone sailing race for 
winner Giovanni Solidni. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor lit a white flare and danced on the deck of  
his yacht Fila while dozens of boaters cheered him on the last two 
miles of the race that began in September and ended at 1:32 a.m. 
EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, the first non-Frenchman to win the race in the five  
times it has been held, had been at the mercy of a high pressure 
and low winds the past few days, crawling along at 6 to 8 knots. 
</P>
<P>
	But he finished with a flourish, making about 15 knots on a  
brisk southwest wind. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Adolfo, members of his crew and race officials  
clamored aboard the boat along with Italian reporters to welcome 
Soldini. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished in record time despite the delay of the last few  
days. His unofficial time of 117 days was more than four days 
faster than the previous record set by Christophe Auguin in 1991 
when the race was known as the BOC Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Marc Thiercelin, with the only other 60-foot boat  
still in the race, was about 250 miles behind Soldini, but more 
than 11 days back in the overall standings. He was expected to 
finish late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the smaller, 50-foot boat division, Mike Garside led  
Frenchman J.P. Mouligne by about 285 miles and was about 690 miles 
from the finish late Friday. Mouligne won the three previous legs 
and is the apparent winner of the division. 
</P>
<P>
	The skippers were among 16 boats that left Charleston last  
September for the race that included stopovers in Cape Town, South 
Africa; Auckland, New Zealand; and Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of Soldini's race was a daring rescue of French  
sailor Isabelle Autissier in the frigid, rolling waters of the 
Southern Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier's yacht PRB was sailing in 20-knot winds when the  
automatic pilot malfunctioned. The boat turned on its side and then 
flipped completely. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel was suppose to right itself, but it never did and  
Autissier had only seconds to close the watertight hatch of the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	She settled down to wait for rescue as Soldini battled for 200  
miles through 40 mph winds and waves as high as 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	He found the overturned yacht, but saw no sign of Autissier. But  
then he tossed a hammer at the hull and she quickly emerged from an 
escape hatch.

<HEADLINE> Ottke Defends His IBF Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Sven Ottke defended his  
IBF super middleweight title for the second time Saturday with a 
unanimous decision over Gabriel Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottke (15-0) controlled the fight from the first round against  
the Dominican Republic fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The light-hitting 31-year-old Ottke, who has just three  
knockouts, floored Hernandez in the opening seconds but Hernandez 
came back. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the sixth, Hernandez began to slow down noticeably and  
Ottke began to toy with him, fighting with his hands down.

	Protesters Rail Vs. Embassy Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Protests at the U.S. and British embassies in  
Beijing that began with well-organized ranks of student 
demonstrators later turned into a rowdy mob that threw rocks and 
tried to set cars on fire. Many carried banners and handwritten 
signs condemning the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia. They shouted ``Down with the Yankees'' and ``Protect 
sovereignty and peace.'' Not since the government crushed democracy 
protests at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, have students and 
other Chinese marched through Beijing streets in large numbers with 
banners and slogans.

	Mrs. Dole Faults Clinton in Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful  
Elizabeth Dole today said the Clinton administration has made 
fundamental strategic and tactical blunders in the Balkan bombing 
effort. Those mistakes, she said, are fair game in the presidential 
campaign. Mrs. Dole said the effort is being run largely by 
politicians and not soldiers, and they have made errors in 
targeting, intensity and focus. Competing politicians traditionally 
have remained quiet during an overseas combat operation, to avoid 
sending conflicting signals to enemies. But Mrs. Dole said the 
stakes in the Balkans are too high for candidates to stay silent.

	Clinton Surveys Tornado Damage  
</P>
<P>
	DEL CITY, Okla. (AP) -- Following an aerial tour of the outskirts  
of Oklahoma City today, President Clinton said he's never seen so 
much destruction over such a wide area. The president promised up 
to $12.5 million to provide temporary jobs for victims of the 
deadly tornadoes that leveled entire neighborhoods and killed at 
least 50 people this past week in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and 
Tennessee. Half of the funds will immediately be made available to 
put 3,500 Oklahomans and 600 Kansans to work. Clinton also said he 
would ask Congress for an additional $372 million for FEMA's 
disaster relief fund.

	Gun Industry Eyes Gun-Control  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of two major firearms industry groups  
want to see what the Clinton Administration has to offer before 
signing on to its gun-control proposals. ``We haven't seen the 
language,'' said Robert Ricker, executive director of the National 
Shooting Sports Foundation. The crunch comes Monday at a White 
House strategy session on children, violence and responsibility. 
Ricker said the industry has supported versions of some of the 
White House proposals in the past. Such laws became the subject of 
much discussion after two teen-agers shot 13 people, then killed 
themselves, in Littleton, Colo. last month.

	Parents Back Gun Restrictions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents whose children have been injured or  
killed by guns today pledged to make Mother's Day a day of 
political action. Joined by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at 
the White House, four parents shared stories about their children 
to about 300 guests, many also parents of shooting victims. ``How 
many more Springfields or Littletons can we suffer before we do 
what must be done to keep guns away from children?'' asked Rebecca 
Lynn. She sat beside her daughter, Betina, who was wounded in last 
May's shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore.

	Citadel Graduates First Female  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The first female cadet in the Citadel's  
history graduated from the military school today, ending a 
150-year-old, male-only tradition following a federal court fight. 
Nancy Ruth Mace, a magna cum laude graduate in business 
administration, received her degree from her father, Emory Mace, 
the school's commandant of cadets. She was greeted with applause as 
she accepted the degree. There had been some hissing during a 
ceremony earlier in the school year when she received her senior 
class ring.

	Reprieve Possible in Pizza Killings  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A man who received the death penalty for  
gunning down a pizza deliveryman in 1997 has been given a possible 
reprieve. Judge Reginald Stanton on Friday ordered Thomas 
Koskovich's death sentence to be commuted to life in prison if he's 
still alive five years from now. Stanton believes inmates unfairly 
spend too much time on death row. Defense attorneys say to their 
knowledge, such an order has never been issued at the trial court 
level. Prosecutors say Stanton exceeded his authority.

	Trail Blazers Beat Suns 95-85  
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Isaiah Rider scored 25 points and the  
Portland Trail Blazers pulled away in the latter part of the fourth 
quarter to beat the Phoenix Suns 95-85 today in the first game of 
their best-of-five series. Brian Grant had 16 points and 10 
rebounds, and Arvydas Sabonis added 12 points, eight rebounds, 
eight assists and three blocks for the Blazers, who are trying to 
make it out of the first round for the first time since advancing 
to the 1992 NBA Finals. Jason Kidd had 17 points and seven assists 
for Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Chaisson Celebrated at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, Ontario (AP) -- The life of Steve Chiasson was  
celebrated in an emotional funeral mass attended by some of 
hockey's greatest names on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Gretzky, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, the Carolina  
Hurricanes and numerous hockey stars joined the Chiasson family and 
friends for a standing-room-only congregation at the 800-seat 
Cathedral of St. Peter's-in-Chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Chiasson told the gathering she wanted the ceremony to be  
a celebration of her husband's life. 
</P>
<P>
	She said when she first learned Steve had died, in a single  
vehicle accident near their Raleigh, N.C., home Monday morning, she 
felt ill in her stomach. In the intervening days, she said the love 
and support she's received from family, friends and the hockey 
community has helped to ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through God, Steve and all your prayers,'' she said, fighting  
back the tears, ``that pit in my stomach has been replaced by 
Steve's love and his strength and his ability to always stay 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina captain Kevin Dineen spoke of Chiasson's humbleness.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steve wasn't a man of many words but he was comfortable in any  
situation,'' Dineen said. ``When he needed to say something, he'd 
be the type of guy to say it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dineen also touched on the events leading up to Chiasson's  
death, after he left a party at teammate Gary Roberts's house, 
following Carolina's playoff elimination last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things we all wish we'd done differently,'' said  
Dineen, the last person to see Chiasson alive. ``This tragedy comes 
down to one person's judgement. It was a direct result of Steve's 
stubbornness and his desire to see his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson was traveling about 74 miles per hour in a 55-mph zone  
when he crashed, said an accident report released last Tuesday. 
Although blood-alcohol test results will not be available for two 
to three weeks, the report issued listed intoxication as an 
accident factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson's sister, Susan Reinhart, remembered her ``big, little  
brother'' as he grew up from his rock collection, to countless 
games of monopoly and scrabble. She also recalled pulling him off 
the outdoor rink when he was six. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd always say just five more minutes,'' she said. ``I also  
remember the chills we felt when he got to the NHL and his first 
game with the big boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also addressed Chiasson's wife and children Michael, 8,  
Ryan, 4, and Stephanie 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey was Steve's life but they (Susan and the kids) were the  
core of his being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates Ray Sheppard and Dineen served as pall bearers along  
with Chiasson's boyhood friends Dean Haig, Jim Morton, Neil Wyath 
and Tim Keating, his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	As they left the church they passed through a row of Minor Petes  
players, from the major bantam and midget AAA teams, that formed an 
honor guard. Chiasson played his minor hockey with the organization 
they represented. 
</P>
<P>
	Other NHL players attending the funeral included Paul Coffey,  
Dino Ciccarelli, Sean Burke, Bob Probert and Stu Grimson. Those 
with a Peterborough connection included Steve Larmer, Tie Domi, 
Kris King, Roger Neilson, Jacques Martin, Dick Todd and Steve Webb, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, a teammate of Chiasson's during the 1993 NHL all-star  
game, said he had the utmost respect for the defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always tough for me to play against. ... He was a true  
NHL competitor and played the game the way it should be played,'' 
Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson, born in Barrie, Ontario, but raised in Peterborough,  
played 723 NHL games with Detroit, Calgary and Hartford, which 
moved to Carolina. He had 92 goals and 297 assists.

<HEADLINE> Tribe's Comeback Defies Logic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Did that really happen?  
</P>
<P>
	That was a frequently asked question Saturday morning at Jacobs  
Field as fans and players were still digesting all the numbers from 
Cleveland's dizzying 20-11 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians overcame deficits of 9-1 and 10-2 by scoring 18 runs  
in their final three at-bats for Cleveland's 20th -- and most 
memorable -- win this season. 
</P>
<P>
	How many times have you seen a team down by eight runs win by  
nine? 
</P>
<P>
	``Ah, never,'' said Travis Fryman, whose three-run homer in the  
seventh inning pulled the Indians to 11-9. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-inning span from the sixth to eighth innings, the  
Indians sent 33 batters to the plate and collected 16 hits. They 
scored four runs in the sixth and seven in both the seventh and 
eighth innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this team, you never know what might happen,'' said David  
Justice, who homered twice and drove in five runs as the Indians 
recorded their ninth come-from-behind win this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the many numbers posted and records set, the most  
interesting were: 
</P>
<P>
	-- 34 combined hits  
</P>
<P>
	-- 31 runs scored (a new stadium record).  
</P>
<P>
	-- 14 extra-base hits (six homers, seven doubles, one triple)  
</P>
<P>
	-- 19 runners left on base  
</P>
<P>
	-- 89 baseballs used.  
</P>
<P>
	Justice's second homer, a three-run shot in the sixth, closed  
the gap to 10-6 and had the Indians' bench and 40,601 fans 
believing Cleveland could win. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Justice had a premonition the Indians might be up to  
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to Paul Wagner to just hold them right there, because  
you never know what's going to happen,'' Justice said. ``I swear, 
10 minutes later, the score was 10-10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Tampa Bay, the collapse helped the Devil Rays set or tie 11  
club records and continued a strange run of recent events. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 1, Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild asked umpire Larry  
Barnett to check Detroit pitcher Brian Moehler's glove. Moehler was 
discovered to have sandpaper and, after he was ejected, the Devil 
Rays rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Jose Canseco hit a fly ball at Tropicana Field  
that lodged in the stadium's catwalk. Earlier this week, the Devil 
Rays blew a 3-0 lead in the ninth inning and lost 5-3 to Kansas 
City, and then combined with the Royals the next night to hit eight 
homers in a three-inning span. 
</P>
<P>
	But those paled in comparison to Friday night's fiasco.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that could go wrong did,'' losing pitcher Jim Mecir  
said.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A nurse accused in the deaths of  
more than 100 patients in the past four months may have killed them 
to collect commissions from local funeral homes, media reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson Izidoro Guimaraes was arrested Friday in Rio de Janeiro.  
He has admitted killing ``five or six'' patients but denies profit 
was his motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Guimaraes says he only wanted to ease patients suffering by  
taking away oxygen masks or giving lethal injections at Salgado 
Filho Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it to those in irreversible comas and whose families  
were suffering,'' the 42-year-old trauma ward nurse told TV Globo 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But police are investigating several Rio funeral homes after  
Guimaraes told reporters he received commissions in exchange for 
death certificate information -- between $60-$600 per certificate. 
Such information gives morticians a head start in contacting the 
victim's family about funeral arrangements.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City police have arrested nine people  
who kidnapped, robbed and sometimes raped tourists hailing taxis 
near the airport, the city attorney general's office said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven men and two women operated for more than a year, the  
office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	One member would drive a green Volkswagen Beetle cab, which are  
common in the city, and signal to his accomplices when a passenger 
was believed to have money. The accomplices would then climb into 
the cab and rob passengers of valuables. 
</P>
<P>
	One gang member said he sometimes took female victims to his  
residence and raped them, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robberies of taxi passengers have become common in Mexico City  
in recent years, and the U.S. embassy has warned tourists not to 
hail cabs in the street.

	VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A group of independence activists  
camped on a beach with unexploded munitions Saturday at a U.S. Navy 
bombing range, protesting an accidental blast that killed a 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ruben Berrios, leader of the Puerto Rican Independence  
Party, and 100 others took boats to the beach on Vieques Island and 
set up a half dozen small tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Berrios said protesters would remain until the Navy pulls out.  
</P>
<P>
	The April 19 death of David Sanes Rodriguez has given new  
impetus to decades of demands that the Navy withdraw from Vieques. 
He died when a U.S. F-18 missed a target and dropped a bomb near an 
observation tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1940, the Navy has controlled two-thirds of the  
33,000-acre island east of Puerto Rico's main island.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Eagleton gained the lead past  
midstretch and pulled clear to win the $113,000 Will Rogers 
Handicap by two lengths on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-1 longshot, Eagleton finished the mile race on turf in 1:34  
1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleton settled in early, moved on the turn and gained the lead

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Alexi Lalas and Chris Klein scored  
first-half goals Saturday night, leading the Kansas City Wizards to 
a 2-1 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first win of the season for Kansas City (1-7), which  
broke a Major League Soccer-record 10-game losing streak dating 
back to last season. Saturday's game was also the Wizards' first 
under former U.S. national team coach Bob Gansler, who replaced Ron 
Newman on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City's two goals doubled its total from the first seven  
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lalas put Kansas City up 1-0 in the 10th minute, heading in a  
corner kick from Preki Radosavljevic for his second goal of the 
year. Chris Klein made it 2-0 in the 32nd minute, also scoring on 
an assist from Radosavljevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles (4-4) scored its only goal in the 37th minute, when  
Danny Pena took a cross from Cobi Jones and fired a left-footed 
shot off the underside of the crossbar and into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Snitko made two saves in the last 10 minutes to preserve  
the win for Kansas City.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Court May Decide Own Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The justices of the Wisconsin Supreme Court  
started this fight -- and they might just decide the victor. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices filed a lawsuit in 1997 claiming they were wrongly  
denied a pay raise approved by the state Legislature. A state 
agency had ruled the money couldn't be paid because it would raise 
the justices' wage above that of the governor, which is not allowed 
under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's salary had also been adjusted upward, but the  
increase did not become effective until last January. In the 
meantime, the justices' pay rose higher than his. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial court sided with the justices, but the state appealed.  
Now the matter is headed to the Supreme Court, where the conflict 
of interest is plain. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court suggested that the Supreme Court use  
reserve judges to hear the case. But state Courts Director J. Denis 
Moran said the suggestion won't fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no provision for the temporary assignment of anybody  
to the Supreme Court,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court clerk said the justices could decide  
within 30 to 60 days whether to take the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctrine of necessity says if there is no other forum  
available to resolve a dispute, the court can even take it in the 
face if what appears to be conflict,'' said Moran. ``However it is 
handled, it will have to be a little bit creative.''

<HEADLINE> Show Held Liable in Guest's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The attorney for relatives of a gay guest  
slain after a taping of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' said the $25 
million award from jurors sends a clear message to the talk show 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of human exploitation needs to be corralled,'' said  
Geoffrey Fieger, who had asked for $71.5 million in damages. ```The 
Jenny Jones Show' and what it does to people is unsafe at any 
speed. This is a renegade business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday held the show and its corporate owner, Warner  
Bros., liable in the shooting death of Scott Amedure, who had 
revealed his attraction to Jonathan Schmitz during a 1995 taping of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after the taping, authorities said, Schmitz bought a  
shotgun, drove to Amedure's trailer in Oakland County's Orion 
Township and shot him twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were brought together for a segment titled ``Same-Sex  
Secret Crushes'' during which Amedure regaled the studio audience 
with his sexual fantasies about Schmitz, who said he is 
heterosexual. The segment never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family argued that a mentally ill Schmitz was lured  
onto the show believing he would meet a woman, and was humiliated 
into murder when his secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Amedure, the victim's father, said the verdict vindicates  
his belief that ambush-style TV should be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just proud that we can show people that shows are not  
going to do this no more,'' he said. ``Please, don't let the kids 
watch all these shows, because there'll be more killings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros. said the verdict could impair the work  
of all media and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone involved in the business of interviewing ordinary  
people ... ought to be very concerned about the chilling effect 
this decision will have on them,'' said Jim Feeney, who predicted 
the verdict will be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense claimed Schmitz knew his guest could be a man,  
suspected it was Amedure and was not upset by the surprise. They 
also argued there was no reason to ask Schmitz about his mental 
history, and suggested Schmitz killed Amedure for reasons other 
than their appearance on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs' theory is that you have to do a psychological  
profile before you allow them to come onto a program,'' said Zazi 
Pope, a Warner Bros. attorney. ``And then you cannot engage in any 
discussion of any topic that has any element of surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who was not sued but testified at the trial, denied  
that her show ambushes guests to boost ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked and saddened by this verdict,'' she said in a  
statement. ``However, the only real tragedy is that Scott Amedure 
lost his life.''

<HEADLINE> Real Quiet Wins Pimlico Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Real Quiet overtook Free House in a dramatic  
stretch duel Saturday and won the $500,000 Pimlico Special by a 
neck, his first victory in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet, winless since the 1998 Preakness, covered the 1 3-16  
miles in 1:54 1-5. That's two-fifths of a second faster than his 
winning time in the Preakness, and the 4-year-old needed that kind 
of time to hand favored Free House his first loss in three races 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet won $300,000 and Free House earned $100,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Fred Bear Claw finished third in the five-horse field, followed  
by Precocity and Brushing Up. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet, at 9-5, paid $5.80, $2.20 and $2.10. Free House paid  
$2.10 and $2.10, and Precocity paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House and longshot Fred Bear Claw raced to the lead, but  
Gary Stevens came from the outside to put Real Quiet into 
contention shortly after the turn. When they hit the stretch, it 
became a battle between Chris McCarron, on Free House, and Stevens, 
who was running outside the rail.

<P>
	Down the stretch, the two-horse race between the 1998 Preakness  
winner and the 1997 runner-up was impossible to call. But Real 
Quiet had a bit more left at the end and hit the wire an instant 
before the 3-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad a horse had to lose,'' said Real Quiet's owner,  
Michael Pegram. ``Gary rode him the right way today, the horse had 
something left and we got lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of entrants in the race, there was no shortage  
of quality. Free House had two straight wire-to-wire wins this 
year; Real Quiet won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness last year 
before finishing second at Belmont; and Precocity came in with 
$1.74 million in career earnings.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway, Heat Misfire Against N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In the glare of the playoff spotlight, Tim Hardaway  
couldn't find his shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's yearlong slump carried over into the postseason  
Saturday when he missed 15 of 19 attempts against the New York 
Knicks. The lack of outside punch left the Miami Heat at a big 
disadvantage, and they lost 95-75 in Game 1 of the first-round 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway went 1-for-9 in the first half, when the Knicks built a  
17-point lead. He finished 1-for-7 from 3-point range and scored 
just 10 points, 12 below his career playoff average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed five or 10 open shots, and my teammates had open  
shots,'' Hardaway said. ``When you do that, and they come down and 
hit shots, it's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Mourning scored 27 points for the Heat, but their four  
guards shot a combined 7-for-36. Miami went 5-for-24 from 3-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	New York guards Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell, meanwhile,  
scored 22 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get better perimeter play to stay in the game,''  
Heat coach Pat Riley. ``We have to take the ball to the basket. 
That has to be an adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway missed shots both inside and out, and that's been the  
case much of the year. He made just 40 percent during the regular 
season, the lowest of his nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	A collision in February with Grant Hill left Hardaway with a  
bruise and hyperextension below his right knee. He recently 
complained that the injury still bothers him, an admission that 
annoyed Riley, who dislikes sharing such information with the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim took a shot in his leg in February,'' Riley said. ``There  
are some lingering effects from that, but he's a pro. It's like 
Patrick Ewing -- he's been playing with a sore Achilles' tendon for 
weeks, but he doesn't make excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps taking a cue from the coach, Hardaway declined to  
discuss the matter following the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much being made of the injury,'' Hardaway said.  
``I don't want to talk about it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no question the top-seeded Heat need more production  
from their star point guard to rally past the Knicks. Despite his 
shooting woes, Hardaway averaged 17.4 points per game this season, 
sank 112 3-pointers and remains Miami's first option in clutch 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need for him to play well for us to be productive,''  
Mourning said. ``But we need to help him.''

<HEADLINE> Some Graduates Take Ethical Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH MANCHESTER, Ind. (AP) -- When Christine Miller graduated  
from Manchester College nine years ago, she signed a nonbinding 
pledge to be socially and environmentally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the company where she worked as a chemist was offered a  
government contract, she gave it a second look -- and didn't like 
what she found. She wouldn't give details, but said it involved a 
product that would be poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
	She voiced her concerns -- exactly what sponsors of the pledge  
would want her to do -- and the company turned down the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge, sponsored by the Graduation Pledge Alliance based at  
Manchester College, is intended to encourage college students to 
find socially responsible jobs and stick to their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also an indicator, experts say, that some graduates  
entering the workforce today are placing more emphasis on ethics 
than their bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it like you have a job for a while ... but you have  
to live with yourself forever,'' said Miller, who left the chemical 
company last year because she was unhappy with its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather make a decision that I could say, 'Yeah, I made  
that decision' and be proud of that decision, rather than going 
against what I truly believe in because I might make some extra 
money doing it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge was started at Humboldt State University in  
California 12 years ago, then spread across the country but 
declined in the early 1990s. Manchester College, a small liberal 
arts school 40 miles west of Fort Wayne, took over the program in 
1996 when only a handful of chapters were still active. 
</P>
<P>
	It has now spread to more than 30 campuses.  
</P>
<P>
	The pledge asks students to ``explore and take into account the  
social and environmental consequences of any job I consider or any 
organization for which I work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Nagy, who oversees a biannual survey of MBAs conducted by  
Duke University, said students' attitudes have taken a 180-degree 
turn over the past decade. In 1989, students responding to the 
survey ranked power, prestige and money near the top of their 
lifetime goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in 1991, successful relationships, a balanced life and  
more leisure time became more important, and in the last survey the 
list was topped by marriage, health and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have our fair share of Wall Streeters whose No. 1  
inspiration out there is to make money, but there are a lot of Wall 
Streeters also who have these same values,'' Nagy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Neil Wollman, who heads the program at Manchester,  
said there is only anecdotal evidence to suggest that graduates 
stick to the pledge, and participation at the 30 campuses varies. 
At Manchester, more than 60 percent of the school's 220 graduates 
enrolled, while some schools report only a handful of students 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he hopes the pledge helps people consider the impact of  
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that you're going to turn down a job. It's that  
you're going to consider that and maybe you work for a company that 
isn't that great, but when you get on the job maybe you're going to 
make a change,'' Wollman said. ``If you're there, you can still 
make the place you are a little bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller now works for Abbott Laboratories in Sturgis Mich.,  
developing baby formula and medications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see doing a job that is morally wrong,'' she said. ``I  
don't know if people in general are like that. I think for the most 
part society is pretty greedy and wouldn't do it.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Mulls Gun-Control Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two major firearms industry groups aren't  
closing the door on Clinton administration gun-control proposals, 
but their leaders said Saturday they want to see exactly what the 
White House is offering before signing on. 
</P>
<P>
	The crunch comes Monday, at a White House ``strategy session on  
children, violence and responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen the language,'' said Robert Ricker, executive  
director of the American Shooting Sports Council. ``We told the 
White House we have to see the language before we can make any 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricker and Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting  
Sports Foundation, met at the White House last week with Bruce 
Reed, President Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Delfay told The Associated Press they ``ticked down the list of  
many points,'' eight or more, that were expected to be offered for 
discussion Monday. ``We did not agree to anything,'' he said. ``We 
indicated -- and this is the absolute bottom line here -- what our 
position might be. The White House certainly acknowledged that the 
devil would be in the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Ricker said: ``I would hope, or at least I have the  
impression, that we would have some input in crafting those 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Saturday that the council, the  
lobbying arm of the gun industry, and the foundation, which 
promotes shooting sports for the industry, agreed to support five 
principal White House proposals: 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising the age eligibility for buying a handgun from 18 to 21;  
</P>
<P>
	--Holding parents criminally responsible for giving children  
access to guns; 
</P>
<P>
	--Forbidding juveniles convicted of violent felonies from ever  
buying a gun; 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring people who sell guns at gun shows to make background  
checks on buyers; and 
</P>
<P>
	--Expanding a federal program to require that all firearms found  
at a crime site be traced. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the organizations refused to endorse White  
House proposals to require three-day waiting periods for buying 
guns and allowing people to buy only one gun a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, the president's adviser, said: ``We're pleased that  
representatives of the gun industry are prepared to support these 
common-sense proposals, and we will continue to work with gun 
manufacturers to work out the details and find common ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting the industry groups remain uncommitted to  
specific White House legislation, Ricker said the industry and even 
the National Rifle Association, the largest gun owners' 
organization, have supported versions of some of the White House 
proposals in the past. That is true particularly about parental 
responsibility laws such as those in California, Florida and half a 
dozen other states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such laws became the subject of much discussion after a school  
shooting last year in Jonesboro, Ark., that killed five people and 
injured 10, and again last month after two teen-agers shot 13 
people, then killed themselves, in Littleton, Colo. The Jonesboro 
pair swiped their weapons from the grandfather of one of them; in 
Colorado, one of the boys involved made bombs in his room, where he 
had Nazi paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post report also speculated that the gun industry  
group's positions on the White House proposals indicated a split 
with the NRA. Both Ricker and Delfay said that's not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``This alleged or hopeful rift between the industry and the NRA  
ain't there,'' Delfay said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the NRA was not at the meeting with Reed and will  
not be represented officially on Monday. Since gun-control 
advocates were invited, Delfay said, ``We thought that was very bad 
form on the part of the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, an NRA board member, former Rep. Bill Brewster,  
D-Okla., was invited and will be at the meeting. But association 
spokesman Bill Powers said Brewster is ``not an official spokesman 
for the NRA, as none of our board members are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is curiously odd that they snubbed Charlton  
Heston,'' he said. Asked why the actor and NRA president was not 
invited, Powers said: ``Ask the White House.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Miller Set for Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's playoff time -- and that means Reggie  
Miller has another opportunity to add to his list of heroics. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and his Indiana Pacers teammates, who took Chicago to  
seven games before being eliminated in the Eastern Conference 
finals last year, begin their best-of-5 first-round series Sunday 
against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's nine previous trips to the playoffs have been filled  
with dramatic game-winning shots and his 23.5 scoring average for 
65 playoff games includes two 39-point performances. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those games came in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference  
finals against the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden. With 
the series tied 2-2, Miller tormented the hostile New York crowd by 
hitting five 3-pointers and tallying 25 points in the fourth 
quarter as Indiana upset the Knicks 93-86. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not afraid to fail,'' said backcourt mate Mark Jackson.  
``All the great ones, that's the key, they're not afraid to miss 
the shot and they step into it with confidence. He actually 
believes, and he's disappointed when the game is on the line and he 
doesn't do something heroic. He's a special player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers forward Antonio Davis said nothing Miller does in the  
playoffs surprises him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like a fan. I keep looking for that fantastic play, that  
last-second shot,'' Davis said. ``Hopefully, this year we won't put 
him in too many situations like that. I think that's putting too 
much pressure on one guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana hasn't played since Tuesday and the Pacers have  
capitalized on the time off with three days of intensive practices 
that each lasted two or more hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really cleaned up a lot of things that we were lacking at  
times,'' Davis said. ``The greatest thing is our focus. We've 
really been focusing on correcting mistakes, and playing great 
defense, which we will need to do against a team like this that can 
really flat out outscore us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee compiled the leading field goal percentage in the  
Eastern Conference, averaging 46 percent, and led the league in 
3-point shooting. However, the Bucks were swept by Indiana in three 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that Indiana doesn't give us much respect, and (the  
media) doesn't want to give us much respect,'' said Bucks coach 
George Karl. ``I think we're a lot closer to them that you all 
(media) say we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, who guided Milwaukee into the playoffs in his first year  
coaching the Bucks, believes his team can produce an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one of the few teams that aren't afraid to try to  
outshoot them,'' Karl said. ``We're going to try to play fast. It's 
anti-playoff. Playoffs are usually not fast-paced games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Karl is confident, he admits Miller will be a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be as bothersome to him as possible,'' Karl said.  
``We have to control his shots, contest his catches, be very 
aggressive with him and switch players. We can't expect Ray Allen 
to be the only guy to do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cops Nab Man They Call Bike Bandit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A man called the bicycle bandit had held up  
at least five banks in central Illinois, always making his getaway 
on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, police say they've got their man and his bicycle. They also  
got his wife, their two cars and their two young children. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a man wearing a baseball cap and wraparound  
sunglasses pedaled up to the Associated Bank and ordered a teller 
to give him cash. He then stuffed $19,629 into his backpack and 
pedaled away. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, a policeman spotted him and gave chase.  
</P>
<P>
	Officer Ken Tegard said he followed as the bike bandit sped to a  
parked car to meet his wife. The cyclist put the bike in the trunk 
of his wife's car, tossed a pellet gun into the back of a nearby 
pickup truck, then drove away in one direction in a Jeep while his 
wife drove the car off in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
	A swarm of patrol cars cornered Rodney Henninger, 29, and his  
wife, Judi, 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's two small children were along for a ride in one of  
the two getaway vehicles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple were ordered held without bail, pending a hearing  
Monday on federal charges of armed bank robbery. If convicted, they 
face up to 25 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Henninger admitted robbing three  
banks in Bloomington and two more in LaSalle since October. Police 
believe he also robbed seven other banks in Bloomington, Normal, 
Peru and Champaign.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Tornado Victim Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- On his way to view the damage wrought by deadly  
tornadoes in Oklahoma, President Clinton today announced a $12 
million program to provide temporary jobs to residents of the 
storm-ravaged area around Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would seek an additional $372 million from  
Congress for a federal disaster relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was taking a half-hour helicopter tour of the area today  
before meeting residents in the hard-hit area of Del City, Okla. 
Storms in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Tennessee killed more than 50 
people over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I've learned is that the images we see on  
television can never fully convey the level of sheer destruction or 
the depth of human grief caused by these disasters,'' the president 
said in his weekly radio address, which was taped after a 
fund-raising stop in Houston on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Labor Department would spend more than $12 million  
to provide temporary jobs to 3,500 Oklahomans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men and women who lost their jobs in businesses destroyed by  
the tornadoes will be paid to serve at relief centers, to 
distribute food and water, to help on construction crews,'' the 
president said. ``They'll be able to feed their families by 
rebuilding their communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who raised $700,000 for Democrats at fund-raising  
events in Houston and Austin, Texas, on Friday, has already 
declared disaster areas in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the occasion of his visit to the Oklahoma City area to  
press Congress to approve $10 million in his proposed fiscal 2000 
budget to improve the National Weather Service's next generation of 
Doppler radar. 
</P>
<P>
	Warning times for tornadoes have been improving, Clinton said,  
but an improved Doppler system was still needed. ``This system 
makes it possible to issue warnings in advance of coming tornadoes 
so that local residents can seek shelter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he would ask Congress for an additional $372  
million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster 
relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``These resources are crucial for our disaster relief efforts  
and I urge Congress to act quickly on my request,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the president emphasized how tough times bring  
communities together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Natural disasters test our faith. But they also show us that  
the old-fashioned American values of neighborly care and concern 
are still very much alive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Gun Groups May Back Clinton Plan </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two firearms industry groups have agreed to  
support some of the Clinton administration's new gun-control 
proposals, The Washington Post reported today. 
</P>

	But it said the organizations refused to endorse White House

</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, which did not attend, plans to  
unveil its own package of proposals on Monday to counter Clinton's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert A. Ricker, executive director of the American Shooting  
Sports Council, told the Post that the recent high school massacre 
in Littleton, Colo., has spurred people on both sides of the 
gun-control debate to seek solutions.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Returning Ishi Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remains of the man thought to be the last  
Yahi Indian will make a final journey home. 
</P>
<P>
	The brain of an American Indian called Ishi will be turned over  
to the Redding Rancheria and Pit River Tribe in California after 
more than 80 years as part of the Smithsonian Institution's 
anthropological collection. 
</P>
<P>
	California Indians have been seeking return of the brain for  
months, after learning its whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Smithsonian Institution recognizes that all California  
Native Americans feel a powerful connection with Ishi and a 
responsibility to see his remains are united and given a proper 
burial,'' Robert W. Fri, director of the National Museum of Natural 
History, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	After his death in 1916, probably from tuberculosis, Ishi's  
brain was sent to the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of his remains were cremated, the ashes placed in a  
simple black jar in Olivet Memorial Park in Colma, Calif. Chiseled 
into the container's surface are the words ``Ishi. The Last Yahi 
Indian. 1916.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be the last Yahi, but he was related closely to the  
Yanas. It was the Yanas that became part of the Redding group,'' 
Fri explained in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we established that there were some close relatives it  
was pretty straightforward'' to decide where to return the brain, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fri said the brain will be returned at a time and place to be  
decided by the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't decided what they want us to do,'' Fri said.  
``These are decisions that they will take very seriously. This is 
not something they will make a snap decision about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum has repatriated more than 4,000 of its collection of  
18,000 remains of American Indians since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1911, Ishi was found near starvation at Oroville, in Butte  
County, Calif. He drew the attention of University of California 
anthropologists and settled into a job doing light work at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a kind of living exhibit, making spears, bows and  
arrows as fascinated visitors watched. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle-aged Ishi never told his name. Anthropologists came  
up with Ishi, which means ``man'' in a local Indian dialect. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Ishi's expressed horror of the concept of autopsies -- he  
thought the body should be burned immediately to free its soul -- 
his body was autopsied and the brain removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The whereabouts of Ishi's brain was a mystery for years until an  
investigation discovered it had been sent to Washington. That 
report in February launched the recovery effort that ended Friday 
with the decision to return the brain to California.

<HEADLINE> Wised Up Wins Fort Marcy Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wised Up, trapped down the stretch, somehow got  
outside and posted a victory by a head in the $116,100 Fort Marcy 
Handicap at Aqueduct on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	N B Forrest was second and La-Faah took third in the 11-horse  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second career start on turf for Wised up and the  
first ever in stakes competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wised Up carried 112 and Mike Luzzi 1 1/16 miles in 1:45 to earn  
$69,600 for Wayne R. Ewald. The win was the third in four starts 
this year for the 4-year-old colt. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $65.00, $21.60 and $13.00. N B Forrest paid

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Duncan To Up Intensity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan didn't know quite what to expect  
in his first postseason last year. Now he's wiser -- and more 
emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan's top-seeded San Antonio Spurs face the No. 8 Minnesota  
Timberwolves in a best-of-5 Western Conference series starting 
Sunday in the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walking in last year I really didn't know what to expect,'' he  
said. ``I'm pretty much going to go out and do the same thing I've 
been doing. I'm going to turn up the intensity a little bit. You 
know it counts for more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Minnesota has beaten the Spurs twice this season,  
the Timberwolves know that accomplishing it in the playoffs will be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a different San Antonio team than the one they defeated  
early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can limit those guys shooting-wise, you give yourselves  
a chance. That's where you have to start,'' said Timberwolves coach 
Flip Saunders. ``They're playing extremely well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams split their regular-season series 2-2, with each  
team getting victories on their home courts. Both of Minnesota's 
victories came early in February, when the Spurs were only 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves found a way to contain Duncan during the wins  
with physical play. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done a great job on Tim,'' said Spurs coach Gregg  
Popovich. ``They play good defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan expects more heavy guarding from Minnesota on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've got some big bodies down there, some very physical  
bodies down there, and they give me a bit of a problem,'' Duncan 
said. ``But hopefully I'll get rolling early and stay away from a 
whole lot of the banging and the double-teaming and make them pay 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Duncan-David Robinson duo led the Spurs down the stretch,  
giving San Antonio the Midwest Division title and the top seed 
throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final four games, San Antonio beat Portland twice plus  
Utah and Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Utah and San Antonio finished the regular season at 37-13,  
but the Spurs beat the Jazz 2-1 in the their regular-season series 
to take the top playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett knows he'll have his work cut  
out for him with Duncan and fellow seven-footer, Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bring a whole 'nother look to the game, so to speak. If  
you get past one, there's another one,'' Garnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota is still adjusting to a squad that has changed over  
the season after trading point guard Stephon Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs haven't faced the Timberwolves with Terrell Brandon in  
the lineup because he sat out his only game against Minnesota 
Brandon was out with a thigh injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does San Antonio have the edge in talent, they also  
have more playoff experience after adding Mario Elie, Jerome Kersey 
and Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It adds to everybody's confidence, without a doubt,'' Popovich  
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tours Tornado-Ravaged Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEL CITY, Okla. (AP) -- As residents rooted through the rubble of  
their homes, President Clinton on Saturday took in the devastation 
wrought by killer tornadoes and promised millions in federal aid 
for rebuilding efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been going to these sites for 20 years,'' said Clinton,  
a former Arkansas governor. ``This is the most devastating tornado 
I have ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents waved American flags and cheered as the president's  
motorcade rolled through a Del City neighborhood where the twisters 
had uprooted trees, overturned cars and leveled houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms killed at least 50 people in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and  
Tennessee and injured hundreds more this past week. More than 9,000 
homes were destroyed in the greater Oklahoma City area and more 
than 8,500 buildings in Kansas were severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton already has declared major disaster areas in the hardest  
hit spots, making them eligible for emergency funds to pay for 
cleanup and temporary housing. He promised up to $12 million more 
in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	On a walking tour, Clinton stopped to chat with David and Alicia  
Price. The couple is expecting their first child and were concerned 
about where they will live now that their home had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed a mortarboard for Price, who was receiving a  
master's degree Saturday from Oklahoma State University. ``You're 
young and you're going to have a baby,'' Clinton said. ``It's all 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, Tammy Weston waited by a mint green chair  
that was spared by the storm. ``I thank you,'' Weston said, as 
Clinton wrapped an arm around her shoulder. ``It means a lot to us 
that you came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at Tinker Air Force Base, Clinton went directly to a  
briefing with James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, Gov. Frank Keating and officials from other 
state, local and federal relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in nearby Moore, Okla., hundreds of relief workers  
labored under a searing sun to sort through truckloads of donated 
food, clothing and other items that will be delivered to those 
recovering from the tornadoes. They paused when Clinton flew 
overhead by helicopter to survey the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 25-minute aerial tour, Clinton saw subdivision after  
shattered subdivision recognizable only by the heaps of rubble at 
the ends of driveways where houses once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen so much complete destruction of homes over  
so wide an area,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the situation, Keating said there had been no incidents  
of looting reported. ``This is a real tribute to Oklahomans,'' 
Clinton replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first announced the new relief funds in his weekly radio  
address. He said the Labor Department would spend up to $12.5 
million to provide temporary jobs for tornado victims. Half of the 
funds, provided under the Job Training Partnership Act, will 
immediately be made available to put 3,500 Oklahomans and 600 
Kansans to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he would ask Congress for an additional $372  
million for FEMA's disaster relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the Small Business Administration was providing  
low-interest loans to displaced homeowners and businesses. 
Homeowners are eligible for up to $200,000 in loans; businesses up 
to $1.5 million. The Internal Revenue Service also has suspended 
collections in the affected areas for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the visit to press Congress to approve $10  
million in his proposed fiscal 2000 budget to improve the National 
Weather Service's next generation of Doppler radar. Warning times 
for tornadoes have been improving, but Clinton said a better 
Doppler system was still needed.

<HEADLINE> First Female Graduates From Citadel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Citadel on Saturday graduated its  
first female cadet, ending a male-only tradition at the military 
school that stretched more than 150 years before ending as a result 
of a federal court fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Ruth Mace, a magna cum laude graduate in business  
administration, received her degree from her father, Emory Mace, 
the school's commandant of cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference after the ceremony, she told reporters she  
does not regard herself ``as a pioneer'' in ending single-gender 
education at The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace was clearly the best-known of the 386 cadets to graduate  
during ceremonies that featured Republican presidential hopeful Pat 
Buchanan warning about declining American military power. 
</P>
<P>
	She was greeted with applause as she accepted the degree. There  
had been some hissing during a ceremony earlier in the school year 
when she received her senior class ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Citadel officials nor Buchanan mentioned Mace or the  
school's controversial all-male admission's policy during the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace entered The Citadel in 1996 after the school dropped its  
all-male admissions policy. That change came after the U.S. Supreme 
Court struck down a similar policy at Virginia Military Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Citadel had fought a three-year battle started by Shannon  
Faulkner, who sought to join the corps of cadets. Faulkner was 
admitted in 1995 under a judge's order, but quit in less than a 
week, citing stress and isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other women entered with Mace. Kim Messer and Jeanie  
Mentavlos quit after the first semester, saying they had been hazed 
and harassed. Both women sued the school, Messer's lawsuit has been 
settled, Mentavlos' case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth woman, Petra Lovetinska, next year is expected to  
become The Citadel's first four-year graduate. Mace graduated in 
three years by transferring credits from a community college. 
</P>
<P>
	The Citadel now has 42 female cadets among its 1,800 students.  
</P>
<P>
	Mace will be an analyst with a business consulting firm in  
Charlotte, N.C., but noted she's only 21 and ``I don't know what I 
want to do with the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mace also announced she became engaged Friday night. She did not  
identify her fiance, except to say he was a senior who also 
graduated Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Blending Element Wins Yerba Buena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Calif. (AP) -- Blending Element overhauled pacesetter  
Queen Douna in the final strides to win the $200,000 Yerba Buena 
Handicap by a neck Saturday at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiving a heady ride from jockey Garrett Gomez, Blending  
Element tracked Queen Douna from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Queen Douna, well rated on the lead by jockey Rafael Meza, dug  
in strongly down the stretch and just missed pulling off a 
front-running victory in the 1 3/8-mile turf race. 
</P>
<P>
	``She felt like she was just galloping (on the lead),'' Meza  
said. ``Garrett rode a smart race. He didn't try to burn me out and 
that's why we ran 1-2. When I went by the 3-16ths pole, I felt I 
was going to win because she really accelerated into the lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blending Element, who won for the fourth time in her last five  
races, stopped the timer in 2:17.26. The 6-year-old mare provided 
trainer Carla Gaines with the biggest victory of her career and 
earned $120,000 for owner Warren B. Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Blending Element, at 8-5 the second choice in the betting behind  
3-2 favorite Midnight Line, paid $5.40, $3.60 and $2.40. Queen 
Douna went off at 13-1 and returned $7.80 and $3.20. Midnight Line, 
with Russell Baze up, paid $2.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the top three across the wire were Bates of Course,  
Raging Love and Squeak, a multiple stakes winner who finished last 
at 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Blending Element has eight victories, three seconds and a third  
in 18 career starts. The victory in the Yerba Buena boosted her 
earnings to $403,484.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Stunned by Day Care Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- The first rescuers on the scene  
thought Steven Allen Abrams might be injured. His big Cadillac was 
smashed against a tree, its windshield wipers flapping time. But 
Abrams just sat there. 
</P>
<P>
	So paramedics and police ignored him. They had other concerns:  
two children pinned beneath the car. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 15 men to lift the crushed 1967 Eldorado off the sand of  
a crowded preschool playground and pull out the limp bodies of 
4-year-old Sierra Soto and 3-year-old Brandon Wiener. It was too 
late for Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
	Toddlers waiting for their parents to pick them up from  
preschool began screaming. Teachers were crying. And still Abrams 
said nothing. Was he drunk? Had he suffered a seizure and veered 
off the road in this upper-middle-class neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
	After 15 minutes, Abrams began talking. According to police, a  
traffic officer turned on a department-issued video camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to execute innocent children,'' he allegedly said  
Monday evening. If so, Abrams fulfilled his wish. Sierra and 
Brandon are dead. Two other children were critically injured. A 
teacher's aide suffered a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
	As Abrams talked, police chief Dave Snowden stood over the  
little girl's crushed body. ``There aren't any words to describe 
what I thought,'' Snowden said. ``It's unprintable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon died 90 minutes later in the emergency room of a nearby  
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief lives just around the corner from the Southcoast Early  
Childhood Learning Center. A sergeant called shortly after 5 p.m. 
``Something terrible has happened,'' he told his boss. Snowden got 
there in 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Capt. Tom Hamilton, firefighters and paramedics arrived  
about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bedlam,'' Snowden said days after the accident while  
standing before a half-block-long shrine of flowers, teddy bears, 
cards and candles fronting the battered playground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was indescribable,'' said Hamilton, standing next to  
Snowden. ``They got the kids out from under the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hamilton wanted to know the driver's story.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went up to talk to him and that's when he started making  
confessions,'' Hamilton said. ``He said he'd thought about killing 
other people -- police, fireman -- but they were too inconsequential. 
So he decided to take out innocents to make his point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which was?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Hamilton said, rubbing his bloodshot eyes,  
surrounded by paramedics who'd brought an orchid plant to the 
schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, Abrams said he rammed the playground  
because he used to live nearby and it reminded him of a 5-year-old 
failure. A married neighbor had spurned his advances and eventually 
obtained a restraining order against him. In 1994, he was convicted 
of stalking her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He served two months in the county jail and was sentenced to  
three years' probation that required him to see a psychiatrist and 
to take lithium, commonly described for manic-depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams, 39, worked at the Ticket Shack, just blocks from the  
school, which sells concert, theater and travel tickets. It is run 
by his brother-in-law, Ken Overland, who described Abrams this week 
as ``a great employee'' without a bad temper. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd get into an argument, but 15 minutes later he'd be back  
to normal,'' Overland said. 
</P>
<P>
	But 45 minutes before the preschool attack, Abrams allegedly  
plowed into the back of a Toyota on the Costa Mesa Freeway in a fit 
of road rage. Abrams rammed the back of a car driven by Hector 
Ruiz, whose wife Michelle, was in the passenger seat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple told police Abrams' Cadillac hit them three times  
before they escaped off the highway, 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, the Orange County district attorney's office  
filed two charges of murder against Abrams, seven counts of 
attempted murder -- two representing Hector and Michelle Ruiz, three 
counts of great bodily injury and a special circumstance allegation 
that could make him eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being held without bail until his arraignment May 21.  
</P>
<P>
	Abrams lived in Santa Ana with his 19-year-old daughter,  
Stephanie, whom police say was in the car with her father when he 
tried to run the Ruizes off the road. Abrams said the couple cut 
him off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of misdemeanor child cruelty for striking  
Stephanie with a belt when she was 14. Police said Abrams dropped 
his daughter at home Monday before heading back to Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Sierra and Brandon were buried in separate  
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Snowden spent last week revisiting the school and  
comforting weeping neighbors who came in a stream. 
</P>
<P>
	What is left of the playground's chainlink fence was covered  
with lined notebook paper bearing the labored printing of nearby 
elementary students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry your kids died,'' read one.  
</P>
<P>
	The chief alternated between anger and grief. A few days after  
the killings, he patted the arm of small boy held by a crying 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowden never spoke to Abrams. One of his officers briefed him  
at the scene about the videotape and its contents. ``I listened for 
about 10 minutes,'' the chief said, his eyes misting. 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped to clear his throat. He resumed his story.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then I had to go inside and tell Sierra's mother that her  
daughter was gone.''

<HEADLINE> Pitcher With MS Fights On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- There are times when Stan Belinda wonders when  
it will end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds reliever developed odd sensations in his leg  
last summer that turned out to be symptoms of multiple sclerosis. 
His season ended when the incurable disease was diagnosed last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	A drug that he injects daily has helped him control the symptoms  
and allowed him to continue his career. A more common problem -- 
tendinitis in his right biceps -- has kept him on the disabled list 
since spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	A month into the season, he hasn't pitched in a game and has no  
idea when he might be ready to be activated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other symptoms have been fine for the last two or three  
months,'' Belinda said. ``That's when the patience goes -- this 
starts and it starts weighing on you a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's weighing on him more than a little. During a break between  
workouts this week, Belinda admitted that the tendinitis -- 
something that comes every spring training and usually goes away 
quickly -- had just about drained his patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``The well's going dry, believe me,'' he said. ``In the last  
year, I've had to deal in a lot of patience. This is really sucking 
the well dry. I hope it rains and fills it back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most troubling thing is the uncertainty. The arm will feel  
good for a few days, then get sore again. For now, he's limited to 
strengthening the arm with weights and throwing. 
</P>
<P>
	He's given up guessing when he might be ready to pitch again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no expectations,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Belinda, 32, is in the final guaranteed year of his contract,  
making an $835,000 base salary. There's a team option for next 
season at $1.5 million that the Reds can buy out for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 million salary for 2000 will kick in automatically if  
he makes 60 appearances this season -- a long shot given the problem 
with his arm. After making 84 relief appearances in 1997, he made 
only 40 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After talking about how his patience is running out, Belinda  
brightened a bit and tried to take a more long-range view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be all right,'' he said. ``It's just taking me a little  
longer. I hope at the end I can go out there and throw this one 
year away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working with some of the Reds' young relievers has helped  
Belinda keep up his spirits. Belinda has befriended rookie Scott 
Williamson, who's in only his third pro season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to help out. I'm trying to make a shortcut for  
them,'' Belinda said. ``There's a lot of stuff that goes into being 
a relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really tried to work with Scott Williamson and make him  
feel comfortable here. I'm just trying to be his friend right now, 
be a good person to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, 23, has turned into one of the Reds' most dependable  
relievers, putting himself in consideration for a closer role down 
the road. He said Belinda has been a big help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the first day of spring training, he's been like a big  
brother to me,'' Williamson said. ``He's taken care of me. I sit 
with him on the plane. Most of the time a younger guy would have to 
scramble for a season, but Stan lets me sit beside him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been a one-way relationship. Belinda has gotten  
something back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He mentioned that I brought life back into him,'' Williamson  
said. ``He said it reminds him of when he was young.''

	UN Expresses Regret Over China Blast  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council, summoned by China  
for an emergency meeting early Saturday, said they were shocked and 
concerned by the damage and casualties caused by an apparent NATO 
missile strike on China's Embassy in Belgrade. The council noted 
that NATO had already launched an investigation into the incident, 
and that NATO and the United States had expressed regret. 

</P>

	China Outraged Over Embassy Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China reacted with outrage today to the bombing  
of its embassy in Yugoslavia, with the government accusing NATO of 
a ``barbarian act'' and ordinary Chinese calling on Beijing to send 
in troops. At least three people were killed and more than 20 
injured when NATO missiles struck the embassy in Belgrade, the 
state-run Xinhua News Agency said. One person was missing. NATO 
said it did not intentionally target the embassy. Apparently 
worried that public anger over the attack might spark protests, 
police beefed up security outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.

in Belgrade. Russia's special envoy to the Yugoslav conflict, 
ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, said he would not postpone a trip 
to several European countries beginning today. Chernomyrdin planned 
to fly to Germany first and also visit several other European 
capitals, including Belgrade, to follow up on a proposed peace plan 
worked out by the Western powers and Russia.

	2 Gun Groups May Back Clinton Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two firearms industry groups have agreed to  
support some of the Clinton administration's new gun-control 
proposals, The Washington Post has reported. Among them are 
measures raising the age eligibility for buying a handgun from 18 
to 21, holding parents criminally responsible for allowing children 
access to guns and forbidding juveniles convicted of violent 
felonies from ever buying a gun. Leaders of the groups -- the 
American Shooting Sports Council and the National Shooting Sports 
Council -- also agreed on measures requiring people who sell guns at 
gun shows to make background checks on the buyers, the Post said.

<P>
	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A dozen police stormed the home of a  
magazine owner today and arrested him, in the latest attack on 
journalists in Pakistan, witnesses said. Police broke down the 
outside gate of Najam Sethi's home in the Punjab provincial capital 
of Lahore, his wife Jugnoo Mohsin said. Sethi owns a weekly 
English-language news magazine, The Friday Times. The newspaper has 
been critical of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government and Sethi 
has issued public statements saying he feared being arrested.

	Pope Makes Historic Romania Visit  
</P>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Pope John Paul II, saying the ``spring  
of hope has begun,'' joined the leader of Romania's Orthodox Church 
in calling for the healing of divisions within Christianity. The 
pope, arriving in the Romanian capital yesterday, said he hoped his 
three-day visit would help ``heal the wounds'' in Catholic-Orthodox 
relations caused by the persecution of Catholics under Romania's 
communist regime, which was deposed in 1989. ``Thank the Lord that 
after the terrible winter of communist reign, the spring of hope 
has begun,'' the pope said in perfect Romanian, to the delight of 
hundreds of people who turned out to greet him on his arrival in 
the Romanian capital. John Paul's visit is the first by a Roman 
pontiff to a mainly Orthodox country in nearly 1,000 years.

	Ship Carriers To Remain in NY, NJ  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Two of the world's largest shipping lines  
have decided to stay in the New York-New Jersey harbor -- a move 
that may help solve a nasty feud that still threatens the port's 
future. Ending a yearlong saga, Sea-Land Service and Maersk 
announced yesterday that economic reasons would keep them in the 
Port of New York and New Jersey. The giant shipping companies 
solicited proposals from other East Coast cities, including 
Baltimore and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Maersk President Tommy Thomsen 
also cited Gov. Christie Whitman's last-minute offer of $120 
million in state funding to reimburse the shippers as crucial to 
the decision.

	Jordan Ends Talks With Hornets

<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan said yesterday he pulled  
out of negotiations to buy 50 percent of the Charlotte Hornets 
after owner George Shinn would not agree to giving Jordan complete 
control of the NBA franchise. Money was irrelevant to the 
disagreement, Jordan said. The breakdown was over who would call 
the shots, Jordan told The Charlotte Observer in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Foster Mom Cared for 162 Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A half century later, she still remembers  
the frightened faces of the first two children. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was crying, red-eyed and puffy-faced.  
</P>
<P>
	The boy was scowling, and he flinched when she tried to unclasp  
a pin holding together the summer coat he wore that wintry day. 
</P>
<P>
	It was March 1948, and Vashti Risdall, already a mother of four  
grown kids, was eager to fill the emptiness of her rambling 
six-bedroom house. So she made a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, a social worker came knocking. And, at 45, Vashti became a  
foster mother. 
</P>
<P>
	That first night, she recalls, both little ones were too scared  
to eat so she cuddled the girl to soothe her. The boy wouldn't be 
touched -- he wore his coat and shoes to bed and clutched a paper 
bag tightly. Don't push, she thought. And she didn't. The next 
morning, he relaxed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after, Vashti opened a brown spiral notebook and wrote:  
</P>
<P>
	1. Margaret. Two years old. Blonde. Blue eyes. A real nice  
little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Robert. Four years old. Brown-eyed. Light brown hair. Very  
shy. Took a great shine to pop (her husband). 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the beginning for me,'' Vashti recalls.  
</P>
<P>
	The two stayed for months. But soon, the notebook had names of  
new foster children who came, then left the Risdall home. 
</P>
<P>
	One book filled up, then another.  
</P>
<P>
	One decade passed, then another.  
</P>
<P>
	Before she knew it, it was December 1998. Vashti was a  
great-grandmother -- and, at 96, still a foster mother. 
</P>
<P>
	It was time to call it quits, though she hated to do it.  
</P>
<P>
	It was time to close the notebooks.  
</P>
<P>
	By then, her list of children had 162 names.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some were a few weeks old, some a few months shy of adulthood.  
Some were disabled and couldn't walk or talk, some wouldn't sit 
still. Some tried to run away, some didn't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	But over Vashti's decades of foster parenting, they all knew her  
as Mom. For one boy, it was official: He was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those 50 years went by so fast, I can hardly realize it,'' she  
says, her voice a wistful whisper. ``Sometimes I say I didn't grow 
up, because I just enjoyed those children. I really did. Even the 
bad ones weren't bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Vashti cared for disabled adults who had lived  
with her for decades. ``I thought I'd die before I stopped,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But nature finally prevailed.  
</P>
<P>
	Vashti suffered a stroke a few years ago, her eyes are failing  
and her legs are slower. Still, her memory, wit and will remain 
strong and even at 96, she would have continued had her 74-year-old 
daughter, Ardis Armstrong, not put her foot down. 
</P>
<P>
	But she, too, understands her mother's sadness.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of a career,'' says Mrs. Armstrong, who helped  
Vashti with the children for many years. ``It's the end of a way of 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It began as a partnership between Vashti and her husband,  
Arthur, an easygoing World War I veteran she married when she was 
just 17. Clearly, though, taking in kids was her idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months, tops. That's how long Vashti thought it would last.  
</P>
<P>
	But six years later when Arthur died, the door was still open.  
Living with her youngest son, Dean, who was physically handicapped, 
she continued to welcome an ever-changing brood, sometimes to the 
stares of disapproving neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an era when Dr. Benjamin Spock was guiding millions of  
mothers and fathers, but Vashti needed no advice in handling 
orphans or kids whose parents couldn't -- or wouldn't -- raise them. 
</P>
<P>
	She had own brand of child psychology: Once she hid two  
brothers' shoes during winter so they wouldn't run away; another 
time, she talked a foster son out of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also knew when silence was best.  
</P>
<P>
	``You never, never, never talk about the families unless they  
want to tell you something,'' she says. ``It's not a pleasant thing 
... and it's none of my business either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some nights, after diapers and dirty dishes, laundry and  
ironing, baths and homework, she'd tuck kids in their Army bunk 
beds, reassuring them they'd see their parents again. 
</P>
<P>
	But some afternoons she'd watch them ``hardly leave the window  
all day, thinking Momma's coming -- and she doesn't come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her house, she decided, had to be a refuge, no matter how long  
kids stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home has got to be pleasant,'' she says matter-of-factly.  
``Home is peaceful. If something happens outside, they have to come 
in and know Mom is there. She's not going to slap them; she's not 
going to be mad at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She always put herself in the child's place,'' her daughter  
says. ``She always thought, 'Why does that child feel bad? What 
would I do?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The years provided answers, and steeled her for unnerving  
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	One night she discovered a foster son walking down the street,  
sneakers smeared with grease, clutching crumpled papers dipped in 
grease and the neighbor's back porch ``nicely in blaze.'' The 
damage turned out to be minimal, but the news made the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Police arrested a 7-year-old boy...,'' says a yellowing story  
from 1954, clipped inside one of her notebooks. It adds this 
detail: Vashti put out the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spanked him,'' she recalls. ``What could I do? You'd  
couldn't put him in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other troublemakers, but Vashti doesn't dwell on  
negatives. ``I can laugh about almost anything,'' she says, her 
heavy-lidded eyes lighting up, a calm, knowing smile deepening the 
creases in her face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vashti remembers the good in life,'' says Kathy Cullen, a  
social worker in Ramsey County, which honored her recently for her 
foster care service. 
</P>
<P>
	Vashti has another explanation: ``I think God has been with me  
all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the reality is most misdeeds she encountered were decades  
ago and relatively harmless. There's a Bedford Falls-like innocence 
when she recalls her boys pushing a Coke vending machine out of a 
building or taking cars for joyrides. 
</P>
<P>
	As Vashti pages through her notebooks, each name has a story:  
</P>
<P>
	There was Del, No. 73, who took his $200 from his paper route  
and ran away with a friend to Chicago, where they dyed their hair, 
then headed to his uncle's farm in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blame him for wanting to find some relatives,''  
Vashti says. 
</P>
<P>
	There was Shirley, remembered with this notation: ``Called me  
more plain and fancy names than I'd ever heard in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was Pete, a boxer, who became a paratrooper before a  
violent end noted in another faded newspaper clip: He was shot and 
killed while trying to rob a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Vashti, of course, was notified of his death. ``Pete had no  
other home,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Leonard, who arrived in his late teens.  
</P>
<P>
	``He came to us one day and said, 'Mom, you've got to adopt me.  
I just have to belong.' '' Months later, he became a Risdall. 
Leonard died a few years ago of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of the 162 kids didn't work out and left. But most,  
she hated to see go. And each time one was adopted, or joined the 
military or was reunited with family, she cried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to thinking this has got to be selfish,'' she says. ``I  
said, 'Do I think I'm going to be the only one who's nice to that 
child ...? Of course, that person who wants them is going to be 
nice ... and I can't keep them all.' So I had to talk myself out of 
that or I would have gone crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she adds: ``Every one that left, left a little empty spot  
in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sentimental to this day, she has saved ink-smeared report cards,  
handwritten lists of inoculation dates, dog-eared growth charts. 
She recalls the corner in her dining room where she rocked an 
autistic girl with croup long ago and the exact words of a social 
worker who deposited a boy with cerebral palsy at her door and 
asked that he be walking in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a year,'' Vashti replied. He left walking.  
</P>
<P>
	``She never asked of a child what a child couldn't give,'' says  
Ms. Cullen, the social worker. And she always gave of herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cullen remembers a foster parent support group meeting a few  
years ago when someone told the 90-something Vashti, ``Now is the 
time in life to sit back and relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No way. There were more children to help.  
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, she raised disabled children who grew into  
adults under her roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Jo Ann, a 41-year-old with cerebral palsy, came from an  
institution at age 13 and remained for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a fantastic mother,'' she says. ``She treated me like  
a person. She was just there for me.'' Once, she recalls, Vashti, 
then in her 70s, knew she adored wrestling, so they attended a 
match where, Jo Ann says, ``I screamed so loud that I lost my 
voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They now talk almost daily. ``I consider her my mother,'' Jo Ann  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl, who arrived as a 4 1/2-year-old in restraining straps and  
harness, stayed 27 years. Now 36, he owns a house, works as a 
janitor and for Easter, brought Vashti home-cooked ham. ``I just 
let him grow up,'' Vashti says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary, who is 32 with Down syndrome, was No. 162.  
</P>
<P>
	She left just before the New Year after nearly her entire life  
with Vashti. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried and cried until I just shook,'' Vashti says. ``It's  
hard now to come down to nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though her daughter lives upstairs, Vashti is alone for the  
first time in her long life. Kind of. 
</P>
<P>
	She has 11 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. And  
memories of 162 more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I've been a good mother,'' she says. ``I think  
I've been a friend.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jagr To Play for Pens Despite Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr is hurting, but has no intention of  
pulling himself from the Pittsburgh Penguins' lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL scoring champion is laboring with a sore muscle in his  
upper right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel very good,'' Jagr said following Pittsburgh's  
2-0 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday in the opening 
game the Eastern Conference semifinals. ``I felt the worst I've 
felt in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to play through it. I've got two options: play  
with the pain or sit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, he intends to lace up his skates and go Sunday night in Game  
2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of frustrating, but even though I can't play 100  
percent I can still help this team,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the ice for 6:58 in the first period, 9:15 in the  
second period, and 6:27 in the third. A good portion of that time 
was spent coasting. He managed three shots on Toronto goalie Curtis 
Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot skate, so that's why I don't get tired,'' Jagr said.  
``I can stay longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr said that, if somebody could guarantee him his sore muscles  
would heal quickly, he'd consider sitting out games. But nobody has 
offered such guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out three of seven games when the Penguins upset the New  
Jersey Devils on the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr and his teammates kidded Dan Kesa about scoring the winning  
goal Friday night. Kesa, who plays on Pittsburgh's checking line, 
scored only two goals all season, and did not take a single shot in 
the New Jersey series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were with his legs,'' Jagr said of the regular-season  
goals by Kesa. ``He hasn't scored with his stick. That's the first 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kesa, 27, who has a bulldog tattoo on his upper right biceps,  
has spent most of his career in the minors. These are his first NHL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was his biggest since he netted two during an  
IHL-championship- clinching victory two years ago with the Detroit 
Vipers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you play the first two games of a series on the road  
you want to get a split,'' said Penguins forward Rob Brown. ``We've 
got that. Now we're going to try to get the second win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we're going to have to play better, but it was a good  
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Barnaby agreed, but cautioned that the Penguins must  
continue to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can 't get too confident over one win,'' he said. ``It'll  
come back and bite you if you do.''

	Protesters Burn U.S. Consulate  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese protesters broke into and severely burned  
a U.S. consulate building in southwest China, an Embassy spokesman 
said Sunday. A large number of people broke into the consulate 
compound in Chengdu and severely burned the consulate general's 
residence, said Tom Cooney, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Beijing. No 
U.S. staff were injured and Chinese police used tear gas to 
disperse the crowd, he said. Cooney also said that U.S. officials 
in Beijing, where the Embassy was surrounded by protesters for the 
second day Sunday, were not getting adequate protection. Protesters 
in Beijing on Saturday hurled chunks of concrete at the U.S. and 
British embassies in the Chinese capital, breaking windows and 
smashing cars.

	NATO Mistakes Embassy for Depot  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO military planners mistakenly  
thought the Chinese embassy in Belgrade that was accidentally 
bombed was a weapons depot, officials said Saturday night. NATO 
pledged to pursue its bombing campaign in the Balkans, but did 
express regret for the mistaken attack Yugoslav media said three 
Chinese were killed in the bombing, lowering an earlier report of 
four dead. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: China Bombing 'Tragic'  
</P>
<P>
	TINKER AIR FORCE BASE, Okla. (AP) -- Although he called the  
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a tragic mistake, 
President Clinton said NATO has tried to minimize damage in its 
campaign against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
NATO aircraft have made more than 10,000 bombing runs with 
relatively few casualties since airstrikes began March 24, he said. 
``We need some sense of proportion here,'' he said.

	Clinton Surveys Tornado Damage  
</P>
<P>
	DEL CITY, Okla. (AP) -- Following an aerial tour of the outskirts  
of Oklahoma City Saturday, President Clinton said he's never seen 
so much destruction over such a wide area. The president promised 
up to $12.5 million to provide temporary jobs for victims of the 
deadly tornadoes that leveled entire neighborhoods and killed at 
least 50 people this past week in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and 
Tennessee. Half of the funds will immediately be made available to 
put 3,500 Oklahomans and 600 Kansans to work. Clinton also said he 
would ask Congress for an additional $372 million for FEMA's 
disaster relief fund.

	Prom Goes On Despite Tornado  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Students were able to salvage their prom  
Saturday night even though many lost their homes and clothing to 
the deadly storms that swept through the state last week. Wea ring 
outfits donated by local shops and rival Edmond North High School 
students, the Del City High School couples arrived at prom hoping 
to cap a week of bad memories with good ones. Junior Traci 
Harriman, 17, was wearing a black satin gown trimmed with silver 
sequins that she picked out from among the hundreds of dresses that 
were donated. ``My house is pretty much gone. I was so fortunate to 
have these girls help me, or I wouldn't have been able to go to my 
prom,'' she said. ``I think they are angels.''

	Belfast Accord 'In Crisis'  
</P>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams demanded  
that his IRA-allied party be immediately included in a new 
Protestant-Catholic government, the intended centerpiece of the 
year-old Northern Ireland peace accord. Addressing more than 1,000 
supporters at his party's annual conference Saturday, Adams 
emphasized that the outlawed group won't be persuaded to start 
destroying its weapons stockpiles, a goal contained in the accord, 
``no matter how this is presented.'' Protestant politician David 
Trimble, the designated leader of the future 12-member government, 
has demanded some IRA disarmament before his Ulster Unionist Party 
will accept two Sinn Fein politicians as government colleagues.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Joe Nieuwendyk's goal with 11:38 left in overtime  
gave the Dallas Stars a 5-4 victory over the St. Louis Blues 
Saturday night and a 2-0 lead in their Western Conference semifinal 
series. The teams will meet at St. Louis Monday night in the third 
game of the best-of-7 series. Nieuwendyk took a perfect pass from 
Sergei Zubov as both teams played a man short in a four-on-four 
situation and whipped a shot from just inside the right circle past 
the glove of goaltender Grant Fuhr.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks held Detroit scoreless for 7 1/2  
minutes in the third quarter tonight, pulling away from the Pistons 
for a 90-70 victory and a 1-0 lead in the best-of-5 series. Steve 
Smith led the Hawks with 19 points, while Dikembe Mutombo had a 
dominating game with 17 points, 19 rebounds and six blocks.

<HEADLINE> Sick US Citizen Mistakenly Deported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An ailing U.S. citizen who was mistakenly deported  
to Haiti has been brought back to the United States at government 
expense, but suffered a heart attack after he arrived in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Sylvain, 20, developed full-blown AIDS after he was sent  
to Haiti in January. He suffered a heart attack Friday while 
traveling from the Miami airport to Jackson Memorial Hospital, 
where he remained in critical condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two congresswomen had pressed for his return.  
</P>
<P>
	His supporters claim the Immigration and Naturalization Service  
didn't do enough to establish his citizenship before deciding he 
was a deportable alien. They also say he would have been healthier 
if he had been able to get medical care in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS had questioned the validity of his birth certificate and  
expired U.S. passport, and in a statement issued Friday blamed 
Sylvain for the mistaken deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Documentation corroborating Sylvain's U.S. citizenship arrived  
into INS hands long after it was necessary to preclude 
deportation,'' the agency said. ``The INS provided Sylvain all 
legal due process given to anyone, including illegal criminal 
aliens, with whom the burden of proof of citizenship lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvain was born in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
	He was alert, talking and progressing ``fairly well'' Saturday  
in the hospital's intensive care unit, said Eunice Devereaux, the

<HEADLINE> GOP Touts Work Flexibility Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican senator made a Mother's Day  
promise Saturday to push legislation providing increased job 
flexibility and tax breaks to all working women, whether they toil 
at home or at the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the increased pressures of today's society, many mothers  
are left struggling to 'do it all' -- everything from bringing home 
the family paycheck to nurturing the children to managing a 
household,'' Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said in the GOP's weekly 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Family Friendly Workplace Act, working parents could  
voluntarily rearrange their hours. If a mother wanted to tend to a 
sick child or attend a school event during her work hours, she 
could make up the time another day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said the legislation would be introduced soon.  
</P>
<P>
	Similar proposals have met with resistance in the past from  
unions and some Democrats, who contend employers could force 
employees to accept compensatory time off instead of overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also called for tax cuts that could help parents work  
a shorter week or save more money for college expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans already have sought to remedy some of the burden, he  
said, citing last session's tax cut and a $500-per-child tax 
credit. He said eliminating the ``marriage penalty'' tax was on the 
GOP agenda for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Arkansas senator contended that stay-at-home mothers  
deserve a tax break too and pointed to a Republican measure that 
would give such women a a tax incentive to put money into an 
Individual Retirement Account. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said his state was still recovering from the school  
shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., last year and cited the shootings at a 
Littleton, Colo., high school as further evidence of the need for a 
parental presence at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``These shootings should serve as a wake-up call to America's  
families -- we must spend more time with our sons and daughters,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bratt: Hollywood Unfair to Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor Benjamin Bratt says Hollywood still has a  
long way to go to fairly represent minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of fair and equal representation for people of color  
in this business is a joke,'' says Bratt, who is of Peruvian and 
German descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratt and his brother, Peter, have begun producing their own  
films to bring more minority viewpoints to the screen. One of them, 
``Follow Me Home,'' premiered in 1996 at the Sundance Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bratt feels pessimistic because ``the personification of  
this industry is an overpampered, self-satisfied middle-aged white 
male whose only contact with people of color is the people who 
clean his house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bratt, who plays a detective on the NBC series ``Law &AMP; Order,''  
has high praise for girlfriend Julia Roberts, but says dating her 
has created a paradox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a man who covets my privacy, and I'm going out with the  
most famous actress in the world,'' he says in US magazine's June 
issue.

<HEADLINE> Vision and Verse Wins Ill. Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STICKNEY, Ill. (AP) -- Vision and Verse rallied through the  
stretch Saturday to beat Prime Directive by 1 1/4 lengths in the 
$500,000 Illinois Derby at Hawthorne Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse, ridden by Herberto Castillo Jr., ran past  
favored Yankee Victor in the stretch and then beat Prime Directive 
to the wire. Pineaff closed from last at the head of the stretch to 
finish third in the field of 10 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain, the second choice in the betting, wound up last in the  
1 1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a bit of a rough trip going around the first turn,''  
Castillo said. ``I tried to get my colt to relax. He was really on 
the bridle, but I was actually glad to see that because he's the 
kind of horse you have to ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse went 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 2-5 to earn $300,000 and  
paid $37.20, $15.40 and $11. Prime Directive was worth $6.20 and 
$4.60 and Pineaff returned $6.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision and Verse, owned by W. Bruce Lunsford of Louisville, Ky.,  
and trained by Bill Mott, won for the third time in six starts this 
year. It was his first stakes victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Derby is usually run at nearby Sportsmen's Park,  
but construction of an auto racing track there forced the track to 
hold its meeting at Hawthorne this spring.

<HEADLINE> Report Explores Gambling Pros, Cons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearing the end of two years' effort, a  
federal commission on gambling is struck by the amount of work 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft report says the ``most startling and unexpected  
conclusion'' of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is 
how little is known about the gambling industry's economic and 
social impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that many state and local governments, and Indian  
nations, were prepared to further expand gambling activities, as 
they had already, with a shocking lack of knowledge about the 
impact on their own citizens,'' said the draft report, which is 
subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft report calls gambling addiction a significant problem  
and youth gambling ``startling.'' It also depicts casinos as a 
uniquely effective economic tool, particularly for Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft report, totaling 283 pages, was released this week  
after the General Services Administration instructed the commission 
it was a public document. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., a commission 
critic, had asked the GSA to look into whether the commission was 
wrong in keeping the draft private. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the draft chapters already have been changed, and there  
will be further additions and revisions before the commission 
submits the report to Congress on June 18. A hotly debated 
recommendation, added to the report since the drafts were written, 
urges state, local and tribal governments to consider imposing 
moratoriums on gambling expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as a work in progress, however, the draft provides  
indications of where the commission is headed after two years' 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	In most places, the draft report reads more like an encyclopedia  
than an opinion. But on some topics, the report takes strong 
positions: 
</P>
<P>
	--On youth gambling: ``The conclusion is startling but confirmed  
by every study: Our children are gamblers. They gamble before 
leaving high school. As adolescents, they participate in lotteries 
and other forms of gambling that are illegal in most states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On advertising practices of state lotteries: ``Many  
advertisements emphasize luck over hard work, instant gratification 
over prudent investment and entertainment over savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On the relevant research the commission found on gambling: ``As  
a commission we found insufficient data on gambling's overall 
impact on unemployment, property crime, murder, suicide, 
indebtedness, bankruptcy, business disruption or family breakups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the positive side, the draft report finds casinos to be ``an  
important source of entertainment, jobs and income.'' It 
distinguishes traditional casinos from what the commission 
considers a more worrisome trend, proliferation of ``convenience 
gambling'' in the form of slot machines or video terminals in 
neighborhood stores or restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a draft chapter on Indian gambling concludes that tribal  
casinos play an essential role in economic development on 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Federal policy-makers have sought for generations to identify  
means (other than gaming) to advance Indian economies, with a 
notable lack of success,'' the draft chapter says. ``There was no 
evidence presented to the commission suggesting any viable approach 
to economic development across the broad spectrum of Indian 
country, in the absence of gaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft report was written by the commission's staff. When the  
commission's nine members met in Washington recently to review the 
draft, many complained their proposals had been omitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some commissioners also objected that the report seemed biased  
against gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner and gambling proponent John Wilhelm, general  
president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, 
said the drafts were one-sided because they failed to recognize the 
economic benefits that gambling brings to communities.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Makes Historic Romania Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Pope John Paul II, saying the ``spring  
of hope has begun,'' joined the leader of Romania's Orthodox Church 
in calling for the healing of divisions within Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, arriving in the Romanian capital on Friday, said he  
hoped his three-day visit would help ``heal the wounds'' in 
Catholic-Orthodox relations caused by the persecution of Catholics 
under Romania's communist regime, which was deposed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank the Lord that after the terrible winter of communist  
reign, the spring of hope has begun,'' the pope said in perfect 
Romanian, to the delight of hundreds of people who turned out to 
greet him on his arrival in the Romanian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's visit is the first by a Roman pontiff to a mainly  
Orthodox country in nearly 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope and Patriarch Teoctist embraced at the airport, and the  
Romanian Orthodox leader stood beside him in the glass-enclosed 
popemobile on the drive into the city. It was believed to be the 
first time the Vatican had invited a non-Catholic clergyman to ride 
with the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Orthodox cathedral, they prayed together -- the  
78-year-old John Paul hunched over, the 84-year patriarch standing 
ramrod straight. The two men, both in white robes, then sat on twin 
thrones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second millennium of Christian history began with a  
painful wound for the unity of the church,'' the patriarch said, 
referring to the Great Schism of 1054 when the Eastern church 
definitively split from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is ending now with a positive sign ... a sincere effort by  
Christian churches to heal that wound,'' added the 84-year-old 
patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, who has made reconciliation a principal goal of the  
Vatican's millennium celebrations, said he was encouraging efforts 
for greater cooperation ``among all those who call themselves 
Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also raised the issue of the persecution of Catholics  
under the various communist regimes that took power in Europe after 
World War II. It is particularly sensitive in Romania, where 2,400 
churches and other property were seized from Eastern rite Catholics 
and given to the Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern rite Catholics follow an Orthodox-style liturgy but are  
loyal to the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The patriarch was accused of collaboration with communist leader  
Nicolae Ceausescu's government. He resigned after the regime was 
overthrown in 1989 and entered a monastery. Three months later, 
church leaders pressed him to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my visit helps heal the wounds'' from that period, the  
pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orthodox Church had been slow in issuing an invitation to  
the pope, in part due to the property disputes with Romania's 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the two churches agreed to a truce, although  
the pope was not allowed to travel to regions where Catholics 
dominate. Orthodox feared their authority might be undercut, and 
ethnic and religious passions stirred up. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several hundred thousand Catholics traveled to the  
Romanian capital on special trains and buses. The crowds warmly 
applauded the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a step towards unity, because at the beginning there was  
a single church,'' said 14-year-old student Flavia Haradgea. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a papal spokesman said early today that John Paul  
will meet moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova either 
Monday or Tuesday.

	NATO Mistakes Embassy for Depot  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO pledged to pursue its bombing  
campaign in the Balkans, but expressed regret today for a mistaken 
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. NATO's military 
spokesman, German Gen. Walter Jertz said military planners had 
mistaken the building that housed the Chinese Embassy for the 
federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement, a military facility 
that coordinates Yugoslavia's weapons imports. Yugoslav media said 
three Chinese were killed in the bombing, lowering an earlier 
report of four dead. 

</P>

	Chinese Attack, US, Brit Embassies  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Demonstrators today hurled chunks of concrete at  
the U.S. and British embassies in the Chinese capital, protesting 
NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
Windows at the American compound were broken, and at least four 
cars belonging to staff members were smashed. A group of protesters 
tried to ignite one car and then started shoving police who stopped 
them. Protests also were held in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong 
Kong. The demonstrations in Guangzhou, a large city in southern 
China, involved tens of thousands of students from more than 10 
universities.

	Clinton: China Bombing 'Tragic'  
</P>
<P>
	TINKER AIR FORCE BASE, Okla. (AP) -- Although he called the  
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a tragic mistake, 
President Clinton said NATO has tried to minimize damage in its 
campaign against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
NATO aircraft have made more than 10,000 bombing runs with 
relatively few casualties since airstrikes began March 24, he said. 
``We need some sense of proportion here,'' he said.

	Clinton Surveys Tornado Damage  
</P>
<P>
	DEL CITY, Okla. (AP) -- Following an aerial tour of the outskirts  
of Oklahoma City today, President Clinton said he's never seen so 
much destruction over such a wide area. The president promised up 
to $12.5 million to provide temporary jobs for victims of the 
deadly tornadoes that leveled entire neighborhoods and killed at 
least 50 people this past week in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and 
Tennessee. Half of the funds will immediately be made available to 
put 3,500 Oklahomans and 600 Kansans to work. Clinton also said he 
would ask Congress for an additional $372 million for FEMA's 
disaster relief fund.

	Prom Goes On Despite Tornado  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Students were able to salvage their prom  
tonight even though many lost their homes and clothing to the 
deadly storms that swept through the state last week. Wearing 
outfits donated by local shops and rival Edmond North High School 
students, the Del City High School couples arrived at prom hoping 
to cap a week of bad memories with good ones. Junior Traci 
Harriman, 17, was wearing a black satin gown trimmed with silver 
sequins that she picked out from among the hundreds of dresses that 
were donated. ``My house is pretty much gone. I was so fortunate to 
have these girls help me, or I wouldn't have been able to go to my 
prom,'' she said. ``I think they are angels.''

	Belfast Accord 'In Crisis'

<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams today  
demanded that his IRA-allied party be immediately included in a new 
Protestant-Catholic government, the intended centerpiece of the 
year-old Northern Ireland peace accord. Addressing more than 1,000 
supporters at his party's annual conference, Adams emphasized that 
the outlawed group won't be persuaded to start destroying its 
weapons stockpiles, a goal contained in the accord, ``no matter how 
this is presented.'' Protestant politician David Trimble, the 
designated leader of the future 12-member government, has demanded 
some IRA disarmament before his Ulster Unionist Party will accept 
two Sinn Fein politicians as government colleagues.

Chiasson at an emotional funeral mass. Wayne Gretzky, NHL 
commissioner Gary Bettman, the Hurricanes and numerous hockey stars 
joined the Chiasson family and friends for a standing-room-only

Chaisson died in a single vehicle accident near his Raleigh, N.C.,

	DENVER (AP) -- Joel Bennett won his first major league start and  
Mike Lieberthal homered twice as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the 
Colorado Rockies 7-2 Saturday. Scott Rolen, Rico Brogna and Ron 
Gant also homered for the Phillies, who shut down the Rockies for 
the second straight day. After scoring 25 runs in the last two 
games of its road trip, Colorado has managed just three in two 
games against Philadelphia.

	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- A student died early Saturday in a  
fraternity house fire at the University of Missouri-Columbia that 
was started by a burning candle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominic L. Passantino, a freshman business major from Leawood,  
Kan., died in his room at the Sigma Chi house, said Assistant Fire

	Authorities said more than 40 other people who lived in the  
house also got out safely when the fire started about 5 a.m. during 
graduation weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire destroyed the room and damaged another room and a  
hallway on the third floor of the three-story house.

 *Heinz Berendes    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heinz Berendes, a prominent researcher at the  
National Institutes of Health who did groundbreaking work on the 
safety of contraception, died Thursday of prostate cancer. He was 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	A pediatrician and epidemiologist, Berendes joined NIH in 1961.  
Early in his career, he directed the Collaborative Perinatal 
Project, the largest effort of its kind in the country. He also 
conducted studies on perinatal health in the Middle East, the Far 
East and in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1972 to 1979, he ran the NIH's contraceptive evaluation  
branch, studying the safety of various means of contraception. More 
recently, Berendes worked on projects aimed at improving the care 
of women and newborns in developing nations.

 *Dirk Bogarde    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Dirk Bogarde, the British actor who starred in  
more than 70 films and captured the hearts of many women in the 
1950s, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The British film star, who achieved his greatest fame in ``Death  
in Venice,'' suffered a stroke in 1996 and had been under 24-hour 
nursing care since last May. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to England from military service in World War II and  
joined a small theater group. Soon, he landed roles in the 
lighthearted ``Doctor in the House'' series, and by the 1950s, the 
actor with the boyish good looks had become a matinee idol. 
</P>
<P>
	Screaming audiences mobbed him at public appearances. The  
attention soon led to bigger roles in movies such as ``A Tale of

<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Robert T. Forsyth, a veteran reporter,  
editor and political consultant who took a lead role in negotiating 
journalists' union contracts, died Saturday of causes related to 
cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular Forsyth, an aggressive, unabashed liberal who began  
his newspaper career in the 1960s at the Spokane Daily Chronicle, 
had battled cancer of the lymph glands for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a stint with The Associated Press in San Francisco in  
1970, Forsyth worked for six years as a reporter and editor at the 
now-defunct Sacramento Union. He covered major stories of the day, 
including the attempted assassination of former President Gerald 
Ford and the Patricia Hearst kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	He became active in the Newspaper Guild and helped negotiate  
labor agreements at both the Union and The Sacramento Bee for 
journalists and advertising sales people. In 1976, he took a leave 
of absence from the Union and traveled the country as an 
international representative of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth joined the Bee in 1978 and worked as a reporter,  
assistant city editor and city editor. He left the Bee in 1985 to 
work as a press secretary for Sen. David Roberti, the president pro 
tem of the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Forsyth went to work as press spokesman for former San  
Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan. After a year, he returned to 
Sacramento where he became a consultant to trade associations 
representing trial and workers' compensation attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter, two sons, a stepson and two  
grandchildren.

<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- James J. Humes, the lead  
pathologist at President Kennedy's autopsy and a target of 
conspiracy theorists, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Humes was chief pathologist at Bethesda Naval Hospital when  
Kennedy's body was flown there for an autopsy. The pathology team 
concluded Kennedy was killed by two bullets fired from behind -- a 
finding disputed to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Humes stood by his work in his most famous case. Aside from  
testimony before government panels, he rarely spoke of the autopsy 
and gave only one interview published in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the conspiracy theories ``general idiocy'' and ``a  
tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Rose Jr. Starting Over, Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Six months shy of his 30th birthday, Pete Rose  
Jr. is starting over on one of baseball's lowest rungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Jr. is getting ready to return to the New Jersey Jackals,  
an independent league team he played for last summer while trying 
to hang onto his major league dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of baseball's all-time hits leader got his spirits up  
when the Los Angeles Dodgers gave him a minor league contract and 
invited him to training camp this spring at his father's behest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers released him from their farm system during the last  
week of spring training, leaving Rose Jr. to return home and look 
for another chance somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to settle for the Jackals.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I have to go to the Northern League and put some  
numbers up,'' Rose Jr. said in a telephone interview Friday 
evening. ``Now I'm looking for the opportunity to get my foot back 
in the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing special, nothing to brag about, but it's  
baseball. I want the scouts to come and see me and say 1997 wasn't 
a fluke. Everyone has a fit somewhere. I've just got to go find 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose Jr. has spent most of his professional career trying vainly  
to find that fit since Baltimore drafted him in the 13th round in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The stocky infielder with his father's looks joined his father's  
organization and realized his dream of playing for the Cincinnati 
Reds in 1997. He hit .308 at Double-A with 25 homers and was called 
up on Sept. 1, when he started at first base and got a single with 
his father looking on. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been downhill from there. He didn't start again and went  
2-for-14 overall with nine strikeouts, then got into a contract 
dispute and wound up at Triple-A the next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Passed over by younger prospects, Rose Jr. chose free agency  
rather than accept a demotion to Double-A. He latched on with 
Pittsburgh's Triple-A team in Nashville, hit .208 and was released 
a month later. He finished the season playing left field for the 
Jackals and hitting .424 in a dozen games. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Dodgers invited him to training camp and gave him  
uniform No. 74, he considered it a turning point. He went 0-for-8 
in exhibition games with one RBI before being assigned to the minor 
league camp and then released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tough,'' Rose Jr. said. ``When something burns so  
much inside of you, it just drives you crazy and you find yourself 
in tears and shaking your head. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time that has ever happened to me. I've just  
got to keep moving on. It's just another setback. Lord knows I've 
had setbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his agent tried to find him a spot in some team's farm  
system, Rose Jr. worked out in his hometown for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he's been doing, Rose Jr. said, ``Besides driving  
everybody around me crazy and wanting to throw the remote through 
the TV every time I see a baseball game? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been swinging and throwing and just waiting.''

<HEADLINE> Army Grounds Hueys After crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army grounded its fleet of aging UH-1 Huey  
helicopters Friday because of concern that the recent crash of an 
air ambulance may signal a structural problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Four crew members were injured, two critically, when the  
helicopter from Fort Rucker, Ala., crashed May 1. The helicopter 
was returning to the base after transporting a burn victim to a 
hospital in Birmingham when it lost part of the tail boom in 
flight, the Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Army headquarters at the Pentagon said  
metal fatigue in the helicopter's tail fin is suspected. During the 
indefinite grounding, the Army and its reserve units plan to 
inspect each of the approximately 1,000 UH-1s for similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action was taken as a precaution to ensure the safety of  
soldiers,'' a statement from the Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UH-1, made by Bell Helicopter Textron, became a military  
mainstay, ferrying Americans troops in and out of battle during the 
Vietnam War. The $4.7 million aircraft is about 57 feet long, has a 
48-foot rotor and can reach speeds of up to 139 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In March last year, the Army and National Guard grounded their  
fleets after pilots complained the engines surged unpredictably. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army had already placed wide restrictions on the Hueys,  
including barring flights in clouds and over water. The Army 
studied the engine surge problem but did not find a cause.

<HEADLINE> First Female Graduates From Citadel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Citadel on Saturday graduated its  
first female cadet, ending a male-only tradition at the military 
school that stretched more than 150 years before ending as a result 
of a federal court fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Ruth Mace, a magna cum laude graduate in business  
administration, received her degree from her father, Emory Mace, 
the school's commandant of cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference after the ceremony, she told reporters she  
does not regard herself ``as a pioneer'' in ending single-gender 
education at The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace was clearly the best-known of the 386 cadets to graduate  
during ceremonies that featured Republican presidential hopeful Pat 
Buchanan warning about declining American military power. 
</P>
<P>
	She was greeted with applause as she accepted the degree. There  
had been some hissing during a ceremony earlier in the school year 
when she received her senior class ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Citadel officials nor Buchanan mentioned Mace or the  
school's controversial all-male admission's policy during the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace entered The Citadel in 1996 after the school dropped its  
all-male admissions policy. That change came after the U.S. Supreme 
Court struck down a similar policy at Virginia Military Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Citadel had fought a three-year battle started by Shannon  
Faulkner, who sought to join the corps of cadets. Faulkner was 
admitted in 1995 under a judge's order, but quit in less than a 
week, citing stress and isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other women entered with Mace. Kim Messer and Jeanie  
Mentavlos quit after the first semester, saying they had been hazed 
and harassed. Both women sued the school, Messer's lawsuit has been 
settled, Mentavlos' case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth woman, Petra Lovetinska, next year is expected to  
become The Citadel's first four-year graduate. Mace graduated in 
three years by transferring credits from a community college. 
</P>
<P>
	The Citadel now has 42 female cadets among its 1,800 students.  
</P>
<P>
	Mace will be an analyst with a business consulting firm in  
Charlotte, N.C., but noted she's only 21 and ``I don't know what I 
want to do with the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mace also announced she became engaged Friday night. She did not  
identify her fiance, except to say he was a senior who also 
graduated Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Star's Kids To Miss Film </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Their dad may star in this year's most  
anticipated film, but Liam Neeson's children won't get tickets to 
see ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>

going on,'' Neeson said in Friday's Daily News. The film opens May 
19.

	When the actor told his 4-year-old son Michael that he was going  
to a ``Star Wars'' party, Neeson said he had to assure his son 
``that the movie is only pretend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neeson also said playing the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn was a  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're playing a mythological character,'' he said. ``He's 300

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farmers Seek Price Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dairy farmers, hoping to make it through a  
disastrous agricultural year, are backing several measures intended 
to shield the industry from the wild price swings that have 
devastated other farm sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Milk marketing order reform, dairy compacts and price supports  
are major buzz words for the industry, which is trying to learn 
from the harsh experiences of grain and livestock farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sectors were hit hard by plummeting prices in the last  
year, and analysts have said the farm industry won't see much of a 
rebound this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be the next train wreck in agriculture,''  
said Christopher Galen, spokesman for the National Milk Producers 
Federation. ``A lot of those policy initiatives are aimed at 
stemming the train away from the bridge that's out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the policies have elicited something of a turf war with  
regions battling each other as well as farmers sparring with the 
processing industry. Many lawmakers have joined in the dairy fight 
to protect their regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight pits David against Goliath, with our family farmers  
up against a powerful lobby,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt. 
``Maintaining fair pricing policy benefits family farmers and 
consumers. This is an uphill battle we must win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., ``Our dated and pointless  
interference by the federal government in dairy policy has cost us 
too many Wisconsin farms. My legislative goal is to finally stop 
the perversion of dairy markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The milk marketing order reform proposal basically would  
overhaul the federal milk pricing system, which is divided 
regionally into what are known as orders that help set the price 
processors pay dairy farmers, much like the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is higher the farther a farm is from Eau Claire, Wis.,  
which was considered the hub of dairy production when the system 
was established decades ago as a way to ensure all regions had 
sufficient milk supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But milk marketing orders and a reform proposal by Agriculture  
Secretary Dan Glickman have sparked fierce debate among farmers, 
particularly those in the Midwest who have traditionally gotten 
lower prices. Glickman's proposal seeks to slightly close that 
disparity for the Midwest, much to the chagrin of farmers in other 
parts of the country. Several lawmakers have proposed legislation 
to overturn Glickman's proposed regulation, which is set to go 
before producers in a referendum in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a middle ground between the archaic status quo and a  
complete elimination of the market order system,'' insisted Rep. 
Ron Kind, D-Wis. ``If the dairy industry is to remain competitive, 
Congress should not advocate a rigid regulatory pricing system that 
pits region-against-region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of dairy compacts is just as contentious, with  
lawmakers from the Northeast and South uniting against the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the regional dairy compacts, states band together to set what  
they consider a ``fair price'' for fluid milk, which is higher than 
the federal government's minimum. A compact operating in the 
Northeast, covering Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, expires Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast region wants Congress to extend its compact while  
lawmakers from the South are pushing for their own. Opponents say 
the compacts will encourage overproduction and depress milk prices 
in other parts of the country. Supporters say they shield producers 
from fluctuating prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, compact supporters have 39 cosponsors in the Senate and  
more than 150 in the House, but with lawmakers from the Midwest 
staunchly opposed, industry observers can expect a fierce battle as 
the issue moves through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation for price supports is the least controversial.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the price support program, which is due to expire Dec. 31,  
the government buys butter, cheese, nonfat dry milk or skim milk 
powder whenever the market price drops below a government-set 
level. The result is a boost in prices so dairy farmers are 
protected from extremely low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our contention is that is a fairly cost effective way of  
providing a safety net in agriculture,'' said Galen, of the milk 
producers federation.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dallas Coach Landry Has Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tom Landry, who took the Dallas Cowboys to five  
Super Bowls, is in a different kind of battle now. He has been 
diagnosed with leukemia, and is undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Former quarterback Roger Staubach, who won two Super Bowls with  
the Cowboys, said Saturday that Alicia Landry, the 74-year-old Hall 
of Fame coach's wife, said doctors diagnosed the disease last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Alicia, and she said a blood test showed signs of  
anemia and that Tom had a form of leukemia,'' Staubach said. ``She 
said he had a good shot at remission because they caught it in the 
early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said the doctors were on top of the situation.''  
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Landry's home by The Associated Press went unanswered  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry has been undergoing chemotherapy in the first week of his  
hospital treatment, said Staubach, who would not say where Landry 
was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't sure how long he will be in the hospital,''  
Staubach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry had a checkup after feeling tired lately.  
</P>
<P>
	``He just wasn't feeling right,'' Staubach said. ``But he's a  
tough guy and in good shape, and he's going to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are several types of leukemia, a cancer that impairs the  
production of blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	In all types, abnormal white cells proliferate in the bone  
marrow, crowding out healthy blood cells. Other organs, such as the 
liver, spleen or lymph nodes, might stop functioning properly if 
infiltrated by the leukemic cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Leukemia is curable, with transfusions, anti-cancer drugs and  
radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry, the third-winningest coach in NFL history, ran the  
Cowboys for 29 years, beginning with the initial season of the 
franchise in 1960. His final season was 1988, and he was fired 
after Jerry Jones bought the team in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended his career with a 270-178-3 record, including playoffs,  
and led his team to a record 20 consecutive winning seasons, from 
1966 to 1985. Under Landry, the Cowboys went to the Super Bowl five 
times, winning Super Bowls VI and XII. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990  
and was included in the Cowboys' Ring of Honor in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Since being fired by Jones, Landry has devoted his time to  
speaking engagements, appearances on behalf of the Fellowship of 
Christian Athletes and evangelist Billy Graham, and business 
interests with his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Cowboys president Tex Schramm, who hired Landry as coach,  
called the news shocking 
</P>
<P>
	``But in a way, I knew that something was wrong,'' Schramm said  
by telephone from Florida. ``I saw Tom two weeks ago at his golf 
tournament and, in fact, I introduced him at a dinner, and he 
didn't look good. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked wrong and was not a healthy person.''  
</P>
<P>
	Schramm noted that Landry had a respiratory illness earlier in  
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had been in the hospital with double pneumonia, and I  
didn't know whether it was something he was still getting over,'' 
Schramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Cowboys, Landry was a defensive assistant  
with the New York Giants, where he had been a mainstay in the 
secondary through 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry's defense was largely responsible for the Giants' success  
in the late 50s. They won the NFL championship in 1956, and lost in 
the title game in 1958 and 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to his pro career, Landry played at the University of  
Texas, where he met his wife. They had three children, Tom Jr., 
Kitty Landry Phillips and the late Lisa Landry Childress. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Mrs. Childress died after a four-year battle with liver  
cancer. She rejected her doctor's advice four years earlier to 
begin chemotherapy immediately for fear of putting her unborn 
child's life in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, her decision to delay cancer treatment made no  
difference in her fate, her husband said at the time. The couple's 
daughter, Christina Alicia Childress, was born in August, 1991.

<HEADLINE> NATO Hits China Embassy in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO launched its fiercest  
bombardment yet of the Yugoslav capital overnight, targeting the 
Yugoslav army headquarters and other government buildings and 
mistakenly striking the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian firefighters went to the burning embassy building in the  
capital's New Belgrade district, where Chinese media reported that 
at least three of the 30 Chinese living inside were killed. 
Witnesses saw one person taken unconscious from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run Tanjug news agency said four Chinese were killed and  
five people -- including the Chinese military attache, who suffered 
chest wounds -- were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said NATO forces mistakenly hit the  
embassy with ``precision guided munitions,'' but had few details 
about how or why the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've offered our sincere regrets to the Chinese  
authorities,'' Shea told reporters in Brussels, Belgium. He said 
NATO forces had intended to hit a nearby army supply depot. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before the shattered embassy engulfed by fire and  
smoke, Ambassador Pan Zhanlin said: ``The People's Republic (of 
China) has been attacked.'' Dazed embassy staff ran about the area 
as firemen searched for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, China's official Xinhua News Agency said one of its  
reporters, Shao Yunhuan, was one of the dead. It also said more 
than 20 people were injured and two were missing in the attack. The 
agency said three NATO missiles slammed into the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese government and people express their utmost  
indignation and severe condemnation of the barbarian act,'' the 
government said in a statement reported by Xinhua. ``The U.S.-led 
NATO should bear all responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it struck hard at central Belgrade, hitting a  
presidential command bunker and a hotel housing the paramilitary 
Arkan Tigers. The alliance said it did not intentionally target the 
Chinese Embassy, adding that it ``regrets any damage to the embassy 
or injuries to Chinese diplomatic personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon would not confirm a  
NATO missile went awry, but he said NATO was targeting at least one 
building across the street from the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council began shortly  
after midnight today in New York. China, a permanent member of the 
council, has strongly opposed the bombing campaign and sided with 
the Serbs in the Kosovo issue. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Secretary-General Kofi Annan  
was ``shocked and distressed'' to learn that NATO airstrikes had 
hit civilian buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the president of the Yugoslav Left party, part of  
the ruling coalition in Yugoslavia, called the attack ``an 
aggression against the People's Republic of China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This might be the beginning of the Third World War,'' said  
Ljubisa Ristic. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the embassy, the jeep Ristic was traveling in was hit  
by shrapnel from another exploding NATO bomb, wounding him slightly 
when the windshield was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb struck the Hotel Yugoslavia, causing a huge fire.  
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said today that NATO had hit 
the ``war room of Arkan's paramilitaries,'' referring to indicted 
war crimes suspect Zeljko Raznatovic, or Arkan. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says Raznatovic owned a casino and spa inside hotel and has  
been using it as a base for his paramilitary forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, power to Belgrade was cut. Tanjug news agency said  
NATO had again used graphite bombs to cripple the power system. 
Witnesses also reported a huge fire in the direction of the 
capital's main power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Other buildings hit in downtown Belgrade included the Yugoslav  
Army headquarters, the Defense Ministry, a large police precinct 
and the Interior Ministry, Yugoslavia media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO jets also pounded Novi Sad, Sombor and outlying districts  
of Belgrade. Media reports said bombs landed on Batajnica, site of 
a major military airfield north of the capital, and the southern 
Rakovica district. 
</P>
<P>
	The overnight attacks on Belgrade came hours after NATO cluster  
bombs fell in a residential area of the southern city of Nis, 
reportedly killing 15 people and injuring 60 others. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO acknowledged it had used cluster bombs in an attack on a  
military airport in Nis and that it was ``highly probable'' one 
bomb went astray. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes came a day after Russia and major Western powers  
agreed to a proposal that would bring an international force to 
Kosovo. President Slobodan Milosevic's government signaled it would 
eventually accept the deal -- if the alliance stops the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug called the proposed peace agreement ``only the start of a  
very lengthy and complex process, which will probably end 
successfully.'' Many details of the plan still must be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia wants the bombing to stop, while NATO insists the Serbs  
first stop the repression of ethnic Albanians. The United States 
wants a complete pullout of Serb forces, while Moscow and Belgrade 
talk of a partial pullout. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft plan for ending the conflict also must be endorsed by  
the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched the air attacks March 24 to force Milosevic into  
compliance. Nearly 700,000 ethnic Albanians have fled the province 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, 5,000 Kosovo Albanians from villages near the  
western city of Pec streamed across the Morini border station 
today, said officials of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe.

	US Consulate Attacked in China  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Protesters broke into and severely burned a U.S.  
consulate building in southwest China in the worst attack yet in 
two days of protests outside U.S. buildings across China, a U.S. 
Embassy spokesman said Sunday. A large number of people broke into 
the consulate compound in Chengdu and severely burned the consulate 
general's residence, said Tom Cooney, an embassy spokesman in 
Beijing. No U.S. staff were injured and Chinese police used tear 
gas to disperse the crowd, he said. In Bejing, more than 1,000 
protesters hurled rocks and lumps of concrete at embassy buildings 
and cars in Beijing. Demonstrators also protested outside the 
British Embassy.

	TWA Flight May Have Been Held

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
had concluded within six months after TWA Flight 800 crashed off 
the coast of Long Island that mechanical failure was to blame, but 
the FBI sat on the report, The Washington Post is reporting in 
Sunday editions. The paper says that FBI officials, still convinced 
terrorists had downed the plane, dismissed the 24-page ATF report, 
prepared in January 1997, as ``unprofessional and reprehensible'' 
and even persuaded a Treasury Department undersecretary to help 
them suppress it. The Post said it was November 1997 before the FBI 
acknowledged publicly that a mechanical flaw had ignited the Boeing 
747's central fuel tank, causing the crash.

	DEL CITY, Okla. (AP) -- Following an aerial tour of the outskirts

so much destruction over such a wide area. The president promised 
up to $12.5 million to provide temporary jobs for victims of the 
deadly tornadoes that leveled entire neighborhoods and killed at 
least 50 people this past week in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and 
Tennessee. Half of the funds will immediately be made available to 
put 3,500 Oklahomans and 600 Kansans to work. Clinton also said he 
would ask Congress for an additional $372 million for FEMA's

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Plays Mr. Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kate Capshaw's return to the movie set caused a  
role reversal at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my summer to reign as king of the house, and I loved  
it,'' her husband, two-time Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg, 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, awarded an Oscar this year for his direction of  
``Saving Private Ryan,'' stayed home with the couple's seven 
children during Capshaw's seven-week shoot of ``The Love Letter,'' 
which opens May 21. Capshaw stars in the film and served as its 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	After the movie wrapped, ``I was hardly ready to give her back  
the scepter,'' Spielberg says. ``There was a little power 
struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capshaw has given first priority to her family after marrying  
Spielberg in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been able to be on a set 14 hours a day and be the  
mother that I wanted to be,'' she tells US magazine in its June 
issue. In the couple's normal routine, she says, ``my little 
village is in the home, and his little village is the set.''

<HEADLINE> Magic: No Secrets to Slow Iverson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic don't pretend to have the  
answer to stopping Allen Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Armstrong will try. So will Nick Anderson, Penny  
Hardaway, Matt Harpring and whoever else winds up isolated against 
the NBA scoring champion when he makes his playoff debut Sunday for 
the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to get his, I don't care what you're going to do,''  
Orlando coach Chuck Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You study film and you can take away some of an opponent's  
offensive sets. But people who can create are still going to do 
that. That's what Iverson does. He can go anywhere he wants on the 
floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for the Magic will be to make sure the 76ers star  
doesn't move far without a defender right in his face. They'll bump 
him, make it difficult to come off screens and try to force him to 
take jump shots instead of penetrating to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando had some success against Iverson during the regular  
season, holding him to 37 percent shooting and 22.7 points per game 
-- 4.1 less than his league-best 26.8 average. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 76ers won two of three meetings. They led the third  
before Armstrong stole an inbounds pass with 3.3 seconds and scored 
at the buzzer to give the Magic a one-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson had 14 points on 5-of-21 shooting that night. The key to  
the five-game series that begins Sunday not only will be 
duplicating those kinds of numbers, but containing his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Geiger and Theo Ratliff both averaged well over their  
season scoring averages against Orlando. George Lynch had a 
career-high 20 rebounds in the game the 76ers lost to the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a total team effort. No one guy can stop  
Iverson. It's going to be five guys out there focused on the same 
goal, and that's playing him a lot tougher,'' Hardaway said. ``At 
the same time, you can't let the guys who are supposedly role 
players on the team beat you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of victories over the Magic in Philadelphia, Iverson  
had 16 points on 5-of-18 shooting on Feb. 6 and 38 points on 
15-for-28 shooting in the most recent meeting on April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we had as much success as we could have,''  
Hardaway said. ``He's just so quick. You've really just got to make 
him shoot jump shots. You don't want him to get to the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the Magic are counting on Armstrong. He may be the  
only player on Orlando's roster with the quickness necessary to 
disrupt the Iverson's rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so quick. I'm so quick. It'll be a fun game. I know he's  
going to beat me sometimes, but there will be times when he 
won't,'' Armstrong said. ``He can destroy your confidence quickly. 
If you let that happen, you're done for the whole day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers, on the other hand, are hoping that trying to contain  
Iverson on defense will take away from Armstrong's effectiveness on 
offense for the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong averaged career highs in points, assists, rebounds and  
steals this season and was instrumental in the team's surprising 
33-17 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's usually their emotional leader, but he'll have his hands  
full chasing Allen,'' Philadelphia's Eric Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoff appearance is the first since 1991 for the 76ers,  
who finished with a 28-22 record as Iverson -- at six-feet tall -- 
became the shortest player in NBA history to win a scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not afraid of anybody,'' Hardaway said. ``Once the  
playoffs start, we're confident that there isn't any team that we 
can't beat, especially at home.''

	China Protesters Attack U.S. Embassy  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- More than a thousand demonstrators attacked the  
U.S. Embassy in Beijing with rocks, smashed up embassy cars and 
scuffled with hundreds of police officers today in a protest over 
the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
Police pushed back demonstrators who tried to ram a van and hurl a 
burning American flag through the embassy gate. Protesters used 
pieces of concrete that had been left in piles by workers 
rebuilding sidewalks to break many of the windows in embassy 
buildings spread over one block. Several cars were smashed with 
chunks of concrete. 

</P>

	U.N. Concerned by Embassy Missile  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council today expressed shock  
and concern over the NATO missile strike on China's embassy in 
Belgrade which reportedly killed three people. While apologizing 
for the loss of life, the United States and its NATO allies 
countered that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bore the blame 
for any casualties from the NATO raids because he had refused to 
comply with international demands for a peaceful settlement in 
Kosovo. ``NATO would never target civilians and NATO would never 
target an embassy,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh told the 
council. China's state-run news agency Xinhua said three people 
died.

	2 Gun Groups May Back Clinton Plan

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two firearms industry groups have agreed to  
support some of the Clinton administration's new gun-control 
proposals, including raising the age eligibility for buying a 
handgun from 18 to 21 and holding parents criminally responsible 
for allowing children access to guns, The Washington Post reported 
today. Leaders of the American Shooting Sports Council and the 
National Shooting Sports Council also agreed on measures forbidding 
juveniles convicted of violent felonies from ever buying a gun and 
requiring people who sell guns at gun shows to make background 
checks on the buyers, the newspaper reported.

President Clinton to pay nearly $500,000 to cover their costs 
following a judge's finding that Clinton had committed civil 
contempt in the sexual harassment case. Clinton's lawyer called the 
request unreasonable. The president already paid $850,000 to settle 
the case while its dismissal was on appeal. The compensation 
proposal yesterday came a month after U.S. District Judge Susan 
Webber Wright found Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, 
false testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Relief Efforts Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Hundreds of relief workers on Saturday  
labored under a searing sun to sort through truckloads of donated 
goods waiting for delivery to the thousands left homeless by last 
week's devastating tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Whitaker, one of nine pastors at the First Baptist Church,  
said almost all 200,000 square feet at the church have been put to 
use in the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Federal  
Emergency Management Agency and others have established operations 
inside while a cafeteria feeds three meals a day to about 3,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	It was by happenstance that the church became a shelter,  
Whitaker said. The church stands just across the street from where 
major damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``All people could see after the tornado passed was the light of  
our cross and they started coming this way,'' Whitaker said. ``From 
the moment the tornado happened, the church became the primary hub 
for this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storms killed at least 50 people in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and  
Tennessee and injured hundreds more. More than 9,000 homes were 
destroyed in the greater Oklahoma City area and more than 8,500 
buildings in Kansas were severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Johns, president of the Southwestern Insurance Information  
Service, said damage estimates continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the number of claims received so far, this could be a  
statewide insured loss of $750 million with about $600-plus million 
in the Oklahoma City metro area,'' Johns said. ``By comparison, the 
worst tornado in the country was in 1975 in Nebraska with insured 
total loss of $1.1 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Polley and Tony Gray left their jobs at a manufacturing  
plant in Pella, Iowa, on Thursday and drove to Oklahoma to pitch in 
with the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a family of my own and what goes around comes around,''  
Polley said. ``If we ever get in a time of need in Iowa, I hope 
someone helps us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of relief service vans and trucks were in a large parking  
lot on the east side of the church. Six refrigerated trucks sat in 
back, loaded with meat, fresh produce, milk and other perishables. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Binkowski of the Red Cross said 24 trucks have been sent  
out to deliver meals in the field and the agency has delivered 
10,000 meals since the tornadoes struck. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen insurance companies set up emergency operations out  
of vans in the same lot as did several phone companies, which made 
dozens of lines available for victims to call loved ones, insurance 
companies and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Maxfield, a Blair High School sophomore, willingly gave  
up her Saturday to join the relief effort after seeing all of the 
damage on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of scary to see,'' she said.

<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- James E. Charlet, the former publisher  
and general manager of The Leaf-Chronicle, died Thursday at 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlet purchased a share in The Leaf-Chronicle in 1946 and went  
on to build a chain of 14 newspapers. By 1960, the firm owned the 
largest group of weeklies published in a single plant in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Publications included the Stewart County Times, Donelson News  
Diary, Suburban News, Madison Community News, Goodlettsville 
Gazette, Hendersonville Star-News, Dickson County Herald, 
Springfield Herald, the Gallatin Examiner, Ashland City Times and 
Waverly News Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlet, his wife and three other stockholders sold The  
Leaf-Chronicle in 1973 to Multimedia but Charlet continued as 
president and publisher until 1978, turning the newspaper over to 
his son, James E. Charlet Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son, daughter, five grandchildren and seven  
great-grandchildren.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, an oil tycoon and the owner of the  
New York Jets, who last year came close to seeing his team return 
to the Super Bowl one last time, died Friday from complications of 
a blood disease. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, one of the wealthiest owners in professional sports, was  
in a group that bought the Jets of the American Football League in 
1963, when they were the New York Titans. He bought out his 
partners in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess died without seeing the Jets back in the Super Bowl. Their  
only appearance came in 1969 when Joe Namath led them to a landmark 
victory over the Baltimore Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in a collision with a teammate during a 1992 game, Hess offered 
financial and medical support throughout Byrd's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess acquired Amerada in 1969 after an ownership battle with  
Phillips Petroleum. Forbes magazine last year listed his net worth 
at $720 million. He stepped down as chairman and CEO of Amerada 
Hess Corp. in 1995.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tibor Kalman, an innovative graphic designer who  
used visual images to try to effect social change, died Sunday of 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	He died in a hotel near San Juan, Puerto Rico.  
</P>
<P>
	Kalman, who founded and ran the Manhattan design firm M&AMP;Co, had  
his staff do work that evoked the look of handmade signs, menus and 
flyers instead of a more polished corporate style. 
</P>
<P>
	He designed Barnes &AMP; Noble's distinctive shopping bag early in  
his career, and later did an album cover for the Talking Heads. 
Kalman produced a photographic series about New Yorkers' 
interactions with Times Square, which hung on a building there. 
</P>

	Kalman also worked as an editor and creative director at the  
magazines Art Forum and Interview. He was editor-in-chief of 
Colors, a magazine published by the clothing company Benetton.

</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Paul  
Liacos, whose tenure was marked by decisions on large issues such 
as abortion, racial bias and the right to an education, died 
Thursday at age 69. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Liacos, who gained a reputation as an unabashed liberal, was  
appointed chief justice in 1989 by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis after 
serving 13 years as an associate justice. He stepped down in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, the SJC held that the state constitution  
prohibited the death penalty, the court provided broader protection 
for a woman's access to abortion, and it gave defendants greater 
protection in search and seizure cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In a major opinion written by Liacos, the court found that the  
state constitution requires children be provided an adequate 
education, a decision that spurred enactment of the state's 
ambitious education reform law. Liacos also opposed minimum 
mandatory prison sentences, contending that sentencing should be 
left to the discretion of judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Liacos founded the SJC's Committee to Study Racial and Ethnic  
Bias in the Courts and served as chairman of the national 
Conference of Chief Justices' Committee on Discrimination in the 
Courts.

revolutionaries who fought alongside Fidel Castro to seize power in 
Cuba in the 1950s, died Friday of a heart attack. His age was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dictator Fulgencio Batista jailed Montane with Castro and other  
guerrillas in Cuba's Isle of Pines for several years after they 
mounted a failed attack in 1953 on the Moncada army barracks in 
Santiago, launching the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The revolutionaries were later released under an amnesty decree  
and fled to Mexico, where they planned a second attack on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	They returned in 1956, vanished into the countryside and  
continued fighting Batista, finally overthrowing him Jan. 1, 1959.

played for a dozen teams in the Negro leagues in the 1920s and

</P>
<P>
	Owens, who had only a sixth-grade education, broke in with the

following a stroke. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the AP in Detroit in 1958, Schroeder was a

used his bulk to advantage in a succession of television and movie 
bad-guy roles, died Wednesday of a heart attack, The 
Press-Enterprise reported. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	He had recently completed a role in Nickelodeon's ``The Journey  
of Allen Strange'' series, scheduled to air this summer.

<P>
	Swalve weighed 300-plus pounds and was a onetime  
semi-professional football player, but was known as a gentle man 
who disliked violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He began acting after he was discharged from the Marine Corps in  
1968. He appeared with Southern California theater companies and 
worked as a stuntman before making his film debut in 1983 in ``The 
Zoo Gang,'' which starred Ben Vereen. 
</P>
<P>
	Swalve's other films included ``City Heat,'' ``Heartbreak  
Ridge,'' ``Barton Fink,'' ``Hands of Steel,'' ``Police Academy 6,'' 
``Open House'' and ``Underground.'' Television credits included 
``The A-Team,'' ``Jake and the Fatman'' and ``Moonlighting.''

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Pick Up the Pieces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBER, Okla. (AP) -- She sat seven miles from home, watching TV  
reports of a spinning, swooping funnel dancing along the red-clay 
prairie. Then she heard where the twister was heading and her 
stomach tightened. She knew what was next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just lost our house,'' Kim Kennedy calmly told her husband,  
Terry. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, the phone rang at her grandmother's house. It was  
a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Is it gone? Is it gone?' '' she recalls, her eyes  
widening in her freckled face as she remembers her question. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Kennedy home was gone, swept away by the wind.  
</P>
<P>
	One day, old-timers will tell tales of the Oklahoma twister of  
'99, the monster that killed 41 in this state alone, injured 
hundreds, and gobbled up thousands of homes, causing hundreds of 
millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family of Rural Route 1 will add their own chapter:  
Their home was among the first to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It sat near the beginning of the tornado trail that ripped a  
60-mile gash across central Oklahoma, hurling propane tanks like 
soda cans, impaling cows on barbed wire, throwing horses onto 
parked cars, yanking a baby from his mother, lifting a man into 
soot-swirling skies and carrying him the length of four football 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Kennedys and their two children, this past week has been  
a time to seek comfort wherever they can; often it has come deep in 
mounds of mud, plaster and bricks. 
</P>
<P>
	There they have plucked out Bibles, an antique gold cameo brooch  
Kim inherited from her great-grandmother, a cherished salt shaker 
that belonged to her grandmother, even their 10-year-old daughter's 
knitting needle. They're still digging for the pocket-size Bible an 
uncle carried during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be OK,'' Mrs. Kennedy says, clutching a 'Ewe's  
Welcome' wooden sheep sign that once adorned their house. ``If I 
didn't know there was a God in control, you wouldn't see a smile on 
my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They retrieved one more treasure: a photo in shattered glass of  
a second cousin, 18-month-old Blake Kennedy, killed in the federal 
building bombing four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried,'' Mrs. Kennedy says, ``when I saw that.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Six miles north on the path of ruin, Don Smith searches for his  
own memory of the federal building. 
</P>
<P>
	For seven days in April 1995, the 37-year-old firefighter clawed  
and picked his way through rubble, pulling out victims of the 
Murrah building terrorist attack. He was given a granite chunk of 
the first floor as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
	It sat proudly atop his fireplace. But now his fireplace is  
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, are the walls, roof, floor, sinks, couch, closet,  
clothes, beds, stove, just about everything that belonged to the 
Smiths except their dazed Dalmatian -- who suffered a broken nose -- 
some photos and a few guitars he saved from his playing days in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll humble you in a heartbeat,'' says his brother, Wes, who  
traveled from the Ozarks to lend a helping hand. ``One day you have 
everything in life. The next day you're out in the grass, kicking, 
trying to find something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith lost it all, but still is lucky.  
</P>
<P>
	He lives in Bridge Creek, a tiny community where 11 people died.  
It now looks like a Mad Max landscape: car doors twisted like taffy 
around trees, homes chewed up and spit out into heaps of metal and 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
	In two days, Smith buried 34 horses and too many dogs to  
remember on these windswept hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaning against his truck, stuffed with shopping bags of donated  
clothes and laundry baskets with soft drinks, toothpaste and cheese 
crackers, he ponders his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do what everybody else does,'' he says. ``Sit down and cry  
awhile, then try to figure out what to do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just strike one,'' he adds with a laugh. ``I think you  
get three in life -- don't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Every now and then, a squeal of joy echoes through 130th Street  
in southwest Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	A dog is found. A bird's chirp is heard. Small blessings.  
</P>
<P>
	For Gary Welsh, it came Wednesday when he unearthed his  
next-door neighbor's parrot from the remains of their dining room. 
The cage was a bit twisted, the gray-blue bird a bit ruffled, but 
alive it was. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado veered northeast from the farmlands, barging across  
the city line, barreling into houses and garages, transforming the 
neighborhood into what looks like a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the days pass, humor survives among the ruins.  
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Martinez, 48, sits in his driveway, his house a heap of  
rubble behind him, as his insurance adjuster walks up and jokingly 
says: 
</P>
<P>
	``With a little duct tape, we can fix this up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is ready with a quick reply:  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll sell it to you for real cheap.''  
</P>
<P>
	Down the street, someone has scrawled across the front of  
another destroyed house: 
</P>
<P>
	``Fixer Upper. Make Offer.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lovella Bahm doesn't live here anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh Lord, how she would love to sleep in the same place she has  
for 34 years, but it is gone, along with many of her neighbors' 
places in Midwest City, at the northern edge of the storm's path. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world still turns. She discovered that in her mail this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury duty notice was awaiting her.  
</P>
<P>
	She called to beg off, but was told to write a letter explaining  
her plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just corked me!'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look here,'' she told them, recalling her spiel with a wagging  
finger, her piercing blue eyes glimmering beneath her white sun 
hat. ``I don't have a house, a pencil, or chair to sit in. You're 
going to have to lay down on the ground and find me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement wasn't supposed to be like this.  
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old grandmother planned to go with her husband on  
their annual trip to Padre Island, then spend the rest of her year 
surrounded by the comforts of home. But now her Jacuzzi is squashed 
by a Dumpster, her aviary of 100 cockatiels is nowhere to be found, 
her plate collection is shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	One moment she was huddling in the cellar with her grandson and  
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, poof! In a few seconds, like a wave of a diabolical magic  
wand, it was all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many other survivors along the tornado trail, Mrs. Bahm  
will rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	But she's taking things slow and easy.  
</P>
<P>
	As the sun sets, she stands by the wooden gate that withstood  
the storm's fury and ponders the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to think positive,'' she says. ``Everything happens  
for the best. Well, I don't know about that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then she pauses for a moment for a final thought.  
</P>
<P>
	``As time passes things will heal,'' she says. ``I'm sure I  
will, too.''

<HEADLINE> RJR Slow in Anti-Smoke Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the maker of Camel  
and Winston cigarettes, turned over only one billboard for 
anti-smoking messages when the ban on tobacco advertising on big 
outdoor signs took effect last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Several state officials said they had to prod another major  
cigarette company, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the maker of 
Kool and Lucky Strike, to provide billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the states got free use of 4,277 billboards from the  
tobacco companies as of April 23, when the tobacco ad ban took 
effect, according to the Office on Smoking and Health at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The office 
helped the states get anti-smoking billboard signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris USA, the maker of Marlboro and the biggest  
cigarette company, said it turned over about 1,900 billboards. 
Brown &AMP; Williamson gave the states about 1,700 billboards, 
according to the National Association of Attorneys General, while 
Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Reynolds supplied the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health officials in some states like West Virginia said  
they felt they were entitled to more billboards than they got. 
</P>
<P>
	But other states got more billboards than they had anticipated,  
said Joel Ressler, a senior deputy attorney general in Pennsylvania 
who has been in discussions with several states over the billboard 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately we seem to have wound up where we should have  
been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard ban resulted from last November's settlement  
agreement between the major tobacco companies and 46 states to 
resolve claims for the costs of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry agreed to pay the states $206 billion over 25 years  
and accept marketing restrictions including a halt to cigarette 
advertising on billboards. The states agreed to drop their suits 
for tobacco-related health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard provision required that tobacco ads would come  
down five months after the agreement was signed and allowed the 
states to use the space where the cigarette ads had been for the 
rest of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds managed to hand over only one billboard -- a sign on a  
heavily traveled highway along the Hudson River in New York City -- 
because it switched to shorter-term billboard leases in October 
even as the tobacco settlement talks were under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new contracts, nearly all its billboard leases expired  
on or before March 31, about three weeks before the billboard ad 
ban was to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Crosslin, a spokeswoman for Reynolds, said the company  
made the move because of ``the uncertain times in the industry'' 
and said it wasn't the first time Reynolds had negotiated 
shorter-term leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Belluck, a former special counsel to the New York state  
attorney general's office who worked on the billboard issue, said 
Reynolds' representatives told him ``we took a chance and our bet 
paid off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson canceled its billboard leases after the  
settlement was signed, according to spokesman Mark Smith. He said 
that was done to assure its outdoor tobacco ads would be down by 
the April deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the company then gave the states a list of their  
billboards and asked which ones the states wanted. The company 
reacquired leases where it could, but found some billboards had 
already been leased to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson then agreed to buy replacement boards in  
locations that would be seen by as many, if not more, people, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Eckhart, deputy attorney general for the state of  
California, said Brown &AMP; Williamson ``realized they shouldn't 
have'' canceled the leases after the settlement was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company initially offered to buy boards near schools  
for anti-smoking messages instead, but the state insisted on 
getting boards with visibility comparable to the boards the company 
had been using for tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the state eventually agreed on replacement  
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eckhart called it ``a frustrating experience. We had a lot  
of back and forth to get them to live up to their obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Belluck described similar difficult negotiations with  
Brown &AMP; Williamson. ``They hemmed and hawed but we had them dead to 
rights,'' he said, adding ``we felt we did okay on the deal'' 
ultimately worked out for replacement boards.

<HEADLINE> Bush Undeclared but Leading the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A month from his debut as a presidential  
campaigner, Gov. George W. Bush professes amazement at his ranking 
atop the Republican field in a race he plans to run on his terms 
and on his timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows what's coming when he takes the road from Texas. He  
stayed put to deal with the business of the state Legislature, 
which adjourns at the end of the month. So Republican leaders came 
to him, 150 or more, to see, hear and endorse the man at the top of 
the preseason polls for the GOP nomination, and for the 2000 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, he talks in minute  
detail of state legislation, but he is purposefully vague on 
national issues. ``I know what I believe, and I know what I will 
fight for,'' he said. ``I will have a tax plan. I'll have plans on 
various issues which we will lay out on my timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very long and arduous road, as you know, and the  
temptation's going to be for people to want to know it immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do on this, what are you going to do on  
that? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be specific in some areas and in some areas, I'll hold my  
fire, so I'll have something to say over the course of the fall and 
the winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will intensify the pressure, the questions, the criticism  
from other candidates and from commentators for a detailed platform 
from Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	It will come in a rush when Bush begins his active campaign next  
month. He's booked to begin with two private fund-raising events on 
the way to a day of campaigning in Iowa on June 12. He's to be in 
New Hampshire on June 14 and 15. After opening in the small states 
that hold the initial contests of the 2000 primary season, Bush is 
booked for a campaign tour in the biggest, California, in late 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Current planning puts him on the campaign road for two weeks in  
June, two weeks in July and 17 days in August. No gradual glide 
path into the campaign for Bush; he begins running in a rush, with 
a media crowd certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are going to be a lot of diversions,'' Bush says.  
``There'll be moments of stress, and I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Make that months of stress. There is no political role more  
intense and demanding than running for president, especially for 
the candidate in front. Every public pronouncement is sifted, every 
slip magnified. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush saw it in his father's presidential campaigns, the winner  
in 1988, the loser in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	And front-runners have fallen before. Gov. George Romney of  
Michigan led in advance but collapsed as a candidate in 1968. Sen. 
Edmund S. Muskie of Maine was the faraway Democratic favorite in 
1972, until he faltered and failed in the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to stay focused on why people should be for me,''  
says Bush, who does not yet call his candidacy by name. He's still 
exploring, undeclared. But that's only timing. He's raised $7.6 
million, expects to at least double that by midsummer. There are 
about 35 people in his Austin political headquarters, and they're 
hiring. More than half the 32 Republican governors are backing him, 
as are about 100 GOP members of Congress. ``We've got the 
beginnings of a good political operation in some of the states,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	All with the candidate at a distance. His father became  
president in 1989 after a long apprenticeship in government that 
began long before his eight years as vice president. The son's 
campaign standing comes after one term as governor and landslide 
re-election in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm amazed,'' Bush says. ``... I know I've got a lot of  
work to do after the session's over to go to these states where I 
haven't been ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	At home, he's studying national policy issues, meeting regularly  
with a team of advisers with Washington know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that one of the things I'm good at is campaigning -- I  
like people a lot -- I like to shake hands and I like to look people 
in the eye and say I'd like for you to hear me and help me out,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that kind of one-on-one campaign is difficult if not  
impossible in the era of nonstop television, boom microphones, 
crowds of reporters, Secret Service security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to go shake those hands,'' Bush said. ``It's going to  
be interesting to see how we can accomplish that.'' That's been his 
strength in Texas campaigns, not the stump speech to the crowd. 
There will have to be more of the latter now, and more television 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	All to put him to the special tests of the leader. ``I know the  
expectations are high,'' Bush says. ``As my daughter said, 'Dad, 
you're not nearly as cool as people think.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He's about to begin finding out.

<HEADLINE> Prom Goes On Despite Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Thanks in large part to benefactors at a  
rival high school, students were able to salvage their prom tonight 
even though many lost their homes and clothing to the deadly storms 
that swept through the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing fashion finery donated by local shops and Edmond North  
High School students, the Del City High School couples arrived at 
prom hoping to cap a week of bad memories with good ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher Alice Furstenau, a sponsor of the prom, said the Edmond  
North students who began the drive to collect formal wear for 
tornado victims made the occasion come together. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did everything from helping the girls pick out  
accessories to helping decorate for the prom,'' Ms. Furstenau said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said even though many Del City students lost their homes,  
she had 20 calls asking if the prom was still on. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just want to come see each other and make sure everyone  
is OK,'' Ms. Furstenau said. 
</P>
<P>
	For some students, the prom was the first time they have seen  
friends from school since the twister struck. Some cried and hugged 
each other as they encountered familiar faces whose fate they had 
not known until that moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Principal Alford Nichols said holding the prom despite  
the circumstances was the first step toward restoring normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids are going to pick up and go on because they are  
survivors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traci Harriman, 17, a junior, was wearing a black satin gown  
trimmed with silver sequins that she picked out from among the 
hundreds of dresses that were donated. 
</P>
<P>
	``My house is pretty much gone. I was so fortunate to have these  
girls help me, or I wouldn't have been able to go to my prom,'' she 
said. ``I think they are angels.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Estate Trustees Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Million-dollar salaries and unabashed political  
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were privileges enjoyed by five Hawaiians who managed one  
of the nation's wealthiest trusts, the $10 billion Bishop Estate 
whose sole beneficiary is a school for children of Hawaiian 
ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Probate Judge Kevin Chang on Friday removed four of the five  
trustees and accepted the fifth's resignation due to Internal 
Revenue Service concerns about their pay, perks and possible 
self-dealing. Chang handed control to a panel of community leaders, 
including a former police chief, retired Navy admiral and an 
Episcopal priest. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's decision came after the IRS said it might revoke the  
estate's tax-exempt status if trustees Richard Wong, Henry Peters, 
Lokelani Lindsey, Oswald Stender and Gerard Jervis remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the exemption, the estate would stand to lose hundreds  
of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling caps a years-long drama involving a once-untouchable  
board comprising some of the state's most powerful Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust, created by the 1884 will of Princess Bernice Pauahi  
Bishop to educate ``the children of Hawaii,'' is the state's 
largest private landowner. Its only beneficiary, the Kamehameha 
Schools, educate 3,100 students of Hawaiian descent on a 600-acre 
campus overlooking downtown Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenue from 337,000 acres of Hawaii land -- and worldwide  
investments that include 10 percent of the Wall Street firm Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co. -- also paid more than $840,000 a year in commissions to 
each of the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang's order came one day after another judge permanently  
removed Lindsey for mismanagement and abuse of power overseeing the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take responsibility for some mistakes that I've made,''  
Lindsey said. ``But there's a lot of things that I've been accused 
of that I have not done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate state investigation, Wong and Peters have been  
indicted for allegedly receiving kickbacks in an estate land deal 
involving Wong's brother-in-law. Wong is a former state Senate 
president and Peters a former state House Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The burly, imposing Peters called Chang's ruling the second  
overthrow of Hawaiians. He was referring to the 1893 overthrow of 
the Hawaiian monarchy by a group of white businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done very well and we're not going to apologize for our  
successes,'' Peters said. ``We are big; we are massive; we are 
wealthy. We are proud of it.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Dirk Bogarde Dies at 78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Dirk Bogarde, the British actor who starred in  
more than 70 films and captured the hearts of many women in the 
1950s, died Saturday, his nephew said. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The British film star, who achieved his greatest fame in ``Death  
in Venice,'' died of a heart attack at his London home, said Brock 
Van den Bogaerde. He suffered a damaging stroke in 1996 and had 
been under 24-hour nursing care since last May. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was extremely happy and looking forward to events like his  
80th birthday and many plans for the future,'' his nephew said. 
``I'm sure there is not a better way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in London on March 28, 1921, Dirk Niven Van den Bogaerde  
was the son of a former actress and a photograph editor of The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career as a scene designer and commercial artist,  
but always dreamed of acting. In the late 1930s, Bogarde joined the 
British army as an officer in Air Photographic Intelligence, 
serving in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as he returned to England from military service, Bogarde  
joined a small theater group. Soon, he landed roles in the 
lighthearted ``Doctor in the House'' series, and by the 1950s, the 
actor with the boyish good looks had become a matinee idol. 
</P>
<P>
	``People forget that Dirk Bogarde was the male hero of Britain  
for about 20 years,'' said director Michael Winner. ``Every girl in 
the country was in love with him. He was the United Kingdom's 
Leonardo di Caprio of his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Screaming audiences mobbed him at public appearances. The  
attention soon led to bigger roles in movies such as ``A Tale of 
Two Cities,'' in which he played Sidney Carton, and other films 
such as ``Darling'' and ``The Servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was our first homegrown film star,'' said former actress  
Glenda Jackson, who is now a Labor government minister. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1960s, Bogarde sought a quieter life and retreated  
from England to a 15th century farmhouse in France. He began a 
second career, as a writer, producing several novels and a series 
of autobiographical works, including ``For The Time Being,'' 
published last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his books, Bogarde described himself as a solitary figure  
with a ``hermit crab syndrome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1986, he  
reluctantly returned to England, where he became an enthusiastic 
supporter of voluntary euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Bogarde never married or had children. Funeral arrangements were  
not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> JFK Autopsy Chief Dies of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- James J. Humes, the lead  
pathologist at President Kennedy's autopsy and a target of 
conspiracy theorists, has died of lung cancer at age 74. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Thursday at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach, just outside  
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chief pathologist at Bethesda Naval Hospital when  
Kennedy's body was flown there for an autopsy. The pathology team 
concluded Kennedy was killed by two bullets fired from behind -- a 
finding disputed to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Humes stood by his work in his most famous case. Aside from  
testimony before government panels, he rarely spoke of the autopsy 
and gave only one interview published in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the conspiracy theories ``general idiocy'' and ``a  
tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost defies belief, but I guess it is the price we pay  
for living in a free country,'' he said. ``I can only question the 
motives of those who propound these ridiculous theories for a price 
and who have turned the president's death into a profit-making 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humes gave the interview to rebut conspiracy talk that resulted  
from release of the Oliver Stone film ``JFK,'' said former JAMA 
editor George Lundberg, a longtime friend of Humes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a consummate professional who succeeded brilliantly in  
all he ever did, and yet had this one day hung around his neck 
forever in the eyes of many,'' Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Humes retired from the Navy as a captain. He was a clinical  
pathology professor at University Medical Center's Health Service 
Center in Jacksonville and formerly was medical director of St. 
John Medical Center in Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Search Goes On for Tornado Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- They are the missing: Tram Bui, a  
23-year-old Seminole woman who was blown from underneath a highway 
overpass, and Barbara and John Potton, a British couple who 
vanished while traveling in a motor home north of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of those still unaccounted-for after Monday's fierce  
tornadoes that killed 46 people in Oklahoma and Kansas has been 
narrowed to three. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pottons, in their 60s, haven't been heard from since calling  
relatives a few hours before the tornadoes struck, Ray Blakeney of 
the state medical examiner's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we're concerned about them is they always contact  
their family every day that they are traveling,'' he said. He 
didn't know their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bui was last seen trying to shelter herself from the storm  
beneath an Interstate 35 overpass. Police Sgt. Nate Tarver said the 
fate of all three may never be known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what a tornado does with people,'' he said.  
``Some people are picked up and dropped with no injuries. And 
others are never seen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deadly weather didn't stop in the central Plains -- on  
Tuesday and Wednesday, storms killed four people in Tennessee and 
another person in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers planned to search the rubble again today. More than  
10,500 homes are estimated to have been destroyed or damaged in 
Oklahoma. In Kansas, 1,500 buildings were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The winds that demolished those structures reached 318 mph, some  
of the most intense ever recorded, said Joshua Wurman, assistant 
professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a pretty reliable estimate,'' Wurman said of his  
preliminary radar data. ``It's possible we'll go through every scan 
we have and find higher wind speeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous highest speed recorded by Wurman was 286 mph in an  
Oklahoma tornado in 1991. Wurman gathers his data with radar units 
mounted on trucks, a program called Doppler on Wheels funded by the 
National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who planned to visit Oklahoma today, added  
five counties to the state's disaster declaration, bringing to 16 
the number of counties qualifying for assistance, Gov. Frank 
Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City police allowed people to bring in bulldozers and  
heavy equipment Friday to clear areas that had previously been 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the state Board of Education decided to cancel the  
rest of the school year for students of Mulhall-Orlando Elementary 
School, which was destroyed by a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patching together something for 11 days would not be  
beneficial to the students and the time would be better spent 
building towards next school year,'' said Dennis Smith, 
superintendent of the school district 40 miles north of Oklahoma 
City.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Sen. Makes Emergency Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMORE, Okla. (AP) -- Sen. Jim Inhofe, a pilot for 41 years,  
made an emergency landing early Saturday after the propeller fell 
off his airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe, R-Okla., was not injured, but his single-engine airplane  
was slightly damaged, said press secretary Danny Finnerty. Inhofe 
was alone in the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe said he glided for about eight miles before landing the  
plane at Claremore Airport. He said he took off from Ketchum, where 
he keeps his 1979 Grumman Tiger, and had been in the air about 10 
minutes when trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I noticed a vibration,'' he said, then heard a pop as the  
propeller dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane became tail heavy and he knew it would be difficult  
landing, he said. ``I wasn't sure I could make it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe, an experienced, commercially rated pilot, was en route  
from northeastern Oklahoma to Oklahoma City, where he was to meet 
President, who was touring tornado-ravaged parts of central 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnerty said the FBI has been asked to investigate because  
``propellers don't just fly off airplanes every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The propeller was found on a county road about four miles from  
the airport by G.W. Curtis, who graduated from Central High School 
in Tulsa with Inhofe. Curtis returned the propeller to Inhofe at 
the airport.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Options Anderson to Tucson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Left-hander Brian Anderson, the odd man out in  
the Arizona Diamondbacks remodeled pitching rotation, was optioned 
to Triple-A Tucson on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks made room for right-handed reliever Amaury  
Telemaco, who started the season on the disabled list with 
tendinitis in his right shoulder. Telemaco's 30-day rehabilitation 
assignment in Tucson expired on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter emphasized that Anderson's assignment was  
temporary. He will get three starts, beginning Monday at Iowa, then 
rejoin the Diamondbacks around May 21 during their four-game series 
in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's for Brian's benefit and our benefit,'' Showalter said.  
``We put a finite date on it. He'll be right back where he was. 
He'll be back with us in Colorado, maybe before that if somebody 
gets injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 27, was diplomatic about the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unusual situation,'' he said. ``As much as I'd like to  
not believe it, it's strange because I almost saw it coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been widespread speculation that Anderson would be  
traded after the Diamondbacks signed free-agent starters Randy 
Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Diamondbacks decided to keep Anderson, at least for now,  
using him as a reliever and as a possible starter if one of the 
five in the rotation was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson obviously was frustrated in the role and he struggled  
in his few relief appearances. He appeared in eight games, pitching 
a total of 10 1-3 innings, with an 0-1 record and a 9.58 ERA. 
Opponents were batting .364 against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter, who said he had ``a tough conversation'' with  
Anderson to tell him about the move, indicated the Diamondbacks 
likely would have sent Anderson to the minors for more work even if 
they had not activated Telemaco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something Brian's in need of, just some time to get his  
confidence and get back the location on his fastball and 
curveball,'' Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who spent the two previous seasons with Cleveland, was  
Arizona's first pick in last year's expansion draft. He was 12-13 
for Arizona last season with a 4.33 ERA. He led the NL in fewest 
walks per nine innings at 1.0 but also tied for the lead in home 
runs allowed with 39. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at it through their eyes,'' Anderson said. ``I'm  
not in the role I used to be in. I'm just insurance to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Vladimir Nunez were the only Arizona pitchers who  
had a Triple-A option remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Telemaco was Arizona's fifth starter the last half of the 1998  
season. He was 6-9 with a 3.94 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pitched some good innings for us last year,'' Showalter  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telemaco, 25, threw three innings Thursday night in Tucson,  
allowing one hit and a walk and striking out two.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes School Lunch Soda Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are hoping to ensure schoolchildren  
a healthy lunch by closing a legal loophole that allows schools to 
give away sodas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a loophole, big enough to drive a soda truck through,

	The culprit of the free sodas, lawmakers charge, are soda  
companies who want to encourage kids to drink their products. Soda 
companies deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, lawmakers, many of whom hailed from dairy states,  
introduced a bill Friday that would close what they call a loophole 
in laws that prohibit the national school lunch program from 
allowing the sale of foods of ``minimal nutritional value,'' such 
as soft drinks and sugar candies, during federally funded meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools that have vending machines currently are required under  
the law to discontinue their use during breakfast and lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers charge that soda companies are avoiding the law by  
distributing their product to some schools free. The proposal would 
ban the free lunchtime distribution of sodas and other snacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft drink industry immediately denounced the allegations,  
saying the industry does not give away free sodas to school. If the 
practice is happening, it's a decision of local officials, said 
Sean McBride, spokesman for the National Soft Drink Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our soft drink companies are not encouraging that,'' McBride  
said. ``In fact we discourage it from happening.''

<HEADLINE> Sautin Wins 3M Springboard Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Six months on his back is not the  
best position for an Olympic gold medal diver. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first competition since November when he underwent a  
surgical procedure to lance an infection on his back, Russia's 
premier diver, Dmitry Sautin, dominated an array of Olympic 
hopefuls by taking the gold on the 3-meter springboard at the 
International Swimming Hall of Fame Aquatic Complex on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sautin, 25, the reigning world 3-meter and platform champion and  
the 1996 Olympic platform gold medalist, has won this event four 
years in a row and five of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the god of diving,'' bronze medalist P.J. Bogart said.  
``I finally came into a meet relaxed. They've (Russians and 
Chinese) overlapped us but we're finally catching up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sautin scored 702.63 points in beating China's Xiong Ni (691.38)  
and Bogart (631.35). 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's platform final, Cai Yuyan of China defended her  
title by edging 15-year-old teammate Li Na. American teen Erica 
Sorgi, who finished behind 17-year-old Cai last year, botched her 
final two dives but held on for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy we placed in the 3-meter and platform because it's a  
step in the right direction for the U.S., but I'm not happy with my 
diving today,'' Sorgi, 16, said. ``The whole Chinese team is 
outstanding but they train so many more hours than us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the synchronized competition, which is making its Olympic  
debut at Sydney in 2000, American brothers Justin and Troy Dumais 
captured their first gold medal as a diving duo in the 3-meter 
event. China's Xiong and Zhou Yilin were second and Americans 
Bogart and Chris Devine finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dumais and Dumais, how much more synchro can you get than  
brothers?'' Justin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristin Link and Lindsay Long got silver in the women's  
synchronized platform event behind China's Cai and Li. Xiong 
received the only perfect 10 in Saturday finals on his fourth dive, 
a reverse 2 1/2 somersault. 
</P>
<P>
	Sautin, second behind Mark Ruiz heading into Sunday's platform  
finals, is also seeking his fourth straight gold atop the 10-meter 
board here. 
</P>
<P>
	He hadn't competed since August, but knew he would pick up where  
he left off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never doubted I'd dive again but I was a little scared when  
they cut it (infection) out,'' Sautin said. ``The time will come 
when the youngsters will do it, but not yet.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Airport Hit by Power Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A power failure knocked out air traffic  
controllers' radar displays and radio communications for 23 minutes 
at Philadelphia International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	However, no pilots reported any ``safety issue'' as a result of  
the outage, Federal Aviation Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage, which occurred early Wednesday, left only overhead  
lights operating in the tower, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported 
in Saturday's editions, quoting officials of the Air Traffic 
Controllers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said the blackout was caused by human error during a  
test of a new generator. In addition, a backup generator didn't 
come online and several phone lines were knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Of six jets in the air at the time, FAA officials say two landed  
safely on their own, and four switched to radio frequencies 
operated by another control center. Five planes on the ground also 
lost radio contact while waiting for takeoff instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty upsetting,'' said controller Richard Weaver, who  
was in the tower. ``Helpless is a pretty good description. ... 
You're lost. It's the Twilight Zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, computer problems at the main air traffic  
control center for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports caused 
numerous flight delays and cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Thursday, a computer problem at an air traffic control  
center at Ronkonkoma, N.Y., delayed departures from airports at New 
York, Philadelphia and Newark, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Hunter's Foundation Holds Fundraiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERTFORD, N.C. (AP) -- The applause from the stands was polite  
and almost reverent Saturday when Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter walked 
toward the pitcher's mound with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat in the middle of the baseball diamond at Perquimans  
County High School next to his wife as family, friends and former 
teammates held a ceremony to honor Hertford's favorite son and to 
kick off a foundation to aid those, like Hunter, suffering from Lou 
Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	One girl read a poem about ``Jimmy,'' whom she thinks of as ``a  
hard worker to lend a hand, not a Hall of Famer.'' Then teammates 
spoke about the Hall of Fame pitcher's determination and courage as 
a player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has more courage in his little finger than most people''  
have at all, former Oakland manager Alvin Dark said. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was finally his turn to speak, the five-time World  
Series winner could barely muster the words for the waiting, hushed 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked everyone for their help with the day's events to  
benefit the newly formed foundation. Hunter stepped away from the 
microphone, one hand lifted to wipe his face, and stepped back with 
a quip about the wind whistling into the mike. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this microphone would stop ringing, I could say  
something,'' he said to break the silent tension. ``I enjoyed this 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, was diagnosed in September with amyothropic lateral  
sclerosis, or ALS, a neurological disease that interferes with the 
signals the brain sends to the muscles. Over time, the muscles 
degenerate. The cause if unknown, and there's no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	It manifests itself differently. In Hunter's case, it affects  
his arms and hands, which means he can't raise them to shake hands 
or throw a baseball. His wife, Helen, helped him take off his navy 
New York Yankees cap before the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people attended the kickoff for the Jim Catfish  
Hunter ALS Foundation, held along with a barbecue lunch, softball 
and baseball games and a silent auction. Items up for bid included 
balls signed by current Yankees Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens, 
black sequined boots worn by Dolly Parton, Yankees World Series 
paraphernalia and Vince Gill's guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	Former major leaguers on hand -- Oakland catcher Jim Pagliaroni,  
A's third baseman Sal Bando, Yankees first baseman Jim Spencer, 
Oakland outfielder Mike Hershberger, Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord 
Perry, Yankees pitcher Ron Davis and pitcher Tommy John -- recalled 
Hunter as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	A big gathering at the high school baseball field is nothing new  
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saturday before Mother's Day has been set aside for a local  
old-timers baseball game since Hunter started it in 1980, a year 
after he retired from the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the date coincided with the perfect game he pitched  
May 8, 1968, when he was with Oakland. It is one of only 13 perfect 
games in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter joked about Perry's fondness for food. Hunter and  
Pagliaroni, his catcher for the perfect game 31 years ago, 
reminisced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Hershberger, about the fifth or sixth inning ... walked  
by me and he says, `Hey, you walked a guy in the first inning.' ... 
And until the last out in the ball game I thought I had walked 
somebody. Until Sal Bando came up to me after the last out and said 
perfect game,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	As amiable as ever, Hunter walked among the throngs of hometown  
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see it happen to him. That stuff he's got is bad.  
All we can do is hope and pray there's a cure,'' said Hertford 
resident Stanley ``Demp'' Pierce, 62. He remembers Hunter, or Jimmy 
as everyone here calls him, running around the ball park as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Even during the autograph session, during which he stood and  
talked to those in line, he yelled out to his former teammates to 
sign faster because the line was getting long. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's his normal self,'' said Susan Harris, one of the day's  
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Catfish Hunter fan,'' said Keith Vaughan,  
the pastor of Hertford Baptist Church. ``Not many people get to 
meet (their) childhood hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Vaughan helps support the family that has helped many in  
this small town.

<HEADLINE> Gold Coin Commemorates Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gold coin commemorating the 200th  
anniversary of George Washington's death in 1799 was offered for 
sale Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some proceeds from sale of the coin will help pay for  
preservation of the first president's former home at Mount Vernon, 
Va., near the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The design of the $5 gold coin resembles that of traditional  
quarters, with a profile of Washington on the heads side and the 
heraldic American eagle on the tails side. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the American eagle on the commemorative coin is  
rendered in more detail, with wings spread wider, than on quarters. 
Plus, the portrait of Washington on the new gold coin is taken from 
a never-used 1931 design by American sculptor Laura Gardin Fraser. 
In it, Washington faces right, instead of left. 
</P>
<P>
	On quarters minted starting this year, new designs commemorating  
each of the 50 states are replacing the eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	A maximum 100,000 of the special 90 percent gold, 10 percent  
alloy Washington coins will be produced and offered for sale by the 
U.S. Mint at prices starting at $180 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of legislation passed by Congress, the Mount Vernon  
Ladies Association, which owns and maintains the Virginia home that 
was in Washington's family for seven generations, will receive $35 
from each commemorative coin sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington $5 gold piece is one of two commemorative coins  
the mint will issue this year. The other is a silver dollar 
honoring Dolley Madison, wife of the fourth president.

<HEADLINE> Teen Guilty of Bus Stop Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ga. (AP) -- Lawyers for a teen-ager convicted of fatally  
beating a younger boy vowed to appeal and argue that last month's 
massacre at a Colorado high school influenced the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Miller, 15, was convicted of felony murder by a jury  
Friday. Prosecutors said he beat 13-year-old Josh Belluardo Nov. 2 
at a school bus stop in their subdivision, and the younger boy died 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Wolfe argued that his client never  
intended to kill Belluardo and should be convicted of involuntary 
manslaughter, not murder. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict, he said Judge C. Michael Roach's denial of  
motions to delay the trial because of the deadly shootings at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., would serve as the basis 
of an appeal. Two student gunmen killed 12 classmates and a teacher 
April 20 before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a sad day that a case has to be tried involving  
the facts and circumstances that were involved in this case so soon 
after the tragedy in Littleton,'' Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jonathan should be punished for his actions, but he shouldn't  
be punished for something that could never have been contemplated 
in his actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Garry Moss said he hoped the verdict would ``stop  
this insanity'' of children behaving violently.

	DALLAS (AP) -- The Colorado Rapids won their fourth consecutive  
game Saturday night with a 2-1 shootout victory over the Dallas 
Burn. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tiebreaker, Colorado's Marquis White and Dallas' Leonel  
Alvarez each converted in the second round. In the fifth and final 
frame, Rapids reserve defender Chris Martinez scored on his shot, 
while Hahnemann saved Chad Deering's attempt to clinch the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann had nine saves in regulation  
and three in the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado midfielder Paul Bravo racked up his third goal of the  
season in the 80th minute by heading home Anders Limpar's corner 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	With two minutes left, Burn forward Jason Kreis denied Colorado  
a regulation-time win with his league-leading seventh goal of the 
season. Following Hahnemann's point-blank save of Kreis' shot, 
Dante Washington tracked down the loose ball deep in the Rapids' 
box to again set up Kreis, whose goal forced the shootout.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuban Spies Face Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The United States has added murder conspiracy  
charges against an alleged Cuban spy for the 1996 downing of two 
civilian airplanes flown by Cuban exiles searching for rafters in 
international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people had already been under indictment, charged with  
trying to penetrate U.S. military bases, infiltrate exile groups 
and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations. Authorities 
describe the spy ring as the largest Cuban espionage operation 
uncovered in the United States in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The new indictment returned Friday adds four new defendants and  
accuses Gerardo Hernandez of providing information about Brothers 
to the Rescue flights to Cuba before Cuban fighter jets shot down 
the Miami-based group's planes over international waters, killing 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who was arrested last year on spy-related charges by  
the FBI, ``received instructions that under no circumstances should 
Miami-based agents fly with (Brothers to the Rescue),'' the day the 
planes were shot down, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased to see that action is being taken against  
some of the participants,'' said Jose Basulto, the group's leader. 
``It was a case of premeditated murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez alone was charged with conspiracy to perpetrate  
murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. After 
the planes were shot down, the indictment said, Cuba's spy agency 
recognized Hernandez for his role and promoted him to captain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 defendants also were accused of infiltrating, informing  
on and manipulating anti-Castro Cuban political groups in Miami and 
Dade County, spreading disinformation within the groups and 
carrying out orders from the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten defendants were arrested in September 1998 and remain in  
pretrial detention, prosecutors said. Five of them already have 
pleaded guilty to spy-related charges.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Coach Warns of 'Hate Factor' / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There already was plenty of clean, hard hitting in  
Boston's opening-game playoff win over Buffalo. Imagine what will 
happen when the ``hate factor'' kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruins coach Pat Burns says that develops as a series goes on.  
And both sides expect the best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinal, 
which resumes Sunday, to last a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not good enough to get cocky or to think this is going  
to be easy,'' Boston's Ray Bourque said Saturday. ``You're going to 
have to play through a lot of hits and a lot of physical stuff, but 
you're dishing it out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how we play. We're intense and the same thing for  
Buffalo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Peca, one of the NHL's top defensive forwards is a prime  
example of that with the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the hate factor. You're battling to get beyond the  
stage you're at with a team that's going to fight just as much,'' 
he said. ``You're going to exchange cheap shots. You're going to 
exchange words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the series is over you shake hands and appreciate the  
battle that was fought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston got the upper hand in that battle with a 4-2 win Thursday  
night. It scored three times against two-time defending NHL most 
valuable player Dominik Hasek, who played well, and added an 
empty-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you ever take the Dom factor away,'' Burns said.  
``He's a great goaltender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is that other factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early in the series to really start hating each  
other,'' Burns said. ``As the playoff series goes on the hate 
factor comes into effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe was even stingier than Hasek, a good  
sign for Boston in a series that figures to be low-scoring. He has 
a 1.71 goals against average in the playoffs, while his team has 
scored at least two goals in each of its seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense has been fine,'' said Boston's Jason Allison, who  
has at least one point in each playoff game. ``We don't score six 
or seven, but you don't usually need to in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres need to score enough to avoid going down 2-0 for the  
15th time in a playoff series. They lost all 14 others. 
</P>
<P>
	They're expected to be without Miroslav Satan, who led them with  
40 goals but hasn't played since the third game of Buffalo's 
four-game sweep of Ottawa because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got to come out and play with a little more  
desperation,'' defenseman Jason Woolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said it won't take much to put his  
team back in control -- just one win on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how easy it switches,'' he said. ``We've got to adjust  
our game a little bit with the absence of Miro but there's no 
feeling that (the series) has gotten away from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had breakdowns in the neutral zone and around their  
net in the opener. They also failed to capitalize on some rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But they put some solid hits on Bourque, one of the NHL's  
greatest players. Burns had no problem with it. That, he said, is 
the way the game should be played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do we get excited because Ray Bourque gets hit? `Oh,  
they're targeting Ray.' Of course, they're going to target Ray,'' 
Burns said. ``If the games are clean and the hits are clean, it's 
exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With two of the NHL's best goalies and two tight-checking teams,  
the emphasis is on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	That means knocking players off the puck, banging them into the  
boards and preparing to take return blows. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're meeting the same guy in the corner,'' Boston's Tim  
Taylor said. ``If he gets the puck out a couple of times, it really 
changes. You really want to go in there making sure you get that 
puck and create a battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the games go on, it'll create more of a rivalry.''

<HEADLINE> US Attorneys Debate Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- They shared horror stories and listened to  
experts, and now attorneys general from around the nation hope to 
use what they've learned to reduce the threat of tragedies like the 
Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The rash of school shootings is a wake-up call for both parents  
and politicians, said U.S. Attorney Tom Strickland of Colorado, 
where two students slaughtered 12 of their classmates and a teacher 
before killing themselves at Littleton's Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lessons to be learned,'' Strickland said. ``If we  
can do anything possible to detect kids who have this propensity, 
we need to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general and prosecutors from some three dozen states  
participated in two days of discussions last week at the National 
Association of Attorneys General conference on youth and school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the presentations, they heard from several students at  
Pearl High School, where two girls were killed and seven of their 
classmates were wounded in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar of Colorado said it was  
obvious from the experts that youth violence extended well beyond 
the schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pearl and Columbine shocked the nation,'' Salazar said. ``But  
many more young people are killed outside of the schools and we 
need to start addressing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salazar said the summit provided insight into some reasons why  
some youth become violent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned that brain development is very crucial during the  
first five years of life,'' Salazar said. ``So we have to create 
quality child care that most people are missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After-school programs must be a priority because that is ``when  
most of our students are getting themselves into trouble,'' Salazar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference's sharing of ideas was a major step in dealing  
with youth violence, said Attorney General Mark Pryor of Arkansas, 
where two students opened fire on classmates in Jonesboro in March 
1998, killing four classmates and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I was listening I was thinking 'how could I apply this to  
Arkansas, which agency could be doing this?''' Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Ballentine, principal at Pearl High School, said the best  
way to prevent youth violence is to increase parental involvement 
in children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could send a message to the rest of the world it would  
be for parents to spend any amount of time, whether it's five 
minutes, with their children,'' Ballentine said. ``Not just in 
Pearl, but in all of the others areas where kids were committing 
violence, they were so deeply involved in outside interests that 
most of their parents didn't have a clue.''

<HEADLINE> Shipp Carriers To Remain in NY, NJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Two of the world's largest shipping lines  
have decided to stay in the New York-New Jersey harbor -- a move 
that may help solve a nasty feud that still threatens the port's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending a yearlong saga, Sea-Land Service and Maersk announced  
Friday that economic reasons would keep them in the Port of New 
York and New Jersey. The giant shipping companies solicited 
proposals from other East Coast cities, including Baltimore and 
Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	Maersk President Tommy Thomsen also cited Gov. Christie  
Whitman's last-minute offer of $120 million in state funding to 
reimburse the shippers as crucial to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman and New York Gov. George E. Pataki have been at odds  
over the way that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
which manages the harbor, funds projects in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki thinks New York subsidizes money-losing ventures in New  
Jersey, while the agency puts more money into New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said last month he will not support a new lease with the  
carriers until Whitman agrees to restructure the agency so that the 
states no longer share revenues. The governors, both moderate 
Republicans, control the agency and can veto any lease approved by 
authority commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman has said she will not agree to restructure the agency  
until the shipping carriers' deal is approved, a process likely to 
take months. 
</P>
<P>
	The feud had put most other business at the agency on hold,  
including $1.7 billion in expansion projects at Newark and New York 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	After the carriers announced their decision, commissioners  
appointed by both governors said the states would try to work out 
their differences.

<HEADLINE> IRL: VisionAire 500 is Non-Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League will issue no points  
or official prize money to the teams and drivers who competed in 
the race where three spectators were killed by flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, executive director of the IRL, said it will pay a  
specified amount to each owner and driver to help cover expenses 
incurred in the VisionAire 500 on May 1 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 
Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was called off after 79 of 208 laps. Wheel and  
suspension parts from a three-car wreck on lap 59 flew over catch 
fencing and into the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the deaths, eight people were injured. A 9-year-old girl  
remained in critical condition Saturday at Carolinas Medical Center 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Each owner will receive an expense check of $17,500 per entry.  
In addition, the entry fee of $5,000 either will be refunded or 
canceled for each owner's entry. Each driver will receive an 
expense check for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Under IRL rules, none of the race results count, so no winner is  
designated. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL and speedway officials are continuing their investigation of  
the accident and plan to reveal their findings next week. The 
speedway is refunding all ticket money or, upon fan request, 
donating the money to a trust fund established for the victims' 
families.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sixty bottles of the rarest wine in the world  
were auctioned off Friday selling for $140,000 and putting the

in 1984, sold for $27,600. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction by Christie's and wine retailer Zachys brought

</P>
<P>
	Also put up for auction were three rare bottles of Chateau  
Margaux, bottled in 1900, which fetched $19,550, and a case of

<HEADLINE> IPOs Available on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A few brokerages are turning to the Internet to  
find those investors who wouldn't normally buy stock in an initial 
public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not easy to get a piece of an IPO. The shares are usually  
off-limits because brokerages sock them away for their wealthiest 
clients and large institutional investors. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	William Hambrecht, one of the pioneers in the field, said his  
company's Web-based system helps ensure that ``a bid from an 
individual has the same standing as a bid from the largest 
institutional investor in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co. solicits offers over the Internet and  
awards shares to the highest bidders. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
allocates some of the IPOs it is sponsoring to its online 
customers. And several companies offer portions of other 
brokerages' IPOs to their online clients. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Suresh Reginald, an investor in Malden, Mass., has  
made $15,000, by his own estimate, from newly issued stocks. He 
checks a list of upcoming IPOs every couple of days with brokerage 
Charles Schwab, and when a company strikes his fancy, puts in a 
request with a Schwab representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, he estimates he's gotten in on at least 60  
percent of the deals he's requested. ``For non-Internet IPOs, I get 
in 100 percent of the times I request them,'' he said, calling the 
offerings ``a gold mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, it's been hard to miss the big first-day  
payoffs of initial public offerings, especially for any company 
with a ``dot com'' in its name. In January, the business news Web 
site MarketWatch.com was offered as an IPO for $17. At the end of 
its first day of trading, investors were paying $97.50 -- a stunning 
474 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech issues aren't the only market darlings. This past  
week, investment bank Goldman Sachs sold 69 million shares at $53 a 
piece, raising $3.66 billion. In the days leading up to Goldman's 
market debut, clients placed orders for an incredible 800 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	So who got the 69 million that were available? Goldman won't  
specify, but estimates are that 70 percent of the shares went to 
institutions like pension funds. The remainder went to rich 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of owners of this deal were either insiders or  
Goldman's best clients,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager at 
the brokerage Avatar Associates. ``It's a wonderful kiss for those 
people who wound up getting stock in the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many IPO payoffs are modest. And the coveted Internet  
stocks can be highly volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is high-risk gambling,'' said Gail Bronson, a Palo Alto,  
Calif.-based analyst for IPO Monitor.com. ``No one knows when the 
roulette wheel is going to come to a screeching halt.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A booming cannon and three red flares marked  
the end of the grueling 27,000-mile Around Alone sailing race for 
winner Giovanni Solidni. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor lit a white flare and danced on the deck of  
his yacht Fila while dozens of boaters cheered him on the last two 
miles of the race that began in September and ended at 1:32 a.m. 
EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, the first non-Frenchman to win the race in the five  
times it has been held, had been at the mercy of a high pressure 
and low winds the past few days, crawling along at 6 to 8 knots. 
</P>
<P>
	But he finished with a flourish, making about 15 knots on a  
brisk southwest wind. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Adolfo, members of his crew and race officials  
clamored aboard the boat along with Italian reporters to welcome 
Soldini. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished in record time despite the delay of the last few  
days. His unofficial time of 117 days was more than four days 
faster than the previous record set by Christophe Auguin in 1991 
when the race was known as the BOC Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Marc Thiercelin, with the only other 60-foot boat  
still in the race, was about 250 miles behind Soldini, but more 
than 11 days back in the overall standings. He was expected to 
finish late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the smaller, 50-foot boat division, Mike Garside led  
Frenchman J.P. Mouligne by about 285 miles and was about 690 miles 
from the finish late Friday. Mouligne won the three previous legs 
and is the apparent winner of the division. 
</P>
<P>
	The skippers were among 16 boats that left Charleston last  
September for the race that included stopovers in Cape Town, South 
Africa; Auckland, New Zealand; and Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of Soldini's race was a daring rescue of French  
sailor Isabelle Autissier in the frigid, rolling waters of the 
Southern Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier's yacht PRB was sailing in 20-knot winds when the  
automatic pilot malfunctioned. The boat turned on its side and then 
flipped completely. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel was suppose to right itself, but it never did and  
Autissier had only seconds to close the watertight hatch of the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	She settled down to wait for rescue as Soldini battled for 200  
miles through 40 mph winds and waves as high as 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	He found the overturned yacht, but saw no sign of Autissier. But  
then he tossed a hammer at the hull and she quickly emerged from an 
escape hatch.

<HEADLINE> Comedy College To Open in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't expect any cheap laughs when the nation's  
first comedy college opens its doors this fall: A year's tuition 
runs $8,500. 
</P>
<P>
	There were still plenty of smiles Friday when school officials --  
a group that includes veteran funnyman Steve Allen -- unveiled plans 
for the Humber Comedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Class clowns of North America, you have a school!'' announced  
a grinning Steven Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy 
Institute and Humber's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which aspires to become an Actor's Studio for  
comedians and comedic writers, opens this October with campuses in 
New York City and Toronto. Plans were unveiled at Caroline's comedy 
club on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The course work? Instruction in stand-up comedy, sitcom  
auditions, improvisation, comedic acting and comedy writing for 
sitcoms, sketches and screenplays during a 30-week program. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes will run from 21 to 25 hours per week; once the session  
is completed, the students will perform in Caroline's before an 
industry audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a comprehensive program, even if I don't comprehend it  
myself,'' said Allen, who will serve as chairman of the school's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The school comes with its own good news/bad news gag. The good  
news: no SAT scores, no minimum GPAs. The bad news: enrollment will 
be quite exclusive; the school's first class is expected to include 
just 18 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoning the multi-million dollar success of Jerry Seinfeld,  
Rosenfield encouraged parents upset by their kids' rejection of 
dental school to bravely reroute their tuition to comedy college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom and dad, just remember that Junior may be the next  
Jerry,'' Rosenfield said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Abreu Gets Good News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Bobby Abreu  
received encouraging news Saturday when doctors diagnosed him with 
a strained muscle in his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is expected to keep Abreu out of the lineup 5-7 days,  
but it could have been worse. The Phillies initially thought he 
might have an elbow injury that could have meant a trip to the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very good news,'' Philadelphia manager Terry Francona  
said. ``We'll sit him out (Sunday) and we'll let him hit early in 
St. Louis Monday and see how he feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abreu said he initially felt soreness in his right throwing arm  
last week and the pain grew worse during batting practice Friday 
before Philadelphia's game against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Francona removed Abreu from the lineup 20 minutes before  
Friday's game and rested him again Saturday. The Phillies won both 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Abreu is hitting .348 with four homers, 17 RBIs and four stolen  
bases this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
	OSAKA, Japan (AP) -- Romanian Lonela Tirlea outran Olympic  
champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica and world record-holder Kim 
Batten of the United States in the women's 400-meter hurdles at the 
Japan Grand Prix on today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than happy,'' said Tirlea, who finished in 54.09  
seconds for one of two gold medals for Romania at the one-day event 
in western Japan. ``I ran pretty well while they were not at their 
best, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemmings finished second in 54.69, and Batten faded to finish  
third in 54.94, 2.33 seconds slower than her world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first race. It didn't go quite as well as I  
planned,'' said Batten. ``But I don't think this race is any 
indication of what I'm going to be like in July and in August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five grand prix events will be held in Europe in July before  
August's world championships in Sevilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley Dorival won the men's 110-meter hurdles in a 1-2-3 finish  
by the United States. Dorival finished with a time of 13.36, 
followed by Allen Johnson's 13.38 and Mark Crear's 13.42. 
</P>
<P>
	``The season just started, and I'm satisfied with the result,''  
Dorival said. ``I now hope to perform as well in the U.S. national 
championships and the world championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hungarian Balazs Koranyi surged ahead of four runners in the  
final lap to win the men's 800 meters in 1:47.70. David 
Krummenacker was second in 1:47.94, followed by fellow American 
Rich Kenah's 1:48.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt jet lag and woke up this morning at 5 a.m.,'' Koranyi  
said. ``Therefore I was not fresh, but turned out to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 800 meters, Diane Modahl of Britain overtook  
American Kathi Rounds in the final 15 meters and won the gold in 
2:03.83. Rounds finished second in 2:03.92 and Australia's Tamsyn 
Lewis was third at 2:04.17. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-day meet at Osaka's Nagai Stadium was the second of a  
series of 18 grand prix events this year, organized by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the series was held in Rio de Janeiro on April 25,  
with the next and grand prix scheduled for Doha on May 13. The 
series culminates in the grand prix final in September.

<HEADLINE> Reprieve Possible in Pizza Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A judge who thinks inmates unfairly spend  
too much time on death row has ordered a possible reprieve for a 
man who gunned down a pizza deliveryman. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Koskovich's death sentence would be commuted to life in  
prison if he is still alive five years from now, Judge Reginald 
Stanton ordered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process has become unacceptably cruel to defendants who  
spend long years under sentence of death while the judicial system 
conducts seemingly interminable proceedings which remind many 
observers of a cruelly whimsical cat toying with a mouse,'' Stanton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say to their knowledge, such an order has  
never been issued at the trial court level. Prosecutors say Stanton 
exceeded his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not aware of any judge ever having issued a sentence like  
this,'' said Alan Zegas, immediate past president of the 
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned whether a time limit on the death penalty was fair  
to the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``To place a time restriction upon its imposition can unfairly  
affect the rights of the defendant to appellate review,'' Zegas 
said. ``Almost every person who has been on death row has taken 
longer than 5 years to exhaust their appeals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskovich, 21, was sentenced to die Friday for killing pizza  
deliveryman Jeremy Giordano in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict and Stanton's condition are subject to automatic  
review, as are all death penalty sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Sen. John Russo, who sponsored the 1982 law that  
reinstated the death penalty in New Jersey, told The Star-Ledger of 
Newark for Saturday's editions that Stanton's ruling was 
``outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He, in effect, has usurped the jury's function and reduced a  
death sentence to a life sentence -- and that's not his function,'' 
Russo said.

75 adults and 27 children -- escaping atrocities in the Yugoslavian 
province of Kosovo were reunited with family in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the third group of ethnic Albanians to arrive this  
week. The United States has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees who 
have fled the Kosovo province to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 refugees a week are expected to move through Fort  
Dix, N.J., and New York's Kennedy Airport to be housed temporarily 
at military bases or placed directly with sponsors or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other officials greeted the  
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are smiling on the outside because they are seeing their  
relatives. They are crying on the inside because they know what 
their homeland is going through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Raci family, Blrena's arrival was bittersweet.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have waited so long for this,'' Raci said. He said he left  
his then-infant daughter in the care of her grandmother while he 
and his wife tried to carve out a new life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was separated from her grandmother when they fled  
Kosovo after their home was burned. She was living in a refugee 
camp in Macedonia for the past month. The grandmother, Raci 
believes, is in a refugee camp in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Two older sisters, one of whom Blrena had never before met,  
pressed four balloons and a bouquet of red roses into her hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the more than 200 people gathered at the airport had  
never before met their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Rugova, 31, of Bedford, N.Y., held up a sign bearing his  
cousin's name -- Nezir Rugova, who was separated from his wife and 
daughter when Serb troops herded them onto buses in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no idea where they are,'' Nick Rugova said.

<HEADLINE>  Tornado Relief Efforts Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Hundreds of relief workers on Saturday  
labored under a searing sun to sort through truckloads of donated 
goods waiting for delivery to the thousands left homeless by last 
week's devastating tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Whitaker, one of nine pastors at the First Baptist Church,  
said almost all 200,000 square feet at the church have been put to 
use in the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Federal  
Emergency Management Agency and others have established operations 
inside while a cafeteria feeds three meals a day to about 3,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	It was by happenstance that the church became a shelter,  
Whitaker said. The church stands just across the street from where 
major damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``All people could see after the tornado passed was the light of  
our cross and they started coming this way,'' Whitaker said. ``From 
the moment the tornado happened, the church became the primary hub 
for this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storms killed at least 50 people in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and  
Tennessee and injured hundreds more. More than 9,000 homes were 
destroyed in the greater Oklahoma City area and more than 8,500 
buildings in Kansas were severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Johns, president of the Southwestern Insurance Information  
Service, said damage estimates continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the number of claims received so far, this could be a  
statewide insured loss of $750 million with about $600-plus million 
in the Oklahoma City metro area,'' Johns said. ``By comparison, the 
worst tornado in the country was in 1975 in Nebraska with insured 
total loss of $1.1 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Polley and Tony Gray left their jobs at a manufacturing  
plant in Pella, Iowa, on Thursday and drove to Oklahoma to pitch in 
with the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a family of my own and what goes around comes around,''  
Polley said. ``If we ever get in a time of need in Iowa, I hope 
someone helps us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of relief service vans and trucks were in a large parking  
lot on the east side of the church. Six refrigerated trucks sat in 
back, loaded with meat, fresh produce, milk and other perishables. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Binkowski of the Red Cross said 24 trucks have been sent  
out to deliver meals in the field and the agency has delivered 
10,000 meals since the tornadoes struck. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen insurance companies set up emergency operations out  
of vans in the same lot as did several phone companies, which made 
dozens of lines available for victims to call loved ones, insurance 
companies and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Maxfield, a Blair High School sophomore, willingly gave  
up her Saturday to join the relief effort after seeing all of the 
damage on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of scary to see,'' she said.

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Solar Bound rallied from seventh on the  
backstretch, caught Tres Coronas outside the eighth pole and rolled 
to a six-length victory Saturday in the $114,800 Edgewood Stakes 
for 3-year-old fillies at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, with Robby Albarado up, covered a mile on turf in  
1:36 2-5 and paid $5.80, $3.60 and $2.80. Secret Partner closed 
from last along the hedge to grab the place spot and paid $4.80 and 
$4. Suffragette finished another length back in third and paid 
$4.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Guy and Diane Snowden, Solar Bound won for the second

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Satirizes Clinton on SNL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky poked fun and took a shot at  
President Clinton during a ``Saturday Night Live''appearance on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern appeared in a skit as ex-President  
Clinton's Malibu housemate in 2001. Clinton, portrayed by actor 
Darell Hammond, is about to slip out for lunch with Vernon Jordan 
when Ms. Lewinsky arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond gives Ms. Lewinsky a slightly lewd embrace and asks  
about her day at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone gets so mad at me when I turn the wrong letters,''  
Ms. Lewinsky replied, a self-mocking reference to a job on ``The 
Wheel of Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond, dressed in a bathrobe, gives Lewinsky a gift: a copy of  
``Leaves of Grass.'' Ms. Lewinsky points out that he's already 
given her the book a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond tells Ms. Lewinsky that he has to get going, and she is  
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you trust me?'' he asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``In your dreams, you big creep,'' Ms. Lewinsky replies,  
followed by the traditional show-opener: ``Live from New York, it's 
Saturday night!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky referred to Clinton as ``the big creep'' while  
Linda Tripp secretly recorded her. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though word had slipped out that Ms. Lewinsky had attended  
rehearsals this week, NBC refused to say whether she would be on 
the show. Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was host and Ricky Martin was 
musical guest.

<HEADLINE> Wind Affects Modesto Relays Sprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- Ato Boldon and Maurice Greene maintained  
their status as the world's top two 100-meter runners, but wind 
wiped out any chance of them bidding for a world record and earning 
a $200,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon won his 100-meter heat in the revived Modesto Relays with  
a time of 9.89 seconds Saturday, and Greene won his heat in 9.91. 
Both times were wind-aided, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash bonus had been offered to any runner who broke the  
world record of 9.84 set by Canada's Donovan Bailey in the 1996 
Atlanta Olympics. But Boldon said he knew long before the race that 
the wind would wipe out any record time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so anal, and I knew four days ago we'd have a hard time,''  
he said after consulting an Internet weather service. ``I don't 
think anyone was thinking of the mark. Going into the blocks, I 
knew what it was like because of the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his time of 9.89 seconds was excellent, especially for  
someone with a sore right hamstring that forced him to back off 
halfway through the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't feel like I was pushing it at any point,''  
said Boldon, the world champion in the 200. ``I don't feel like I 
gave a great effort out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the defending world champion in the 100, ran his time  
with a slightly milder tailwind, and Boldon said ``Maurice's race 
was faster, no question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world's top-ranked sprinter last year, and Boldon  
both have clocked bests of 9.86 in the 100 under legal wind 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	In other events, Stacy Dragila tied her own American record in  
the women's pole vault by clearing 14 feet, 7 1/4 inches (4.45 
meters), matching the mark she set in the Modesto Relays in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Anjanette Kirkland tied the meet record of 12.70 in the women's  
100-meter hurdles, matching the time set by Jackie Joyner Kersee in 
1988. But Dan O'Brien, the defending Olympic champion and world 
record holder in the decathlon, finished only sixth in the men's 
100-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Modesto Relays used to be one of the top meets on the  
American track and field schedule, attracting top sprinters such as 
Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But in line with the sport's downward spiral in the United  
States throughout the 1990s, the meet lost fan and sponsor support 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, an infusion of cash from the Modesto-based Save Mart  
supermarket chain, which also is bidding to buy the Oakland 
Athletics, brought back some of the world's top sprinters as the 
Modesto Relays celebrated a 58th edition. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $200,000 bonus for breaking the men's 100  
record, there was a $50,000 prize offered for a women's world 
record in the 100. Inger Miller won the women's 100 in 11.06, far 
off the world record of 10.49 set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 
1988.

	NATO Apologizes for Embassy Strike  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO owned up to a ``tragic mistake''  
today -- the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- but 
expressed confidence that the error would not derail efforts to 
enroll Russian and Chinese support to end the Kosovo conflict. NATO 
issued a strong apology but made clear allied airstrikes will 
continue against Yugoslavia. In Beijing, a large crowd attacked the 
U.S. and British Embassies with chunks of concrete today, smashing 
windows and cars to protest the bombing. Protests also were held in 
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.

residents of the storm-ravaged area. He also said he would seek an 
additional $372 million from Congress for a federal disaster relief 
fund. After a half-hour helicopter tour of thousands of acres of 
twisted and shredded rubble, Clinton met survivors in Del City, 
Okla. ``I have been going to these scenes for 20 years and this is

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican senator today promoted

spend more time with their families. The so-called flex-time bill 
would allow working parents a chance to voluntarily rearrange their 
hours. If a mother wanted to tend to a sick child or attend a 
school event during her work hours, she could reschedule the missed 
time for a different day, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said in the

Game 1 of their Eastern Conference, first-round series. The loss 
puts the top-seeded Heat in a daunting position, because now they

<HEADLINE> Paper: FBI Sat on TWA Flight Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
had concluded within six months after TWA Flight 800 crashed off 
the coast of Long Island that mechanical failure was to blame, but 
the FBI sat on the report, The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper says in Sunday's editions that FBI officials, still  
convinced terrorists had downed the plane, dismissed the 24-page 
ATF report, prepared in January 1997, as ``unprofessional and 
reprehensible'' and even persuaded a Treasury Department 
undersecretary to help them suppress it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said it was November 1997 before the FBI acknowledged  
publicly that a mechanical flaw had ignited the Boeing 747's 
central fuel tank, causing the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Charles E. Grassley,  
R-Iowa, is holding hearings on the investigation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI didn't want to hear about anything but a missile or a  
bomb, because otherwise there was no FBI case,'' Grassley told the 
Post. ``Their conduct was disturbing from the very beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post cited a number of internal memos and confidential  
sources for its report. It said the FBI declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> United 2, MetroStars 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roy Lassiter had a goal and an assist as D.C.  
United snapped a three-game losing streak Saturday afternoon with a 
2-1 victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory allowed United (4-3) to avert its first four-game  
losing streak since dropping the opening four games of the 
inaugural MLS season in 1996 and prevented the franchise's first 
three-game skid at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars mustered little early offense against United  
goalkeeper Tom Presthus, who didn't make his first save until seven 
minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Nansha Kalonji tallied in the second half for New York-New  
Jersey (3-4), which has dropped three in a row overall and three 
straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter's team-high seventh goal of the year gave United a 1-0  
lead in the sixth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Moreno, the trailer on a 3-on-1 break started by Lassiter,  
made it 2-0 in the 57th minute. From the right side, he shot 
Antonio Otero's short pass into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalonji, a halftime substitution for Sorber, scored in the 75th  
minute. He stumbled over the ball at the top of the penalty area 
but still flicked a shot past Presthus, breaking a scoreless streak 
of 319 minutes in regulation time with his first MLS goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalongi nearly tied the game with eight minutes left, but his  
header from 12 feet out was snared by Presthus.

<HEADLINE> Show Held Liable in Guest's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The attorney for relatives of a gay guest  
slain after a taping of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' said the $25 
million award from jurors sends a clear message to the talk show 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of human exploitation needs to be corralled,'' said  
Geoffrey Fieger, who had asked for $71.5 million in damages. ```The 
Jenny Jones Show' and what it does to people is unsafe at any 
speed. This is a renegade business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday held the show and its corporate owner, Warner  
Bros., liable in the shooting death of Scott Amedure, who had 
revealed his attraction to Jonathan Schmitz during a 1995 taping of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after the taping, authorities said, Schmitz bought a  
shotgun, drove to Amedure's trailer in Oakland County's Orion 
Township and shot him twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were brought together for a segment titled ``Same-Sex  
Secret Crushes'' during which Amedure regaled the studio audience 
with his sexual fantasies about Schmitz, who said he is 
heterosexual. The segment never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family argued that a mentally ill Schmitz was lured  
onto the show believing he would meet a woman, and was humiliated 
into murder when his secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Amedure, the victim's father, said the verdict vindicates  
his belief that ambush-style TV should be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just proud that we can show people that shows are not  
going to do this no more,'' he said. ``Please, don't let the kids 
watch all these shows, because there'll be more killings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros. said the verdict could impair the work  
of all media and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone involved in the business of interviewing ordinary  
people ... ought to be very concerned about the chilling effect 
this decision will have on them,'' said Jim Feeney, who predicted 
the verdict will be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense claimed Schmitz knew his guest could be a man,  
suspected it was Amedure and was not upset by the surprise. They 
also argued there was no reason to ask Schmitz about his mental 
history, and suggested Schmitz killed Amedure for reasons other 
than their appearance on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs' theory is that you have to do a psychological  
profile before you allow them to come onto a program,'' said Zazi 
Pope, a Warner Bros. attorney. ``And then you cannot engage in any 
discussion of any topic that has any element of surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who was not sued but testified at the trial, denied  
that her show ambushes guests to boost ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked and saddened by this verdict,'' she said in a  
statement. ``However, the only real tragedy is that Scott Amedure 
lost his life.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: Terrorism Won't Stop U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stood  
before the families of Americans killed in the East Africa bombings 
last August and pledged Friday that such incidents will not force 
the United States to retreat from its global responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never, never happen,'' Albright told the State  
Department gathering, which also included retired Foreign Service 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright unveiled replicas of plaques honoring the 12 Americans  
who died in the bombings last Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania. Dozens of Kenyans and Tanzanians who worked for the 
U.S. government also were killed. All told, the bombings killed 224 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the ceremony, Albright met for an hour with the family  
members. ``The pain and anguish has not lessened in their hearts,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that similar incidents cannot be ruled out in the  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The era of safe diplomatic posts is over,'' she said. ``We can  
take nothing for granted about embassy security.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBER, Okla. (AP) -- She sat seven miles from home, watching TV  
reports of a spinning, swooping funnel dancing along the red-clay 
prairie. Then she heard where the twister was heading and her 
stomach tightened. She knew what was next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just lost our house,'' Kim Kennedy calmly told her husband,  
Terry. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, the phone rang at her grandmother's house. It was  
a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Is it gone? Is it gone?' '' she recalls, her eyes  
widening in her freckled face as she remembers her question. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Kennedy home was gone, swept away by the wind.  
</P>
<P>
	One day, old-timers will tell tales of the Oklahoma twister of  
'99, the monster that killed 41 in this state alone, injured 
hundreds, and gobbled up thousands of homes, causing hundreds of 
millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family of Rural Route 1 will add their own chapter:  
Their home was among the first to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It sat near the beginning of the tornado trail that ripped a  
60-mile gash across central Oklahoma, hurling propane tanks like 
soda cans, impaling cows on barbed wire, throwing horses onto 
parked cars, yanking a baby from his mother, lifting a man into 
soot-swirling skies and carrying him the length of four football 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Kennedys and their two children, this past week has been  
a time to seek comfort wherever they can; often it has come deep in 
mounds of mud, plaster and bricks. 
</P>
<P>
	There they have plucked out Bibles, an antique gold cameo brooch  
Kim inherited from her great-grandmother, a cherished salt shaker 
that belonged to her grandmother, even their 10-year-old daughter's 
knitting needle. They're still digging for the pocket-size Bible an 
uncle carried during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be OK,'' Mrs. Kennedy says, clutching a 'Ewe's  
Welcome' wooden sheep sign that once adorned their house. ``If I 
didn't know there was a God in control, you wouldn't see a smile on 
my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They retrieved one more treasure: a photo in shattered glass of  
a second cousin, 18-month-old Blake Kennedy, killed in the federal 
building bombing four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried,'' Mrs. Kennedy says, ``when I saw that.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Six miles north on the path of ruin, Don Smith searches for his  
own memory of the federal building. 
</P>
<P>
	For seven days in April 1995, the 37-year-old firefighter clawed  
and picked his way through rubble, pulling out victims of the 
Murrah building terrorist attack. He was given a granite chunk of 
the first floor as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
	It sat proudly atop his fireplace. But now his fireplace is  
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, are the walls, roof, floor, sinks, couch, closet,  
clothes, beds, stove, just about everything that belonged to the 
Smiths except their dazed Dalmatian -- who suffered a broken nose -- 
some photos and a few guitars he saved from his playing days in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll humble you in a heartbeat,'' says his brother, Wes, who  
traveled from the Ozarks to lend a helping hand. ``One day you have 
everything in life. The next day you're out in the grass, kicking, 
trying to find something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith lost it all, but still is lucky.  
</P>
<P>
	He lives in Bridge Creek, a tiny community where 11 people died.  
It now looks like a Mad Max landscape: car doors twisted like taffy 
around trees, homes chewed up and spit out into heaps of metal and 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
	In two days, Smith buried 34 horses and too many dogs to  
remember on these windswept hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaning against his truck, stuffed with shopping bags of donated  
clothes and laundry baskets with soft drinks, toothpaste and cheese 
crackers, he ponders his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do what everybody else does,'' he says. ``Sit down and cry  
awhile, then try to figure out what to do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just strike one,'' he adds with a laugh. ``I think you  
get three in life -- don't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Every now and then, a squeal of joy echoes through 130th Street  
in southwest Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	A dog is found. A bird's chirp is heard. Small blessings.  
</P>
<P>
	For Gary Welsh, it came Wednesday when he unearthed his  
next-door neighbor's parrot from the remains of their dining room. 
The cage was a bit twisted, the gray-blue bird a bit ruffled, but 
alive it was. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado veered northeast from the farmlands, barging across  
the city line, barreling into houses and garages, transforming the 
neighborhood into what looks like a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the days pass, humor survives among the ruins.  
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Martinez, 48, sits in his driveway, his house a heap of  
rubble behind him, as his insurance adjuster walks up and jokingly 
says: 
</P>
<P>
	``With a little duct tape, we can fix this up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is ready with a quick reply:  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll sell it to you for real cheap.''  
</P>
<P>
	Down the street, someone has scrawled across the front of  
another destroyed house: 
</P>
<P>
	``Fixer Upper. Make Offer.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lovella Bahm doesn't live here anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh Lord, how she would love to sleep in the same place she has  
for 34 years, but it is gone, along with many of her neighbors' 
places in Midwest City, at the northern edge of the storm's path. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world still turns. She discovered that in her mail this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury duty notice was awaiting her.  
</P>
<P>
	She called to beg off, but was told to write a letter explaining  
her plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just corked me!'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look here,'' she told them, recalling her spiel with a wagging  
finger, her piercing blue eyes glimmering beneath her white sun 
hat. ``I don't have a house, a pencil, or chair to sit in. You're 
going to have to lay down on the ground and find me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement wasn't supposed to be like this.  
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old grandmother planned to go with her husband on  
their annual trip to Padre Island, then spend the rest of her year 
surrounded by the comforts of home. But now her Jacuzzi is squashed 
by a Dumpster, her aviary of 100 cockatiels is nowhere to be found, 
her plate collection is shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	One moment she was huddling in the cellar with her grandson and  
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, poof! In a few seconds, like a wave of a diabolical magic  
wand, it was all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many other survivors along the tornado trail, Mrs. Bahm  
will rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	But she's taking things slow and easy.  
</P>
<P>
	As the sun sets, she stands by the wooden gate that withstood  
the storm's fury and ponders the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to think positive,'' she says. ``Everything happens  
for the best. Well, I don't know about that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then she pauses for a moment for a final thought.  
</P>
<P>
	``As time passes things will heal,'' she says. ``I'm sure I  
will, too.''

<HEADLINE>  Chaisson Celebrated at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, Ontario (AP) -- The life of Steve Chiasson was  
celebrated in an emotional funeral mass attended by some of 
hockey's greatest names on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Gretzky, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, the Carolina  
Hurricanes and numerous hockey stars joined the Chiasson family and 
friends for a standing-room-only congregation at the 800-seat 
Cathedral of St. Peter's-in-Chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Chiasson told the gathering she wanted the ceremony to be  
a celebration of her husband's life. 
</P>
<P>
	She said when she first learned Steve had died, in a single  
vehicle accident near their Raleigh, N.C., home Monday morning, she 
felt ill in her stomach. In the intervening days, she said the love 
and support she's received from family, friends and the hockey 
community has helped to ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through God, Steve and all your prayers,'' she said, fighting  
back the tears, ``that pit in my stomach has been replaced by 
Steve's love and his strength and his ability to always stay 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina captain Kevin Dineen spoke of Chiasson's humbleness.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steve wasn't a man of many words but he was comfortable in any  
situation,'' Dineen said. ``When he needed to say something, he'd 
be the type of guy to say it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dineen also touched on the events leading up to Chiasson's  
death, after he left a party at teammate Gary Roberts's house, 
following Carolina's playoff elimination last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things we all wish we'd done differently,'' said  
Dineen, the last person to see Chiasson alive. ``This tragedy comes 
down to one person's judgement. It was a direct result of Steve's 
stubbornness and his desire to see his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson was traveling about 74 miles per hour in a 55-mph zone  
when he crashed, said an accident report released last Tuesday. 
Although blood-alcohol test results will not be available for two 
to three weeks, the report issued listed intoxication as an 
accident factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson's sister, Susan Reinhart, remembered her ``big, little  
brother'' as he grew up from his rock collection, to countless 
games of monopoly and scrabble. She also recalled pulling him off 
the outdoor rink when he was six. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd always say just five more minutes,'' she said. ``I also  
remember the chills we felt when he got to the NHL and his first 
game with the big boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also addressed Chiasson's wife and children Michael, 8,  
Ryan, 4, and Stephanie 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey was Steve's life but they (Susan and the kids) were the  
core of his being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates Ray Sheppard and Dineen served as pall bearers along  
with Chiasson's boyhood friends Dean Haig, Jim Morton, Neil Wyath 
and Tim Keating, his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	As they left the church they passed through a row of Minor Petes  
players, from the major bantam and midget AAA teams, that formed an 
honor guard. Chiasson played his minor hockey with the organization 
they represented. 
</P>
<P>
	Other NHL players attending the funeral included Paul Coffey,  
Dino Ciccarelli, Sean Burke, Bob Probert and Stu Grimson. Those 
with a Peterborough connection included Steve Larmer, Tie Domi, 
Kris King, Roger Neilson, Jacques Martin, Dick Todd and Steve Webb, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, a teammate of Chiasson's during the 1993 NHL all-star  
game, said he had the utmost respect for the defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always tough for me to play against. ... He was a true  
NHL competitor and played the game the way it should be played,'' 
Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson, born in Barrie, Ontario, but raised in Peterborough,  
played 723 NHL games with Detroit, Calgary and Hartford, which 
moved to Carolina. He had 92 goals and 297 assists.

be the type of guy to say it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dineen also touched on the events leading up to Chiasson's  
death, after he left a party at teammate Gary Roberts's house, 
following Carolina's playoff elimination last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things we all wish we'd done differently,'' said  
Dineen, the last person to see Chiasson alive. ``This tragedy comes 
down to one person's judgement. It was a direct result of Steve's 
stubbornness and his desire to see his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson was traveling about 74 miles per hour in a 55-mph zone  
when he crashed, said an accident report released last Tuesday. 
Although blood-alcohol test results will not be available for two 
to three weeks, the report issued listed intoxication as an 
accident factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson's sister, Susan Reinhart, remembered her ``big, little  
brother'' as he grew up from his rock collection, to countless 
games of monopoly and scrabble. She also recalled pulling him off 
the outdoor rink when he was six. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd always say just five more minutes,'' she said. ``I also  
remember the chills we felt when he got to the NHL and his first 
game with the big boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also addressed Chiasson's wife and children Michael, 8,  
Ryan, 4, and Stephanie 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey was Steve's life but they (Susan and the kids) were the  
core of his being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates Ray Sheppard and Dineen served as pall bearers along  
with Chiasson's boyhood friends Dean Haig, Jim Morton, Neil Wyath 
and Tim Keating, his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	As they left the church they passed through a row of Minor Petes  
players, from the major bantam and midget AAA teams, that formed an 
honor guard. Chiasson played his minor hockey with the organization 
they represented. 
</P>
<P>
	Other NHL players attending the funeral included Paul Coffey,  
Dino Ciccarelli, Sean Burke, Bob Probert and Stu Grimson. Those 
with a Peterborough connection included Steve Larmer, Tie Domi, 
Kris King, Roger Neilson, Jacques Martin, Dick Todd and Steve Webb, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, a teammate of Chiasson's during the 1993 NHL all-star  
game, said he had the utmost respect for the defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always tough for me to play against. ... He was a true  
NHL competitor and played the game the way it should be played,'' 
Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson, born in Barrie, Ontario, but raised in Peterborough,  
played 723 NHL games with Detroit, Calgary and Hartford, which 
moved to Carolina. He had 92 goals and 297 assists.

<HEADLINE> Rockets, Lakers Have Similar Teams  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Mirror, anyone?  
</P>
<P>
	As the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Lakers enter their  
first-round playoff series, the teams have so many similarities 
that it's scary. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both had records of 31-19 during the abbreviated regular  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers are seeded fourth in the Western Conference and have  
homecourt advantage in the best-of-5 series by virtue of a 2-1 
record against fifth-seeded Houston, but the Rockets don't seem 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure's on them, the pressure's always on the home  
team,'' Charles Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be able to come away with at least a split in their  
building,'' Scottie Pippen said, referring to Game 1 on Sunday 
afternoon and Game 2 on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Neither team lived up to high preseason expectations, and each  
played very poorly near the end of the season, losing six of eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we removed all the hype the way we played early on,''  
Lakers forward Rick Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both snapped out of slumps by putting together brief winning  
streaks to end the season -- three for the Rockets, four for the 
Lakers -- to gain a little momentum entering the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've definitely turned some things around, our attitude is  
very positive,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``I'm sure LA 
feels the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Fox: ``I expect if we continue to play the way we've been  
playing, the bandwagon will get heavy again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both struggled defensively most of the season before showing  
significant improvement in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Each has one of the best centers in the game -- Houston's  
Hakeem Olajuwon and Los Angeles' Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Each has two other high-profile players -- Barkley and Pippen  
for the Rockets, and Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both acquired one high-profile player -- Pippen and Rice -- to  
hopefully put them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both have young players in the backcourt -- Houston starts  
rookies Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley, and the Lakers go 
with the 20-year-old Bryant and 24-year-old Derek Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Finally, each has an elder statesmen hoping to win a  
championship ring before retirement -- Houston's Barkley and Los 
Angeles' Derek Harper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a very tough first round,'' Olajuwon said.  
``If we can beat them, it will boost our confidence for the rest of 
the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen and Rice might be the keys.  
</P>
<P>
	Both expressed frustration with the way they've been used at the  
offensive end, and understandably so. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has had to adjust to usually being the third option after  
being No. 2 behind Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls, and Rice 
had to make the same adjustment after almost always being the top 
option with the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen played one of his best games as a Rocket on April 26 in a  
102-80 victory over the Lakers, scoring 26 points and sparkling on 
defense with six steals. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring a total of 14 points in two games, Rice scored 62  
in the next two capped by a 40-point explosion in Wednesday night's 
119-91 victory over Portland in the regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Rice continue what he started against Portland, he and  
O'Neal would provide the Lakers a deadly inside-outside game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important not to let (Rice) get the hot hand going like  
(against Portland),'' Pippen said. ``You have to deny him the ball 
and make him catch the ball in uncomfortable spots. He's a pure 
shooter.''

<HEADLINE> Doc Holliday Shotgun Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PFLUGERVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 10-gauge shotgun that Doc Holliday  
used at the O.K. Corral is expected to bring a bid of $50,000 when 
it goes on sale Sunday at an auction of the tools of various Wild 
West figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction got under way Friday, with some items going for as  
little as a couple hundred dollars. But a 45-caliber single-action 
pistol that belonged to Al Seiber, chief of the Apache scouts, went 
for $18,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the auction items came from collector David Hall, an  
Illinois man whose prize possessions include the double-barrel 
sawed-off shotgun Doc Holliday used in the famous gunbattle at the 
O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal effects of other Old West icons such as Wyatt Earp,  
Sitting Bull, Tom Horn, Geronimo and Buck Garrett are also among 
the 1,500 collectibles on the auction block through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, a 72-year-old home builder, says he spent 62 years  
gathering frontier-era weapons, paintings, photographs, law 
enforcement badges and other trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 10 years old and started collecting Indian arrowheads  
and then coins and silver dollars, and I just kept going,'' said 
Hall, who called Pflugerville auctioneer Tom Keilman four months 
ago to arrange the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said he bought his first collectible gun, a rifle belonging  
to Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, 30 years ago from a doctor 
in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, a few minutes before cellular-phone-wielding men wearing  
cowboy hats began bidding on his life's work, Hall said he is 
comfortable with his decision to part with his collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``My kids say they don't have the slightest idea what this stuff  
is or what to do with it,'' Hall told the Austin 
American-Statesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectors consider Hall's Old West collection the best ever  
assembled, said Tom Burks, a Johnson City resident and former 
curator of the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame in Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	``The photography collection he put together is one of the most  
significant Western collections of photographs there ever was,'' 
Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the hundreds of photographs in the collection, perhaps the  
most important is one taken of a horse named Comanche, which was 
the only member of Gen. George Custer's command to survive the 
Battle of Little Bighorn, Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several museums are expected to take part in the bidding,  
Keilman said, adding that representatives from the Cowgirl Hall of 
Fame in Fort Worth plan to make a run at a Smith &AMP; Wesson pistol 
owned by markswoman Annie Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	Other interesting items being auctioned include a noose  
belonging to Arkansas ``Hanging Judge'' Isaac Parker and hangman 
George Maledon, an autograph from Sitting Bull and a pistol used in 
the feud between the Hatfields and McCoys. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Schroeder, a 59-year-old retiree from Las Cruces, N.M.,  
said he made the trek to Pflugerville to get a piece of history 
from a less complicated era in early America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a simpler time -- laid-back and easygoing,'' Schroeder  
said. ``Progress is great, but I sat bumper-to-bumper on I-35 for 
30 minutes this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One particular item on the display tables that lined the  
Pflugerville Lions Hall drew Schroeder's eye more than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do like the Virgil Earp Winchester. It's very nice,''  
Schroeder said. ``You can't go to Wal-Mart and find this stuff, 
that's for sure.''

<HEADLINE> Italian Takes Sail Race in Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- When heroic Italian skipper Giovanni  
Soldini sailed the 27,000-mile Around Alone single-handed yachting 
race four years ago, the object was to finish. This time, he said, 
he wanted to make a showing. 
</P>
<P>
	And that he did, cruising across the finish line off Charleston  
early Saturday to win in record time. His mark of just under 117 
days shaved almost five off the record set by Christophe Auguin. 
</P>
<P>
	Three red flares streaked across a starry sky and a cannon  
boomed as Soldini's yacht, Fila, raced across the line with the 
lights of Charleston sparkling on the horizon. Soldini held a white 
flare as he danced on the deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, several hundred people greeted the 60-foot Fila as it  
berthed at a dock near the city's historic district. Soldini held 
an Italian flag and waved to the crowd. He popped the cork on a 
giant bottle of champagne and sprayed it on his shore crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Soldini said he was proud to be the first  
non-Frenchman to win the race in the five times it has been held. 
He finished second in the smaller 50-foot class in the last race. 
</P>
<P>
	That experience, he said, gave him ``more calm and maybe a bit  
more balance,'' for this race. ``It's great, obviously, to be here 
faster than Christophe. But this boat was four years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini said he did not know if he would enter the next Around  
Alone. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke movingly of Andrea Romanelli, his friend and the  
co-designer of Fila who was lost in an earlier accident at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very glad the race went well so everyone will  
appreciate the work Andrea was doing with us,'' Soldini said. ``We 
won this race much more on the land than we did at sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of the race, for the rest of the world at least,  
was Soldini's single-handed rescue of Isabelle Autissier whose boat 
PRB flipped in the stormy Southern Ocean. Soldini battled for 200 
miles through 40 mph winds and waves as high as 30 feet to make the 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was modest about his efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a friend had a problem and I stopped by to pick  
her up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen boats left Charleston last September, but only nine  
remain. The only other 60-footer, skippered by Frenchman Marc 
Thiercelin, is expected to arrive late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini said it is tough for many of the boats to keep going  
when problems crop up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everybody is lucky enough to have the money to react''  
when a mast is lost or there is some other problem, he said. The 
Fila campaign, he said, had about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is I don't have $20 million in my pocket to change  
the keel every six months,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first leg, Soldini misread the weather and sailed into  
Cape Town, South Africa, almost three days behind the leader. But 
then he beat the competition into Auckland, New Zealand, and won 
the final two legs as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lowest point was the last three days of the first leg,''  
Soldini laughed. ``The highest was the rest (of the race).'' 
</P>
<P>
	This race was a change from four years ago because satellite  
telephone technology gave racers access to the Internet and various 
weather predicting models, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini, said he spent about an hour a day on the Internet but  
said that was ``too much. Too much because the modem is very 
slow.''

<HEADLINE> Reno, Rockers Fight Teen Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is following the  
lead of her saxophone-playing boss and reaching out to the nation's 
young people via MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, standing with bleach-haired rock stars called the Goo Goo  
Dolls, unveiled a CD-ROM and resource guide jointly produced by MTV 
and the government in hopes of stemming teen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living in a culture of violence and we can do something  
about it,'' Reno said at Friday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we use the resources that are available in this nation, if  
we stop the blame game and use positive, creative solutions, I 
think we can substantially eliminate the culture of violence in our 
society,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD, along with a resource guide, is a compilation of songs  
and sound bites donated by top pop artists, including Lauryn Hill, 
the Dave Matthews Band, Backstreet Boys, Alanis Morissette, 
Everclear and Tori Amos. 
</P>
<P>
	An accompanying booklet shows how to avoid violence through  
mentoring and art programs, and includes an extensive resource 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Goo Goo Doll guitarist John Rzeznik said he and the other two  
Dolls had been looking for a project like this ever since the 
Colorado high shootings in which 15 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the tragedy a turning point for the country and said,  
``I was really shocked at how much it shook us all.'' The Goo Goo 
Dolls plan to distribute the CD and 24-page booklet during its 
50-city summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to be comforted and understood and educated and  
invested in and ultimately break the cycle of violence that has 
been passed on and on,'' Rzeznik said. 
</P>
<P>
	The materials will be distributed free to more than 1 million  
young people nationwide over the next year.

<HEADLINE>  2nd Wave of Refugees Arrive in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- A second group of Kosovo refugees has  
arrived in the United States, carrying little more than gruesome 
memories of their troubled homeland and hopes for safe sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	A small crowd of military officials and civilians applauded  
Friday as 407 refugees left a chartered jet and boarded buses for 
nearby Fort Dix. A young boy smiled broadly and waved, while 
another in a black bomber jacket stopped to salute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heartbreaking situation when people leave their homes  
with only the clothes they have on their back,'' said Joseph 
Rudder, the pilot of the jet. ``It does bring tears to your eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has agreed to accept up to 20,000 of the  
hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 after  
President Slobodan Milosevic rejected a plan to end the fighting 
with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The first group of 453 refugees arrived Wednesday and were  
preparing to move into homes of their own. The second group -- 202 
adults and 205 children -- brought more stories of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Selim Berisha and 50 others hid for days in his basement as guns  
were fired on the streets of Pristina. When the shooting ended, 
they emerged to see a dog eating the body of a neighbor, a 
translator said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group buried the young man in a garden before fleeing into  
the woods, said Berisha, 63, who used a handkerchief to dab away 
tears. Berisha and five family members eventually made it to 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never saw his neighbors again,'' the translator said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fadil Krasniqi, 35, hid with 150 neighbors in a house for three  
days as Serb soldiers went door-to-door. Krasniqi, a taxi driver, 
said Serbs filled cars with explosives and rolled them down a hill, 
destroying six houses on his street. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is working to find sponsors for the refugees,  
generally churches and other charities. The sponsors will help them 
find apartments and jobs, assist with school enrollment and arrange 
for family members to take English classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will give $740 to the sponsoring agencies for  
each refugee, said a State Department spokeswoman. After the first 
month, the Department of Health and Human Services will provide 
medical assistance and cash grants similar to state welfare 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical officials said the refugees appeared healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are incredibly surprised how good their health is,  
considering what they've gone through,'' said Dr. Susan Cookson of 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Army personnel and volunteers said they have received scores of  
packages from people donating clothing and other items to the 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is America at its best,'' said Col. William Marshall of  
the New Jersey National Guard. ``You're seeing a side of Americans 
we haven't seen in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all they have been through, many refugees don't like  
being idle and are eager to work, said Brigadier Gen. Mitchell 
Zais, commander of a task force overseeing the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like the fact that they are forced to accept  
charity and are unable to reciprocate in any way,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rowdy Irishman Wins $100,000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Rowdy Irishman won his second  
consecutive $100,000 Iroquois Steeplechase on Saturday, beating 
Avanico by a neck at the end of a furious drive down the Percy 
Warner Park homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Miller, who rode third-place finisher High Card, lodged a  
protest charging Rowdy Irishman and rider Vincent Marzullo with 
interference during the homestretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards reviewed tapes for 15 minutes before affirming the  
victory for Rowdy Irishman, owned by Vesta Balestiere of Cashiers, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Marzullo, of Franklin, Tenn., let High Card and Avanico have the  
lead for the first two turns of the three-mile run with 18 national 
hurdles. Going around the far turn the final time, the bay son of 
Erin's Isle was sent after the leaders and jumped the 18th fence on 
even terms with them. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rowdy Irishman on the inside, High Card in the middle,  
Avanico on the outside and the crowd of 30,000 roaring, the three 
horses matched strides for the final eighth of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo finish camera showed Rowdy Irishman the winner by a  
neck. Another neck separated Avanico and High Card. 
</P>
<P>
	The win for Rowdy Irishman was his fourth in a Grade I event. He  
has twice won the $150,000 American Grand National at Far Hills, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwoods, ridden by Chip Miller, won the $50,000 co-feature, a  
three-mile race over post and rail fences. During that event, 
jockey Ellen Horner fell from Bit of Scotch when her saddle slipped 
over the first jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner was admitted to Saint Thomas Hospital and listed in  
critical condition with head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no serious structural damage,'' Dr. J.W. Thomas Byrd  
said. ``That's an encouraging sign.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine 'Boy in the Window' OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Pat Ireland doesn't remember everything  
that happened the day he was shot three times and crawled out a 
second-story window. He does recall thinking someone would catch 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	People around the world watched on live television as the  
17-year-old student escaped the Columbine High School rampage by 
tumbling out of a library window and into the arms of police. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shortest way down, out,'' Ireland said Friday,  
sitting in a wheelchair between his parents. ``I felt confident 
that there'd be someone there to catch me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time he has spoken publicly since the April 20  
massacre that left 15 dead, including the two student gunmen, and 
22 others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that everyone has been wondering what happened to the  
boy in the window, and he's doing really, really well,'' said 
Ireland's mother, Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland knew of gunmen Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
but was not acquainted with them. When they opened fire, ``I closed 
my eyes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was shot once in the right foot and twice on the left  
side of his head, suffering neurological damage that mimics a 
stroke. The extent of permanent damage isn't known. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very remarkable, brave young man,'' said Dr. Alan  
Weintraub, adding that Ireland is making a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland occasionally has muscle spasms in his leg. The most  
difficult aspect of his therapy is speech and reading because ``the 
words get mixed up in my head sometimes and I'm not sure of all of 
the meanings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hospital news conference, Ireland stopped occasionally  
to confer with his parents before he answered questions in a 
strong, clear voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really remember all of it,'' he said. ``I'm still  
trying to piece together the events that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted he feels a ``little bit'' of anger, but has not  
given it much thought. And he is eager to return to school, yet 
unsure how he will react. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ireland said she and her husband, John, didn't realize the  
boy in the window was Patrick until they saw a video of the rescue 
three days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt, and I think John did too, that there wasn't any reason  
to consider that might be Patrick because we knew he was paralyzed 
and we couldn't imagine that,'' she said. ``I didn't picture it 
happening that way. When we did see it, we knew immediately it was 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four other students remained hospitalized Friday, two in serious  
condition and one in fair condition. The fourth was undergoing 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 13 wooden crosses erected at Clement Park in memory  
of the victims will have to come down again. Religious symbols 
aren't allowed in such a public space, said Edie Hylton, manager of 
the Foothills Park and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois carpenter Greg Zanis initially erected 15 crosses,  
including two for the gunmen. Those were torn down and Zanis 
removed the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	He put them back up this week after the controversy died down,  
but park managers say they will have to be removed -- a declaration 
that ``shocked'' Zanis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten 80 letters from people saying how important the  
crosses are to the healing process,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rocket Hopes To Touch Down Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens hopes to be back on the mound  
Thursday night against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocket, who hasn't pitched since straining his left  
hamstring April 27, threw off a mound for about 15 minutes Friday, 
and planned to take fielding practice Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to bust over to first base a few times and  
I'll have to test it pretty good,'' he said Saturday before the New 
York Yankees played Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young Award winner is among baseball's fiercest  
competitors, and the Yankees know he has a tendency to try to pitch 
through anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is being able to differentiate between a  
little pain and being hurt,'' Clemens said. ``You have some in your 
elbow and your shoulder all the time. Being a power pitcher, you 
deal with it. I know I can pitch with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also understands the Yankees want to be cautious so he's able  
to pitch at full effectiveness. While he's 2-0, he has a 5.47 ERA 
in five starts and has struggled with his control. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were late in the year, they'd be wrapping it up and  
I'd be going out there and getting through,'' Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clemens returns, the Yankees will have to decide whether to  
put Hideki Irabu or Ramiro Mendoza back in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why I don't have to make a decision is if he feels  
anything, it will be a couple more days until he's right,'' interim 
manager Don Zimmer said. ``We don't want him to be partly right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre says Clemens is on track for  
Thursday if he's able to get through the fielding drill and another 
throwing session Tuesday without pain. If it rains Sunday, the 
fielding workout will be pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, obtained by the Yankees from Toronto in February, has  
won 17 consecutive decisions since last May 29, tying the AL 
record. Because of his intense workouts, the Yankees aren't 
concerned he's lost arm or leg strength during the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it as gotten him to cut back on the extra work he  
does,'' Stottlemyre said.

<HEADLINE>  Hunter's Foundation Holds Fundraiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERTFORD, N.C. (AP) -- The applause from the stands was polite  
and almost reverent Saturday when Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter walked 
toward the pitcher's mound with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat in the middle of the baseball diamond at Perquimans  
County High School next to his wife as family, friends and former 
teammates held a ceremony to honor Hertford's favorite son and to 
kick off a foundation to aid those, like Hunter, suffering from Lou 
Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	One girl read a poem about ``Jimmy,'' whom she thinks of as ``a  
hard worker to lend a hand, not a Hall of Famer.'' Then teammates 
spoke about the Hall of Fame pitcher's determination and courage as 
a player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has more courage in his little finger than most people''  
have at all, former Oakland manager Alvin Dark said. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was finally his turn to speak, the five-time World  
Series winner could barely muster the words for the waiting, hushed 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked everyone for their help with the day's events to  
benefit the newly formed foundation. Hunter stepped away from the 
microphone, one hand lifted to wipe his face, and stepped back with 
a quip about the wind whistling into the mike. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this microphone would stop ringing, I could say  
something,'' he said to break the silent tension. ``I enjoyed this 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, was diagnosed in September with amyothropic lateral  
sclerosis, or ALS, a neurological disease that interferes with the 
signals the brain sends to the muscles. Over time, the muscles 
degenerate. The cause if unknown, and there's no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	It manifests itself differently. In Hunter's case, it affects  
his arms and hands, which means he can't raise them to shake hands 
or throw a baseball. His wife, Helen, helped him take off his navy 
New York Yankees cap before the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people attended the kickoff for the Jim Catfish  
Hunter ALS Foundation, held along with a barbecue lunch, softball 
and baseball games and a silent auction. Items up for bid included 
balls signed by current Yankees Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens, 
black sequined boots worn by Dolly Parton, Yankees World Series 
paraphernalia and Vince Gill's guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	Former major leaguers on hand -- Oakland catcher Jim Pagliaroni,  
A's third baseman Sal Bando, Yankees first baseman Jim Spencer, 
Oakland outfielder Mike Hershberger, Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord 
Perry, Yankees pitcher Ron Davis and pitcher Tommy John -- recalled 
Hunter as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	A big gathering at the high school baseball field is nothing new  
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saturday before Mother's Day has been set aside for a local  
old-timers baseball game since Hunter started it in 1980, a year 
after he retired from the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the date coincided with the perfect game he pitched  
May 8, 1968, when he was with Oakland. It is one of only 13 perfect 
games in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter joked about Perry's fondness for food. Hunter and  
Pagliaroni, his catcher for the perfect game 31 years ago, 
reminisced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Hershberger, about the fifth or sixth inning ... walked  
by me and he says, `Hey, you walked a guy in the first inning.' ... 
And until the last out in the ball game I thought I had walked 
somebody. Until Sal Bando came up to me after the last out and said 
perfect game,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	As amiable as ever, Hunter walked among the throngs of hometown  
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see it happen to him. That stuff he's got is bad.  
All we can do is hope and pray there's a cure,'' said Hertford 
resident Stanley ``Demp'' Pierce, 62. He remembers Hunter, or Jimmy 
as everyone here calls him, running around the ball park as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Even during the autograph session, during which he stood and  
talked to those in line, he yelled out to his former teammates to 
sign faster because the line was getting long. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's his normal self,'' said Susan Harris, one of the day's  
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Catfish Hunter fan,'' said Keith Vaughan,  
the pastor of Hertford Baptist Church. ``Not many people get to 
meet (their) childhood hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Vaughan helps support the family that has helped many in  
this small town.

<HEADLINE> Coach's Son Charged in Parrot Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin football coach Barry Alvarez's  
son faces criminal charges for breaking into a fraternity brother's 
room and microwaving a parrot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have recommended charging Chad Alvarez, a senior at  
Wisconsin, with burglary and mistreating an animal. The 23-year-old 
Alvarez was arrested Friday after turning himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to be arraigned Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Sigma Chi fraternity members found the dead parrot in the  
microwave last week while it was still operating, Madison police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Greenfield, a member of the fraternity, owned the parrot  
and said whoever killed ``Iago'' may have done so because he was 
angry about an e-mail that was passed around the fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I was ridiculing him in front of the whole  
fraternity,'' Greenfield told The Capital Times of Madison. But 
Greenfield said ``there's no excuse when you put somebody's pet in 
the microwave and fry it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield would not refer to Alvarez by name, but he said  
whoever killed his parrot had confessed to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield said the bird had a vocabulary of about 20 words.  
</P>
<P>
	If charged and convicted on both counts, Alvarez faces a maximum  
fine of $20,000 and 12-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Alvarez pleaded no contest in April to first offense  
drunken driving, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released Friday on a $500 signature bond.

<HEADLINE> Jets May Be Sold by Hess Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan may get a  
third chance at owning an NFL franchise after two unsuccessful 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan is being mentioned among the potential buyers for the New  
York Jets following the death of owner Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess confided to some of his fellow NFL owners that he wanted  
the team sold rather than have his family run it after his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He was said to have been reluctant to leave the responsibility  
of ownership to his heirs, which include his son John, who 
succeeded his father as chairman of Amerada Hess Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan was an unsuccessful bidder for the Washington Redskins  
earlier this year and also failed to buy the Cleveland Browns 
expansion franchise last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners voted in favor of Alfred Lerner's $530 million offer for  
the Browns franchise over brothers Larry and Charles Dolan, who 
were teamed with Hall of Fame coach Don Shula and comedian Bill 
Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan was joined by New Jersey Devils owner John McMullen in his  
bid for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan may have had a problem even if he had been successful with  
either of those bids because of the NFL's cross ownership rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The league does not permit its owners to have a franchise in  
another sport except if that franchise is in the same market as the 
NFL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Dolan's Cablevision owns the New York Knicks and New York  
Rangers, that would not be a problem should he decide to bid for 
the Jets. Nor would it be for McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan, anxious to expand his sports holdings, also reportedly  
made an offer for the New York Yankees recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Also mentioned in published reports as potential Jets' buyers  
were real estate and hotel-casino operator Donald Trump; Howard 
Milstein, who failed in a bid to buy the Redskins; Nelson 
Doubleday, part owner of the New York Mets; and Robert Tisch, part 
owner of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump would have to divest himself of his gambling casinos  
before becoming an owner in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Jets coach and general manager Bill Parcells has been  
mentioned as a likely point man for a group of investors, as well 
as Jets president Steve Gutman. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise has been estimated to be worth about $500 million,  
according to sports finance experts quoted in Saturday's edition of 
The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost will be considerably lower than the $800 million that  
the Redskins sold for, mainly because the Washington franchise 
included a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services for Hess, who had been ill with a blood  
disorder for about a year, will be held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was an oil tycoon worth an estimated $720 million.

<HEADLINE> Judge Suggests Settling Barney Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge has recommended that the  
owners of Barney, the purple dinosaur loved by children, work out 
their differences with a company that rents and sells purple animal 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case that ought to have been settled,'' U.S.  
District Judge Graham Mullen said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of the trial Friday, Mullen announced that he was  
taking the case under advisement. He said it could take him some 
time to issue a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's owner, Lyons Partnership of Richardson, Texas, sued  
Morris Costumes in 1997, accusing the Charlotte company of 
copyright and trademark infringement for renting and selling purple 
animal costumes that look like Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar lawsuits targeting the Barney look-alikes have been  
filed across the country, but this is the first case to go to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barney's young fans accept him as a `real' best friend, and  
trust him completely,'' Lyons Partnership said in a statement. 
``Many of these very vulnerable children have been shocked and 
disappointed by seeing someone in a bogus `Barney' costume behaving 
rudely, smoking, drinking, or otherwise behaving in ways they know 
are not appropriate for Barney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Morris Costumes, one of the nation's largest costume  
distributors, say there has been no infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Costumes' lawyer, Jay Bilas, told Mullen that parents  
renting the costumes for their children's birthday parties knew 
they weren't Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons Partnership is seeking a court-ordered injunction  
preventing Morris Costumes from renting or selling the costumes 
resembling Barney. Barney's owner also wants $300,000 for what it 
calls willful infringement.

	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Substitute Paulo Dos Santos provided all  
the footwork New England needed Saturday night as the Revolution

	Dos Santos scored the winning goal in the shootout, the fourth  
of the year for each team.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Democrats Adopt Caucus Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan's Democratic Party leaders  
unanimously adopted a new caucus plan Saturday that would challenge 
the traditional dominance of Iowa and New Hampshire in the 
presidential selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	However, both states have successfully fought off similar  
attempts by other states in the past and party leaders have 
signaled their determination to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the Michigan Democratic State Central Committee  
voted in favor of holding a Feb. 12, 2000 party caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Iowa nor New Hampshire have set their caucus or primary  
dates for 2000, but Iowa Democratic leaders have said they intend 
to match Republican plans for a Feb. 7 caucus. Iowa held its 
initial caucus meetings on Feb. 12 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire state law requires that the parties set their  
primary dates seven days before any other state primary. Democrats 
are not expected to set their date before September. The 1996 
primary was on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., has fought to have Michigan go ahead  
of Iowa and New Hampshire for years, but acknowledges that there 
could be a fight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee traditionally preserved the  
status of Iowa and New Hampshire as, respectively, the first caucus 
and primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not right that two states have such a huge impact on the  
way we pick a president. It's not right the candidates visit those 
states a huge number of times while other states get few visits,'' 
Levin said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said if the DNC does not approve Michigan's request to move  
up its caucus date, his fight won't be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take our case to the convention, where I predict all the  
other states, except New Hampshire and Iowa, will give us a 
standing ovation for having the guts to do what's right,'' Levin 
said in a telephone interview after Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he does not think the national committee would punish  
the state by not seating Michigan's delegates at the national 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Murphy, spokesman for New Hampshire Democratic Gov. Jeanne  
Shaheen, said the decision changes nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a state, New Hampshire will do what it takes to ensure that  
that status is not disturbed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Michigan plan, Democrats could begin voting for their  
presidential choice on Jan. 11, 2000, at party headquarters or by 
mail-in ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, to be announced at a party caucus on Feb. 12, would  
be used to help select delegates for the Democratic National 
Convention, which will be held in Los Angeles in August 2000.

<HEADLINE> Columbine 'Boy in the Window' OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Pat Ireland doesn't remember everything  
that happened the day he was shot three times and crawled out a 
second-story window. He does recall thinking someone would catch 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	People around the world watched on live television as the  
17-year-old student escaped the Columbine High School rampage by 
tumbling out of a library window and into the arms of police. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shortest way down, out,'' Ireland said Friday,  
sitting in a wheelchair between his parents. ``I felt confident 
that there'd be someone there to catch me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time he has spoken publicly since the April 20  
massacre that left 15 dead, including the two student gunmen, and 
22 others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that everyone has been wondering what happened to the  
boy in the window, and he's doing really, really well,'' said 
Ireland's mother, Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland knew of gunmen Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,  
but was not acquainted with them. When they opened fire, ``I closed 
my eyes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was shot once in the right foot and twice on the left  
side of his head, suffering neurological damage that mimics a 
stroke. The extent of permanent damage isn't known. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very remarkable, brave young man,'' said Dr. Alan  
Weintraub, adding that Ireland is making a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland occasionally has muscle spasms in his leg. The most  
difficult aspect of his therapy is speech and reading because ``the 
words get mixed up in my head sometimes and I'm not sure of all of 
the meanings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hospital news conference, Ireland stopped occasionally  
to confer with his parents before he answered questions in a 
strong, clear voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really remember all of it,'' he said. ``I'm still  
trying to piece together the events that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted he feels a ``little bit'' of anger, but has not  
given it much thought. And he is eager to return to school, yet 
unsure how he will react. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ireland said she and her husband, John, didn't realize the  
boy in the window was Patrick until they saw a video of the rescue 
three days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt, and I think John did too, that there wasn't any reason  
to consider that might be Patrick because we knew he was paralyzed 
and we couldn't imagine that,'' she said. ``I didn't picture it 
happening that way. When we did see it, we knew immediately it was 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four other students remained hospitalized Friday, two in serious  
condition and one in fair condition. The fourth was undergoing 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 13 wooden crosses erected at Clement Park in memory  
of the victims will have to come down again. Religious symbols 
aren't allowed in such a public space, said Edie Hylton, manager of 
the Foothills Park and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois carpenter Greg Zanis initially erected 15 crosses,  
including two for the gunmen. Those were torn down and Zanis 
removed the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	He put them back up this week after the controversy died down,  
but park managers say they will have to be removed -- a declaration 
that ``shocked'' Zanis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten 80 letters from people saying how important the  
crosses are to the healing process,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hart Upset by Royals Protest Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sorry, Royals fans. John Hart doesn't feel your  
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's general manager has heard reports that the Indians,  
like the Yankees before them, will be greeted by protesters when 
they visit Kansas City next month. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 3,000 Royals supporters, upset with a growing chasm  
in baseball's economic system that pits big-money franchises like 
New York, Cleveland and Baltimore -- all with payrolls above $68 
million -- against Kansas City's paltry $24 million, wore T-shirts 
reading ``$hare the Wealth'' and walked out of Kauffman Stadium 
during the fourth inning of a recent game against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart has heard the fans are planning a similar welcome for the  
Indians when they go to Kansas City for a four-game series 
beginning June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're on the list as one of the teams to be protested, I  
think it's an absolute joke,'' Hart said. ``Because in our 
situation, we are truly the same kind of market as Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that we've had a plan and gone about it and our fans  
support us and our community supports us. We don't have any 
ancillary extra dollars coming in from television. We've been very 
creative and very aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where were they six years or seven years ago when they were  
winning and spending (former owner) Ewing Kauffman's money and not 
developing a plan and paying attention to what was going on? The 
guy dies and says, 'Here's the money, go ahead and support the 
team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing rankles Hart more than when the Indians are lumped  
together with the big-market, big-money Yankees and Dodgers, teams 
who draw much of their revenue from large local television 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago that Cleveland was baseball's sorriest city  
with a crumbling stadium, low attendance figures and a skimpy 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no protests in Cleveland when we had two or three  
thousand at the game and we were going into Toronto with an $8 
million payroll to their $51 million,'' Hart said. ``We just said, 
'Hey, let's fix it. Let's not let somebody else do it. Let's fix it 
ourselves.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart understands there is a disparity issue in baseball, but  
he's quick to point out that spending money isn't necessarily the 
quickest way to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no guarantees,'' he said. ``The Dodgers have had a  
lot of money for four years, and they haven't been in it. Colorado 
has had a lot of money, and they haven't been in it. Texas has been 
in and out, in and out.''

<HEADLINE> Families Sue Pesticide Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- At least 100,000 people who claim they  
suffered health problems because of exposure to the pesticide 
malathion are part of a lawsuit against the substance's 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action suit was filed against Cheminova Inc., of  
Wayne, N.J., on Friday in U.S. district court. The lawsuit claims 
the company improperly handled and stored the chemical, which was 
spayed in 1997 and 1998 in several Florida counties, including 
Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee and Sarasota. 
</P>
<P>
	Malathion is used to eradicate the fruit-eating Medfly.  
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1 million people lived and worked in the spray  
zone, and some complained of sinus congestion, headaches and 
respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Those suing the company say they were exposed to contaminated  
batches of malathion. They are seeking unspecified damages to pay 
for past and future medical bills, property damages and other 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this ends the use of malathion,'' said Kathy Rink of  
Sarasota, one of the plaintiffs named in the class action suit. ``I 
hope this sends the message that they can't come and poison us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheminova officials had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The suit asserts that malathion was stored above recommended  
temperatures, causing the pesticide to break down into its highly 
toxic components, malaoxon and isomalathion. 
</P>
<P>
	It accused the company of knowing about the danger, and also  
entrusting handling and storage of the chemical to unqualified 
people.

<HEADLINE> Pope, Orthodox Leader: Stop Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Pope John Paul II and Romania's  
Orthodox Christian patriarch combined their moral authority 
Saturday in a joint appeal for an end to the Kosovo conflict, 
condemning both forced expulsions and ``murderous bombings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul and Patriarch Teoctist appealed ``in the name of God''  
to those ``who in one way or another are responsible for the 
current tragedy'' to return to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued on the second day of John Paul's  
historic visit to Romania, a mainly Orthodox country that borders 
on Serbia. Before the visit, some in Romania questioned inviting a 
religious leader from the West while NATO was bombing fellow 
Orthodox in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NATO attacks began March 24, John Paul has issued a  
series of statements condemning the bombing as well the expulsions 
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The expression of solidarity with ``those expelled from their  
homes, their land, separated from their loved ones, who know the 
cruel reality of the exodus,'' was considered one of the strongest 
statements by an Orthodox leader on Serbia's campaign against 
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. The Russian patriarch, Alexy II, 
mentioned the plight of refugees during a visit to Belgrade last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders mentioned expulsions in their statement before  
expressing solidarity with the ``victims of murderous bombings.'' 
However, they didn't specifically say that the ethnic Albanians 
were the victims of expulsions or name NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	They called for a resumption of dialogue that would lead to a  
``just and lasting'' peace and permit the return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit by John Paul was the first by a pope to a mainly  
Orthodox country in nearly 1,000 years. Before returning to Rome on 
Sunday, the pope and the patriarch will attend a Catholic and an 
Orthodox religious service. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope was bearing up well, despite a heavy  
schedule, although he leaned on a silver staff for support during 
the morning Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope began the second day of his visit with a stop at Belu  
cemetery in southern Bucharest, where Catholic clergymen killed 
during the Communist regime are buried. 
</P>
<P>
	He knelt in prayer for 10 minutes before the tombs, occasionally  
looking up at the photographs of seven Catholics who have been 
proposed for beatification, the last stage before sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between Catholics and Orthodox in Romania have come  
into the open since the fall of communism, particularly with the 
re-emergence of Eastern Rite Catholic churches, which retain 
Orthodox-style liturgy but are loyal to the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Communists in Romania and elsewhere in Eastern Europe suppressed  
the Eastern Rite, turning over its property to the Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope presided at an Eastern Rite service Saturday in a  
crowded St. Joseph's cathedral. Organizers had handed out some 
2,000 tickets for only 1,000 places in the small church and many of 
the faithful stood on pews to get a glimpse of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the pope arrived, an ambulance crew carried in  
Cardinal Alexandru Todea, 86, who has been confined to wheelchair 
for years. The cardinal spent 43 years in prison or house arrest 
during the Communist rule, which ended in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to silence your liberty, to suffocate it, but they  
didn't succeed,'' the pope said in his homily. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope agreed as a price for his visit not to travel to  
Transylvania, where Catholics predominate. Orthodox feared their 
authority might be undercut.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 2, Fire 1 (so) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Garlick stopped all five shots and R.T.  
Moore scored the lone shootout goal as the Tampa Bay Mutiny won 
their third straight game, a 2-1 victory over the Chicago Fire 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore converted his first career shootout attempt in the fourth  
round. Garlick made the slim lead hold up when he stopped Jerzy 
Podbrozny on Chicago's final chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams were missing key players because of suspensions or  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutiny midfielder Carlos Valderrama and Chicago defender Lubos  
Kubik, the 1998 MLS defender of the year, served suspensions for 
incurring red cards. Fire forward Ante Razov, the league's leading 
scorer with six goals and three assists, sprained his right ankle 
May 1 and is expected to miss 3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire went up 1-0 when Josh Wolff scored his third goal in  
the sixth minute. The forward beat Garlick to a pass from Roman 
Kosecki and scored from 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay tied the game on Jefferson Gottardi's fourth goal  
during the 57th minute. From near the left post, Gottardi 
redirected Mauricio Ramos' shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos set a Mutiny record by picking up an assist in four  
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton preserved the regulation tie,  
robbing Pete Marino from in close with just over two minutes left 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire lost two players during the game. Team captain Peter  
Nowak departed in the 71st minute with a left calf strain and C.J. 
Brown left with cramps in the 58th minute.

	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Six protesters ended an eight-day hunger  
strike early today when the University of California, Berkeley, 
agreed to retain eight ethnic studies professorships. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will provide $100,000 toward an institute of  
race and gender studies, open a multicultural student center and

	Students began a liquid-only diet on April 30, claiming  
administrators had cut funding to the ethnic studies department. On 
Tuesday, police arrested some 80 protesters who had set up a 
makeshift camp outside the office of Chancellor Robert Berdahl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hunger strikers had to be treated for dehydration and  
an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Berdahl said the agreement proves the university's commitment to  
its ethnic studies program.

<HEADLINE> Murray Bros. Now on Opposite Sides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMAR, Norway (AP) -- Brothers Bryan and Terry Murray, who work  
together all year for the good of the Florida Panthers, will have 
different agendas Sunday when Canada plays the United States in the 
second round of the World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Murray coaches the U.S. team, while Bryan is Team Canada's  
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are taking a break from their duties with the Panthers.  
Terry is the coach of the NHL team, and Bryan, as the club's 
general manager, is his brother's boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been through this many times: Washington-Detroit,  
Philadelphia-Florida,'' Terry said, referring to the times the two 
brothers worked for different NHL teams. ``The first time there was 
a lot of attention, a lot of interviews, a lot of distraction for 
the two teams that were playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't affect our relationship,'' Terry said. ``When we  
get back to work (with the Panthers) nothing will have changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't mean much, it's the Canadians playing the United  
States. That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Terry, nationality had little to do with accepting the  
position of head coach for the American team. He has lived in the 
United States for 30 years and has been a U.S. citizen for about 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	It had more to do with opportunity knocking.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had been asked by Canada, even this year, I would gladly  
have gone. I would have loved to have come,'' Terry Murray said. 
``But my phone never rang. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity came from the U.S. team and I had the U.S.  
passport. I didn't want to pass up the opportunity. It's a once in 
a lifetime chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Older brother Bryan agreed. He, too, jumped at the chance to  
join the Canadian team. 
</P>
<P>
	And it wasn't the first time.  
</P>
<P>
	He was an assistant coach for Canada at the 1990 world  
championships when the team got into the semifinals where they lost 
to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you get the opportunity and are invited to represent  
your country it's an exciting challenge,'' said Bryan Murray, 56. 
``It's a very competitive tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While it's his first time as a coach at a major international  
tournament, Terry is not feeling any particular pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though at the last world championships, a quickly-assembled  
group of mismatched American players went crashing out in the 
opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any anxiety? Not for me, not at all,'' said Terry. ``The past  
has nothing to do with what's going on in the future. It's a new 
year. The attitude is different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the team has managed to get past the preliminary round  
this year, routing Japan 7-1 and defeating Austria 5-2, it suffered 
4-3 losses to Olympic champions Czech Republic and Olympic bronze 
medal winner Finland. The latter in its second-round opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, the 1997 world champions, opened their second round  
campaign with an 8-2 win over Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In other second round play Sunday, the Czechs will face Slovakia  
while Finland, the losing finalists to Sweden last year, will play 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champions Sweden will meet Russia,

mistakenly sent a dirty joke by e-mail to 6,000 reporters and 
government officials instead of a daily report on actions taken by 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC issued an apologetic e-mail Friday immediately after  
sending out the raunchy joke titled, ``Nuns in heaven,'' The 
Philadelphia Inquirer reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	An Inquirer reporter received the e-mail, which was sent to a  
distribution list of journalists and public officials who regularly 
receive the FCC's daily summary of news, speeches, commission 
orders and public notices. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC called the message highly offensive and said  
disciplinary action would be taken against the sender. Agency 
spokeswoman Stacey Mesa apologized in a separate e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman William E. Kennard planned to issue a ``sternly  
worded'' e-mail to employees on Monday reminding them of the 
agency's policy against using computers for personal e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Gives Talk, Despite Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill  
Bradley delivered the commencement address as planned Saturday at 
Mount St. Clare College despite a call from a national Roman 
Catholic group that wanted his invitation withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falls Church, Va.-based Cardinal Newman Society had asked  
college president James Ross to cancel Bradley's invitation because 
he supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that some people disagree on certain issues, but  
for me, I have tremendous respect for ... Mount St. Clare, for the 
leadership here at this institution and for the young people who 
are graduating today,'' Bradley said in an interview before 
speaking to the 102 graduates at the school's 69th commencement 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	A former senator from New Jersey, Bradley said he understood why  
the Cardinal Newman Society objected to his appearance. The 
organization had asked 10 Catholic colleges this spring to cancel 
invitations to speakers who support abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a country that has free speech, and people can express  
their views, and that's fine,'' said Bradley, who has taught at 
Notre Dame, the nation's most prominent Catholic university. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley did not address the controversy during a 15-minute  
speech to about 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he talked about the ``horrific tragedy'' of the  
Littleton, Colo., high school shooting on April 20 in which 13 
students and a teacher died. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many parents, he said, were becoming too busy in their own  
lives to pay attention to their children. He said the ``scourge of 
school shootings'' around the country in recent years have killed a 
total of 28 people while injuring 71. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children's values are shaped as much by television, the  
shopping malls, the video games as they are shaped by the 
parents,'' Bradley said. ``Something is wrong when parents are so 
out of touch they don't know that bombs are being built under their 
own roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must take responsibility for the society that are children  
live in. We must teach them the sense of right and wrong, good and 
evil. These are the seeds of conscience, and we must do what we can 
to help them grow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount St. Clare officials never gave any thought to canceling  
Bradley's appearance, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Franciscan college, it's important for us to expose our  
students to all varieties of groups of people,'' he said. ``In my 
situation, I do have a difference of opinion on the issue. I have 
always been strongly in favor of the pro-life aspect of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But again, Mr. Bradley has done so many different things for  
our society and what he stands for,'' Ross said. ``The college does 
not endorse any particular viewpoint of any of its speakers. We did 
not have any thought of rescinding the invitation.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Scrutinizing AT&AMP;T-MediaOne Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's plan to buy MediaOne, a deal that would  
create the nation's largest cable TV company and provider of 
high-speed cable Internet services, ``warrants very careful 
scrutiny,'' the FCC's chief said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $58 billion deal's size, complexity and its potential reach  
into American homes must be studied, Federal Communications 
Commission Chairman Bill Kennard said in his first comment on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement reached Tuesday, AT&AMP;T would acquire the  
nation's fourth-largest cable TV company, MediaOne, and its 5 
million cable TV customers. AT&AMP;T also would acquire MediaOne's 25 
percent stake in cable systems owned by Time Warner Inc., the 
nation's largest cable TV company. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which recently took over the nation's No. 2 cable TV  
company, Tele-Communications Inc., would become the nation's 
largest cable TV provider, directly or indirectly owning cable TV 
systems that reach two-thirds of U.S. homes, government officials 
estimated Friday. AT&AMP;T, already the country's biggest long-distance 
company, considers the two-thirds figure overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Importantly, those cable deals as well as other cable alliances  
would give AT&AMP;T direct links to carry telephone, television, 
Internet services and interactive entertainment into U.S. homes. 
Without the links, AT&AMP;T would have to rely on other companies, 
notably its rival Baby Bells, to have a direct pathway into 
customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Cleland, director of Legg Mason's Precursor Group,  
comparing Kennard's statement with his positive comments on the 
AT&AMP;T-TCI deal, interpreted the chairman's comment on the proposed 
merger as significant. ``He gave a positive signal when AT&AMP;T and 
TCI was announced,'' Cleland said. ``This time the tone and words 
are quite different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, both Cleland and AT&AMP;T believe the deal will be approved  
by the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T would acquire MediaOne's 50 percent  
management interest in cable Internet services provider Road Runner 
-- the biggest competitor to At Home, in which AT&AMP;T now has a 
controlling stake through its takeover of TCI. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home and Road Runner are the two main providers of Internet,  
data and other information that cable customers can obtain using 
high-speed cable TV lines and special cable modems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers will lose all hope of choice,'' said Mark Cooper of  
the Consumer Federation of America, which wants the FCC to block 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's deal with MediaOne is intensifying calls by America  
Online, consumer groups and some of the nation's Baby Bells that 
the government force AT&AMP;T to give all companies access to its 
high-speed cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of its size and reach and the many novel legal and  
policy issues involved, this proposed merger warrants very careful 
scrutiny,'' Kennard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	While the deal holds the promise of helping AT&AMP;T crack open the  
Baby Bells' local telephone monopoly -- something attractive to 
Washington lawmakers and regulators -- its potential reach over 
cable TV customers makes some policy-makers nervous. Senate 
hearings on the merger will be next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a race against the nation's five Baby Bells, wireless  
companies and satellite providers, AT&AMP;T aims to use cable as its 
foundation to become a dominant national player in providing 
telecommunications and entertainment services. It does not own any 
of the telephone connection lines into people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC staff are now trying to sort through the many issues the  
merger raises. They include the deal's effects on the ability of 
new cable TV networks to be carried on AT&AMP;T-owned or -controlled 
cable TV systems; rivals' ability to gain access to cable TV 
programming; and competition for, and consumers' access to, 
high-speed cable Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	And another big issue looming for the proposed deal: compliance  
with any new federal rules that may be put in place to restrict the 
number of cable customers a single company can control.

<HEADLINE> Parents Support Gun Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents of children killed or injured by guns  
banded together at the White House to plead for an end to gun 
violence and for stronger measures to keep firearms away from 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined Saturday by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the  
ornate, yellow-curtained East Room of the White House, four parents 
shared stories about their children to about 300 guests, many also 
parents of shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Mauser related to the audience the agony of waiting for word  
that his son, Daniel, had been killed in the April 20 shooting at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``My time spent in that waiting room was less than an hour, and  
it was a terrible hour,'' Mauser said. ``But many parents are still 
in that waiting room. They fear for their children and fear for 
their safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mauser said gun violence was the result of ills in American  
society and urged more responsibility from the entertainment and 
gun industries. He cited the example of his late son, who was thin 
and afraid of public speaking but made himself participate in 
debate and athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son worked on his weaknesses. I urge America to address its  
weaknesses, also,'' Mauser said to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	His words were echoed by Catherine Murphy, whose 11-year-old  
son, Christopher, was shot to death by a 12-year-old. Murphy, a New 
York police officer who carries a firearm every day, urged parents 
to keep weapons locked up and to lobby Congress for tougher gun 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	With the others, she pledged to make Mother's Day a day of  
political action for those who have lost children to guns. They 
were joined by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was 
shot and killed and her son critically wounded by a crazed gunman 
on the Long Island Railroad in 1993. She has become one of 
Congress' most vocal advocates for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many more Springfields or Littletons can we suffer before  
we do what must be done to keep guns away from children?'' asked 
Rebecca Lynn. She sat beside her daughter, Betina, who was wounded 
in last May's shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady read to the crowd a pledge of four steps parents  
can take to prevent gun violence. She told the crowd she would 
carry the pledge with her at all times and promote it whenever she 
can.

<HEADLINE> Bush Undeclared but Leading the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A month from his debut as a presidential  
campaigner, Gov. George W. Bush professes amazement at his ranking 
atop the Republican field in a race he plans to run on his terms 
and on his timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows what's coming when he takes the road from Texas. He  
stayed put to deal with the business of the state Legislature, 
which adjourns at the end of the month. So Republican leaders came 
to him, 150 or more, to see, hear and endorse the man at the top of 
the preseason polls for the GOP nomination, and for the 2000 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, he talks in minute  
detail of state legislation, but he is purposefully vague on 
national issues. ``I know what I believe, and I know what I will 
fight for,'' he said. ``I will have a tax plan. I'll have plans on 
various issues which we will lay out on my timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very long and arduous road, as you know, and the  
temptation's going to be for people to want to know it immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do on this, what are you going to do on  
that? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be specific in some areas and in some areas, I'll hold my  
fire, so I'll have something to say over the course of the fall and 
the winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will intensify the pressure, the questions, the criticism  
from other candidates and from commentators for a detailed platform 
from Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	It will come in a rush when Bush begins his active campaign next  
month. He's booked to begin with two private fund-raising events on 
the way to a day of campaigning in Iowa on June 12. He's to be in 
New Hampshire on June 14 and 15. After opening in the small states 
that hold the initial contests of the 2000 primary season, Bush is 
booked for a campaign tour in the biggest, California, in late 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Current planning puts him on the campaign road for two weeks in  
June, two weeks in July and 17 days in August. No gradual glide 
path into the campaign for Bush; he begins running in a rush, with 
a media crowd certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are going to be a lot of diversions,'' Bush says.  
``There'll be moments of stress, and I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Make that months of stress. There is no political role more  
intense and demanding than running for president, especially for 
the candidate in front. Every public pronouncement is sifted, every 
slip magnified. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush saw it in his father's presidential campaigns, the winner  
in 1988, the loser in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	And front-runners have fallen before. Gov. George Romney of  
Michigan led in advance but collapsed as a candidate in 1968. Sen. 
Edmund S. Muskie of Maine was the faraway Democratic favorite in 
1972, until he faltered and failed in the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to stay focused on why people should be for me,''  
says Bush, who does not yet call his candidacy by name. He's still 
exploring, undeclared. But that's only timing. He's raised $7.6 
million, expects to at least double that by midsummer. There are 
about 35 people in his Austin political headquarters, and they're 
hiring. More than half the 32 Republican governors are backing him, 
as are about 100 GOP members of Congress. ``We've got the 
beginnings of a good political operation in some of the states,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	All with the candidate at a distance. His father became  
president in 1989 after a long apprenticeship in government that 
began long before his eight years as vice president. The son's 
campaign standing comes after one term as governor and landslide 
re-election in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm amazed,'' Bush says. ``... I know I've got a lot of  
work to do after the session's over to go to these states where I 
haven't been ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	At home, he's studying national policy issues, meeting regularly  
with a team of advisers with Washington know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that one of the things I'm good at is campaigning -- I  
like people a lot -- I like to shake hands and I like to look people 
in the eye and say I'd like for you to hear me and help me out,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that kind of one-on-one campaign is difficult if not  
impossible in the era of nonstop television, boom microphones, 
crowds of reporters, Secret Service security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to go shake those hands,'' Bush said. ``It's going to  
be interesting to see how we can accomplish that.'' That's been his 
strength in Texas campaigns, not the stump speech to the crowd. 
There will have to be more of the latter now, and more television 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	All to put him to the special tests of the leader. ``I know the  
expectations are high,'' Bush says. ``As my daughter said, 'Dad, 
you're not nearly as cool as people think.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	He's about to begin finding out.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Forsberg's Ejection Key to Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A contrite Peter Forsberg admitted his ejection  
from the opening game of the Detroit-Colorado playoff series 
crippled his team, even while his coach and teammates decried a 
lack of consistency in officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	With Forsberg, Colorado's best player, gone from the latter  
stages of Friday night's game, Detroit's Kirk Maltby scored 4:18 
into overtime, giving the Red Wings a 3-2 victory. Game 2 is 
scheduled here on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the second period, Forsberg hit Brendan Shanahan from  
behind, knocking Shanahan into the glass and opening a cut around 
his right eye. Forsberg was assessed a five-minute major for 
boarding and a game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado managed to kill off that penalty, as did Detroit in the  
third period after Darren McCarty, on a similar play, was assessed 
a five-minute boarding penalty for slamming Claude Lemieux into the 
boards from behind, leaving a stunned Lemieux lying on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there was no blood, however, McCarty was not ejected.  
</P>
<P>
	``Either both should have been ejected or both should have  
stayed in,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley argued on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel McCarty's hit on Lemieux was twice as worse as  
Forsberg's hit on Shanahan. But we can spend all day discussing if 
a gash to Shanahan is worse than the neck sprain that Lemieux 
suffered. The rule is written that way, and we just have to live 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	As of mid-afternoon on Saturday, the Avalanche had not been  
informed if Forsberg would be suspended by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it mattered that McCarty was not ejected, Lemieux said,  
``If you look at the outcome of the game, it really does matter. He 
assisted on the winning goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tightly officiated game featured a rash of penalties even  
before the two five-minute calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew before the game they were going to call a lot because  
of what happened before in the series,'' Forsberg said, referring 
to the blood feud that has characterized this series since the 1996 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit coach Scotty Bowman did not fault either Forsberg or  
McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think Forsberg did it intentionally, and I  
don't think Darren did either,'' Bowman said. ``He went into 
Shanahan pretty hard, but I don't think Forsberg's intent was to 
really hit him like that. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit backup goalie Bill Ranford, idle since April 14, was  
thrust into the starting role Friday night because of Chris 
Osgood's lingering knee injury and performed superbly, posting 37 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman was coy about whether Ranford would start in Game 2.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chris practiced (Saturday) and looked about the same as he did  
(Friday),'' Bowman said. ``It's a tough injury because he hasn't 
practiced. Then, if he practices, he might hurt it. But he hasn't 
hurt it so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his availability on Sunday, Osgood said, ``Maybe.  
Doubtful. I would think maybe Tuesday (for Game 3). It's tough when 
you don't play, but it's easier when you know that you have a guy 
that can play like Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, acquired by Detroit on March 23 from Tampa Bay, said it  
felt good to ``get the start and know that you're in the game, 
especially when there was such a long layoff for myself. And the 
team had almost 10 days off (since a first-round sweep of 
Anaheim).''

<TEXT>
<P>
	For the third straight year, the New York Knicks and Miami Heat  
are facing each other in a first-round series. Neither side wants a 
repeat of the first two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two series, I guess it was a boxing match -- a rumble  
in the jungle, or whatever it was,'' Knicks guard Chris Childs 
said. ``It's hard to play a basketball game when you've got bodies 
on bodies without getting into a skirmish, but I think cooler heads 
will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, four Knicks were suspended for leaving the bench  
to join in a scuffle. Miami won that series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Miami's Alonzo Mourning and New York's Larry Johnson  
were suspended for fighting. New York prevailed in five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys should have learned their lessons and how suspensions  
hurt their seasons,'' Miami forward P.J. Brown said. ``I'd be very 
surprised if there was any of that stupid stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also beginning today are Detroit-Atlanta, Sacramento-Utah and  
Phoenix-Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's games are Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San Antonio,  
Houston-Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if there was a physical confrontation  
-- pushing and shoving,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ``But I'd be 
surprised if it went beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are almost mirror images, even though Riley left New  
York four years ago. Riley protege Jeff Van Gundy kept the system 
when he became Knicks coach, and the similarities only lend 
intensity to the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Patrick Ewing appeared ready to go, although his sore  
left Achilles' tendon will be a question throughout the series. The 
7-footer took part in Friday's one-hour practice before the Knicks 
left for South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what he did, he looked all right,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has barely had time to catch its breath before the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing an overtime game Wednesday night at Philadelphia  
and returning to Detroit in the wee hours Thursday, the Pistons 
turned right around and practiced Friday morning before traveling 
to Atlanta for Game 1 of a best-of-5 series against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where the homecourt (advantage) really helps out these  
teams early is that it's a travel day that they don't have to throw 
in,'' NBC analyst Doug Collins said. ``And I think that's vital. 
When you don't have the preparation time, it really limits how much 
you can get involved with your team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect a high-scoring Pistons-Hawks series. The Hawks  
allowed only 83.4 points per game -- lowest in the league -- while 
the Pistons also ranked among the defensive leaders at 86.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a good defensive team,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said.

I did,'' Karl Malone said. ``We grew up with strong coaches and 
different players to look up to than the guys do now. It's a very 
different time, and you can see that when John plays some of the 
younger kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Phoenix-Portland, the teams have been fixtures in the

17 straight times and Phoenix 11. The last time they met, the Suns

</P>
<P>
	The Blazers have lost in the first round of the playoffs the  
last six years, but they didn't have homecourt advantage in any of 
those series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a sense of urgency,'' Portland guard Isaiah Rider  
said. ``It's a sense of, we want to win, rather than we're happy to 
be here. Now we realize that we're favored to win. We're supposed 
to win. So it's time to take care of business.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Satirizes Clinton on SNL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky poked fun and took a shot at  
President Clinton during a ``Saturday Night Live''appearance on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern appeared in a skit as ex-President  
Clinton's Malibu housemate in 2001. Clinton, portrayed by actor 
Darell Hammond, is about to slip out for lunch with Vernon Jordan 
when Lewinsky arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond gives Lewinsky a slightly lewd embrace and asks about  
her day at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone gets so mad at me when I turn the wrong letters,''  
Lewinsky replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond, dressed in a bathrobe, gives Lewinsky a gift: a copy of  
``Leaves of Grass.'' Lewinsky points out that he's already given 
her the book a couple of times already. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond tells Lewinsky that he has to get going, and Lewinsky is  
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you trust me?'' he asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``In your dreams, you big creep,'' Lewinsky replies, followed by  
the traditional show-opener: ``Live from New York, it's Saturday 
night!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though word had slipped out that Lewinsky had attended  
rehearsals this week, NBC refused to say whether she would be on 
the show. Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was host and Ricky Martin was 
musical guest.

<HEADLINE>  Don't Blink, It's NBA Playoff Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the third straight year, the New York Knicks and Miami Heat  
are facing each other in a first-round series. Neither side wants a 
repeat of the first two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two series, I guess it was a boxing match -- a rumble  
in the jungle, or whatever it was,'' Knicks guard Chris Childs 
said. ``It's hard to play a basketball game when you've got bodies 
on bodies without getting into a skirmish, but I think cooler heads 
will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, four Knicks were suspended for leaving the bench  
to join in a scuffle. Miami won that series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Miami's Alonzo Mourning and New York's Larry Johnson  
were suspended for fighting. New York prevailed in five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys should have learned their lessons and how suspensions  
hurt their seasons,'' Miami forward P.J. Brown said. ``I'd be very 
surprised if there was any of that stupid stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also beginning today are Detroit-Atlanta, Sacramento-Utah and  
Phoenix-Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's games are Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San Antonio,  
Houston-Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if there was a physical confrontation  
-- pushing and shoving,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ``But I'd be 
surprised if it went beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are almost mirror images, even though Riley left New  
York four years ago. Riley protege Jeff Van Gundy kept the system 
when he became Knicks coach, and the similarities only lend 
intensity to the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Patrick Ewing appeared ready to go, although his sore  
left Achilles' tendon will be a question throughout the series. The 
7-footer took part in Friday's one-hour practice before the Knicks 
left for South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what he did, he looked all right,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has barely had time to catch its breath before the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing an overtime game Wednesday night at Philadelphia  
and returning to Detroit in the wee hours Thursday, the Pistons 
turned right around and practiced Friday morning before traveling 
to Atlanta for Game 1 of a best-of-5 series against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where the homecourt (advantage) really helps out these  
teams early is that it's a travel day that they don't have to throw 
in,'' NBC analyst Doug Collins said. ``And I think that's vital. 
When you don't have the preparation time, it really limits how much 
you can get involved with your team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect a high-scoring Pistons-Hawks series. The Hawks  
allowed only 83.4 points per game -- lowest in the league -- while 
the Pistons also ranked among the defensive leaders at 86.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a good defensive team,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said.  
``Offensively, we've got to move the ball. We don't have a 
superstar like Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal) that we can throw it to. Our 
shot selection has to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kings-Jazz series, the most intriguing matchup is at

stalwart John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton is the key to Utah's businesslike approach, while

<HEADLINE> Mark Tuinei Remembered by Friends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADDISON, Texas (AP) -- Mark Tuinei was a big guy with an even  
bigger heart who did all he could to make others around him laugh 
and enjoy life, several of his former Dallas Cowboys teammates said 
during a memorial service Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei was found in a car outside his home early Thursday and  
could not be revived. The 39-year-old former offensive lineman 
retired after the 1997 season, his 15th, because of knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Stories about the Tuinei doing or saying something funny on the  
golf course, in the locker room, on the field and during post-game 
parties at his house lightened the mood of the 1 1/2-hour service. But 
plenty of tears were shed as his warmth and generosity were 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad my children knew Mark, but I feel cheated that they  
won't know him longer,'' former teammate Kevin Gogan said. ``Mark 
sharpened all of us. He made our lives better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei overcame a rough upbringing in  
Hawaii by devoting himself to football, but he was no instant 
success. He made the Cowboys in 1983 as an undrafted free agent on 
the defensive line, then became an offensive starter in 1987 and 
eventually anchored a line that helped win three Super Bowls in the 
1990s. He made the Pro Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei recently had arranged to become an assistant coach at his  
old high school in Honolulu. His wife, Pono, was already there and 
he was planning to join her this weekend. The couple had no 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pono told us last night, `Keep him in your heart.' It can't be  
said any purer,'' fullback Daryl Johnston said. ``There's a void in 
our lives that's not going to be filled, but we've got memories 
we're never going to forget. He made an impact on all of our 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's cause of death has yet to be determined. Collin County  
medical examiner William Rohr is awaiting results of toxicology 
tests, which could be done by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei is believed to have spent his final night in Dallas  
partying with friends. A friend who discovered Tuinei slumped in 
his car early Thursday told a 911 operator that Tuinei ``stopped 
breathing I guess it was last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The caller identifies himself on the tape as Nicky. Cowboys  
backup fullback Nicky Sualua reportedly was with Tuinei the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Sualua was among more than 30 current and former  
Cowboys players and coaches who attended the service at a private 
Christian school. Team owner Jerry Jones, quarterback Troy Aikman 
and running back Emmitt Smith and retired greats Harvey Martin and 
Drew Pearson also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of Tuinei with a variety of friends and former  
teammates were displayed in the auditorium foyer. Four framed items 
surrounded the casket inside the auditorium, including one of his 
Cowboys jerseys and a black-and-white photo of Tuinei posing in a 
crouch in his No. 90 Hawaii jersey. Just before the service, a red 
and orange lei was placed around the corner of the frame. Hawaiian 
flowers stood out among many of the floral arrangements covering 
the stage.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Ends Talks With Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- George Shinn lost his chance to be the man who  
brought Michael Jordan back to the NBA when the retired Chicago 
Bulls great broke off negotiations to buy half-interest in the 
Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by his agent early Saturday, Jordan said  
he withdrew from negotiations not because of price, but because of 
control. In fact, the five-time NBA most valuable player said he 
had offered to buy 100 percent of the Hornets, but was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to my competitive nature and my desire to be actively  
involved in all aspects of ownership, the issue of control became 
paramount to me.'' Jordan said. ``Although George was willing to 
let me manage basketball operations, he was not willing to yield 
decision-making authority in other major business areas relating to 
the Hornets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn had estimated the market value of the Hornets at $160  
million. For the amount of money he would spend buying into the 
Hornets, Jordan said he ``could not become comfortable without 
having ultimate decision-making authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn has been an owner since the Hornets were founded 11 years  
ago, the past 10 years as sole owner. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't seek sale of the team he bought for the 1988 expansion  
franchise fee of $32.5 million. He sought to bring in Jordan as a 
partner at the request of NBA commissioner David Stern and after 
suffering several public relations problems in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a North Carolinian, owning the Hornets and bringing  
championship basketball to the fans of the Carolinas has been my 
No. 1 goal in recent months,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Hornets have done well on the court, recording seven  
straight .500 or better seasons, Shinn has refused to agree to big 
contracts to keep star players. In the past four years, trades 
prompted by contract concerns have sent away Alonzo Mourning, 
Kendall Gill, Larry Johnson and Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the court, Shinn is under investigation for sexual assault  
stemming from a 1997 incident. He has agreed to divorce his wife of 
22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn and Stern declined to comment Friday at a meeting of the  
NBA's Board of Governors in New York. The team declined comment. 
Jordan's agent, David Falk, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's potential involvement with the Hornets had created  
great interest locally and nationally. He grew up in Wilmington, 
played college basketball at North Carolina and went on to become 
the NBA's leading career scorer, while pacing the Bulls to six 
league championships before retiring this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte business, civic and government leaders believed that  
Jordan's partial ownership would make it easier to land taxpayer 
approval for a new downtown arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Johnson, chief executive officer of Black Entertainment  
Television, said earlier this year he was interested in the 
Hornets, but only if he could buy 100 percent.

<HEADLINE>  United 2, MetroStars 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roy Lassiter had a goal and an assist as D.C.  
United snapped a three-game losing streak Saturday afternoon with a 
2-1 victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory allowed United (4-3) to avert its first four-game  
losing streak since dropping the opening four games of the 
inaugural MLS season in 1996 and prevented the franchise's first 
three-game skid at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars mustered little early offense against United  
goalkeeper Tom Presthus, who didn't make his first save until seven 
minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Nansha Kalonji tallied in the second half for New York-New  
Jersey (3-4), which has dropped three in a row overall and three 
straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter's team-high seventh goal of the year gave United a 1-0  
lead in the sixth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Moreno, the trailer on a 3-on-1 break started by Lassiter,  
made it 2-0 in the 57th minute. From the right side, he shot 
Antonio Otero's short pass into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalonji, a halftime substitution for Sorber, scored in the 75th  
minute. He stumbled over the ball at the top of the penalty area 
but still flicked a shot past Presthus, breaking a scoreless streak 
of 319 minutes in regulation time with his first MLS goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalongi nearly tied the game with eight minutes left, but his  
header from 12 feet out was snared by Presthus.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic-GTE Merger Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved a merger plan  
that would create the nation's largest local phone company, but 
only on condition that Bell Atlantic and GTE sell off overlapping 
wireless mobile systems in nine states, Justice officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would be even bigger than  
the planned merger of regional Bell companies SBC Communications 
Inc. and Ameritech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is now reviewing the plan  
and has raised some concerns involving GTE's Internet and 
long-distance holdings. Several state public utility commissions 
also must approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	To win Justice Department approval, Bell Atlantic and GTE agreed  
to divest themselves of overlapping wireless systems in 65 markets 
in a consent decree filed Friday in federal court in Washington. 
Justice officials said the agreement would resolve their concerns 
that the deal as originally planned would substantially reduce 
competition, lower quality and raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree won't become final until a judge approves it.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the largest divestiture packages involving a  
merger ever required by the department's Antitrust Division,'' 
officials said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wireless mobile telephones are increasingly becoming an  
important part of everyday life for an ever-growing number of 
Americans, and we rely on competition to ensure that customers get 
the lowest prices as well as features and rate plans that best fit 
their plans,'' said Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general in 
charge of the antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the original plan would have led to  
a loss of head-to-head competition in wireless mobile telephone 
services in 65 markets that have a total population of more than 25 
million. The divestitures would include the major metropolitan 
areas of Chicago, Houston, Richmond, Va., and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``In four of the markets, Bell Atlantic has ownership interest  
in one cellular system and GTE has an ownership interest in the 
other,'' the department's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 46 of these markets, GTE has an ownership interest in one  
of the cellular systems and PrimeCo -- a firm that is 50 percent 
owned by Bell Atlantic -- owns one of the personal communications 
services wireless businesses,'' it said. ``In addition, GTE is 
acquiring 15 cellular systems from Ameritech in a recently 
announced acquisition, and PrimeCo owns the PCS wireless business 
in those 15 markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's general counsel said the company knew it would  
have to deal with the companies' wireless overlaps when it 
announced the merger in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decree gives us full flexibility to clear wireless  
conflicts by disposing of either cellular or PCS properties,'' said 
James R. Young, who also is a Bell Atlantic executive vice 
president. ``We have time to resolve wireless conflicts in an 
orderly way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decree calls on Bell Atlantic and GTE to complete  
divestitures of overlapping wireless businesses they either already 
own or will own within 180 days of closing the deal. If they fail 
to do this, the businesses must be turned over to a trustee chosen 
by the Justice Department.
