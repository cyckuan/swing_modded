<HEADLINE> Study: Parties Driving Attack Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Candidates let their political parties do much
of the dirty work in TV advertising, according to a new study that
documents the pervasive use of unregulated and increasingly popular
''issue ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 20 percent of the ads paid for by candidates for Congress
in 1998 attacked their opponents, compared with 60 percent of those
by political parties, according to the study being released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice at New
York University School of Law, an organization that advocates
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on ''issue ads,'' which avoid campaign finance
laws by stopping short of telling viewers how to vote. There are no
limits on the donations that pay for these ads, and interest groups
don't have to say who the donors are.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of these ads were paid for by political parties, with
interest groups airing the rest, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study also concluded that one in four ads failed to clearly
and legibly identify its sponsors, and ''were therefore in
violation of federal disclosure regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our study shows that campaign practices are circumventing laws
designed to protect the integrity of elections, as parties and
outside groups increasingly exploit technicalities to make
long-standing regulations meaningless,'' said E. Joshua Rosenkranz,
president of the Brennan center.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on an analysis of 2,100 political ads aired
in the largest 75 media markets, covering 194 House and Senate
races.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Troops Push Into Eritrea  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKOMBIA, Eritrea (AP) -- Troops, artillery pieces and fuel
tankers poured through this once-bustling market town Wednesday as
Ethiopian troops pushed deep into Eritrea on the sixth day of a
massive offensive to end a two-year border conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate objective was Barentu, 25 miles north of the
border and the command center of Eritrea's army in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea said late Wednesday that its troops had withdrawn from
Barentu. A government statement, broadcast on state-run media, said
the town was being evacuated to avoid loss of civilian life and the
total destruction of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian government spokesman Haile Kiros, who accompanied
reporters to the area, said the goal was not to hold the provincial
capital of 25,000 people, but to defeat the opposing army, secure
the territory around the contested border and withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we want to hold it, we cannot afford to,'' he said as
troops returning from the front line, about a dozen miles to the
north, cheered and waved green, yellow and red Ethiopian flags.
''If there is anything Eritrea wants to claim, and as long as they
do not do it militarily, we will have talks and try to solve it
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved an
arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea late Wednesday. It will
be terminated immediately if Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports
that ''a peaceful definitive settlement of the conflict'' has been
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the council will review compliance with the embargo
after 12 months and decide whether it should be extended.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eritrean capital, Asmara, government and aid officials
told The Associated Press that about 200,000 Eritreans had fled
Barentu and the surrounding area, posing yet another humanitarian
crisis in the drought-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the Eritrean government asked local U.N.
officials to seek emergency international aid for Eritreans
displaced by the latest round of fighting that began May 12 with
the Ethiopian drive on the Badme border area southeast of Barentu.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Nhongo, the U.N. resident coordinator for Eritrea, said
the government had requested 700 tons of high-energy biscuits, 150
tons of milk powder and 15 tanker truckers to carry water.
</P>
<P>
   There were no civilians to be seen in Tokombia, only donkeys and
cows that wandered forlornly through the main square of the dusty,
wind-swept town.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers emerged from shops carrying clothing, shoes, soft
drinks, tea and food items, but a 22-year-old company commander
denied they were looting.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people have been fighting the enemy,'' said Abdu Said.
''If you see a lot of these things all over the place, it happened
during the fighting. By nature and by training, we do not go for
looting places.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the artillery pieces seen were four mobile rocket
launchers, with an effective range of 25 miles, loaded and ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Abdu predicted the war would end in a short time after the
Eritrean invaders had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In Lisbon, the 15-member European Union, one of the major aid
donors to both nations, called for an immediate stop to the
fighting and an unconditional resumption of frustrated peace talks
sponsored by the Organization of African Unity. Portugal holds the
current six-month EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out in May 1998 when Eritrea occupied Badme. But
Haile said the border issue was a ''secondary'' issue. He blamed
Eritrea for trying to put a stranglehold on the economic life of
Ethiopia, which became landlocked after Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia in 1993 and kept the Red Sea ports.
</P>
<P>
   Most Eritreans view the war as a David-versus-Goliath contest
with the larger Ethiopia, with an estimated population of 61.7
million, determined to dominate upstart Eritrea, population 4
million.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt to Release N.M. Fire Report  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt could
face the white-hot anger of Los Alamos' residents when he visits on
Thursday to explain how a government-ordered brush-clearing fire
raged out of control and destroyed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I think about it, I get very angry. It's ludicrous. There's
no reason any of us should have lost our homes under these
circumstances,'' said Tory Temple, 24, whose parents lost their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt is expected to release a preliminary report on what went
wrong with a fire that was set May 4 by the National Park Service
to clear out 968 acres of brush in the wilderness. The fire raged
out of control and burned more than 47,000 acres, leaving 405
families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Weaver, the park superintendent who took responsibility for
igniting the blaze, has been placed on leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that if he's guilty, we can get something back.
Everything we owned is gone,'' said Tracie Korth, 29, who is
expecting twins in August. She and her husband lost their rented
home and had no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, nearly 1,300 firefighters battled the blaze
outside of town. Shifting winds pushed the flames toward
already-charred land, giving firefighters a boost. By evening,
officials said fire was 60 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we are very secure right here in Los Alamos,''
Forest Service spokesman Jim Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said close to 1,000 acres have burned on the Baca Ranch, a
majestic 95,000-acre volcanic area the Forest Service plans to
purchase for recreation, such as fishing and hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, families escorted by National Guardsmen made quick
trips into Los Alamos to gather valuables, pets and other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Sandoval, a cardiologist, brought his wife, Mary,
and their six children home for a 30-minute frenzy of packing. Tops
on the list: school books and two parakeets.
</P>
<P>
   Their wood-and-stucco home escaped damage, but around the
corner, a neighbor's house was burned to the foundation. And a home
nearby that the Sandovals had been remodeling also was destroyed.
The Sandovals had hoped to move in by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It backs up right to the forest, and that's why we bought
it,'' Mary Sandoval said. ''It was a beautiful location. It had
really nice pine trees in the back yard, and that's probably what
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire threatened the nation's top nuclear weapons laboratory
and destroyed several portable buildings. The lab's main buildings
were spared.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear was whether smoke from the blaze contained
radiation that may have been set free as flames rolled across the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Eugene
Brezany, said a slight boost in background radiation is expected
any time there is a forest fire. Preliminary results released
Wednesday appear to indicate that those increases are being
captured in air samples, Brezany said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was ready to rage at Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel we should start from here and go forward and not be
laying blame on people,'' said Judy Hutson, 64, who still had no
idea whether her home was still standing. She was denied access to
the area because it had not yet been checked for hazardous waste.

<HEADLINE> Can Americans Adjust Downward?  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CUNNIFF
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans adjust their finances upward much
better than downward. They know how to spend during good times, but
that very tendency causes them hardship when times get tough.
</P>
<P>
   It now tests their ability to withstand higher interest rates,
and all that higher interest rates could mean, such as layoffs,
costlier credit cards, falling stocks and rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   It could also test the image of middle Americans living the good
life, as portrayed in leisure and travel magazines and indicated
statistically by the record percentage of homeowners (68 percent),
and the late-model cars in the driveway (almost 17 million sold
last year).
</P>
<P>
   The question to be answered is how durable are the good times,
and how much they are merely the benefits of low unemployment, easy
credit, rising stocks, unrealistically high expectations, and just
plain good luck.
</P>
<P>
   The question coincides with publication of ''The Fragile Middle
Class'' (Yale University Press) by three professors who view
prosperity as not quite so durable as depicted, mainly because of
debts. Some of our miracle families -- those with ''everything'' --
they say, ''only appear to be afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   They picture thousands of families hauling so heavy a financial
load over thin ice that they could go crashing through. The
precipitators: income interruptions, credit cards and other
consumer debt, accidents and illnesses, divorce, home mortgages.
They refer to ''drowning-by-mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Teresa Sullivan and Jay Lawrence Westbrook of the
University of Texas, and Elizabeth Warren of Harvard, observe that
amid prosperity there is a line of clouds. It could, they say, be
''just another summer squall or a terrible storm headed our way.''
</P>
<P>
   While they didn't necessarily have the Federal Reserve in mind
when they wrote their book, their comments indicate the sensitivity
of the Fed's pursuit of an economic slowdown by raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates, for example, are generally considered
deadly for stocks, which represented almost a third of household
wealth, a total of $13.3 trillion at the end of 1999, a 20
percent-plus gain in one year.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in such assets could deflate the so-called wealth
effect and, in the case of stocks bought with borrowed money,
create financial hardships. In either case, the impact would be
felt in lower sales, profits and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The impact could be equally bad or worse at the lower end of the
financial scale, mainly among those with few skills and only a
tenuous hold on employment. This group would include former welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Should these people be badly affected, it would represent a sad
irony of the economic boom. For years, the lowest 20 percent of the
income scale suffered from minimal gains, but in the latest
five-year period their percentage improvements have exceeded those
of the sectors above them.
</P>
<P>
   While any slowdown of the expansion will mostly be felt in the
pocketbook, its effects may reverberate into the social and
political areas as well. It could, for example, worsen the wealth
gap between whites and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   These are but some of the sensitivities that could be exposed by
continued interest rate increases. While the six increases since
June have had little impact, it has only made the Fed more
hard-nosed.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the big test -- for the Fed, for stocks, for borrowers,
for political leadership, for rich and poor. It's the big test.
After such good times, can the fragile household adjust downward
smoothly?
</P>

<HEADLINE> Campbell Unveils Turnaround Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After posting a third straight quarter of
disappointing earnings, Campbell Soup Co. announced a ''back to
basics'' plan focusing on its primary product with new soup
varieties, more convenient packaging and increased marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Camden-based company, the world's largest soup maker, on
Wednesday reported a 14 percent drop in profits, which they blamed
primarily on a sharp decline in U.S. soup consumption. The company
also warned that if the trend continues, earnings for the year will
likely fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Results in the third quarter are very distressing, completely
unacceptable and unprecedented,'' senior vice president F. Martin
Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive David W. Johnson said the company, which also
makes Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers, Godiva chocolates and
Swanson broths, had let its focus drift away from its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson predicted the turnaround plan, set to begin in July,
will get Campbell back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to discuss the gloom and terror of where we
are, and yet we've got a 70 percent (soup) market share in this
country,'' Johnson told analysts. ''We're not doing too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third fiscal quarter, which ended April 30, Camden-based
Campbell reported net earnings dropped to $139 million, or 32 cents
per share, from $162 million, or 37 cents per share, a year
earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
apparently had forecast earnings per share of 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales declined 6.6 percent, to $1.39 billion from $1.49
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Campbell's soups dropped 9 percent to $927 million in
the quarter, and the earnings contribution from the company's soups
and sauces division plunged 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That division's decline was slightly offset by a 2 percent sales
increase for the biscuits and confectionary division and an 8
percent sales increase for the ''Away from Home'' division, which
sells soups to restaurants, college cafeterias and fast food chains
such as McDonald's and Subway.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to chase too much growth and as a result spread
themselves too thin,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst and managing
director at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ''I expect earnings in fiscal year
2001 to be up only modestly, 6 percent, despite the fact that this
year was horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround campaign will focus on the company's most popular
soups, Chicken Noodle and Tomato. Chicken Noodle will get 20
percent more meat per can. Advertising will ''really exploit'' the
cancer-fighting properties and other health benefits linked to
tomatoes, Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's ''Ready to Serve Soups,'' the noncondensed brands
such as ''Chunky'' and ''Select,'' will be getting easy-open pull
tops. And Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner will be added to the celebrity
team endorsing Campbell products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Campbell has temporarily brought back Johnson, one of
its most successful leaders as president and chief executive
officer, while it searches for a new one. Dale F. Morrison resigned
from the post March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 67, held the same top posts from January 1990 until he
retired in July 1997, a period when Campbell had consistently
strong profit increases and saw its market value more than triple
to more than $22 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cramer Threatens To Ax Fox Show  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- TheStreet.com is threatening to pull its
television show off the Fox News Channel, claiming the cable
network disparaged Jim Cramer, the Web site's co-founder and most
visible commentator.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox said Wednesday the Web company is still under contract
for another year and fully expects the show to continue. The show,
called ''TheStreet.com,'' airs on Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest exchange of blows in a dispute that began in
mid-April when Cramer, in one of his regular appearances,
recommended buying shares of TheStreet.com, in which he owns a 13
percent stake. The shares were trading at around $6 at the time,
well below their high of $48.75 reached last May.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Clarke, CEO of the Web site, said TheStreet.com was
canceling the show because the company was disappointed with Fox's
efforts to expand the reach of the show, and because Fox had
disparaged the company publicly and breached a contract with it.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was referring to an article in the New York Daily News on
April 26 in which a Fox official was quoted as saying ''we do not
approve of the touting of stock for personal gain on the air.''
Clarke said TheStreet.com interpreted that remark to be a new
policy imposed by Fox regarding on-air disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Brandi, vice president for legal affairs at Fox News,
said Cramer remains under contract to do the show for another year.
She dismissed arguments that Fox breached its contract with
TheStreet.com or tarnished the company's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple truth is that Mr. Cramer touted TheStreet.com stock
in an inappropriate manner on the television program,'' Brandi
said. ''TheStreet.com has made unfounded assertions and has put
forth the unfathomable claim that a published newspaper article
permits Mr. Cramer and TheStreet.com to walk away from his and its
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer's remarks on the show had also drawn a rebuke from the
top editor at TheStreet.com. Dave Kansas, in a column published
April 15, wrote: ''I don't like Cramer or anyone else discussing
our stock on the show or on the site. You have to take his view on
this with your own heavy grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Cramer has found himself in hot water
over statements he made on the air. Two years ago CNBC temporarily
suspended him from appearing on the air after questions arose about
comments he made about a stock that he was trading at the time.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp., the parent company of Fox News, has a 1.6 percent
stake in TheStreet.com. The New York Times also owns 6 percent of
the company and operates a joint newsroom with the Web site.
Co-founder Martin Peretz, owner of The New Republic, has an 11.8
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer produces voluminous amounts of commentary about the stock
market in various forms. In addition to his TV appearances and
numerous daily columns on TheStreet.com, he also writes a weekly
column for New York magazine and contributes to Inside.com, a new
media news Web site in which he also has a financial interest.

<HEADLINE> New Heartburn Drug Is Cheaper  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an unusual step to quickly grab market share
for the world's biggest-selling pills, American Home Products Corp.
is pricing its newest heartburn drug 30 percent below its main
rival.
</P>
<P>
   AHP said Wednesday it has decided to sell wholesale a daily dose
of Protonix for $3 compared to $4.14 for AstraZeneca's Prilosec.
Retail prices typically cost about 20 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to compete on price is rare in sale of brand-name
drugs. Instead, drug companies typically focus on the effectiveness
of their drugs in sales pitches to doctors and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We analyzed the market and realized we could provide a safe
product and price it less, that not only would make it competitive
but would enable the health care system to realize savings,'' said
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for Madison, N.J.-based American Home.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Home is trying to capture market share in a crowded
market, so this is not an unreasonable strategy,'' said Bob Kirby,
who follows the pharmaceutical industry for the Edward Jones
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The gastrointestinal drug market is the biggest prescription
drug category. Prilosec alone had more than $5.9 billion in sales
worldwide last year, more than any other prescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices have become a hot-button political issue this year
as Congress looks to extend prescription drug coverage to Medicare
beneficiaries. Drug manufactures say the cost of their products
reflects the expense of discovering and developing new medicines.
But critics contend many high-priced drugs often are no more
effective than cheaper alternatives, such as generic medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say American Home's pricing decision was based on a
need to quickly become established in the highly competitive market
for heartburn drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, a generic version of Prilosec is expected to be
approved in the United States. Generic drugs typically sell for at
least half the cost of brand-name drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Protonix is also the fourth proton-pump inhibitor to be
introduced in the United States. The drugs work by shutting down
the body's mechanism that causes the secretion of excess stomach
acid.
</P>
<P>
   While Protonix is in the same class as Prilosec, TAP's Prevacid
and Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Aciphex, it has not received government
approval for use in treating as many conditions as the other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved Protonix for up to
16 weeks of treatments, including use in cases of nighttime
heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Prilosec, is approved for treatment of heartburn
and for ulcers and related gastrointestinal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors still could prescribe Protonix for related disorders,
but are less likely to do so when a competing drug already has
federal approval for such treatments, said Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AstraZeneca, the maker of Prilosec, said the
extra approved uses of its pill, as well as its history of more
than a decade of use, justifies its price.

<HEADLINE> Kraft CEO Takes Mattel Top Job  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- The new chief of Mattel says one of
his top priorities is to reassure employees that the company is
getting back on track.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to financial woes, the world's biggest toymaker has
been hurt by layoffs, primarily in its Learning Company operations,
and the departure of many key executives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a very inclusive leader. I am a visible leader,'' said
Robert A. Eckert. ''I want to make sure people know I'm the kind of
person who's going to eat with them in the cafeteria, listen to
their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert quit as president and CEO of Kraft Foods to accept the
top job at El Segundo-based Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Jill Barad, who after three turbulent years left the
company in February.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sent Mattel shares 13 percent higher on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert, who has four children ages 8 to 21, said he also saw his
stock rise at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a hero throughout my kids' childhood because I had
access to macaroni and cheese and Lunchables'' packaged cold-cut
meals, he said. ''I've really scored some points in the last couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the task of rebuilding Mattel, most importantly
boosting its battered stock price and lifting depressed earnings
after months of management turmoil and big losses.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert got the job in part because of his success rejuvenating
Kraft brands and introducing successful new products. Although
Mattel's products are different from Kraft's, Eckert finds
similarities in the need to create brand awareness and loyalty in
the consumer marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 23 years at Kraft, the last three as its top executive.
He frequently had been mentioned as a probable successor to
Geoffrey C. Bible, CEO of Kraft parent Philip Morris Companies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I want to see in a CEO coming into this business is
someone with some global branding experience ... someone who is
able to implement some operating efficiencies into the business,''
said Anthony N. Gikas, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has turnaround experience, and it looks like he addresses
all these needs. Certainly the credentials are all in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's board did an extensive search looking for a replacement
to Barad, who spent 21 years at the toymaker. She is credited with
building the Barbie brand from a $320 million U.S. business in 1985
to a $2 billion global brand by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But she left after she reported the company's fourth-straight
quarterly loss, and continued weakness at its Learning Company
division.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel purchased the Learning Company, the maker of Carmen
Sandiego and other software titles, for $3.6 billion earlier in
1999 as part of a bid to strengthen its hand in the growing
interactive toy business. Mattel is now trying to sell the
division.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party boss says looks like Giuliani running  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of the state Conservative Party
says ''it looks more and more'' as if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will
continue in the U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The politically savvy Michael Long said Wednesday he was not
basing his opinion on personal conversations with the mayor -- they
have been at political odds -- but on developments over the past
several days and his conversations with other politicians,
including Republicans leaders from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday there was still no decision from Giuliani on how
he plans to treat his prostate cancer, a decision he has said will
help him determine if he can stay in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, did confirm that
Brendan Quinn, a former top aide to state GOP Chairman William
Powers who is now working for the Giuliani campaign, had been
dispatched to Buffalo to begin preparations for the Republican
state convention that will be held there May 30. That convention is
to nominate a Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''People shouldn't draw any inference from that except that the
campaign is moving forward,'' Teitelbaum said. ''The convention is
in two weeks and we have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that Giuliani has not scrapped plans for a
Senate run, several Republican leaders from across the state have
been invited to join him at a televised town hall forum in
Manhattan tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The estrangement between Long and Giuliani, over the mayor's
continued support of abortion rights and his closeness with Liberal
Party boss Raymond Harding, was in evidence Wednesday night as the
Conservative Party held its annual fund-raising dinner at a
Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974
without Conservative Party backing and the mayor was not even
invited to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never been endorsed by the Conservative Party,'' Long
explained. ''He goes to the Liberal Party's dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp is fond of pointing out that no Democrat has
been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York without Liberal
Party backing since the party was founded more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Long said that among the featured speakers at the Wednesday
night dinner would be Republican Gov. George Pataki, who while a
backer of Giuliani's Senate bid has had chilly relations with the
mayor. Also on the dinner's dais, but not speaking, will be former
Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, the Westchester County Republican who is
seeking Conservative Party backing with Long's blessing for a
Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   That means Pataki could be helping to raise money for a party
that could then spend it against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to the dinner because he's a friend of Mike Long
and because the Conservative Party supports him,'' Pataki
spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said when asked about the governor's
attendance at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to facing cancer, Giuliani is also going through
very public marital woes. On Friday night, just days after
announcing that he and his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover, were
discussing a separation, the mayor took a very public stroll after
dinner with his self-described ''very good friend'' Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Long said that while he thought the mayor would continue to run
for Senate, he also felt ''more and more Republicans want him out''
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the perfect scenario for Mike Long and the Conservative
Party,'' Long said. ''The Quinnipiac poll showed us at this moment
at 5 percent and that's without a campaign yet and without anybody
knowing'' our candidate. ''Some of my own leaders don't know who's
running.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute out Tuesday
had Clinton at 42 percent, Giuliani at 41 percent and DioGuardi at
5 percent among New York's registered voters asked about a possible
three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DioGuardi announced that he had sent letters to
Pataki and all members of the Republican state committee asking
them to get behind his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to GOP leaders, DioGuardi said the ''professional
politicians'' backing Giuliani ''were so dazzled by the lure of
celebrity and big money that they overlooked principles.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, James Buckley was elected to the U.S. Senate from New
York while running on the Conservative Party line in a three-way
race. He was defeated six years later by Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan in a two-way race.

<HEADLINE> Bragman seeks to oust fellow Democrat as New York Assembly speaker  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Assembly Majority Leader Michael
Bragman says he is moving to oust fellow Democrat Sheldon Silver as
speaker of the chamber and to take over the top job himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not going to fail ... I'm absolutely confident,''
Bragman, a Syracuse-area Democrat, told reporters Wednesday at the
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he would formally move against Silver on Monday
when the Assembly reconvenes. The house was briefly in session
Wednesday before Silver sent members home for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, a spokesman for Manhattan Democrat Silver, said
Bragman lacked the support among the chamber's Democrats to oust
Silver. She also distributed a letter from Silver in which he fired
Bragman ''effective immediately'' as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an attempted coup that's failing,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Silver supporters agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no constituency in there to change speakers and the
notion that there are a majority of Democrats who want to do that
is hallucinatory,'' said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman had his own supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside him at a hastily convened news conference was
Queens Democratic Chairman Thomas Manton, a former congressman who
has been at odds lately with Silver. Also on hand was state
Assemblyman Martin Luster, an Ithaca Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Manton said he was not concerned about New York City losing
influence in the Assembly where city Democrats have ruled for
years. No Democrat from traditionally more conservative upstate New
York has been Assembly speaker in more than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Manton called Bragman a ''straight shooter'' who ''certainly is
very knowledgeable about all our state and our local city issues as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queens Democratic boss said that ''although I believe Shelly
Silver is a fine man and a fine public servant, I believe he's lost
the confidence of his members.''
</P>
<P>
   Manton said Assembly members had complained to him about ''too
much centralized control'' in the Assembly and that members
couldn't get sufficient publicity for their favorite issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman appeared to play to such complaints as he declared
Wednesday that he wanted ''to make sure this is a member-driven
house.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, should Bragman become the first upstate Democratic
speaker of the Assembly in modern times it could have a significant
impact on the region. Generally, legislative leaders are very
careful to keep their bases of power well stocked with extra
goodies from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The halls of the state Capitol were sizzling Wednesday when
initial reports spread that Bragman was on the verge of moving
against Silver, possibly even with the help of opposition
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, as the leader of the Assembly's conservative upstate
Democrats, has good relations with many Republican members, but he
denied any collusion with them in the attempt to overthrow Silver.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario had Bragman lining up some fellow Democrats who are
dissatisfied with Silver's leadership and some or all of the
chamber's 51 Republican members to come up with the 76 votes needed
in the 150-member Assembly to elect a new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been strained between Silver and Bragman for some
time over a host of issues, including Bragman's desire to someday
have Silver's job.
</P>
<P>
   More recently there has been tension over Bragman's decision to
get behind the possible 2002 gubernatorial candidacy of state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall. Silver had urged members to stay
neutral for the time being and there has been speculation that
Silver really favors the potential rival candidacy for governor of
federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman was also not among the 24 speakers that addressed the
Democratic state convention Tuesday that nominated Hillary Rodham
Clinton for the U.S. Senate. Silver had much influence over who got
those speaking assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was elected Assembly speaker in 1994. Bragman has been
majority leader that entire time.
</P>
<P>
   The last Albany leader to be deposed was then-state Senate
Majority Leader Ralph Marino, a Long Island Republican, who was
ousted in a 1994 Thanksgiving Day weekend coup led by current
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican. At
the time, Marino's troops insisted Bruno didn't have the votes to
pull off the coup.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jarvis Offered Wizards Job  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan has offered the Washington
Wizards coaching job to St. John's coach Mike Jarvis, TNT said
Wednesday night, although a team source and the Washington Post
knocked down the report.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the Wizards' president of basketball operations, has
said he wants a coach in place by Sunday's NBA draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
   TNT cited a source who said negotiations between Jordan and
Jarvis would begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, a team source, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, told The Associated Press the speculation was premature
and that the team has no plans for an announcement through the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that
Jordan and Jarvis met at length Wednesday, but the job was not
offered, nor were possible terms discussed. The newspaper did cite
several sources who indicated Jordan is close to making an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who coached George Washington in the nation's capital
from 1990-98, is one of five known candidates Jordan has been
considering.
</P>
<P>
   Interim coach Darrell Walker and Golden State assistant Rod
Higgins were ruled out Wednesday when Jordan gave them front-office
jobs. Jordan's former Bulls teammate, John Paxson, pulled himself
out of the running recently when he told Jordan he wanted to remain
in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens, the NBA's career leader in coaching victories,
also interviewed with Jordan, but he didn't help his cause last
week when prematurely indicated that Jordan had offered him the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis reportedly was in the Washington area Wednesday. He still
has a home in the Maryland suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has spent two seasons at St. John's, where he compiled a
53-17 record and took the Red Storm to the NCAA tournament each
year.
</P>
<P>
   At George Washington, Jarvis revitalized the program and in his
first season led the school to its first winning record in eight
years. The Colonials became a regular participant in the NCAA
tournament in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   His task with the Wizards would be more daunting. Washington
hasn't won a playoff game in 12 years and has had four coaches --
Bernie Bickerstaff, Jim Brovelli, Gar Heard and Walker -- in the
last 14 months. The roster includes overpaid veterans Juwan Howard,
Rod Strickland and Mitch Richmond, whose long-term contracts make
it nearly impossible for the team to make major personnel
acquisitions under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan became the president of basketball operations and a
part-owner of the Wizards on Jan. 19 and has been very aggressive
in his mission to turn the franchise around. He practiced with the
team, fired Heard within a few days and this week restructured the
front-office staff.

<HEADLINE> Clinton addresses graduates of Coast Guard academy  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The latest class of Coast Guard
officers started their careers with words of support and promises
of more funding from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's graduation ceremonies at the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy mark the last time Clinton will address a military academy
as their commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the graduates they will play a vital role in
combating terrorism and providing global security, in a new age of
biological warfare and cyber terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your class will play an even larger role in defending and
advancing America's security. It is very important to me, as the
commander in chief, that each and every one of you understand the
threats we face, and what we should do to meet them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would seek $300 million to strengthen
counterterrorism efforts, including increased monitoring of the
Canadian border, expanding forensic examination of forged travel
papers, and new task forces to get local and federal law
enforcement to work together.
</P>
<P>
   The money was part of a strategy to make sure the United States
is ''paying our fair share'' in international affairs, in
cooperation with other nations, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited cooperation with Jordan and Canada to catch an alleged
New Year's Eve bombing plot as an example of the kind of
cooperation the country needs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised in his new budget $376 million more for the
Coast Guard, including money to buy new ships.
</P>
<P>
   The 190 new Coast Guard officers applauded Clinton's message.
</P>
<P>
   ''To get such support from the president is really wonderful,''
said Hai Dang, a cadet from Escondido, Calif. who will be serving
on a cutter that monitors the Alaskan border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Per tradition, the graduates gleefully threw their hats and
epaulets in the air at the end of the ceremony as a symbol of
saying goodbye to their cadet life. Children, including students
from New London, ran onto the field to collect the hats and
epaulets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's half-hour speech, with the Coast Guard cutter Reliance
and the Thames River in the background, included many inside jokes
for cadets. One cadet was a contestant on ''The Price is Right,''
while an instructor had a role on ''Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the Class of 2000's spirit was so high that
opposing schools complained in writing about the cadets' heckling
at soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if any of you got in trouble for that, but
pursuant to long-standing tradition, I hereby grant amnesty to all
candidates marching tours or serving restrictions for such minor
offenses,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Cadet Asheley Bodkin of Dayton, Va., who will be stationed in
Seattle, said the graduation was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was great thing for him to be our graduation
speaker,'' Bodkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The class includes nine graduates from Connecticut, 64 women and
five international students. One graduate, Nour Kabariti of Jordan,
is the first woman to serve in the Jordanian Navy and the first
Arab to graduate from the academy.

<HEADLINE> Federal Inspectors: UConn researchers mistreated and neglected animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- The University of Connecticut has been
cited for mistreating and neglecting its research animals following
the death of five rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal inspectors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture found
repeat violations at the university's animal research facility over
the past two years, including rabbits and pigs penned up in hot
cages without drinking water, The Chronicle of Willimantic reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said UConn was fined $4,500 in 1998 for neglecting
its research animals.
</P>
<P>
   A USDA spokeswoman said federal inspectors made an unannounced
visit to the research facility in March and found structurally
unsound cages, dirty water drains, inadequate shelter from
sunlight, and dirty drinking water receptacles, among other
violations. An inspector returned last week and found some of the
problems still had not been addressed, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith, the university's vice provost for research and
graduate education, told The Chronicle the problems were limited to
just two labs. He said the university is taking steps to see that
the situation is corrected and acknowledged that the latest
violations most probably will result in another fine.
</P>
<P>
   UConn has begun conducting formal training sessions for animal
care technicians and has appointed Herbert E. Whiteley, professor
and head of the department of pathobiology, as interim director of
the Office of Animal Research Services, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The violations and any USDA actions against UConn will not
affect any grants to the animal research center, such as the $5.1
million given by the USDA to the research center in January for the
development of animal vaccines, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an official at Pfizer Inc.'s division of animal
health and biological research told The Chronicle the drug maker
will no longer conduct any animal research projects with UConn
until the university fully complies with the federal Animal Welfare
Act. Randy Leyh, manager of animal and biological research, said
that although the Groton-based company is not involved currently
with any animal research projects with UConn, all future projects
in the animal research area will be suspended until compliance is
met.
</P>
<P>
   UConn currently has approximately 15,000 vertebrate animals, or
about two dozen species, for research purposes. Most of the animals
are rabbits, but there also are cows, goats, pigs, cats, mice and
rats.

<HEADLINE> Va. warden sues newspapers, officials for defamation  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The warden of a Virginia prison where nearly 500
Connecticut
inmates have been transferred claims he has been defamed by two
Connecticut lawmakers, the head of the Bridgeport NAACP chapter and
three newspapers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Young, warden of Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone
Gap, Va., filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday. In it, he claims that
the officials' comments and newspaper articles have depicted him as
a racist who ''not only tolerates but encourages abuse by his
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants are state Sen. Alvin Penn, D-Bridgeport;
state Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven; and Carolyn Nah of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People office
in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Young also sued the Connecticut Post, the New Haven Advocate and
The Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who has served as warden of the maximum security prison
since April 1999, is seeking $13.5 million in damages. His lawsuit
was filed Friday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, co-chairman of the Legislature's Public Safety Committee,
said Wednesday the lawsuit was an attempt to divert attention from
allegations of unsafe conditions at the Virginia prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, about 480 Connecticut inmates have been housed at
Wallens Ridge. Gov. John G. Rowland and correction officials say
the transfers ease overcrowding in Connecticut prisons and break up
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers and inmate advocates say they fear for the safety
of the prisoners, most of whom are minorities. In April, David
Tracy, a 20-year-old inmate from Bridgeport, hung himself in his
cell. In March, three Connecticut inmates were shot with rubber
bullets by guards trying to break up a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give as much validity to that lawsuit as I did to the plan
to send inmates down to Virginia,'' said Penn, who wants a bill
that would bring the inmates home to be considered during next
month's special session of the Legislature. ''I never attacked the
man. I attacked the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Nah was quoted in a Post story which focused on the presence of
Civil War memorabilia in Young's office. She said she never
knowingly made any false statements about the warden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by my comments,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor, who said he hadn't seen the lawsuit and could not
comment on its merits, said the move appears to be in reaction to
tough questions from Connecticut lawmakers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is true about Virginia is they are obviously not
accustomed to being criticized at all,'' he said. ''The idea that a
public official would actually sue legislators or journalists
because he is criticized is an indication someone is not up for the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Toolan, editor of The Courant, said the paper stood by its
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we don't believe we have defamed anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sayers, editor and publisher of the Connecticut Post, said
Wednesday he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Thompson, publisher of the New Haven Advocate, a news and
entertainment weekly, declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Asthma emergency sought in Hartford; other cities also worried  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Environmental groups in Hartford are
joining a growing number of officials and experts worried about the
rapid increase in asthma in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Environmental Justice Network urged city officials
Wednesday to declare an asthma emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The network cited a recent study by the Connecticut Children's
Medical Center showing the asthma rate in Hartford is more than
five times the national average. More than 7,500 Hartford children
were screened, with 41 percent suffering from doctor-diagnosed
asthma, the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't breath. They can't sleep. They can't eat,'' said
Mercedes Gentles, whose three children have asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas in Connecticut and around the country have been
hardest hit by asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frightening,'' said state Rep. Chris Caruso,
D-Bridgeport. ''It's affecting such a large number of the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Bridgeport children brought to emergency rooms for
asthma is twice the state average, Caruso said. He said lawmakers
must reach a consensus to clean up the state's five worst-polluting
power plants and find ways to curb auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma causes obstruction and inflammation of the air passages.
Researchers have not determined why the burden of asthma falls
disproportionately on inner city youths, especially blacks and
Hispanics. But some officials blame environmentally hazardous
projects such as power plants that are often located in cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, about 1,400 children under 15 are hospitalized
for asthma annually, while 6,000 visit emergency rooms, according
to the state Department of Public Health. The department is
identifying high risk populations and is educating the public about
treatment and reducing environmental conditions that may contribute
to asthma attacks, said spokesman William Gerrish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly asthma is a priority for us,'' Gerrish said.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 to 10,000 Americans die annually from asthma, said
Jack Elias, chief of pulmonary and critical care at Yale University
School of Medicine. The disease costs billions of dollars annually
in lost productivity and care and is the number one cause of school
absenteeism, he said.

<P>
   ''I think it's an epidemic,'' Elias said. ''To have a disease
that is this common should be very alarming to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the Pew Environmental Health Commission says the
country should declare a war on asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that war should begin here first,'' said Dr. Mark
Mitchell, president of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental
Justice. ''We feel our urban population are the canaries in the
cage. It's coming here first.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and others want a federal study to determine why the
asthma rate is so high in Hartford. Councilwoman Elizabeth Horton
Sheff promised to support the Network's goals before the council.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven-based Connecticut Voices For Children reported that
one in three Hartford children had asthma in 1994, up from one in
five in 1980. The group cited a 1996 survey indicating that 22
percent of New Haven students were told by a doctor they had
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In Stamford, officials are looking at geographic data to
determine areas where asthma is concentrated, said Anthony Iton,
the city's health director. The next step will be to increase
education and inspect rental properties to determine if conditions
are triggering asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a significant concern,'' Iton said.

<HEADLINE> Rowland executive order designed to curb pollution  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- An executive order designed to cut
emissions from state power plants is being blasted by
environmentalists and lawmakers who unsuccessfully pushed for
stricter pollution regulations in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland on Wednesday issued the order that requires
the state Department of Environmental Protection to develop
regulations to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides at 61 power plants. The regulations must be in place by May
1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said it sets no firm deadlines for implementing
those regulations and lets the state's worst polluters off too
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor and those lawmakers who decided to put big
business profit over the health of the state are now trying to use
this order to cover their deeds,'' said state Rep. Christopher
Caruso, D-Bridgeport. ''The executive order does absolutely
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan covers fossil fuel-fired power plants and large
industrial and commercial boilers, not just the so-called ''Filthy
Five'' plants targeted by the failed legislation. The plants would
be allowed to trade emission ''credits'' from lesser polluters in
an effort to reduce overall smog.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the plan-- put together by lawmakers, utility
regulators and environmental officials -- would cut the emission of
sulfur dioxide by 30 percent and nitrogen oxides by 20 percent by
the summer of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the plan cuts air pollution while ensuring
Connecticut has enough power to get through another hot summer.
Utility customers also would not have to pay higher prices, at
least until the first price freezes of deregulation end in December
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Connecticut will benefit from cleaner air, but
they'll do so in a way that will keep the lights on and not
needlessly bankrupt companies,'' said Sen. Thomas Herlihy,
R-Simsbury, ranking member of the Legislature's Energy and
Technology Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said they will draw up a plan of their own, one
that includes clean air advocates they say were shut out of
Rowland's measure. Caruso hopes to revisit the issue in a special
legislative session next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legislative working group still will meet, in the interest
of bringing all the stakeholders to the table to resolve, once and
for all, this important environmental issue,'' House Speaker Moira
Lyons, D-Stamford, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, environmentalists have fought for a
reduction in nitrogen and sulfur oxide levels at plants in Norwalk,
Bridgeport, New Haven, Middletown and Montville.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars if the plants
were forced to shut down, the power companies launched a feverish
lobbying campaign at the Capitol that prevailed two weeks ago when
no cleanup action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Clean-air advocates had pushed for legislation that would have
required reduced emissions by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply buying more and more time and doing what the
industry wants,'' said Betty McLaughlin, an advocate with the
Connecticut Coalition for Clean Air. ''Three years to write
regulations is three years of doing nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Dominican Presidency Being Decided  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- As vote counting in the
Dominican presidential election neared an end Wednesday, populist
opposition leader Hipolito Mejia was on the verge of receiving the
majority needed to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results were not yet clear, what was certain, was
that voters had rejected an incumbent administration whose
free-market economic policies, critics claim, have yet to benefit
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a stab at the current politicians!'' said Rogelio
Cruz, a well-known Roman Catholic priest and activist who works in
the capital's poor neighborhoods. ''Although the image (they) are
selling abroad is of prosperity, the people are not living in
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, officials said Mejia had 49.86 percent, with
all but 18 of the 11,422 polling stations counted. Danilo Medina of
the governing Dominican Liberation Party had 24.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Balaguer, the 93-year-old former president who ran on
his Social Christian Reformist Party ticket, won 24.61 percent of
the vote, despite blindness and frailty that forced him to vote
from inside his car on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Mejia fails to get more than 50 percent of the vote, Balaguer
and Medina were expected to join forces in an attempt to defeat him
in a second round on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   After working all night, election officials halted vote-counting
at noon to give workers a rest. They were expected to resume late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, Mejia said he was convinced he had won.
He credited his populist campaign with uniting the Revolutionary
Party and drawing out voters who had felt forgotten by politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked for votes everywhere,'' he said. ''I looked under
rocks, under a shrub, under a yucca tree and the stump of a
plantain tree.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 72 percent of the 4.3 million people registered to
vote turned out for the elections -- a marked increase over the 1998
congressional elections, which only drew about 48 percent. The 1996
presidential elections attracted a similar 75 percent turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported three election-related deaths on Tuesday. In
Santo Domingo, a 76-year-old woman died of a heart attack during an
alleged scuffle with poll security guards. A man was shot during an
argument over politics in the northwestern town of San Juan de la
Maguana, and another man was stabbed to death during a fight after
voting in the northeastern province of El Seybo.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia and his vice presidential running mate, Milagros Ortiz
Bosch, made an emotional visit Wednesday morning to the grave of
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez -- the former leader of the Dominican
Revolutionary Party who ran unsuccessfully for president three
times.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of people cheered, Mejia and Ortiz Bosch held their
hands over Pena Gomez's tomb, and Mejia addressed his old friend:
''Pena, these hands will be used for the good of the people. They
will not be stained by robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing a majority in Congress and local governments, the
left-leaning Mejia vowed not to let his government succumb to the
gridlock that plagued President Leonel Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I promised, I will do,'' he said. ''I will not be a
person who will be frustration for this society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fernandez administration streamlined the bureaucracy,
privatized state enterprises and opened up the economy to trade and
tourism, leading to annual growth rates of up to 8 percent. But
most people remain poor, per capita income hovers around $2,000 a
year, and allegations of widespread corruption persist.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Balaguer and Medina, meanwhile, said they were
hopeful Mejia would fail to reach the 50 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for the second round,'' said Jose Luis Ramirez,
who sold fritters at a stand outside Balaguer's home in central
Santo Domingo. ''There is no loser yet.''

<HEADLINE> Pangs of Conscience After Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By JERRY SCHWARTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly four decades ago, Americans asked: How could anyone
protect the people who did this? How could they shield the racists
who bombed an Alabama church, murdering four little girls in white
dresses?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, a long time coming, is that they couldn't -- or at
least, they couldn't do it forever.
</P>
<P>
   All of 10,494 days passed between the carnage at Birmingham's
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and Wednesday's arrests of Thomas
Blanton Jr. and Bobby Cherry. The facts of the case never changed
in that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that more evidence has been discovered, or that there
is more prosecutorial motivation that there was 30, 35 years ago,''
says David J. Garrow, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book,
''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says, ''Family members are no longer willing to
cover for people. ... I think it is the moral, ethical burden of
living with that guilt and guilty conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   If Blanton and Cherry are convicted, they will join others who
have been corralled by conscience -- and not their own. Apparently,
a telltale heart beats within the hearing of long-reluctant
witnesses, if not within earshot of the murderers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is happening all across the South. ... You have
people saying, 'I'm not going to my grave with this on my
conscience,''' says Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a leader of the civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Six witnesses came in forward in 1991 to help convict Byron De
La Beckwith in the 1963 murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers;
one said he'd heard him boast, ''Killing that nigger didn't cause
me any more discomfort than our wives have when they have a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly willing witnesses convicted Samuel S. Bowers in 1998 for
ordering the 1966 firebombing murder of Vernon Dahmer; one
overheard him talking about the crime in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And others have already helped put away one defendant in the
Birmingham bombing case -- Robert Edward Chambliss, convicted in
1977. He died in prison eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been a number of important civil rights era cases,
but the fact is this really might be the most important of all,''
says Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing on Sept. 15, 1963, represented ''the watershed
moment of the civil rights movement in the United States,'' Potok
says.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Garrow says, the deaths of Denise McNair, Cynthia
Wesley, Carole Robertson and Addie Mae Collins remain a tragedy
that is even greater than the murder of Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Both Garrow and Potok compare the crime with those committed by
Nazi concentration camp guards who lived quietly in this country
for decades after World War II. Ultimately, they say, justice must
be served.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is so ultimately horrific ... the moral stain of this is
so huge,'' that any secret knowledge of who was responsible had to
weigh heavily on those witnesses, Garrow says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, estranged relatives of Cherry have said
publicly that he talked of helping plant the dynamite. His son,
Thomas Frank Cherry, appeared before a grand jury on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The years in which these witnesses failed to come forward could
hurt the case -- memories fade, evidence is harder to marshal. But
in some ways, the time elapsed might help the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is almost inconceivable that this could have been brought
in a state court successfully'' in 1963, Potok says. Juries in
civil rights cases often acquitted in minutes, and ''any witnesses
who testified against a Klansman in the 1960s were taking their
lives in their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alabama has changed, he says, and Blanton and Cherry will be
tried under today's rules, not yesterday's.
</P>
<P>
   There are other unpunished racial crimes, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Till, 14, was beaten and shot to death on Aug. 28, 1955,
in Money, Miss., after he whistled at a white woman; an all-white
jury took an hour to acquit, but only, the foreman said, because
they stopped to ''drink a pop.'' The two defendants, J.W. Milam and
Ron Bryant, told Look magazine they did it. Bryant is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Oneal Moore, a black sheriff's deputy, was shot to death by
nightriders in Vernado, La., on June 2, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, civil rights
workers, were killed in Philadelphia, Miss., on June 21, 1964.
Eight Klansmen went to prison on federal conspiracy charges, but
the state never brought murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very likely, there will be other cases,'' Potok says. But none
like the Birmingham bombing case. ''There will be no cases of this
magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrow agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the big one,'' he says. ''Period.''

<HEADLINE> Black, White Pirates Said Equal  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pirates have gone down in history as drunken, bloodthirsty
terrors of the high seas who wouldn't think twice about slicing off
a captive's ear or sending him down the plank.
</P>
<P>
   But a close examination by some historians has found that pirate
ships may have been one of the earliest places in modern society
where blacks attained equality with whites. Despite slavery on the
mainland, black pirates on the ocean had the right to vote, could
bear arms, got an equal share of the booty and were even elected
captains of predominantly white crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deck of a pirate ship was the most empowering place for
blacks within the 18th-century white man's world,'' said Kenneth
Kinkor, project historian at Expedition Whydah, a museum on Cape
Cod, Mass., that houses artifacts from the first documented pirate
ship discovered in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates even raided slave ships and plantations and gave blacks
a chance for freedom by joining them, said Kinkor, who contends
pirate brutality has been exaggerated by Hollywood movies and
popular lore.
</P>
<P>
   Historians are divided over whether blacks fared much better as
pirates, however. W. Jeffrey Bolster of the University of New
Hampshire, for instance, acknowledged that black pirates enjoyed
some privileges: One was Captain Kidd's quartermaster and several
belonged to Blackbeard's crew.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolster also said many pirates were psychopathic criminals
who ''happily raped captive African women'' and kept black slaves
on board to do the most onerous jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to say these white pirates always accepted the black
men as equals is nonsense,'' Bolster said.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Marcus Rediker of the University of Pittsburgh, author
of the 1987 book ''Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, insist
pirates practiced a type of democracy revolutionary for the times,
nearly two centuries before slavery ended in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Golden Age of Piracy'' lasted from 1680 to 1725, with at
least 10,000 pirates roaming the seas at its height, according to
Kinkor, who estimated at least one-third of them were black.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say buccaneers voted on all major decisions, elected
their leaders, split their booty fairly and established
compensation for injured pirates and the families of dead pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic ways extended to blacks, who could escape slavery
and rise to command a ship or an entire fleet, Rediker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could either be a law-abiding slave or an escaped convict
or a pirate with a chance at the golden ring,'' added marine
explorer Barry Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford has found what are believed to be the only pirate ships
in the world discovered to date so far: the Whydah off Cape Cod in
1984, two pirate ships off Venezuela in 1998 and what he believes
is Captain Kidd's ship off the African island of Madagascar last
January.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, experts in North Carolina are scheduled to try and
recover part of the hull of a ship believed to have belonged to
Blackbeard.
</P>
<P>
   On Madagascar's tiny Ste. Marie isle, where Kidd's ship
apparently sank, pirates brought their ''floating democracies'' to
land, said Clifford, establishing a community in about 1680
governed by a constitution that included the right to be free
regardless of color.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds almost like Abraham Lincoln plagiarized it,'' said
Clifford, co-author of the 1999 book ''Expedition Whydah.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite evidence of racial parity, even Kinkor and Rediker don't
think pirates treated blacks as equals solely out of a grand vision
of social justice. They say it also grew out of pragmatism: pirates
needed competent, hardworking deck hands, regardless of skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most ''successful'' pirate ever was Laurens de
Graf, who was one of the buccaneers most feared by the Spanish and
who led a fleet that peaked at 2,000 men, Kinkor said. De Graf
eventually was pardoned by the French, given a minor title of
French nobility and helped found Biloxi, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   In history books, de Graf is described as tall, blonde-haired,
blue-eyed and white. In reality, he was a black escaped slave.
Historians lied about his color because they feared he would serve
as an example to other slaves who also might revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Historians did not want people to know de Graf was black,''
said maritime historian James Nelson of Harpswell, Maine. ''The
thought of a black uprising was the most frightening thing in
colonial America.''

<HEADLINE> Laughing Gas May Help Smokers Quit  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nitrous oxide, the laughing gas used by dentists,
may help smokers kick the habit, according to the results of a
preliminary study presented.
</P>
<P>
   When seven smokers went through a single session of breathing
nitrous oxide, five quit for at least three days. Four were still
tobacco-free when checked a month later.
</P>
<P>
   How does it work? ''That's the million-dollar question,'' said
psychiatrist Dr. Carlo Bayrakdarian of the Weill Cornell Medical
College of New York Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing gas would be just a first step in treatment, to get
over the initial ''hump'' of craving before a person moves on to a
longer-term strategy to stay off tobacco, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bayrakdarian said he did the study after reading about a South
African researcher who was using the gas to prevent alcohol
withdrawal. He presented the results at a meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of treatment, participants avoided smoking beforehand
so they could feel their nicotine craving. Then they breathed
nitrous oxide and oxygen for a maximum of 20 minutes, or just until
their craving was gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three days they kept a diary of their smoking. They
then returned to give a urine sample that was tested to reveal
whether they had lit up.
</P>
<P>
   All seven smokers smoked fewer cigarettes in the three days
after treatment, with an overall decrease of 81 percent,
Bayrakdarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the nicotine dependence center at
the Mayo Clinic, called the result interesting. But he stressed the
idea must be tested in more people, with the gas pitted against a
placebo.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Clot-Busting Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Clot-dissolving drugs routinely given to heart
attack victims don't help patients over 75 and may actually raise
their risk of dying, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were a surprise: There is widespread belief that
clot-busting drugs known as thrombolytics benefit older patients as
well as younger patients, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Younger patients clearly benefit from thrombolytics, but the
one-third of heart attack patients who are older than 75 are
unlikely to have any benefit and may be at higher risk of death,''
said Dr. David Thiemann, a cardiologist who led the study based on
data from 7,864 Medicare patients ages 65 to 86.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that patients over 75 who were given the
clot-busters were nearly 40 percent more likely to die within 30
days of treatment than patients who did not get the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate for patients treated with thrombolytics was 18
percent, compared with 15.4 percent for the other patients.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of dying was related to bleeding, strokes or a ruptured
heart, according to the study in the latest issue of Circulation, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association and the American College of Cardiology have
cautioned that the safety and effectiveness of thrombolytics in
older patients have yet to be proven.
</P>
<P>
   Two other large studies conducted by Harvard and Yale have
examined the same question and come up with similar findings,
Thiemann said.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the paper in Circulation, Harvard
Medical School's Dr. John Ayanian, who was not involved in the
study, said the findings support the use of another clot busting
treatment -- angioplasty -- in which a balloon is used to clear a
blockage in a blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Previous randomized trials have suggested benefits of primary
angioplasty over thrombolytic therapy in the elderly,'' Ayanian
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seek To Block Tumor Cells  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers working with mice reported today that they have
identified a way to block a chemical pathway that tumor cells use
to spread to surrounding tissues and organs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said closing the pathway offers a promising approach
to managing cancer and limiting metastasis, or the circulation of
cancer cells through the body.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the pathway has been manipulated in experiments in mice
only. The research was conducted by scientists at Columbia
University and published in today's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could lead to therapies that block the transition of a
tumor from benign to malignant and keep local disease in check,''
said pathologist Lance Liotta of the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments at Columbia focused on an important
characteristic of tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
   Both benign and malignant tumors grow in uncontrolled ways, but
malignant cells invade surrounding tissue and distant organs. If
those cells circulate throughout the body, they can spawn new and
more vigorous tumors that defy treatment even after the original
tumor has been surgically removed or killed by radiation and
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe the malignant cells hijack the body's own
chemical transport system.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found that the pathway uses two specific
proteins: amphoterin and RAGE. RAGE is involved in many kinds of
cell growth. Amphoterin is found on a type of fast-growing brain
cell known as a neurite.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Anne Marie Schmidt at Columbia implanted cancerous
tumors in mice. In experiments, they blocked the combined activity
of the two proteins with specific combinations of antibodies. The
tumors stopped growing and circulation of malignant cells dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said any potential cancer therapy based on the
experiments probably would be used in combination with other
treatments that cut off a tumor's blood supply and boost the
patient's immune system.

<HEADLINE> Study Recommends Waking Patients  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patients on life support get out of intensive care sooner if
doctors cut off their sedatives long enough for them to wake up
each day, according to a study in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often, these kind of simple, straightforward, pragmatic
solutions have more to do with improving outcomes in patients than
high-tech, expensive, arcane interventions,'' said Dr. John Heffner
at the Medical University of South Carolina, who wrote an editorial
accompanying the study.
</P>
<P>
   University of Chicago researchers followed 128 very sick
patients breathing through mechanical ventilators.
</P>
<P>
   Such devices push air into the lungs through a tube placed down
the throat. But they can make patients uncomfortable and fearful,
so sedatives are routinely delivered intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   These calming drugs can accumulate and put patients in a torpor
for days. A groggy patient cannot be trusted to start breathing on
his own and cannot be properly tested for neurological problems, so
sedation can extend the stay in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the patients with daily breaks from sedation
stopped using a ventilator after an average of five days and left
intensive care within a week. The other patients got off the
ventilator in seven days and were out of intensive care in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The extra time in intensive care exposes patients longer to such
risks as pneumonia, blood clots and lung injury from ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They end up being stuck on the ventilator, and being on a
ventilator in intensive care is not a safe place to be,'' said Dr.
Jesse Hall, a critical care physician who took part in the study.

<HEADLINE> Journal Editor Urges Restrictions  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   The editor of one of the world's premier medical journals has
written a withering critique of the research system, saying science
is being compromised by the growing influence of industry money.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of The New England Journal of
Medicine, joins a wave of critics who say an explosion of research
funding from drug and medical-equipment makers has added commercial
concerns to the scientific process.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the boundaries between industry and academic medicine
become as blurred as they are now, the business goals of industry
influence the mission of medical schools in multiple ways,'' she
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   She raised the questions in today's issue of the journal in an
editorial headlined ''Is Academic Medicine for Sale?'' The
Boston-based journal is widely regarded as medicine's most
distinguished periodical.
</P>
<P>
   Angell, the journal's outgoing editor, acknowledged that rising
research funding from biotechnology and drug companies has helped
lead to dramatic advances against many diseases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, medical schools have struck a
''Faustian bargain'' with industry.
</P>
<P>
   She said industry representatives are lavishing giveaway
products, other gifts and trips on doctors. She said speaking and
consulting fees, along with other compensation, are subtly swaying
researchers toward more favorable findings on products of companies
making the payments.
</P>
<P>
   She said researchers may also be focusing on trivial -- but
marketable -- differences between similar drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As a remedy, she said major medical schools should adopt a
strong, common code for conflicts of interest, banning some writing
and speaking arrangements and stock ownership in companies making
the products under study. She said drug companies should not
promote products and offer gifts to students and doctors at
teaching hospitals. And she suggested that researchers' consulting
income could go into a common research pool.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Werner, a lawyer for the Washington-based Biotechnology
Industry Organization, said disclosure of financial ties and
government regulation sufficiently protect the public. He said
companies have every reason to shun poor research because of
liability and the bad publicity that could result from a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Drazen, an asthma researcher at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, has been named to replace Angell, probably later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen's own ties to the drug industry came under scrutiny Feb.
24 when the journal disclosed that it had published 19 articles on
drug treatments without disclosing the authors' industry links. One
of the authors was Drazen, who had accepted grants or an advisory
role at eight companies.
</P>
<P>
   Angell pointed to a study of depression treatments in today's
issue with an unusually long list of potential conflicts. Its lead
author, Brown University psychiatrist Dr. Martin Keller, said in an
interview that industry money was badly needed for the large study
of 681 patients at 12 sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said the personal integrity of scientists helps resist
conflicting pressures, and he suggested ''a balance between what's
reasonable and fair -- and what would be so overly strict that it
would be restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   His study was funded by drug maker Bristol-Meyers Squibb.
Company spokeswoman Tracy Furey said she does not feel that
providing research grants necessarily influences the outcome of
medical research. Neither she nor Keller would discuss details of
personal compensation to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the editor's message in the same issue, journal
correspondent Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer of the University of
California at San Francisco said 70 percent of money for clinical
tests of drugs and devices now comes from industry, not government.
</P>
<P>
   David Rothman, director of the Center for Society and Medicine
at Columbia University, said researchers used to face heavier
pressure to fudge research for reputation rather than for wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is more benign to be after fame than after fortune.
You're less likely to cut corners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University, with some of the most stringent restrictions
on conflict of interest, is now under pressure from some
researchers to ease rules, acknowledged Margaret Dale, an associate
dean at its medical school. She said they argue that there is a
potential even for a school like Harvard to lose researchers to
more laissez-faire schools.

<HEADLINE> House: Limit Kosovo Involvement  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The future of U.S. peacekeeping in Kosovo goes
before the Senate after the House voted to end involvement in the
Yugoslav province next year if Europeans don't chip in for more of
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials warned that any attempt to set
a date for withdrawal of American troops could lead to an erosion
of NATO solidarity and another eruption of violence in ethnically
torn Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interpreted in the Balkans as a sign of weakness,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday in a speech to
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ''We cannot afford that in a region
where weakness attracts vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was to vote today on an amendment sponsored by Sens.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., that would undo a
provision in a military construction spending bill setting a July
1, 2001, date for withdrawal of U.S. ground troops unless the
president seeks and Congress approves an extension.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal provision, authored by Sens. John Warner, R-Va.,
and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., also would cut extra funds for the Kosovo
operation unless the president certifies that European nations are
paying their fair share.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that setting a deadline would result in more than a
year of ''dangerous uncertainty'' and would be ''inconsistent with
what we have struggled so hard to achieve in the Balkans, which is
stability in a relatively peaceful environment.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,900 U.S. troops are in the NATO-led, 37,000-strong
peacekeeping force, which has been stationed in Kosovo since the
78-day air war to drive Yugoslav troops out of the province ended
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said earlier this week he would
recommend that President Clinton veto the Senate bill, which
includes $8.6 billion for military construction and $4.7 billion in
emergency spending for Kosovo and anti-drug efforts in Colombia, if
it contained the Warner-Byrd language.
</P>
<P>
   He said an artificial deadline for withdrawal could lead to a
renewal of violence between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians and
''call into question NATO's viability.''
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday voted 264-153 to require the president by
next April 1 to certify that European allies have met their
financial commitments to the Kosovo operation. If he can't, the
president must within 30 days submit a plan for the withdrawal of
U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our fighters flew 70 percent of the sorties over Kosovo. Our
military took the greatest risk. We've fulfilled our financial
obligations. Our allies, unfortunately, have not,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chief sponsor of the amendment to a
defense authorization bill, said European allies promised $402
million for the rebuilding of the war-torn province, but so far
have only provided $93 million.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the debate in both chambers touched on the feelings
of many lawmakers that Congress is being left out of decisions on
the deployment of U.S. troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like his predecessors in the White House, has insisted
he doesn't need congressional approval to send troops to
peacekeeping and other multinational missions. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, who hopes to succeed Clinton in the White House, also has
opposed the Senate measure as ''legislative overreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress, pointing to their constitutional authority
over federal spending, disagree. Congress demanded a voice in the
Persian Gulf War and has sought, largely unsuccessfully, to put
limits on U.S. military actions in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, the Senate's leading constitutional authority, said his
aim was not to force U.S. troops out of Kosovo but to make the
president justify the mission there. ''What we are trying to do is
take back the authorities of the Congress which have been usurped
by the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, a Democratic
expert on defense, said it would be ''foolish and
counterproductive'' for Congress to intervene with a date certain
for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is undermining the ability of the commander in chief -- you
know we can only have one president at a time,'' he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Women Rise To Power in Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- When Taiwan's newly elected vice president
stepped out of a black limousine and faced a long line of generals,
the men looked bewildered and hesitated for a moment before raising
their hands in a crisp salute.
</P>
<P>
   The awkward response to Annette Lu was understandable: The brass
was saluting a female leader for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other Taiwanese men in the military and government are
going to have to get used to showing more respect to women. Keeping
his campaign promise to promote more women, President-elect Chen
Shui-bian has filled about a quarter of the top posts in his
Cabinet with females, a total of eight.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual move for a leader in chauvinistic Asia, where
-- much more so than in the West -- men still have a tight grip on
the best jobs in government and business.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a milestone for Taiwanese women,'' said Chen Chu, the
newly appointed Labor Council chief, the first woman to lead the
Cabinet agency.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Asian women who followed their husbands or fathers into
politics -- such as former Philippine President Corazon Aquino and
India's late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi -- the Taiwanese women
rose to prominence the hard way: marching in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Lu and Chen Chu both took part in the democracy movement that in
1987 helped end decades of repressive martial law in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   They were convicted of sedition and sentenced to jail in 1979,
along with six male dissidents. Lu was jailed for 5{ years and Chen
six years before they were paroled.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a conservative, traditional society where women had
no say in things,'' Chen Chu, 50, said. ''Even most men were too
afraid to support the opposition movement, but we had quite a few
very brave women.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen Chu, chief of social affairs in Taiwan's second-largest
city, Kaohsiung, said she was influenced by family members who were
staunch supporters of the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The end of martial law in Taiwan gave rise to a vocal and
powerful feminist movement. As many women as men now enter college,
and many women hold key positions in private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But working women are still a minority. While 70 percent of
Taiwanese men work, only 45 percent of women do so, less than the
50 percent average among Japanese and Korean women.
</P>
<P>
   In the national legislature, women hold 43 of the 225 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new female Cabinet ministers hold prominent
positions, rather than the token jobs awarded to women in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Yeh Chu-lan, a lawmaker, will be Taiwan's first female
transportation minister. Taiwan also will have its first government
spokeswoman, economist Chung Chin.
</P>
<P>
   Another post, head of the Mainland Affairs Council that handles
the delicate relations with China, went to Tsai Ying-wen. Tsai, who
holds a doctorate in law from the University of London, has been a
key negotiator in pushing for Taiwan's entrance to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But another battle for equality may have just begun as the women
are tested for their capability to run the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, Taiwan's first female vice president, has complained that
male politicians expected her to be powerless and remain
''voiceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's constitution simply states the vice president shall act
for the president when the leader cannot perform his duties without
saying what the job actually involves.
</P>
<P>
   Lu loudly questioned whether that meant she should be a ''flower
vase.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Many men still don't accept women as their equals, and it is
more so the closer you get to the nucleus (top echelon) of power,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With a master's degree in law from Harvard, Lu, 56, won a seat
in the national legislature and was elected chief of Taoyuan County
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many men said Lu's comments about her new job reinforced the
perception that women lack political dexterity, but feminists
praised her for speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women have no power in this society. If they speak softly, how
can they gain any power?'' asked TV anchorwoman Sisy Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Chu, however, said she never gained any privilege as a
woman and was never suppressed because of it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, Lu, and Tsai have never married, reflecting a society
where many women must choose between a promising career and getting
married, which could involve more family commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women face too many roadblocks,'' Lu said. ''They have to work
several times harder than men.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminists say they expect the new government to set up more
childcare centers and old-age homes to relieve the household
burdens that fall mostly on women.

<HEADLINE> Barak Evaluates 1st Year in Office  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Pulling a shiny card of campaign promises out
from his chest pocket, Prime Minister Ehud Barak tried to rekindle
the national euphoria that surrounded his election one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly acknowledging the doubts about Israel's progress that
have surfaced of late but determined to squash them, Barak pounded
his fist in the air Wednesday as he brandished the card of pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a government that does not deal with niceties of
language and packaging, it deals with action,'' he said. ''I have
no doubt that ... we will continue on this path and, in the end,
the feeling will change as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's landslide victory over former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu last May 17 boosted expectations in Israel and abroad
that real progress on all fronts in the peace process was just
around the corner. But the luster has begun to fade.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli-Palestinian talks lagging and no sign that
negotiations with Syria will be resumed, Barak is behind in his own
plans to be well on the way to ending Arab-Israeli conflict by this
point.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators delve into the
thorniest issues dividing the sides, Barak's coalition has begun to
crack over his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
   However, he is fulfilling one of his key campaign commitments:
The army has started to withdraw troops from south Lebanon to end
Israel's 18-year presence there by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of an arrangement with Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon, could lead to trouble. Residents along the
border complain nightly on national television about fears that
they will be subject to guerrilla attacks after the pullout when
the border will be just yards from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Barak has fallen behind in promises to pull Israel
out of a recession and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis elected Barak mostly for his centrist policies on the
peace process, but they are beginning to express skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll, Israelis gave the former chief of the army a
28 percent approval rating -- lower than Netanyahu's support a year
into office.
</P>
<P>
   ''His approval rating is the lowest it's ever been,'' said
pollster Hanoch Smith. ''There is major uncertainty about whether
or not he's headed for peace with the Syrians and the Palestinians.
It's not clear which way he's going since things are stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 500 Israelis had a margin of error of 1.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A second deadline for the broad outlines of a final peace treaty
between Israel and the Palestinians passed on May 13 with both
sides acknowledging they were far from agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. envoy Dennis Ross said this week that he has complete
confidence in the Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prime Minister Barak has made it clear that he sees an
opportunity to end what has been an intractable conflict,'' Ross
told reporters. ''I believe that he is determined to press ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's coalition has begun to crumble. One of the largest
partners in the government, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, has
threatened to pull out if it doesn't receive funds for its troubled
education network.
</P>
<P>
   One other key ally, the National Religious Party, has already
announced it is quitting the government over Barak's peace policies
and an immigrant party, Israel B'Aliya, stands poised to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare show of political boldness, Barak managed to push one
of his peace initiatives through parliament on Tuesday -- commanding
the support of even some of his more hesitant coalition partners by
making the vote a motion of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, only yesterday, did Barak begin his real term as
prime minister,'' commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper Wednesday. ''He spent a year dancing. The issues
that have been tearing at Israel for years seemed to have passed
him by.''

<HEADLINE> Study: All Should Lower Salt Intake  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- By cutting their salt intake in half, all
Americans -- but especially those at high risk of hypertension -- can
lower their chance of developing high blood pressure, researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came Wednesday from Dr. Eva Obarzanek, a
nutritionist with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of
the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH also released a study involving 412 people who were
divided into two groups, both of which were put on low-salt diets
for 14 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One group was put on the average American diet, with foods like
roast beef, ham and turkey, along with high-fat sweets and some
fruits and vegetables. The other group was fed a diet rich in
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Both diets contained the same low amounts of salt.
</P>
<P>
   The group that ate the produce-rich diet saw a dramatic
reduction of 8.9 points in systolic pressure (the top number in a
blood pressure reading) and 4.5 points in diastolic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But even those on the typical American diet saw their blood
pressure drop -- an average of 6.7 points and 3.5 points,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted at five leading medical institutions
around the country and presented during the American Society of
Hypertension annual meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one percent of the participants had high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Obarzanek said the quickest way to reduce sodium intake is to
cut down on processed foods -- for instance, certain spaghetti
sauces in a jar and potato chips. She said people should also
remove the salt shaker from the table, flavor foods with spices
instead of salt, and check food labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The food industry needs to lower the salt content of its
products,'' said Dr. Frank Sacks, associate professor of medicine
at Harvard Medical School and Boston's Brigham and Women's
Hospital. ''And we need help from the fast-food industry not to
pre-salt that hamburger.''

<HEADLINE> Car service driver killed in Bronx  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A car service driver found on the ground next to
his vehicle in the Bronx died minutes after being taken to the
hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, identified as Kim Hong, was not a licensed livery
cab driver and worked for a car service not licensed with the Taxi
&AMP; Limousine Commission. But an advocate for drivers says the killer
did not know that, so Hong's murder on Wednesday makes him the 10th
driver slain on duty this year. Eleven drivers were killed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were out to kill a livery cab driver,'' said Fernando
Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, police have no suspects. Robbery appeared to be the
motive -- some of Hong's property was removed -- but police did not
say what was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Hong, 20, was found shortly after midnight after police received
a call about a car accident in the Williamsbridge section of the
Bronx. They found Hong's black Acura Legend had hit an unoccupied
parked car, and Hong was discovered next to it with a gunshot wound
to his back.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Montefiore Hospital where he was pronounced dead
at 12:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hong, who was from Cambodia, worked for Preferred Car Company in
the Bronx and had been dispatched to pick up a client, police said.
He is survived by his pregnant wife and their 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Police have already formed a task force to combat a recent rash
of livery cab driver killings and the TLC has started requiring all
drivers to install either bulletproof partitions or security
cameras in their cars. The city set aside $5 million to help pay
for the extra security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings echo the early 1990s, when livery cab drivers were
under siege. In 1992, cabbies were killed at the rate of nearly one
per week for a record annual total of 45 slayings.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, in March and April of 1990, seven livery drivers
were killed in six weeks, prompting scores of drivers to quit or
switch to day shifts.

<HEADLINE> Clint Eastwood, Disabled Spar  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Actor Clint Eastwood is getting his day, if
not making it, in a battle with advocates for the disabled who say
his California hotel is in violation of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   A California woman has sued the actor, prompting and outcry from
Eastwood about what he says are frivolous ADA lawsuits that target
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, angered by a request from the woman for more than
$500,000 in attorneys fees, planned to ask a House subcommittee
today to amend the 10-year-old law so businesses like his Mission
Ranch Hotel in Carmel, Calif., have more time to comply.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Florida Republicans Mark Foley and Clay Shaw
would require plaintiffs to give defendants notice of alleged
violations and then 90 days to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ''I totally support the ADA laws. I think people not in
compliance should get into compliance,'' Eastwood said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. But he added, ''I think there should
be a better way to get people in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Foley, ''I don't want to create an impediment to the ADA.
In fairness, businesses should be given a chance to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Eastwood, filed three years ago, claims the
former Carmel mayor violated ADA provisions in his 32-room Mission
Ranch Hotel and restaurant. At least one bathroom and the hotel
parking lot did not comply with the law and there were not enough
rooms accessible to the disabled, the suit claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rein, who represented plaintiff Diane Zum Brunnen in the
suit, said Eastwood's fight for notification is unfair to the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a black person is not allowed to enter a business because
of his race, he's not required to send a letter. If a woman is not
allowed to ..., she's not required to send a letter. Why should
disabled persons be the only class of persons required to send
letters?'' Rein said.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood insists his hotel is in compliance and says he and
other small businesses are being preyed upon by money-seeking
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit demands $577,000 in attorneys fees. The disabled
cannot collect monetary damages under the law, although Rein says
the lawsuit does demand $25,000 for Brunnen under a California
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thinks I'm some stiff coming along that's going to roll
over,'' Eastwood said. ''I'm going to trial. I'm going to take it
before a judge and a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor said he is fighting for other small business owners as
well. ''A lot of people can't afford that. Somebody has got to
stand up for those people. Somebody has got to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocate for the disabled fear the fight could result in
weakening the law once lawmakers begin revisiting it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we open up this bill, there's no way to control the
number of amendments that may come forward,'' said Curt Decker,
executive director of the National Association of Protection and
Advocacy Systems. ''This is going to be a message to anybody that
has not complied... Despite a decade of legal requirements
nationally, they are basically being given a free ride for not
complying with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 3590

<HEADLINE> Koreas Agree on Summit Talks Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- South Korea and North Korea reached full
agreement Thursday on the agenda and other details for a summit of
their leaders in June, negotiators from both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after negotiators met at the border village
of Panmunjom and resolved one last pending issue -- the size of the
South Korean press corp for the June 12-14 summit in the North's
capital, Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The summit would be the first ever between the two Koreas, which
were divided into the communist North and the pro-Western South in
1945. Their three-year war in the early 1950s ended in an
armistice, not a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Park Jae-kyu, South Korea's unification minister, said an
advance party of South Korean officials will visit Pyongyang at the
end of May to prepare for the summit. The 30-member team will
include specialists in security, protocol and communications.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean negotiator Choi Sung Ik said both sides agreed to a
broadly worded agenda that calls for self-reliance, peace and
national unity. South Korea had dropped its proposal for a specific
agenda listing matters such as economic aid to the impoverished
North.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Cabinet-level meeting at Panmunjom was the fifth
since April 22. After four rounds of talks, the two sides last week
decided to discuss details through documents and telephone
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise, South Korea agreed to send a delegation of 130
officials as well as a 50-member press corps, down from its
proposal of 80 journalists. North Korea, which has often accused
South Korean and Western journalists of biased reporting, had asked
that the number be halved.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed to allow South Korean journalists to hold
live television broadcasts from Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il will meet at least two or three times and more if
necessary, according to the 15-point agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators agreed that there will be no markings or signs at
the meeting site or conference rooms. South Korean officials said
that meant there will be no display of national flags or symbols in
an effort to avoid ideological friction.
</P>
<P>
   In a luncheon meeting with religious leaders on Wednesday,
President Kim Dae-jung said he would not seek ''too much at a
time'' from the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   High on South Korea's summit agenda are economic cooperation and
reunions of separated family members. North Korea is expected to
raise the U.S. military presence in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials believe North Korea was driven to agree
to the summit for economic reasons. With its economy in tatters,
the North has been relying on foreign aid to feed its 22 million
people since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Stands by Microsoft Breakup  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department remains steadfast in
its belief that Microsoft Corp. should be broken up, rejecting
lesser penalties the company has proposed as being ''neither
serious nor sensible'' ways to remedy a pattern of illegal,
anticompetitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting up the giant computer software maker -- one of the
world's richest companies -- would ''undo the harm to competition
caused by Microsoft's illegal conduct without creating the costly
inefficiencies of more burdensome regulation or ... risking
material harm to Microsoft's shareholders,'' the government said in
a 70-page court document filed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate but not surprising that the government is
attempting to defend its extreme remedy proposal,'' said Jim
Cullinan, a spokesman for the Redmond, Wash.-based company. ''We
don't believe there's any kind of basis in law or in the case to
warrant such a remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's latest filing puts the next round in the
protracted antitrust battle back in the hands of U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who oversaw a 78-day trial on the
case. The trial resulted in an April 3 ruling in which Jackson
found Microsoft in wide violation of federal antitrust laws through
predatory and anticompetitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to appeal the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the case is scheduled for next Wednesday, and
Jackson is likely to outline further proceedings at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan submitted last month by the Justice Department and
17 of the states that successfully sued Microsoft on antitrust
charges, Microsoft would be broken up into two companies. One would
develop the company's dominant Windows computer operating system
and the other would have everything else, including Microsoft's
Office software and its Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan also would impose numerous temporary
restrictions on Microsoft's business practices while the case moves
through the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   In its formal response, Microsoft asked Jackson to dismiss the
government plan, or at least give its attorneys up to six months to
prepare its legal defense against such a severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the government argued that Microsoft's request for
additional time was ''unwarranted and unreasonable'' and a
transparent attempt to ''delay the day when the law will hold it
accountable for its illegal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft should not have been surprised by the proposal to
split the company because it ''has known for several months about
plaintiffs' interest in structural relief,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft in its response last week also offered to impose
milder remedies on itself, specifically ones that would curb the
company's conduct against competitors and clients dealing with
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered to give computer makers leeway in altering
the Windows desktop to promote competing software, as well as allow
them to hide Microsoft's Internet Explorer icon and promote other
browsers instead.
</P>
<P>
   But the government, in its reply Wednesday, said Microsoft's
proposed remedies were ''neither serious nor sensible,'' and would
fail to restore competition in the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up the company is the only sanction that ''has a chance
of ending Microsoft's persistent unwillingness to abandon its
widespread use of unlawful practices to maintain and extend its
Windows monopoly,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan responded that the government's proposed conduct
regulations would force Microsoft to give up its intellectual
property to competitors like Sun and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's like forcing Coke to share its secret formula with
Pepsi and every other major soft drink vendor in the country,'' he
said. ''The government wants to use a chain saw to try and cure a
common cold. We don't believe the Justice Department has the right
cure for this alleged ailment.''

<HEADLINE> UN OKs Ethiopia-Eritrea Arms Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council unanimously
approved an arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea late
Wednesday following the latest flare-up in their two-year war.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo will be terminated immediately if Secretary-General
Kofi Annan reports that ''a peaceful definitive settlement of the
conflict'' has been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the embargo will last for 12 months and the council
will then decide whether it should be extended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it sends an unequivocal and strong message to the
parties to bring an end to this conflict,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Nancy Soderberg said after the 15-0 vote on the U.S.-sponsored
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Council members resolved differences over the time limit between
the United States and Britain on one side, and Russia and France on
the other, after several hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, backed by Britain, initially wanted a total
arms embargo on both countries, which would only be lifted when a
final peace agreement had been signed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a major arms supplier to both countries, initially
opposed an arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians dropped their objection to an arms embargo Tuesday
and joined France and other countries in demanding a time limit.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain dropped their demand for an
unlimited embargo and proposed that the council review compliance
after 12 months -- the time frame that was ultimately accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France oppose unlimited economic sanctions,
especially those imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which they argue have caused great suffering to ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between the Horn of Africa neighbors broke out on
several fronts last Friday. Hours later, the Security Council
unanimously adopted a British-sponsored resolution calling for
''immediate steps'' to be taken if the two countries didn't stop
fighting and resume talks.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution adopted Wednesday night recalls that the council
urged all countries last year to end sales of arms and ammunition
to Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   It bans the sale or supply of weapons, ammunition, military
vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment and spare parts to
both countries. It also prohibits military-related training or
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over the 620-mile border between Ethiopia and
Eritrea -- among the world's poorest countries -- has cost the lives
of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution deplores the loss of life, strongly condemns the
continued fighting, and demands an immediate cease-fire and
withdrawal of forces.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have agreed to an Organization of African Unity
blueprint for peace.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea wants a cease-fire first, which would include a
pullback by both sides and a U.N.-supervised demarcation of the
border. Ethiopia wants implementation before a cease-fire, and says
Eritrea's position amounts to ''setting preconditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution demands the earliest possible reconvening,
without preconditions, of ''substantive peace talks'' under OAU
auspices.
</P>
<P>
   It also requests the OAU chairman to consider dispatching an
envoy to the region to seek an immediate cease-fire and resumption
of the peace talks. This was a key Russian demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''The resolution has strong support for the OAU process and
strong endorsement for negotiating a peaceful settlement and final
agreement of this bloody conflict,'' Soderberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting forced the World Food Program to temporarily halt
food distribution in Ethiopia's western border area, which could
affect tens of thousands of displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution strongly regrets ''the negative impact the
diversion of resources to the conflict continues to have on efforts
to address the ongoing humanitarian food crisis in the region.'' It
requests the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments to provide
humanitarian assistance and ensure its delivery to needy people.

<HEADLINE> Storms Rake Midwest, Plains  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA FARGEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Severe weather swept from the Rockies into the Plains on
Wednesday, with a tornado leveling a farmhouse in western Nebraska,
snow closing roads in Colorado and Wyoming and rain flooding parts
of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Two people, a husband and wife, received minor injuries as the
tornado near North Platte destroyed their home and severely damaged
five others, said Lincoln County emergency management director Deb
Bertrand
</P>
<P>
   Farm equipment, vehicles, livestock and buildings were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is stunning,'' Bertrand said. ''Every single family that
I stopped and talked to was utterly in shock and trying to carry
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It broke your heart to see the destruction that happened so
quickly and so completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, snow and rain closed down roads in Colorado and
Wyoming, snapping tree limbs, knocking out power and forcing
streams out of their banks. The closures included Interstate 80
between Cheyenne and Laramie, where 6 inches of snow fell Wednesday
and another 6 inches were possible overnight, and Loveland Pass, 70
miles west of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes swept across Colorado's northeastern plains, but no
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, heavy rain produced flash flooding. In Vernon
County, along the Minnesota and Iowa state lines, authorities
fearing high water moved 300 schoolchildren who were camping at
Sidie Hollow Park while intersections were swamped in La Crosse.
</P>
<P>
   The children, who attend various Waldorf schools throughout
Wisconsin, were taken to a nearby school to spend the night, said
Shane Nottestad, a sheriff's dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Deep drifts of hail piled up in Kasota, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just like a blizzard. It kept going and going and
going. First nickel-sized, then pea-sized,'' said Dale Larson of
Door Engineering and Manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   A flash flood warning was issued for parts of Minnesota after
creeks and streams rose 2 feet or more Wednesday afternoon.
Mudslides also were reported in the steeper terrain closer to the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusting to 70 mph snapped limbs and trees, downed power
lines and tore part of the roof off a hotel in Brookings, S.D. A
trampoline and two boats up for sale were blown across a parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a surprise to us to see something like a boat blowing
across the road because we didn't really see much wind here,'' said
Chris Quinn who watched as the storm rolled into town. ''But when
we saw that trampoline coming across the lot, we knew it was pretty
strong wind.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia Seeks Patent Extension  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three decades ago, Columbia University
undergraduate Judd Gregg prowled the sidelines of sports events as
the school's mascot, clad as a lion. Now a U.S. senator, Gregg is
still showing school spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Republican, Columbia Class of '69, has
inserted a provision into an agriculture spending bill that would
help his alma mater win a lucrative patent extension on a process
its scientists invented for making some widely sold biotechnology
drugs. The patent, which nets Columbia up to $100 million a year in
royalties from companies using the procedure, otherwise expires in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's provision has set off a wave of protest from the
pharmaceutical industry. Many companies would like to use the
process without paying royalties, while others worry that their
competitors would be emboldened by a Columbia victory to try
extending patents on other products or processes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find it to be a very, very dangerous precedent and
potentially costly for consumers,'' said G. Thomas Long, counsel
for the National Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents
manufacturers and marketers of generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg and Columbia officials counter that inventors of drugs can
apply for patent extensions, so it is only fair that the law be
changed to let inventors of processes do the same thing. Besides,
they say, the university uses most of the royalties for research
that benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If Columbia stops collecting royalties from companies, ''Do you
honestly think they'll reduce their prices for these products?''
Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   The 350-word provision, which does not mention Columbia by name,
is typical of the hundreds of special-interest items lawmakers
shoehorn into Congress' 13 must-pass spending bills each year.
</P>
<P>
   As a subcommittee chairman on the Senate Appropriations
Committee, which writes spending measures, Gregg is well-placed to
insert such a provision. And many colleagues are reluctant to
challenge a chairman's project -- especially one like the sometimes
bristly Gregg -- knowing they might need a favor from him later.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers are criticizing the arrangement because the
school used its relationship with Gregg to influence legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're really talking about is special access ... that
would not be available to just anyone,'' said Peter Eisner,
managing director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan
watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg says he was asked to address the problem by his friend
George Rupp, Columbia's president. He says he sees nothing wrong
with that and put it into the spending bill -- which may move
relatively quickly through Congress -- because Columbia needs the
law changed before its patent lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess Mr. Eisner wants a windfall profit for the drug
companies at the expense of a research university,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia got its patent for a technique called cotransformation
in August 1983, making it one of the earlier biotechnology
processes. Using it, a gene can be inserted into a cell so that
cell will produce proteins used in medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Since the process was introduced, Columbia says sales of drugs
produced by cotransformation have totaled $28.3 billion, on which
the school has taken an average 1 percent royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The school produces no drugs itself, but has granted licenses to
34 companies that make and market 18 pharmaceuticals. The drugs
include Activase for heart attack and stroke victims; Herceptin for
breast cancer; and Avonex for multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Three Columbia scientists developed the procedure using grants
from the federal National Institutes of Health that totaled ''the
low millions of dollars over many years,'' said Michael Crow,
executive vice president and provost at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The three inventors split 20 percent of the royalties, he said,
so each reaps millions annually. The rest -- minus some
administrative costs -- goes to research.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like we're taking the money and buying hotels,'' said
Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's language would let nonprofit organizations that have
invented processes that have led to five new drugs apply to extend
their patents.
</P>
<P>
   Crow says it was written ''in generic form'' and could affect
others. Critics say Columbia is the only entity they know of that
would qualify, and that Columbia would meet every criteria
established, virtually guaranteeing a patent extension.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was initially drafted by Columbia lawyers but
altered with suggestions from lawmakers and aides, Crow said.
</P>
<P>
   Crow said Columbia would seek a five-year extension, the maximum
drug inventors can now get to prolong patents. But under a formula
in current law the school expects an extension lasting 1{ years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for enactment are unclear. The $75 billion agriculture
appropriations bill has been approved by the Senate Appropriations
Committee and is awaiting Senate floor action. But the Clinton
administration is expected to come out against the Columbia
provision soon, according to congressional aides speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., whose state is home to some
major drug manufacturers, said he will try to strip the provision
from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you believe in the market and competition, at some points
monopoly rights have to end,'' he said.

ADA lawsuits that target small businesses. Eastwood, angered by a request from

Arrests Made in 1963 Church Bombing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two former Ku Klux Klansmen were arrested on murder
charges Wednesday in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black
girls -- a crime that galvanized the civil rights movement. Thomas E. Blanton
Jr., 61, of Birmingham, and Bobby Frank Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas,
surrendered on the state charges and were jailed without bail. If convicted,
they could get life in prison with the possibility of parole. U.S. Attorney Doug

<HEADLINE> Seattle Picks Up Rickey Henderson  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rickey Henderson, released by the New York Mets
over the weekend, reached agreement Wednesday night to play for the
Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and the Mariners made their deal about eight hours
after baseball's career stolen base leader cleared waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been looking for an outfielder for a long period of time
and Rickey became available,'' Mariners general manager Pat Gillick
said. ''We just hope he has something left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos also pursued signing Henderson, 41. The
leadoff man spoke to managers Lou Piniella of Seattle and Felipe
Alou of the Expos shortly before making his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to see him come over and I told him that,'' Piniella
said after a 4-0 victory over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was Henderson's manager with the New York Yankees from
1986-88. Gillick was Henderson's general manager at Toronto in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went down to the bottom of the ninth,'' agent Jeff Borris
said. ''The Expos made a valiant effort to get him, but so did the
Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a team option for a 2001 contract at $3
million with a $250,000 buyout. He is making $1.9 million this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was cut by the Mets on Saturday in the midst of a
troubling season. Slumping at the plate and booed by fans at Shea
Stadium, his attitude angered manager Bobby Valentine and general
manager Steve Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll probably help them if he has an incentive. I'm happy for
him,'' Valentine said Wednesday night after the Mets beat Colorado
4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson needs 163 hits for No. 3,000. He also hopes to become
baseball's career leader in runs scored and walks -- he needs 125
runs to match Ty Cobb's mark and 59 walks to tie Babe Ruth's
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could have been content to go home and rest for the rest of
the year, but the guy wanted to play,'' Gillick said. ''He's a guy
who at times has been a little sensitive. He's coming to Seattle
because he wants to win another ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said he spoke to a few Mariners players before making
the deal, and said they agreed Henderson would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''His age is the big question,'' said first baseman John Olerud,
who played with Henderson on the Mets last season. ''But if he
plays like he did last year, he'll definitely help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had been upset since the start of spring training
because the Mets wouldn't raise his salary or give him a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew he and Bobby Valentine didn't see eye to eye,''
Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners only had to pay a portion of the minimum salary to
get Henderson -- meaning it cost them about $150,000, with the Mets
responsible for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after Henderson twice passed through waivers
without anyone claiming him, the Mariners were willing to take a
chance on him -- including a significant raise -- for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, picked by many to win the AL West, are leading the
division. They will likely use Henderson as their regular leadoff
hitter and left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson batted .219 with no homers and two RBIs for the Mets.
He stole five bases in seven tries, and has 1,339 career steals in
a major league career that started in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people believe Rickey has a lot of baseball left in
him,'' Borris said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has used Mark McLemore and Mike Cameron as its leadoff
hitters. Stan Javier has played mostly in left field.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected Henderson, who was still in the New York area,
would join the Mariners on Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had been interested in Henderson after the 1997 season,
when he was a free agent. Henderson eventually signed with Oakland
and played there for a season before signing with the Mets for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners talked to the Mets before this season about a
possible trade involving pitcher Brett Tomko. The Mets also talked
to the Detroit about a deal for outfielder Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a 10-time All-Star and the 1990 AL MVP, is regarded
by many as the greatest leadoff hitter in major league history. He
was MVP of the AL championship series in 1989, when he helped the
Athletics on to the World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Since starting in the majors, Henderson has shifted teams nine
times. He's had four stints with the Athletics, and also has played
for San Diego and Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night, Henderson was criticized by Valentine for
failing to run out a long drive -- Henderson said he thought it was
going to be a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Saturday's game against Florida, Henderson shouted at a
reporter who wrote about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''After considering everything that happened last night and this
morning, something had to be done,'' Phillips said at the time. ''I
think the reasons are fairly obvious. No matter how much talent you
have, if you continue to create problems and situations, you wear
out your welcome. We got to the point where we had to compromise
our ideals and what we expect from our players too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson created a stir last year when he and Bobby Bonilla
were accused of playing cards in the Mets' clubhouse during the
season-ending, extra-inning loss at Atlanta in the NL championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, though, said he was not the reason the Mets, the NL
wild-card winner last year, were hovering around the .500 mark this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't cause them to lose. Look someplace else,'' he said
before quickly leaving the clubhouse following a 7-6 loss to
Florida, his final game for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Henderson often has slumped when unhappy.
Last season, he hit .315 with a .423 on-base percentage -- best
among NL leadoff men -- and stole 37 bases.

<HEADLINE> Angels 8, Orioles 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Scott Spiezio singled home the winning
run with one out in the ninth inning and the Anaheim Angels rallied
past Baltimore 8-7 Wednesday night, the Orioles' eighth loss in
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad's two-run single in the Angels eighth tied it at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin (0-1) walked Tim Salmon to lead off the ninth and
Garret Anderson sacrificed. After Troy Glaus was intentionally
walked, Spiezio won it with a broken-bat single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival (1-2) earned the victory with an inning of hitless
relief, despite walking three batters.
</P>
<P>
   After Buddy Groom escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh,
Timlin relieved him with runners at the corners and one out in the
eighth. He walked pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro with his first four
pitches and Erstad grounded the next pitch to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken, starting at third base after missing four games
because of scar tissue inflammation in his back, hit an RBI double
in the first inning for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle drove in three runs for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp, who lasted only 3 1-3 innings last Thursday against
Boston, overcame a shaky first inning. He pitched six innings and
gave up four runs and five hits, including Glaus' 11th homer.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing a three-run margin as quickly as they built it,
the Orioles regained the lead in the second inning on a
bases-loaded, two-run infield single by Belle off Scott
Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and the runners moving on a 3-2 pitch, Glaus
charged Belle's slow-hit grounder to third and failed to make the
barehanded pickup as Rich Amaral hustled home right behind Charles
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles added an unearned run in the sixth when B.J. Surhoff
walked, stole second and scored on Glaus' error.
</P>
<P>
   After Glaus homered in the bottom half, Delino DeShields led off
the seventh with a double and scored on Jeff Conine's sacrifice fly
to give Baltimore a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Conine and Ripken hit two-out, RBI doubles in the first after
Belle's sacrifice fly. The Angels tied it in the bottom half with
the help of some sloppy defense by the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Belle and Brady Anderson did not communicate on a fly to
right-center by Erstad and the ball fell between them for a double.
Adam Kennedy doubled home Erstad and scored when Conine, making his
14th consecutive start at first base for the injured Will Clark,
played Mo Vaughn's routine grounder into a two-base error. Vaughn
came home on Tim Salmon's double off the right field wall.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ripken grounded into a double play for the 328th time in his
20-year career, tying the major league record set by Hank Aaron.
... Keith Luuloa, who was promoted from the Angels' Triple-A
Edmonton club after Tuesday night's game, made his major league
debut as a pinch-runner for Bengie Molina and scored a run. Luuloa
joined Onan Masaoka of the Dodgers and Benny Agbayani of the Mets
as the only current Hawaiian-born players in the majors. ... Rapp
outlasted Benji Gil in a 15-pitch duel, striking him out in the
fourth inning after nine consecutive fouls. ... Tim Belcher, who
hasn't pitched for the Angels since undergoing surgery on his right
elbow on Dec. 2, threw off a mound for 10 minutes on Wednesday (all
fastballs) and reported no discomfort. He'll repeat the routine on
Saturday. ... Rapp and Schoeneweis combined to throw 100 pitches
during the first two innings.

<HEADLINE> 1980 Preakness Ended in Controversy  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Trainer D. Wayne Lukas was pleased to receive a
bag full of telegrams at the Pimlico stable gate the day after he
won the 1980 Preakness with Codex.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were all congratulatory,'' Lukas recalled.
''Not many of them were.''
</P>
<P>
   Codex's victory was one of the most controversial in the history
of Triple Crown racing. The colt had the temerity to beat the filly
Genuine Risk, the betting and sentimental favorite and the first of
her sex to win the Kentucky Derby in 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many people were upset about the upset. A lot of them were
outraged by the manner in which jockey Angel Cordero Jr. engineered
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero and Lukas were greeted by shaken fists, boos and curses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Angel if I take a bullet, I want it in the arm, not the
chest,'' Lukas said Wednesday after watching the gallop of High
Yield, the trainer's 26th starter in his 18th Preakness. He has won
four times.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of the outrage was Cordero, who later received
threats against his life and threats to burn his house for forcing
the filly extremely wide in the stretch and shaking his whip in her
face.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero had Codex in the lead on the final turn, while Genuine
Risk, the 2-1 favorite ridden by Jacinto Vasquez, was fourth, 3\
lengths behind Codex.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Risk then moved to join Codex on the outside entering
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Let footnotes on the Daily Racing Form chart of the race tell
what happened next:
</P>
<P>
   ''Cordero looked back entering the stretch, angled extremely
wide, intimidating and lightly brushing Genuine Risk in early
stretch . . .''
</P>
<P>
   A Baltimore Sun photo of the bumping was captioned: ''Was it a
bump or a kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   Codex finished 4} lengths ahead of runner-up Genuine Risk.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez claimed foul against Codex and Cordero for interference
in the stretch, but the claim was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez complained, ''I thought this was a race track, not a
rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Bert Firestone, Genuine Risk's owners, appealed to
the Maryland State Racing Commission, but after a three-day hearing
the result was allowed to stand, and Lukas had his first winner of
a classic race.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of a Triple Crown race has never been disqualified for
a race infraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness win followed victories in the Santa Anita Derby
and Hollywood Derby for Codex, who did not run in the Kentucky
Derby because of an oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Now horses are nominated for all three Triple Crown races at the
same time. Back in 1980, nominations were made for each race on an
individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was on a pony when a representative of Churchill Downs
handed him a list and asked him to check the horses he wanted
nominated. He checked some, none of which ran, but neglected to
check Codex.
</P>
<P>
   After Codex won the Santa Anita Derby on March 30, Lynn Stone,
president of Churchill Downs, presented the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'It's a shame that the horse is not nominated for the
Derby,''' Lukas recalled. ''I almost fell over. I was sick it was
my first chance to run in the Classic. I still think he would have
been my fifth Derby winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Codex, indeed, could have been the first of five Derby winners
for Lukas, who first saddled a Derby starter in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   There still are people, however, who think Codex should not have
been the first of Lukas' five Preakness winners.

<HEADLINE> Ways To Beat Fusaichi Pegasus  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bob Baffert has the problem of how to beat
Fusaichi Pegasus in the Preakness all figured out.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer, with an opinion on nearly everything, has a few
bright ideas on how to outfox the Kentucky Derby winner in
Saturday's $1 million Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   --Load him in the starting gate backwards.
</P>
<P>
   --Give everyone else a head start.
</P>
<P>
   --Force him to break from behind the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   --Call in the Stanford band.
</P>
<P>
   The way Fusaichi Pegasus is going, it just might take something
along those lines for any of his seven challengers to stand a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Derby winner is an extraordinary horse,'' said Baffert,
who sends out Captain Steve in the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness. ''These
other horses are going to have to run the race of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the 18 trainers who sent their 3-year-olds against
Fusaichi Pegasus -- FuPeg for short -- in the Derby, Baffert feels
this Derby winner has what it takes to win the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ''And my job is to make sure he earns it,'' said Baffert, who
hit the Derby-Preakness double with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real
Quiet in '98. ''We're here to keep him honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, eighth in the Derby, but contending at the top of
the stretch before being bumped by Wheelaway, isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   A field of eight was entered Wednesday night for the second leg
of the Triple Crown. As expected, Fusaichi Pegasus is the 3-5
favorite in the morning line, with Red Bullet the second choice at
9-2. The Derby winner will be ridden again by Kent Desormeaux;
Jerry Bailey will be aboard Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is fairly straightforward,'' FuPeg trainer Neil Drysdale
said after he selected the No. 7 post for his $4 million colt.
''The horse is quite versatile, and with a quarter-mile to the
first turn and an eight-horse field, the draw isn't that
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet won the Gotham Stakes before being soundly beaten by
FuPeg in the Wood Memorial on April 15. The lightly raced Red
Bullet, trained by Joe Orseno, skipped the Derby. The Preakness
will be his fifth career start.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done very well here and handles the track well,'' Orseno
said before gaining the No. 1 choice in the post position draw and
choosing post No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The last non-Derby starter to win the Preakness was Deputed
Testamony in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Other non-Derby starters in the field are Snuck In, at 12-1, and
Hugh Hefner, at 20-1. Four Derby starters are back to try again --
Captain Steve and Impeachment, both at 8-1; High Yield at 10-1 and
Hal's Hope at 20-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the Derby, Impeachment was third, Captain Steve eighth, High
Yield 15th and Hal's Hope 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, FuPeg finally shipped in from Kentucky and
was vanned to Pimlico from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''No problem. He traveled well. He's fine,'' Drysdale said,
adding that the playful colt was ''feeling good'' on the van ride
to the track.
</P>
<P>
   FuPeg, accompanied by his personal ''pony'' Bodyguard, was the
first horse off the van and was quickly led down the ramp and into
Barn 7 on the backstretch -- far removed from the Stakes Barn, the
traditional home of the Preakness starters.
</P>
<P>
   The last Derby winner who ran in the Preakness but did not stay
in the Stakes Barn was Northern Dancer in 1964. He won the race
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale chose to keep the frisky Fusaichi Pegasus away from the
media horde hanging around the Stakes Barn because ''it's quieter
back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Churchill Downs, where the Derby horses are spread out
and have lots of room to graze, the Pimlico backstretch has 10 long
brick barns, asphalt roads and virtually no grazing space.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Drysdale insists FuPeg will be better off away from
the other Preakness starters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here because it's quiet,'' he said. ''And it's less
crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be noisy and crowded on Saturday, when about 100,000
people show up to see if Fusaichi Pegasus -- FuPeg for short -- can
win the Preakness and earn a chance to become the 12th Triple Crown
winner by taking the Belmont Stakes on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, his Japanese owner, Fusao Sekiguchi, will collect a
$5 million bonus from Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   The past three years has produced a Belmont Stakes with the
Triple Crown on the line: Charismatic in '99; Real Quiet in '98 and
Silver Charm in '97. All three fell short in the Belmont. The last
Triple Crown winner was Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus soared to the top of his class by beating the
best in the West and then displaying powerful finishing kicks to
take the Wood at Aqueduct and the Derby at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Add a five-race winning streak and a quirky personality that has
seen him buck, rear and even throw an exercise rider into the mix,
and horse racing has itself a superhorse in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, of course, isn't buying any of the hype, especially
when he's told FuPeg looks like a lock in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can always lose, 100, 200, 300 ways,'' he said. Asked
which horse he feared most on Saturday, Drysdale said, ''I fear all
horses. I'm always worried. I think it's a strong bunch of
3-year-olds this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Baffert has a much different approach than Drysdale,
the white-haired trainer can understand Drysdale's decision to keep
Fusaichi Pegasus away from the hustle and bustle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neil is a private person, and he knows clicks of cameras are a
distraction to his horse,'' Baffert said. ''He's just protecting
him, and I don't really blame him. Me, I like to share my horses
with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a few whimsical ideas.

<HEADLINE> Bourque Is Back for Game Three  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Eighteen days after going down with a knee injury,
Colorado Avalanche star defenseman Ray Bourque will return for Game
3 of the Western Conference finals with the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque pronounced himself ready to play after a hard practice
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Bob Hartley, who hinted at Bourque's possible
return a day earlier, wasn't available to confirm it. But who would
dare argue with a future Hall of Famer who boasts an NHL-record 403
goals as a defenseman?
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's return for Friday night's game here -- where Colorado
is 6-0 this postseason -- should help the Avalanche compensate for
the loss of another valuable defenseman, Adam Foote, who has been
ruled out of Game 3. Foote sustained an eye injury Monday night in
a 3-2 loss to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' victory squared the best-of-seven series 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in the conference finals, Dallas and Colorado also
were tied 1-1. The Stars won that series in seven games en route to
capturing the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who has missed the last four playoff games with a
strained left knee, took contact for the first time in Wednesday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good,'' Bourque said. ''I went through practice and it
went very well. I'm where I need to be. So it's a go for Friday,
and I'm anxious to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, injured in the third game against Detroit on May 1,
skated on his own following the injury and rejoined his teammates
during workouts late last week. Wednesday's practice was a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did everything,'' he said. ''I did a lot of one-on-ones, a
lot of grinding in the corners. I felt very good.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've kind of turned the corner, and that's what I've waited
for over the last week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bourque insisted he was returning to the ice on his own
timetable, not because Foote is sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of whether Adam was there or not, you've got to be
good enough to go,'' Bourque said. ''That's why I'm playing Friday,
because I'm well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Paired together, Bourque and Foote were a force earlier in the
playoffs. Even without Bourque, Foote shut down Dallas' Mike Modano
in a 2-0 victory in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   With Foote exiting early in Game 2, Modano found more room to
skate and scored two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bourque will accept the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adam is a warrior and he's a big part of this team,'' Bourque
said. ''The good thing is the injury could have been worse, and
he'll be back. When, exactly, we're not sure. But we've just got to
hold the fort.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've shown on many occasions in the last month or so how much
heart this team has in picking up the slack whenever somebody has
gone down.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time they acquired Bourque from Boston until his
injury, the Avalanche were 18-3-1. Although there were many anxious
moments when Bourque was hurt, the Avs went 3-1 without him.
</P>
<P>
   Now they face the same challenge without Foote, but this is
clearly a team with imposing depth.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a one- or two-man team,'' said defenseman Aaron
Miller, who likely will be paired with Bourque on Friday night.
''Adam is a great player, but there's a lot of talent on this team.
Among 20 guys, you can certainly pick up the slack.''

<HEADLINE> Man accused in firebombing hoax found unfit to stand trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- A man accused of planting two firebombs at
a Norwalk synagogue has been found incompetent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Eddie Rodriguez Jr. on Wednesday ordered Joseph Yellen,
35, to spend 60 days at the Connecticut Valley Hospital in
Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Yellen placed two glass bottles filled with a
flammable liquid and stuffed with rags on the lawn of Congregation
Beth El on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Yellen told police he chased two men who were about to throw the
devices at the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Yellen on Nov. 26, saying he made up the story
in the hope of receiving a lighter sentence in an unrelated court
case. He was charged with falsely reporting an incident. He was
later charged with two felony counts of manufacturing a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   When Yellen's attorney, William Pelletreau, told him of the
judge's order Wednesday, Yellen seemed confused and began screaming
at Prosecutor Robert Katz.
</P>
<P>
   ''You satisfied, Katz?'' Yellen said. ''You piece of garbage.
You throw 20 charges against the wall. You get one that sticks.
This is a comedy act.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellen, who was unshaven and wearing jeans and a black jacket,
brought a duffel bag filled with personal items. Before the
hearing, he said, ''I brought my bag because they are sending me
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Padilla, a social worker with the Department of Mental
Health and Addiction Services, testified that Yellen has been
diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla said he concluded that Yellen is ''unable to understand
the charges against him and unable to assist in his defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla said Yellen reported that he had been hearing voices of
a self-deprecating nature. He said evaluators attributed some of
his behavior to pervasive paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Yellen felt that he was being persecuted by members of the
Norwalk Police Department, Padilla said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thinks they are trying to clean up problems in town by
making him a scapegoat,'' Padilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in Norwalk were heightened at the time of the incident
because a package of medical waste with anti-Semitic messages
attached to it had been left at the synagogue last August.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jay Lorenz, a medical waste disposal equipment salesman,
was charged in February with carrying out the crime and similar
incidents in Stamford.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants More African Trading  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Congress continues to weigh the question
of trade with China, President Clinton is ready to make official
some progress on another trade front: Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton today was signing legislation, backed by Washington's
African diplomatic corps, that would make it easier to sell goods
from sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president scheduled a formal signing ceremony on the White
House South Lawn, just after a private meeting with former South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   It took five years for the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to
move through Congress. The legislation finally passed last week on
a 77-19 Senate vote, the first major trade legislation approved
since a 1994 bill that led to the creation of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   During his historic 1998 tour of Africa, Clinton touted the
legislation as a means through which the poorest African countries
could build their own economies, reduce their debts and stabilize
their governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, countries can ship, duty-free, clothing made
with U.S. yarn and fabrics, provided they meet certain human rights
and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing made in Africa from African fabric would be allowed to
rise from 1.5 percent of U.S. imports to 3.5 percent over eight
years, boosting African exports of these products from about $250
million a year now to as much as $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   African nations where the gross domestic product is less than
$1,500 a year per person, all but six of the 48 sub-Saharan
nations, would have four years of quota-free benefits for apparel
made with third-country fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Caribbean nations helps level the trade playing
field that tilted in Mexico's favor after the North American Free
Trade Agreement went into effect.

U.N. To Expand Sierra Leone Mission

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite the uncertainty surrounding the future of
Sierra Leone's peace process, Britain has proposed expanding the size of the
besieged U.N. peacekeeping force to accommodate new troops. British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock asked the Security Council Wednesday to approve the expansion
quickly -- as early as Thursday -- because the force was expected to surpass its
11,100 limit over the weekend. A new ceiling of 13,000 would accommodate troops
that have been promised by India, Bangladesh and Jordan but haven't yet arrived,
U.N. officials said.

of the South Korean press corp for the June 12-14 summit in the North's capital,
Pyongyang. The summit would be the first ever between the two Koreas, which were

the actor, prompting and outcry from Eastwood about what he says are frivolous
ADA lawsuits that target small businesses. Eastwood, angered by a request from
the woman for more than $500,000 in attorneys fees, planned to ask a House
subcommittee Thursday to amend the 10-year-old law so businesses like his
Mission Ranch Hotel in Carmel, Calif., have more time to comply.

pervasive use of unregulated and increasingly popular "issue ads." Just 20
percent of the ads paid for by candidates for Congress in 1998 attacked their
opponents, compared with 60 percent of those by political parties, according to
the study being released Thursday. The study was conducted by the Brennan Center
for Justice at New York University School of Law, an organization that advocates

<HEADLINE> US: Surveillance of Embassies Common  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department officials are wondering who
are all those people who stake out American diplomatic missions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. surveillance detection teams have uncovered more than 700
incidents of suspected monitoring of American personnel and
facilities since the program began in January 1999, a top State
Department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's an average of more than one incident a day.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter told a House
committee that the teams were deployed after the State Department
concluded that surveillance against U.S. facilities is intense
prior to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter spoke to a House International Relations Committee
hearing that was convened to hear a progress report on the embassy
security situation.
</P>
<P>
   That issue has received high priority since the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   State Department Inspector General Jaquelyn Williams-Bridgers,
who also testified, said U.S. officials are trying to collect
information about the various groups which have had U.S. facilities
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said the presence of the teams has expanded the
security perimeter and the zone of control beyond previous
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The program is still a work in progress, he said, adding that
the Clinton administration nonetheless believes that ''it is
destined to become a major aspect of our overseas security
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said the surveillance detection teams are no
substitute for having a minimum 100-foot buffer between an official
facility and the nearest street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we can build embassies meeting the setback and other
security standards, our efforts cannot provide the degree of
security all of us want for our people and facilities,'' Carpenter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, said a record $800 million was obligated in the
last fiscal year on embassy security, but much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fully 85 percent of our facilities do not meet minimum
security standards,'' he said. ''Some are seriously overcrowded.
Most, however, have to be replaced. ... Our goal is to
expeditiously locate into safe facilities more than 22,000 embassy
staff in over 220 vulnerable buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that over the past year and a half, 87 properties
at 25 posts have been acquired to expand buffer zones around U.S.
installations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are looking into the possibility of acquiring an
additional 31 properties at 14 posts, he added.

<HEADLINE> House, Senate Panels OK China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and its
congressional allies are buoyed by lopsided committee votes in both
the House and the Senate for a landmark China trade bill. But they
caution that next week's House showdown remains close.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing is not over by any means,'' said Rep. Robert
Matsui, D-Calif., the administration's point man for the bill among
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed Wednesday's 34-4 vote by the House
Ways and Means Committee and 18-1 vote by the Senate Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strong bipartisan votes in both committees send a clear,
strong message that permanent normal trade relations for China is
vital to America's prosperity at home, our leadership in the world
and to positive change in China,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to redouble his efforts to build support for the
legislation in advance of the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   The president is considering a five-minute address to the nation
on Sunday evening to promote the bill, congressional supporters of
the legislation said.
</P>
<P>
   The near-unanimous Senate committee vote was expected because
bipartisan support for the overall measure has always been broad in
that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor has waged a fierce campaign against the
measure, cutting deeply into potential Democratic support in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, at least five Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee
who previously said they were undecided voted for the China-trade
bill on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good vote. It advanced us,'' said Matsui. ''On the
other hand, the floor will be very difficult next week. There is no
magic bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, who earlier predicted that 70-80 of the House's 211
Democrats would support the bill, said Wednesday that his most
realistic hope now was ''closer to 70.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders say they expect about 140 Republicans
to vote for the bill and that Democrats will have to provide the
rest. Since the bill requires 218 affirmative votes if all 435
members vote, that suggests that 78 or more Democratic votes would
be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not quite there but we think at the end of the day,
members of Congress will do the right thing,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky told a farm group Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end 20 years of annual congressional votes on
China's trade status and grant Beijing the same permanent
low-tariff access to U.S. markets that nearly every other nation in
the world already enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   It would also ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based organization that oversees world
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel added bipartisan language to the legislation
designed to protect U.S. industries from surges in certain exports
from China. It would allow the president to grant financial relief
to industries battered by such surges.
</P>
<P>
   Separate legislation to set up a commission to monitor human
rights in China was also expected to be included once the bill gets
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, D-Texas, called
the legislation ''a win-win for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure drew only four negative votes on the House panel,
all Democratic: Reps. Fortney Pete Stark, D-Calif.; William J.
Coyne, D-Pa.; John Lewis, D-Ga; and Gerald D. Kleczka, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   At least six committee members -- five of them Democrats -- who
had previously been undecided voted for the bill: Reps. Mac
Collins, R-Ga.; Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.; Karen L. Thurman, D-Fla.;
Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas; William Jefferson, D-La.; and Richard Neal,
D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> CBS, Pax TV Networks New Schedules  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is packing its fall schedule with dramas,
adding shows about crime scene investigators, a 32-year-old college
student, a big-city police commissioner and remaking ''The
Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is counting on a bawdy, outsized comedic personality --
Bette Midler -- to do battle against ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS introduced seven new series on Wednesday. Last year's No. 1
network is locked in a struggle with NBC for second place this
season behind the ''Millionaire''-fueled success of ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and UPN will present their fall schedules today.
</P>
<P>
   Midler's ''The Bette Show'' has the highest profile of the three
new CBS comedies, featuring the singer playing a character
suspiciously like herself. It's scheduled for 8 p.m. on Wednesdays
-- opposite ABC's fourth night of ''Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers who caught a glimpse of clips from the new show on
Wednesday gave it a rousing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''By reputation, I don't watch television,'' Midler said. ''I
never thought it could be as much fun as it has turned out to be
... I think we're going to have a sensational time.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is canceling its long-running medical drama, ''Chicago
Hope.'' Three dramas that were on Fridays or Saturdays -- ''Martial
Law,'' ''Early Edition,'' and ''Now and Again'' -- were also
canceled. The comedy ''Ladies Man'' was left off the schedule but
may make a midseason reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby is also off CBS's schedule. His ''Cosby'' sitcom has
retired and CBS didn't pick up ''Kids Say the Darndest Things,''
which had the comedian as host.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS schedule contains 12 hour-long dramas, with comedies
featured only on Monday and Wednesday nights. On Fridays, CBS will
air an update of the 1960s action series, ''The Fugitive,'' and the
drama about a team of forensic investigators in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   With ABC and NBC both turning over Saturday nights to movies,
CBS will bring back ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' and surround it with
the other new dramas: ''That's Life'' and ''The District.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS President Leslie Moonves acknowledged that criticism of the
networks for not having enough minority actors in prime-time played
a role in CBS's renewal of ''City of Angels,'' a medical drama with
a primarily black cast. It will air on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it wasn't good, it wouldn't have been picked up,'' Moonves
said of the show, which has scored low in the ratings. ''I still
think it's a very good drama.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is also shifting the newsmagazine ''48 Hours'' to Thursdays
at 8 p.m., and moving ''Diagnosis Murder'' to Thursdays at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fledgling Pax TV network said Wednesday it would
introduce three new series later this year. ''Mysterious Ways'' is
about a professor driven to uncover the mysteries behind uncanny
occurrences, and it co-stars Rae Dawn Chong. ''The Rumfords'' is
believed to be the first prime-time series to mix cartoons and
live-action comedy. ''Encounters With the Unexplained'' is a
reality series that explores some of the mysteries of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Country star Billy Ray Cyrus will star in ''Doc,'' a series
about a country doctor who moves to Manhattan, but it won't debut
on Pax until next winter.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ups Counterterrorism Effort  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is pumping an additional
$300 million into the nation's $9 billion battle against terrorism,
warning that Americans are ''vulnerable in new ways'' in a world of
computer viruses, high-tech warfare, biological attacks and
fast-spreading diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The world faces ''a fateful struggle between the forces of
integration and harmony and the forces of disintegration and
chaos,'' the president said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced a series of new measures, including
the installation of high-resolution day and night camera technology
on the U.S.-Canadian border, along with other secure communication
and advanced monitoring equipment to detect and deter terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like a lot of money,'' Clinton said. ''When you see
the evidence of what we're up against, I think you will support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy's
commencement ceremony, addressing about 5,000 people under sunny
skies at Cadet Memorial Field. Gusts of wind blowing off the Thames
River almost blew away the president's notes as he presented
degrees to 184 newly commissioned ensigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''In responding to terrorist threats,'' Clinton told the
graduates, ''our own strategy should be identical to your motto:
semper paratus. Always ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the new measures, Clinton recalled last December's
terrorism scare in the United States. He said that working with
Jordan, ''We shut down a plot to place large bombs at locations
where Americans might gather on New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most detailed remarks yet about the incident, Clinton
said, ''We learned the plot was linked to terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the organization created by Osama bin Laden, the
man responsible for the 1998 bombings at our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya, which cost the lives of Americans and hundreds of
Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the plan was uncovered, Clinton recalled, a
Customs agent in Seattle found bomb-making materials being smuggled
into the United States, ''the same material used by bin Laden in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile believed to be in Afghanistan, is among
17 people charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy to kill
Americans in the embassy bombing cases. Six are in custody in the
United States and three overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleged bomb smuggling, Ahmed Ressam, 32, was arrested
Dec. 14 after driving his rented car off a ferry from Victoria,
British Columbia, at Port Angeles, Wash. Prosecutors allege Ressam
was at the center of a plot, involving a handful of other Algerian
nationals in New York and Canada, to set off bombs in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has pleaded innocent to nine charges, including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central reality of our time,'' Clinton said, ''is that the
advent of globalization and the revolution in information
technology have magnified both the creative and the destructive
potential of every individual, tribe and nation on our planet.''
The world also faces threats such as AIDS and other diseases, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures in the expanded antiterrorism campaign include:
</P>
<P>
   --Increasing the number of Justice Department prosecutors and
legal staff to support the prosecution of terrorists. Fifteen
positions will be added.
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding from 26 to 37 the number of Joint Terrorism Task
Forces, which combine the assets of the FBI, Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the Customs Service, Secret Service and
state and local law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   --Strengthening the immigration service's forensic capabilities
to detect fraudulent travel documents.
</P>
<P>
   --Intensifying efforts to track and analyze the financing of
terrorist organizations and expanding the Treasury Department's

   Before returning to Washington, Clinton stopped in Greenwich,
Conn., for an afternoon of golf and a $500,000 fund-raiser for the
Democratic National Committee. Clinton used the occasion to trumpet
the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore, saying he had
been instrumental in decisions ranging from the budget and gun
control to foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Renew Women-Violence Law  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno called on Congress
to renew funding for programs established in the 1994 Violence
Against Women Act while announcing drops in the level of domestic
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Violence still devastates too many lives,'' she said Wednesday
at a news conference in front of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   She called a decision by the Supreme Court this week to strike
down a provision of the law that lets rape victims sue their
attackers in federal court ''deeply disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report, ''Intimate Partner Violence,'' the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics described a widespread
drop in violence among husbands and wives, boyfriends and
girlfriends that mirrors the general decline in serious crimes
nationwide since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which women were attacked by ''intimate partners'' --
current or former spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends or partners --
dropped 21 percent during the mid-1990s and the number of men
murdered by wives or girlfriends plunged 60 percent from 1976
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., the sponsor of the 1994
legislation, credited the act for the decrease. Under the law,
states had to honor protective orders issued by other states,
federal funding for shelters more than doubled and new grants were
given to train police and prosecutors, set up special units and
track incidents.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for certain grants, states also had to adopt policies
that encourage police to arrest offenders on a domestic call. In
many states, police now must make an arrest when they go to a
domestic dispute or explain in writing why they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the provision allowing
rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court, saying
Congress wrongly trampled on an area of state authority. The other
provisions were not at issue in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he could not figure out a way to rewrite the law to
allow rape victims to circumvent the ruling. Asked if there were
any changes that could be made to make federal rape lawsuits legal,
he replied: ''Yes, two new justices.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau report, citing FBI data, showed the number of
intimate partner homicides dropped since 1976 for every race and
gender group except white women.

<HEADLINE> Tribes: Gov't Not Enforcing Laws  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tony Eriacho Jr. says he and other American
Indian artists are losing out to cheap, foreign-made knockoffs of
Indian-style jewelry, pottery and other crafts.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is not enforcing a law designed to
protect Indians in the $1 billion a year business, Eriacho and
other Indian artists told a Senate panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency responsible for enforcement has not sought criminal
charges or civil lawsuits since 1990, when the law was
strengthened, even though trade groups estimate that at least half
of all Indian-style art sold in the United States is not authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Indian communities, enforcement ... has become a joke. It's
like a paper tiger with no teeth,'' said Eriacho, a member of New
Mexico's Zuni tribe and a jewelry maker and wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Indian Arts and Craft Board said Congress has
provided little money -- $1 million this budget year -- or support.
The agency, part of the Interior Department, also operates three
federal museums -- in Montana, Oklahoma and South Dakota -- where
Indian crafts are displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the investigators to go out and be looking for
cases,'' Faith Roessel, a Navajo, told the Senate Indian Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which hired its first staff lawyer two months ago,
has received 45 written complaints since 1996, many from consumers
who ''got a bad deal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's plenty of blame to pass around, but we don't seem to
be making any progress,'' said the committee chairman, Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne and former jeweler.
Campbell, R-Colo., said the government needs to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, who wrote the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act,
raised the possibility of moving enforcement to another government
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''With an estimated 50 to 60 percent of the marketplace plagued
with forgeries, how hard can it be to find a test case?'' Kyl,
R-Ariz., said in a statement. ''It almost seems as if the board
isn't looking for cases at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law strengthened existing penalties and gave the Indian
Arts and Crafts Board responsibility for referring complaints to
federal prosecutors. The intention was to further protect Indian
artists, who account for up to 85 percent of the job-holders on
some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopi tribe estimates that arts and crafts bring in $11.2
million a year for the 37 percent of its workers involved in the
business, but faux Hopi knockoffs cost another $4.6 million a year,
Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's Isleta Pueblo have seen the number of full-time
artists drop to 30 from 150 in the past 50 years, Isleta sculptor
Andy Abeita told senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfair competition from import fakes and mechanically cast
pottery and jewelry is now often being sold to the unsuspecting
consumer as Indian handmade,'' said Abeita, who has investigated
the problem for tribes and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This threat has made it almost impossible to compete fairly in
the commercial marketplace, forcing generations of potters and
silversmiths to discontinue the trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Violators can face up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine. Companies could pay a $1 million fine for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   The government board has pressured some businesses into dropping
sales of fakes, Roessel said. She said Time-Life Books agreed in
1996 to use authentic Hopi Kachina dolls as a promotional giveaway
for its books on American Indians after the board learned the
company originally planned to give away fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in South Dakota charged a man under the arts
and crafts law in 1998, Mark Van Norman of the Justice Department
said. The result was a guilty plea and an agreement to stop using
the words ''Native American'' on the goods produced, said Van
Norman, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe.

<HEADLINE> Army To Test Clean Fuels  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- The Army will be ''cleaner and
greener'' when it begins testing cleaner-burning alternative fuels
for the National Energy Technology Laboratory this fall, a
scientist says.
</P>
<P>
   Under a formal agreement the two agencies were expected to sign
today, the Army will equip its fleet of Humvees, tanks and Jeeps
with special instruments to monitor how the fuels burn, then send
that data back to the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Army was targeted in part because of its impact on air
pollution: It has some 250,000 vehicles worldwide, said Diane
Hooie, senior adviser in the lab's Strategic Center for Natural
Gas.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives the lab a testing ground and, eventually, a
buyer for both battery-like fuel cells and liquid fuels made from
coal, oil, natural gas and waste products from landfills and
sewage-treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy has four research programs with
multiple projects under way at the lab to develop fuels that burn
with little or no emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative fuels are safe and stable, Hooie said, but
significantly more expensive than gasoline and diesel because they
are not yet mass-produced.
</P>
<P>
   The Army will try various fuels on 100 vehicles at a time for
several years. If the fuels are compatible with existing pumps and
engines, their use would be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The lab has about 1,200 employees in Morgantown and Pittsburgh,
and nearly $70 million of its annual $482.5 million budget goes
toward research on alternative fuels and fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells operate like batteries, generating electrochemical
power from a hydrogen-rich source like natural gas, methanol or
sewage waste, Hooie said. The anodes and cathodes that in a normal
battery actually supply the power in a fuel cell simply facilitate
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quiet, there's no waste and there are no moving parts,''
Hooie said.
</P>
<P>
   Some fuel cells are already commercially available but not yet
widely used. They have potential applications in luxury vehicles
and for long-haul truckers, who could use them for auxiliary power
as they rest.

<HEADLINE> Draft Registration Falling  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly one in five young American men are
failing to register for the military draft as required by law,
risking fines and jail as well as ineligibility for a wide array of
benefits including student loans and government jobs, the Selective
Service Administration says.
</P>
<P>
   In making the that announcement Wednesday, agency officials said
ignorance rather than willful resistance appears to be behind the
compliance numbers, which were at 93 percent a decade ago. ''Since
1990 we have seen an erosion of about 1 percent a year,'' said
agency spokesman Lewis Brodsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our research has consistently shown that the biggest barrier
to young men's compliance is a simple lack of awareness,'' said
Selective Service Director Gil Coronado. ''It's tragic to see young
men potentially missing out on future opportunities because they
just do not know they are required to register.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of not registering for whatever reasons, are
enormous,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley, who joined
Coronado at a news conference where they announced the formation of
partnerships with educational associations to get the word out to
young men.
</P>
<P>
   For men born in 1980 who are now 19 and 20 years old, the
compliance rate is about 83 percent, Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   A state-by-state survey issued by the agency showed some large
states had low registration levels among those men -- California
with 79 percent and Texas, 77 percent. New Hampshire, by contrast,
ranked highest with 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that all young men living inside the United
States and its territories register with the Selective Service
within 30 days of their 18th birthday. That includes immigrants and
non-citizen residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The names are gathered in case a national emergency should
require a military draft. Selective Service officials and members
of Congress at the news conference called the system an important
national ''insurance policy.'' They said the all-volunteer
enlistment policy of the armed services is working as intended in
peacetime. The last actual draft was in 1973 near the end of the
Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to register can cost young men their chance at student
loans and grants, job training, government jobs and citizenship for
male immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a felony punishable by up to five years in jail or
prison and a fine of up to $250,000, but such cases are rarely
prosecuted. The last prosecution was in 1985, agency officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make sure that any draft is as fair and as equitable as
possible, we've got to make sure we reach everyone,'' Brodsky said.
''And it's difficult to know who you're not reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But we suspect, based on the demographics we've seen, that
it's high school dropouts and immigrants'' who are not registering.
Brodsky said the agency is working with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service as well as schools to try to get more
immigrants to register.
</P>
<P>
   The Selective Service survey showed that the states with the
lowest compliance rates for men born in 1980 -- all of them under 80
percent -- are California, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and South
Carolina, all with a 79 percent rate; Texas, 77 percent; Louisiana,
74 percent, and Hawaii, 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The states with the best compliance -- all of them 90 percent or
better -- are New Hampshire, 95 percent; Maine and North Dakota, 93
percent; Iowa and Nebraska, 91 percent, and Minnesota, 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said there are now 13.5 million men in the Selective
Service data base whose ages range from 18 to 25. Men 26 and older
are not eligible for the draft. An estimated 1.6 million men age 18
to 25 have not complied with the law, he said.

<HEADLINE> New 'Brady' Movie Panned  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''The true story about the filming of 'The Brady
Bunch,''' says NBC, ''was often times as funny, and certainly more
dramatic, than the actual series.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But don't expect to see much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story of a nostalgia-obsessed culture that can't get
past its past -- that belches forth big-screen versions of ''Leave
it to Beaver,'' ''My Favorite Martian'' and, yes, ''The Brady
Bunch.'' A culture that produces two -- two! -- live-action
''Flintstones'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   And now we get the behind-the-scenes look at the Bradys. The
two-hour ''Growing Up Brady,'' airing Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on
NBC -- just days after an even more inept, more potboilerish Fox
one-hour effort called ''Brady Bunch: The Final Days'' -- purports
to chronicle the ''real story'' behind the hit TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Even giving it the benefit of the doubt -- namely, that it's
worth making in the first place, which is arguable -- ''Growing Up
Brady'' fails at what it sets out to do.
</P>
<P>
   With an edge and a real premise, it might have been watchable.
Its namesake, the book ''Growing Up Brady: I Was a Teen-age Greg,''
by Barry Williams, was an often readable, at times even insightful
tale about kids growing up in showbiz.
</P>
<P>
   Not the small-screen version.
</P>
<P>
   The only remotely intriguing things about it are watching the
talented DanielHugh Kelly suffer through a portrayal of Robert
Reed, seeing Michael Tucker (in glasses like Uncle Junior's from
''The Sopranos'') play producer Sherwood Schwartz, and zooming in
on a drooling Barry Williams (Adam Brody, who does well given the
material) when the apparently hot-to-trot Maureen ''Marcia''
McCormick (Kaley Cuoco) steps out of her jean shorts and into the
Williams family swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it's ''The Brady Bunch'' redux. It features the
same improbable family slapstick (the kids run afoul of security on
the Paramount lot and break things on the ''Star Trek'' sound
stage), the same quasi-wacky suburban bear-huggery (we're supposed
to believe the cast hummed the TV theme song in unison on the
set?), and the same early '70s, post-psychedelic camera wipes and
fades.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is portrayed as a troubled, cantankerous,
Shakespeare-trained actor who objected to much of the ''Brady''
scripting but dearly loved the kids who played his children -- an
accurate portrayal, by most accounts, if a sanitized one.
</P>
<P>
   But Florence Henderson, in reality a vibrant, engaging actress,
comes across in Rebeccah Bush's portrayal as entirely devoid of any
Wessonality. Eve Plumb (Jan), Chris Knight (Peter) and Mike
Lookinland (Bobby, played by Lookinland's real-life son) are
nonentities, and the character of Susan Olsen, who played Cindy, is
just plain annoying.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't surprising. ''The Brady Bunch'' was not the best of
1970s TV comedy. It simply tapped into a theme resonant at the time
-- that two suddenly single parents could ''somehow form a family''
out of the angst of the age -- and went from there.
</P>
<P>
   It being a comedy, the potential for depth was underplayed -- one
of Reed's major complaints.
</P>
<P>
   This was a serenely, almost obnoxiously happy family whose most
trying tribulations, it seemed, were broken noses, school
popularity issues and errant hair-dying experiences. At a time when
''All in the Family'' and, later, ''Maude'' were breaking new
ground in family-oriented sitcoms, the Bradys were all too happy to
look backward toward ''Leave it to Beaver'' while the boys grew
proto-Frampton hairdos and the girls mooned over Monkees.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it became a happy Gen-X staple -- right down to the
house that defined for so many post-Boomers how a nice white suburb
is supposed to look. And what the demographic wants, the
demographic gets.
</P>
<P>
   So now we have kids precocious beyond their years playing kids
precocious beyond their years. We have Barry Williams and Maureen
McCormick fooling around, Eve Plumb and Chris Knight fooling
around, Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen fooling around. We even
have Williams taking Henderson, his TV mom, on a date.
</P>
<P>
   There are musical numbers and tension, too: Will the network
renew for a second season? There are Hollywood machinations and
showbiz betrayal -- all nicely sanitary. And there's heartache:
Tiger the dog dies during the off-season. ''Tiger's untimely demise
was the first real Brady tragedy,'' Williams narrates, deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when the actors begin touring and are mobbed by fans,
we have this infuriatingly Cindy-worthy line from Susan Olsen
(Carly Schroeder, who nails Cindy on the nose): ''Now I know how
the Beatles felt.''
</P>
<P>
   This saccharine tribute to a saccharine show is fitting in its
circularity. Gen-Xers loved ''The Brady Bunch'' for what it was,
and for what it said about family and its role in modern life. But
it's long gone; several enfeebled sequels didn't last, and two
recent feature films with new casts succeeded only because of their
wink-nudge take on the Brady naivete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Growing Up Brady,'' though, lacks any irony -- just like the
show it chronicles. It's something you can afford to miss. Instead,
contemplate what might come next in our continual forward march
toward looking back: a biopic, perhaps, about the horse that
starred in ''Mr. Ed''?

<HEADLINE> WHO Debates How To Fight AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- World Health Organization members are debating how
to move forward in tackling the AIDS epidemic, with Brazil urging
the U.N. health agency to set up a global database of drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Wednesday of WHO's annual assembly, Brazilian
Health Minister Jose Serra proposed that WHO ''establish a
computerized database in order to provide member states with
information on prices of essential drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The call was backed by Uganda, Mexico and South Africa among
others, but received a cool initial response from WHO. Adviser
Michael Schultz said that maintaining a ''comprehensive and
reliable database on prices,'' rather than monitoring prices
locally, could strain the agency's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices change every week and to survey this on a worldwide
basis seems to be a humongous task for which WHO certainly today is
not equipped at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, five pharmaceutical companies -- Britain's Glaxo
Wellcome, Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche of Switzerland, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck and Co. of the United States --
announced a commitment to reduce the cost of medicines for
governments and agencies in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers have regularly complained that the cost of
patented AIDS drugs is so high that people in developing countries
are effectively blocked from receiving the care they need.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and South Africa were among countries that backed the
local production of drugs to cut prices. A final decision on the
WHO resolution is expected later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The medical aid group Doctors Without Borders strongly backed
Brazil's database proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The WHO and countries are here to ensure that the public
health of populations takes priority over private profit,'' Ellen
't Hoen of Doctors Without Borders said. ''Member states need
information and choice to ensure the best health care for their
people,'' including information on cheaper generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe made its own call for WHO ''to determine the best price
that could be obtained for a treatment regime for HIV/AIDS of
acceptable quality.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee of the WHO assembly is to meet again Friday to
discuss planned amendments to a resolution on HIV/AIDS, including
Brazil's, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution should provide a ''booster to enhance the
attention and the resources that are directed to the overall
response to HIV/AIDS,'' senior WHO policy adviser Daniel Tarantola
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Tarantola said the agreement could help clear the way to deal
with other problems, such as weak health services and uneven
distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high cost of drugs has in some cases been the tree that
was hiding the forest,'' he said. ''No one was really going beyond
that tree because the obstacle appeared to be so insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of the world's 33.6 million HIV-infected
people live in sub-Saharan Africa, where governments do not have
the resources to subsidize the medicine to an affordable level.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement brought a cautious welcome from some
governments and aid groups, who said they wanted to see more
details.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to qualify this with a lot of caution'' ahead of talks
with the companies involved, Tarantola said.

<HEADLINE> Clint Eastwood, Disabled Spar  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Actor Clint Eastwood is getting his day, if
not making it, in a battle with advocates for the disabled who say
his California hotel is in violation of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   A California woman has sued the actor, prompting an outcry from
Eastwood about what he says are frivolous lawsuits under the law
that target small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, angered by a request from the woman for more than
$500,000 in attorneys fees, planned to ask a House subcommittee
today to amend the 10-year-old law so businesses like his Mission
Ranch Hotel in Carmel, Calif., have more time to comply.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Florida Republicans Mark Foley and Clay Shaw
would require plaintiffs to give defendants notice of alleged
violations and then 90 days to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ''I totally support the ADA laws. I think people not in
compliance should get into compliance,'' Eastwood said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. But he added, ''I think there should
be a better way to get people in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Foley, ''I don't want to create an impediment to the ADA.
In fairness, businesses should be given a chance to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Eastwood, filed three years ago, claims the
former Carmel mayor violated ADA provisions in his 32-room Mission
Ranch Hotel and restaurant. At least one bathroom and the hotel
parking lot did not comply with the law and there were not enough
rooms accessible to the disabled, the suit claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rein, who represented plaintiff Diane Zum Brunnen in the
suit, said Eastwood's fight for notification is unfair to the
disabled.

   ''If a black person is not allowed to enter a business because
of his race, he's not required to send a letter. If a woman is not
allowed to ..., she's not required to send a letter. Why should
disabled persons be the only class of persons required to send
letters?'' Rein said.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood insists his hotel is in compliance and says he and
other small businesses are being preyed upon by money-seeking
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit demands $577,000 in attorneys fees. The disabled
cannot collect monetary damages under the law, although Rein says
the lawsuit does demand $25,000 for Brunnen under a California
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thinks I'm some stiff coming along that's going to roll
over,'' Eastwood said. ''I'm going to trial. I'm going to take it
before a judge and a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor said he is fighting for other small business owners as
well. ''A lot of people can't afford that. Somebody has got to
stand up for those people. Somebody has got to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocate for the disabled fear the fight could result in
weakening the law once lawmakers begin reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we open up this bill, there's no way to control the
number of amendments that may come forward,'' said Curt Decker,
executive director of the National Association of Protection and
Advocacy Systems. ''This is going to be a message to anybody that
has not complied... Despite a decade of legal requirements
nationally, they are basically being given a free ride for not
complying with the law.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 13-year-old boy accused of stabbing woman more than 60 times, killing her </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- An autopsy shows that a woman killed in
her home -- allegedly by her 13-year-old neighbor -- was stabbed more
than 60 times, the district attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary, real scary,'' said Koupa Samuels, 25, who lives in
an apartment complex next to the house where Darlyne Jules, 33, was
killed. ''I know I'm going to be looking for somewhere else soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jules' neighbor, Kareem Watts, was charged with murder and was
being held in a juvenile detention center without bail. He could
serve life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bucks County District Attorney Diane Gibbons said she knew of no
motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him if he understood. He just shook his head,'' said
District Justice Joanne V. Kline, adding that Watts showed no
emotion during a preliminary hearing early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's 7-year-old son, Alan Lubin, told police he saw
Watts sitting on top of his mother, who was lying on the sofa, and
stabbing her in the chest. Alan ran upstairs to his mother's
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, he and his younger brother found their mother
dead and ran to a neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   Watts lived near the victim, about 300 feet from his own
apartment and past a dilapidated playground and a few yards down a
tree-lined street.
</P>
<P>
   Jules, a native of Haiti, rented a white, Cape Cod-style home,
which was backed by a supermarket parking lot and the playground.
Morrisville is located across the Delaware River from Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Watts stabbed Jules in the head, face, neck, chest,
torso and arm, spattering blood around the room leaving her body
under a pile of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Her son told police that Watts entered the home Monday night
saying he needed to use the telephone. Later, Alan told authorities
he heard his mother screaming for someone to call police.
</P>
<P>
   Alan went downstairs and saw his mom lying on the couch with
Watts on top of her. He told police Watts had a knife in his hand
and was stabbing Jules in the chest while she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Alan ran back upstairs, calling to his mother but Watts
answered, saying that he was helping Jules with some clothing. In
the morning, the 7-year-old went back downstairs and found his
lifeless mother lying under a pile of clothes, and then ran for
help.
</P>
<P>
   Alan's younger brother and his newborn baby sister were also in
the house all night Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Watts' mother, Janice, told police she left their apartment
several times during the night to purchase crack cocaine and that
she had also gone looking for her son, who was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't do it,'' Janice Watts told WCAU-TV. ''I know he
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Court papers showed Janice Watts had pleaded guilty to a charge
of possession of crack cocaine in 1998. In the two years since
then, she had violated her probation at least once by using drugs,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Watts had been on probation until recently after pleading
''non-adversarial'' -- a juvenile court term equivalent to a guilty
plea -- two years ago to charges of simple assault and possession of
a weapon on school grounds, Bucks County Juvenile Court official
Bill Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said Watts, then 11, brought an air rifle or paintball gun
to a school and was involved in an altercation. He was placed in a
supervision program, which he completed successfully, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Henry Watts, 39, is serving time in a Delaware
prison on robbery charges, and had a 1992 robbery conviction in
Bucks County.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who knew Jules, who was an unemployed amateur artist,
said she was a kind woman who loved her children.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very nice, friendly, devoted to her kids,'' said Lee
Ann McClease, 26, who was pregnant at the same time as Jules. The
two women talked about having babies; Jules had had her newborn
just over a week before she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was too trusting and too friendly,'' said neighbor Mary
Singleton, 46.
</P>
<P>
   The Americana Terrace Apartments where Watts lived consists of
several two-story brick bunkers and fronts a stretch of road that
neighbors call ''apartment row.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were looking for the murder weapon on Wednesday. Officers
pulled on plastic gloves before they stepped inside the house,
which was surrounded with yellow crime-scene tape.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said all three of Jules' children were doing fine. The
boys were staying with their father, whom officials identified as
John Lubin, a Willingboro, N.J., truck driver.

<HEADLINE> Navy suspends four after sailor's drowning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST MILTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Four sailors assigned to the submarine
training unit at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Navy site have been
suspended following an alcohol-related boating accident that left
one sailor missing and presumed drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams, 19, James Orms, 19, Denis Rees, 19, and Gregg
Cissell, 20, have been suspended from training, Lt. Commander
George Saroch told the Times Union of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Charles Kegler, a 21-year-old sailor, were
suspended because they face criminal charges of providing alcohol
to minors. Cissell and Rees were suspended because they are
undergoing medical counseling. Orms has been charged with a boat
navigation violation.
</P>
<P>
   Saroch said the Navy is still determining what, if any,
disciplinary action will be taken against the sailors. A sixth
sailor, 20-year-old Matthew Weller, remains in training.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors and an 18-year-old female friend were on Saratoga
Lake at 3 a.m. Saturday, May 6 after a day of drinking when their
14-foot rowboat capsized. Aaron W. Binkerd, 19, of Indiana, is
missing and presumed drowned.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher in early trading
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22 points in the early
going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange held a 6-5
lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index was ahead 12 points and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index was up 3.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street opened in somewhat of a news vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The only economic news is the latest weekly jobless claims
figure, and there aren't any headline-grabbing earnings reports to
study.
</P>
<P>
   One story of interest is a Wall Street Journal article about
regulatory concerns over WorldCom's purchase of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In overseas trading, Tokyo share prices were sharply lower on
the heels of Wednesday's Wall Street weakness.
</P>
<P>
   However, stocks turned mostly higher in Europe. And bond prices
are fairly steady.

<HEADLINE> Psychiatrists Cancel Gay Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Psychiatric Association canceled a
scheduled panel discussion of whether homosexuality can be altered
through therapy, a move that has upset some self-described former
gays.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over what is known as reorientation therapy was
pulled from the APA's convention agenda on Wednesday after two
psychiatrists who contend that the subject is too politically
charged for scientific discussion withdrew from the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation led to a protest by Exodus International, a
non-denominational Christian organization that seeks to help gays
switch their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here as one representative for a virtually unseen but
sizable population,'' said Exodus' national board chairman, John
Paulk of Colorado Springs. ''I once lived as a gay man, but now I'm
heterosexual, something the American Psychiatric Association says
does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulk said he is a former drag queen who has two sons with his
wife, Anne, a former lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   The canceled debate was organized by Dr. Robert Spitzer, the
same person who spearheaded the APA's decision in 1973 to remove
homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. At the time, the
Columbia University psychiatry professor argued that homosexuality
does not meet the criteria necessary to be considered a mental
disorder, calling it instead an ''irregular'' form of sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Now Spitzer wants to explore whether homosexuality can be
reversed for some people. He contends that the only way to
determine whether that is possible is to conduct scientific
experiments and share information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no documentary evidence showing someone's sexual
preference can be changed by therapy,'' Spitzer said. ''There is
only anecdotal evidence, mostly from the therapists themselves,
claiming that what they do works. That's not very scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the other hand, there's no scientific evidence to show that
this is impossible,'' said Spitzer, who called the cancellation
distressing. ''It hasn't been studied.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 65; Nasdaq Down 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as
investors sought direction in a market facing rising interest rates
and a dearth of significant economic news.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 65.46 at 10,835.20.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 14.70 at 3,630.26, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 4.04 at 1,451.84.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell 2 3/16 to 55 13/16. The Wall Street Journal reported
today that federal antitrust enforcers have recommended blocking
WorldCom Inc.'s $115 billion buyout of Sprint because it would
violate antitrust law. WorldCom shares fell 1\ to 40}.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose 7 17/64 to 64~. After the close of trading Wednesday,
the company reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal
third quarter. Analysts said investors were pleased with the
earnings report, but remain wary of the stock due to concerns about
the proposed takeover of Lycos by Spain's Terra Networks SA.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet as investors continued to
scout a new path in a market facing higher interest rates. The
Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other -- to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating borrowing costs make it tougher to borrow money to
finance growth. Ultimately, that can cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 111.14 million
shares, compared with 115.57 million at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.91 to 498.75.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.1 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.1 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Suspect arrested in vandalism of church statues in Brooklyn  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who police say confessed to participating
in a series of vandalism attacks on Roman Catholic statues in
Brooklyn told investigators he was following orders from God,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told us that he believed that God had told him to do it --
that the Bible suggested to him that he should not worship graven
images,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Primus St. Croix allegedly led a group of less than a dozen
followers, but has named only two who allegedly helped him damage
statues of the Virgin Mary, saints and other religious figures,
said Deputy Inspector Barbara Sicilia, head of the NYPD's Hate
Crime Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Police said St. Croix, 34, confessed to participating in five of
the 11 vandalism incidents but he and his followers are believed to
be responsible for the bulk of them. St. Croix confessed to
vandalizing three churches, a Knights of Columbus hall and a
convent.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix, an illegal alien from St. Lucia, was arrested Tuesday
night near his apartment in Manhattan's Morningside Heights section
after a tip was called in to the NYPD's Crime Stoppers, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was arraigned early today in Brooklyn on charges
including second-degree criminal mischief, a felony punishable by
up to 2{ years in prison. He was ordered held on $100,000 bail, and
is due back in court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix told police he was baptized Catholic but does not
practice the religion, Sicilia said.
</P>
<P>
   While police interviewed the suspect, he quoted often from the
Bible, and Sicilia said several verses stood out when St. Croix
discussed Deuteronomy, Chapter 12, verses one through five.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that passage reads: ''Break down their altars, smash
their sacred stones ... cut down the idols of their gods and wipe
out their names from those places. You must not worship the Lord
your God in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix admitted to vandalizing statues in the incidents where
the figures' hands or heads had been cut off, Sicilia said. Other
statues were marred without any parts being removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's showing by destroying them, he's showing people that it's
only material, it's stone, it's broken, there's nothing spiritual
here,'' Sicilia explained.
</P>
<P>
   The places vandalized were apparently chosen at random -- most
are near where St. Croix used to live in Brooklyn. A self-employed
day laborer who works in the demolition and construction field, St.
Croix moved to Manhattan about a month ago to live with his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He told police he sought out statues early Sunday mornings
because he knew the damage would affect people going to church,
Sicilia said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would get up, feel this message to do it, and whatever
church came across his path, was the one,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix said he used a sledgehammer, and police were looking
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeRosa, spokesman for the Diocese of Brooklyn, said
parishioners are encouraged that there's been an arrest in some of
the incidents, but saddened at the reason for the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statues of Jesus, or of the Blessed Mother or the saints
are there to remind us how to live the Christian life -- there is no
idolatry involved,'' DeRosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The vandalism began last Sept. 26 at St. Jerome's Roman Catholic
Church in Flatbush where a statue of the Virgin Mary was knocked to
the ground, its face and hands destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The next desecration was on Oct. 24 at Our Lady of Refuge Church
in Flatbush. A statue of the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus was
knocked down, its head missing.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, the vandals struck three churches, a convent
and a private residence over two days. Police said St. Croix
confessed to the January incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In others, a sculpture of Pope Pius X was dragged away and
smashed, a Jesus statue was toppled, and religious objects at four
other churches, a monastery, and a private home were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix faces five counts of second-degree criminal mischief,
five counts of third-degree criminal mischief and five counts of
first-degree aggravated harassment. The top count of second-degree
criminal mischief carries up to seven years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party boss says looks like Giuliani running  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of the state Conservative Party
says ''it looks more and more'' as if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will
continue in the U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The politically savvy Michael Long said Wednesday he was not
basing his opinion on personal conversations with the mayor -- they
have been at political odds -- but on developments over the past
several days and his conversations with other politicians,
including Republican leaders from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Giuliani said he still had not chosen a treatment
for his prostate cancer, a decision he has said will help him
determine if he can stay in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't anticipate that I'll be in a position to make that
decision today,'' Giuliani said at a news conference. He said
choosing a cancer treatment has been ''a much more difficult
decision than I thought it would be,'' adding that ''I'm not
leaning'' toward any particular treatment at this point.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bruce Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager,
did confirm that Brendan Quinn, a former top aide to state GOP
Chairman William Powers who is now working for the Giuliani
campaign, had been dispatched to Buffalo to begin preparations for
the Republican state convention that will be held there May 30.
That convention is to nominate a Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''People shouldn't draw any inference from that except that the
campaign is moving forward,'' Teitelbaum said. ''The convention is
in two weeks and we have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that Giuliani has not scrapped plans for a
Senate run, several Republican leaders from across the state have
been invited to join him at a televised town hall forum in
Manhattan tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel committed to do it and I will do it,'' Giuliani said
this morning, referring to the evening forum.
</P>
<P>
   The estrangement between Long and Giuliani, over the mayor's
continued support of abortion rights and his closeness with Liberal
Party boss Raymond Harding, was in evidence Wednesday night as the
Conservative Party held its annual fund-raising dinner at a
Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974
without Conservative Party backing and the mayor was not even
invited to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never been endorsed by the Conservative Party,'' Long
explained. ''He goes to the Liberal Party's dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp is fond of pointing out that no Democrat has
been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York without Liberal
Party backing since the party was founded more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the featured speakers at the Wednesday night dinner were
Republican Gov. George Pataki, who while a backer of Giuliani's
Senate bid has had chilly relations with the mayor. Also on the
dinner's dais, but not speaking, was former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi,
the Westchester County Republican who is seeking Conservative Party
backing with Long's blessing for a Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   That means Pataki could be helping to raise money for a party
that could then spend it against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to the dinner because he's a friend of Mike Long
and because the Conservative Party supports him,'' Pataki
spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said before the governor's attendance at
the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to facing cancer, Giuliani is also going through
very public marital woes. On Friday night, just days after
announcing that he and his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover, were
discussing a separation, the mayor took a very public stroll after
dinner with his self-described ''very good friend,'' Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Long said that while he thought the mayor would continue to run
for Senate, he also felt ''more and more Republicans want him out''
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the perfect scenario for Mike Long and the Conservative
Party,'' Long said. ''The Quinnipiac poll showed us at this moment
at 5 percent and that's without a campaign yet and without anybody
knowing'' our candidate. ''Some of my own leaders don't know who's
running.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll Tuesday from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute had
Clinton at 42 percent, Giuliani at 41 percent and DioGuardi at 5
percent among New York's registered voters asked about a possible
three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DioGuardi announced that he had sent letters to
Pataki and all members of the Republican state committee asking
them to get behind his candidacy.

   Protests set at Presbyterian, Episcopal conventions debating gay
issues
</P>
<P>
   LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Demonstrations are planned for the
June national assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the
July convention of the Episcopal Church to protest their policies
against homosexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   The group planning the protests, Soulforce, staged a sit-in
outside the hall May 10 while the Archbishop of Canterbury preached
to a United Methodist Church conference in Cleveland. Nearly 200
participants were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian ''direct action'' is scheduled June 25 as
delegates to a national assembly in Long Beach, Calif., hold Sunday
worship. The Episcopal Church protest will occur sometime during a
July 5-14 convention in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian and Episcopal meetings will both debate
blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   Soulforce said it also plans ''spiritual resistance'' ongoing
protests during Sunday worship at local Presbyterian and Methodist
congregations that support their denominations' stands.
</P>
<P>
   Soulforce is led by the Rev. Mel White, a minister in the
largely homosexual Metropolitan Community Churches based in West
Hollywood, Calif. Soulforce accuses many denominations of
discrimination against their gay and lesbian members.

United Methodists declare Mormonism outside Christian tradition
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A new United Methodist Church policy statement
declares that the Mormon church, ''by self-definition, does not fit
within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of the
Christian faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper says this means Mormons who become Methodists should
be treated as converts from another faith and undergo baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church is the third largest U.S.
denomination, with 8.4 million members, while the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints ranks seventh, with 5 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, approved at a Methodist conference without debate,
says Mormonism has ''some radically differing doctrine on such
matters of belief as the nature and being of God; the nature,
origin, and purpose of Jesus Christ; and the nature and way of
salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Methodists say Mormonism believes in a ''gendered, married
and procreating god'' with ''a body of flesh and bones,'' and
''more closely resembles a tritheistic or possibly a polytheistic
faith'' than monotheism.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodists also object that ''the Jesus of Mormonism is not
co-eternal with the Father'' and that Mormons add other scriptures
to the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, Utah, the Mormon church responded:
''Latter-day Saints embrace both ancient and modern revelations
that proclaim Jesus Christ as the living, divine Son of God, the
Savior and Redeemer of the world. Any assertion otherwise
demonstrates a lack of knowledge of Latter-day Saint doctrine and
teachings.''

Anglican Church relying on Canadian government for financial
survival
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- The Anglican Church of Canada,
the nation's third largest religious body, hopes to avoid
bankruptcy through help from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The national executive board met to discuss the denomination's
declining finances and lawsuits alleging abuse at church
residential schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without federal assistance our resources will soon be
exhausted, leading to bankruptcy. This would massively disrupt our
ability to participate in healing and reconciliation,'' said a
church statement.
</P>
<P>
   Church legal costs over the abuse claims reached 1.5 million
Canadian dollars in 1999 and another $112,000 in the first three
months of 2000. The church says about 1,600 suits against the
national denomination and dioceses are asking total damages of more
than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Anglican Church and federal government are both
named in many of the lawsuits, general secretary Jim Boyles said
Anglicans hope the government will help the church.

Federal judge again orders Ten Commandments removed
</P>
<P>
   LONDON, Ky. (AP) -- A federal judge has denied a motion from two
counties and a school district to keep posting the Ten Commandments
while they appeal a ruling to take down the document.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jennifer Coffman said the displays should be
removed because McCreary and Pulaksi counties and the Harlan County
public schools are unlikely to win an appeal of a suit won by the
American Civil Liberties Union on grounds of church-state
separation.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Ray, attorney for the counties and schools, said the Ten
Commandments, displayed with other documents such as the
Declaration of Independence, are intended to show the history of
American law. But the judge's order said a ''reasonable observer''
would conclude the displays were religious, not secular.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a
resolution that encouraged schools to post the Ten Commandments and
called for restoration of a monument to them at the state capitol.

Some parents question Wisconsin school's religious ''released
time''
</P>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Wis. (AP) -- Some parents are raising questions about a
new plan to let students spend an hour a week of public school time
at churches learning about religion.
</P>
<P>
   If 80 percent of students in the Augusta district sign up, the
''released time'' class program will begin in September.
</P>
<P>
   A school letter told parents that students who wish would be
bused each Friday to churches while non-participating students
attend study hall. Educational costs would be covered by religious
groups offering the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents objected that the program would leave out certain
students, force others to attend different congregations from those
of their families, or usurp parents' responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just allowing an activity. It's promoting,'' said one
mother, Wendy Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   But Jody Hahn, school board vice president, said, ''With
everything that's happening in schools, we see this as a chance to
do something for the students besides metal detectors and drug
dogs.''

Museum honoring evangelist Billy Sunday opens
</P>
<P>
   WINONA LAKE, Ind. (AP) -- Sixty-five years after the death of
athlete-turned-evangelist Billy Sunday, his bungalow, restored for
$400,000, has opened as the Billy Sunday Home Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and visitors center were funded mostly by state
grants.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, who preached to an estimated 100 million people, built a
50,000-square-foot tabernacle near his tiny home and hosted annual
Bible conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War I, Winona Lake audiences slimmed and the
town's central district deteriorated. The area has been reborn
through the $15 million Village at Winona commercial development.

Presbyterian seminary president resigns before misconduct verdict
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANSELMO, Calif. (AP) -- The president of San Francisco
Theological Seminary resigned days before a Presbyterian church
tribunal convicted him on two counts of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donald McCullough wrote seminary trustees that he was
stepping down because of ''inappropriate conduct'' before joining
the school.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk of San Francisco Presbytery said McCullough faced two
charges of ''sexual abuse.'' McCullough and the seminary
administration would not elaborate on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A church source told the San Francisco Chronicle the trial
stemmed from McCullough's involvement with two adult women staffers
at a San Diego church he served.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing to determine punishment is scheduled May 22.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in quiet trading today as
investors sought direction in a market facing rising interest rates
and a dearth of significant economic news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is just marking time,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ''We have buyers
and sellers just waiting it out for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 23.65 at 10,793.39.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 66.94 at 3,578.02, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 5.66 at 1,442.14.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell 1} to 56\. The Wall Street Journal reported today
that federal antitrust enforcers have recommended blocking WorldCom
Inc.'s $115 billion buyout of Sprint because it would violate
antitrust law. WorldCom shares fell 1{ to 40{.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose 5 5/64 to 62 11/16. After the close of trading
Wednesday, the company reported better-than-expected results for
its fiscal third quarter. Analysts said investors were pleased with
the earnings report, but remain wary of the stock due to concerns
about the proposed takeover of Lycos by Spain's Terra Networks SA.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet as investors continued to
scout a new path in a market facing higher interest rates. The
Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other -- to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating borrowing costs make it tougher to borrow money to
finance growth. Ultimately, that can cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lingering case of interest rate jitters,'' Ackerman
said. ''There are not many who believe the Fed is near the end of
its rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, were modestly higher today. J.P. Morgan rose 2 to
134| and American Express rose 13/16 to 51}. Merrill Lynch rose 3
11/16 to 111 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 379.84 million
shares, compared with 388.56 million at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.29 to 495.37.

By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At the end of Cardinal John O'Connor's life,
union leaders took out a full-page New York Times ad proclaiming
him the ''patron saint of working people.'' Some labor activists
say his successor, Bishop Edward Egan, has been hostile to unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bishop came across as being pretty much anti-union,'' said
Paul Fortier, formerly vice president of the New England Health
Care Employees Union District 1199, who picketed Egan's Bridgeport,
Conn., cathedral during 1996 negotiations at a Catholic hospital.
Cemetery workers made a similar charge in a separate dispute; a
labor representative, Robert Barber, said Egan hired a law firm to
''break the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan responded that he is committed to worker rights. ''The
Catholic Church has a long-standing tradition of support for
working men and women. We will always stay true to that
tradition,'' he said Tuesday through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't necessarily mean supporting unions, but rather
letting employees decide whether to organize, spokesman Tom Drohan
said. ''The diocese of Bridgeport does not want to put employees in
a position that they have to pay union dues if they don't want to
pay dues,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   To union leaders, however, such ''open shop'' arrangements
lessen workers' bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has long lauded organized labor. Pope John
Paul II's 1981 encyclical, ''On Human Work,'' calls unions ''a
mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the century, the American Catholic church was known
for its labor activists, including ''worker priests'' who joined
immigrant laborers on the picket line. The son of a union
craftsman, O'Connor was among the most outspoken supporters of the
right to organize and was known for mediating labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, the son of a businessman, ''is not cut from the same cloth
as labor priests from an earlier generation,'' says John Russo,
coordinator of labor studies at Youngstown University. Among
bishops today, he is more the norm than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may be supportive of labor unions in certain areas,''
Russo said, ''but within Catholic institutions they keep them at
arm's length.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Michael Cemetery in Stratford, Conn., was unionized during
the 1930s. While the eight newer Catholic cemeteries in Egan's
Bridgeport diocese have all been nonunion, the diocese extended the
benefits negotiated at St. Michael to all cemetery workers for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, a Bridgeport law firm the diocese retained to
negotiate with St. Michael called for another approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recommended that it would be more efficient and proper to be
nonunion,'' says lawyer Terry Durant. ''You have to look at the big
picture. When so many cemeteries were nonunion, it made more sense
to be nonunion. (The bishop's) finance people agreed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drohan calls Durant's proposal ''a starting position'' that was
not anti-union. Barber, a former laborer who was the workers' union
representative, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing was set up by the diocese to break the union,''
said Barber, who believes the diocese worried the union was going
to organize all the cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Gravediggers picketed the bishop's house and Sunday Masses,
citing papal encyclicals on the right to collective bargaining, and
asked parishioners to skip the Sunday collection until the dispute
was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the workers went on strike. Union leaders say they
agreed to an open-shop clause only to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Brown, president of the New England Health Care Employees
Union District 1199, said similar tensions arose during
negotiations at St. Camillus Health Center in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 letter, Brown said Egan had ordered the management of
St. Camillus to demand an open-shop contract for the workers, whom
he described as 100 mostly Haitian immigrants earning as little as
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the bishop's insistence on conditions that would
render the workers weak and poor is wrong and in violation of
Church teachings,'' Brown wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Durant, the labor lawyer who also represented the diocese in
this case, said the bishop never tried to prevent a union. ''Our
initial position was that it would be up to the employees,'' he
said of management's open-shop proposal. ''That was the bishop's
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   After the workers threatened to strike, the diocese agreed to a
modified union shop, in which current employees have the option of
joining and future employees are required to join.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had to be demonstrated that employees wanted something
other than an open shop,'' Drohan said. ''When they demonstrated,
they got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Egan's elevation earlier this month to archbishop of New
York, a city with a recent history of close ties between church and
labor, union leaders have voiced hope that he will become more like
O'Connor.
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Panel: Repeal Telephone Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a unanimous vote to get rid of a
102-year-old telephone tax, the House Ways and Means Committee is
turning its attention to Republican legislation to gradually repeal
the estate tax -- a measure that has substantial Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   The leading version of the estate tax bill, sponsored by Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., has attracted 237 co-sponsors, including 44
Democrats. The committee is scheduled to vote on the bill next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Death by itself should not trigger a tax,'' said the committee
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would be patterned after a provision in last year's
$792 billion tax bill that was vetoed by President Clinton, Dunn
said. To reduce the cost, estate taxes would be reduced gradually
in the first five years and then cut more dramatically in later
years at a cost of roughly $65 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference today, Archer and Dunn appeared with five
Democrats to demonstrate the broad support the bill now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill transcends the usual ideological categories of left
and right,'' said Rep. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including members of the Clinton administration,
frequently attack estate tax cuts as primarily benefiting the rich,
but Dunn said a coalition including farmers, small-business people
and environmental groups concerned about land conservation are
supporting its repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., is among 10 members of the
Congressional Black Caucus who are co-sponsoring the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The very rich are not paying it because they know how to get
around it,'' Clayton said. ''This tax disproportionately falls on
the people who can't adjust their accounts ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Ways and Means Committee voted unanimously
Wednesday to repeal over three years the 3 percent telephone excise
tax imposed originally to finance the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan support for the bill, which the full House is likely
to pass next week, was tempered by a letter from Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers expressing support for the concept but warning
that its five-year, $20 billion cost must be considered in an
overall budget and spending blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the only reason the
102-year-old tax has survived so long is that ''it is awfully hard
to stop Washington bureaucrats from taking tax dollars from
hard-working taxpayers,'' even as federal budget surpluses continue
to swell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will move forward to repeal the Spanish-American War tax
because it is plain common sense,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the 3 percent tax would be reduced to 2 percent
30 days after it becomes law. It would drop to 1 percent on Oct. 1,
2001, and would be fully repealed on Oct. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The tax has been repealed on two previous occasions but was
brought back in different forms to pay for World War I and World
War II and then increased to help fund the Vietnam War. It was made
permanent in 1990, with the money going into the general treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's misgivings, repealing the telephone tax
appears to be gaining unstoppable momentum in Congress similar to
unanimous repeal of the Social Security earnings limit passed
earlier this year. Both issues have been around for years but have
never before been moved without unrelated, more controversial
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's appropriate and I hope that it's done soon,''
said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal bill is H.R. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone tax repeal bill is H.R. 3916.

<HEADLINE> PBS Alone in Convention Enthusiasm  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Call him old-fashioned, but Jim Lehrer is
looking forward to covering the Republican and Democratic national
conventions this summer. That makes him something of a dying breed
in television.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer will anchor three hours of convention coverage each night
for PBS, easily the most extensive reporting available to any
television viewer without cable or a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a public service as well as a journalistic
responsibility,'' the ''NewsHour'' anchor said.
</P>
<P>
   While ABC, CBS and NBC haven't nailed down their plans yet, the
bad memories of 1996's disastrous ratings and scripted, sanitized
conventions are still fresh. This may be the year conventions
virtually disappear from prime-time for the big networks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are meeting to nominate George W. Bush for president
in Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 3. Democrats nominate Al Gore
for the presidency in Los Angeles from Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions were high-profile, starmaking events for network
news teams in television's infancy. Not only were they occasionally
suspenseful, they were among the few big events that broadcasters
were able to plan for well in advance, said broadcast consultant
Andrew Tyndall.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been decades since nominations were decided at the
conventions, and party leaders now work to minimize any signs of
conflict so the gatherings don't look bad on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are no longer news events,'' Tyndall said. ''They're
propaganda events.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1996 conventions, networks had already cut back on
airtime. With some variations, ABC, CBS and NBC carried one hour
each of coverage on the conventions' first three nights, and more
on the last night when the nominees gave their acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Even the limited time left viewers cold: Ratings were down 26
percent from 1992 for the Republicans and 18 percent for the
Democrats, according to Nielsen Media Research. The biggest media
story four years ago was Ted Koppel and his ABC ''Nightline'' crew
abandoning the GOP event, saying nothing newsworthy was happening.
</P>
<P>
   During primary season this year, the broadcast networks
essentially ceded extended political coverage to CNN, Fox News
Channel and MSNBC. Expect more of the same for the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I think it's fair to say we've committed only
to showing the acceptance speeches of the nominees,'' said NBC News
vice president Bill Wheatley.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is tentatively planning an hour each on the Tuesdays and
Wednesdays of each week, more on the night of the nominees'
speeches, said Marc Burstein, executive producer. CBS said it
hasn't decided how much time the story will get in prime-time.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is very little news that comes out of the conventions
anymore and consequently what you end up getting is a lot like an
infomercial,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandra Genelius. ''We're not in
the infomercial business.''
</P>
<P>
   Each network stresses that it has the flexibility to respond to
breaking stories. For example, NBC can easily replace a ''Dateline
NBC'' episode with a convention special if it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer said PBS will strive for a middle ground between the
gavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN and the more limited approach of
the networks. After two years of working in partnership with NBC
News, PBS is going it alone this time; NBC's news team now has
MSNBC as an outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions serve as the kick-off to the general election
campaign and it's where most Americans first focus on the choice
ahead of them, Lehrer said.
</P>
<P>
   People who argue that the conventions are like infomercials
forget that many news events -- like presidential addresses -- are
also scripted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where do you stop?'' he asked. ''I think when the major
political parties of this country gather together their people and
resources in one place to nominate their candidates, that's
important. To me, it's a non-argument. I don't see why someone
would argue that it wasn't important.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS also has a business reason for showing the conventions.
Unlike the Big Three, ratings go up for the public broadcasting
system and the cable news networks for big political events. PBS'
viewership on the final night of the 1996 Democratic convention was
63 percent higher than it would have been on an August night with
no convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer isn't sure whether a pullback in coverage by ABC, CBS and
NBC would help increase PBS' viewership this year. He's likely to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will leave them to their own decisions,'' he said. ''I have
a different view.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Director Faces War Memories  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Twenty-seven years ago on Yom Kippur, the
most solemn day of the Jewish calendar, an Israeli student named
Amos Gitai was called up for army duty. Syria had just launched a
surprise attack. War had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Gitai, who narrowly escaped death in a missile attack, is now a
prominent Israeli director, and ''Kippur'' is his attempt to come
to terms with his wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be more apt; Israel is now considering a
return of the disputed Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But if appearing at Cannes is a personal triumph for Gitai --
he's in the competition for the second year in a row, a rare feat --
his film is less of a triumph. Drawn-out war scenes take the place
of any real plot or character development. In the end, it seems
more like a documentary than a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Gitai drew much attention last year, as the first Israeli
director to make the competition in a quarter-century. His film,
''Kadosh,'' was a brutal look at the cloistered world of
ultra-Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Gitai is a director who never shies away from tackling
unpleasant issues head-on. But he often takes too long to do it. In
both ''Kadosh'' and ''Kippur,'' one wishes he'd left more on the
cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene of ''Kippur'' is a glimpse of an Israeli
street on Yom Kippur. It is a strong image; Yom Kippur is the one
day when Israel shuts down completely. On normally bustling
streets, there isn't a car to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then the film shifts to an interior scene of a couple slowly
covering themselves with fingerpaint. They begin to have sex. We
don't know who they are (later we realize the man is Weinraub,
Gitai's autobiographical character.) The scene feels like it lasts
10 minutes. Why is it here? Hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sirens sound; Weinraub and his buddy Ruso head off to
the front. Ruso exults: ''Hey, this is real war, and finally we're
the right age!'' As in so many war movies, it won't take long for
such youthful enthusiasm to be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the best war movies, we get a chance to know the
characters, so we're ready to mourn if they die. Gitai doesn't take
the time to bring us close to these young men.
</P>
<P>
   Weinraub and Ruso hook up with an air force rescue unit. They
spend their time in a helicopter, evacuating the dead and wounded
from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   There are traditional war-movie images: a soldier looking
pensively out of the helicopter as the propellers roar; another who
suddenly cracks, overwhelmed by the horror. Again, it would have
been better to know these characters more.
</P>
<P>
   A few scenes work well. Gitai's slow style succeeds in a scene
where soldiers are trying to haul a wounded comrade on a stretcher
through the mud. They keep stumbling; they can't carry him and move
forward at the same time. The scene conveys how exhausting even the
simplest tasks can be in war.
</P>
<P>
   Also effective is a helicopter crash. Gitai survived a missile
attack on his helicopter while on a rescue mission behind enemy
lines and must have engraved it in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, a missile hits and suddenly soldiers are covered in
blood and moaning in pain. The co-pilot is dead. A doctor treats
the wounded despite being horribly injured himself. Then the badly
damaged aircraft crashes to the ground. For a long moment there is
only silence, until the men finally start trying to move.
</P>
<P>
   Gitai makes no secret of his political motives. In ''Kadosh,''
he criticized what he saw as the oppressive nature of Orthodox
Jewish life. In ''Kippur,'' he's making an anti-war statement at a
decisive moment in Israel's political life, with the country
struggling toward peace accords with both Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always thought that cinema is an effective way to have a
dialogue with the country,'' Gitai says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll leave political decisions to the politicians, but if
someone has the crazy idea of going to war again, let them first
look very well at the images of this one.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged INS Spy Trial Begins  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Jurors in the trial of an immigration official
accused of spying watched an FBI surveillance video today showing
the man meeting with a top Cuban diplomat in a Miami hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, a veteran Immigration and Naturalization Service
official, is charged with violating the Espionage Act by failing to
report meetings with Cuban officials and passing on classified
information about a Cuban defector that was given to him during an
FBI sting.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, shot in October at a Hilton Hotel, Faget and Jose
Imperatori, a diplomat at the Cuban Interest Section in Washington,
sit at a small table in a lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 54, then the acting district deputy director at the INS
office in Miami, can be seen talking and gesturing as Imperatori
nods his head.
</P>
<P>
   FBI specialist John Victoravich, who recorded the silent video,
said the meeting lasted about two hours, although he captured only
a few moments on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''To obtain photographic evidence of the two of them together
was our objective, and that's what I did,'' Victoravich said.
</P>
<P>
   Faget has acknowledged meeting with Imperatori but said it was
to talk about potential business opportunities in a post-embargo
Cuba, not to relay U.S. secrets. The case led to Imperatori's
expulsion from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During opening statements Wednesday, defense attorney Edward
O'Donnell said Faget meant no harm when he alerted longtime friend
Pedro Font that a former Cuban diplomat wanted to defect.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, Faget was shown secret documents
and told that the Cuban official was about to defect. He allegedly
called Font minutes later and passed on the information. Font, a
Cuban-American, is a childhood friend of Faget's.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell told jurors his client acted out of concern for an old
friend and would never have done anything to compromise national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Dick Gregorie told the jury that as a
high-ranking official, Faget had access to secret government files.
</P>
<P>
   Gregorie also alleges Faget and Font created a corporation to
conduct business with Cuba, and while Font and other partners put
up money, Faget had nothing to give except his status as a
government official.
</P>
<P>
   Faget has been held without bond since his arrest and faces up
to 10 years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Feds Urge New R.R. Merger Rule Fast  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater called
Thursday for speedy completion of new rules governing railroad
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board, which regulates railroads, in
March imposed a 15-month moratorium on railroad mergers while it
studies the problems that resulted from combinations in the 1990s
and rewrites its merger rules.
</P>
<P>
   That step blocked the pending merger between Canadian National
and Burlington Northern. The railroads have asked a federal court
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, in comments filed Thursday on the board's action, said
the board needs to be more vigorous in assessing the benefits and
risks of proposed mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Slater cautioned the board, which is part of his department, not
to ignore the current needs of the rail industry to respond to a
constantly changing market and urged it to act quickly to finish
the rulemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said that in its new rules the board should take
steps to avoid post-merger service breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Among his suggestions were indemnification of shippers, short
line railroads, Amtrak and commuter railroads if significant
service problems occur following a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The board, formerly the Interstate Commerce Commission, took
action on railroad mergers following a series of service problems
in the wake of mergers in the 1990s, including the Union
Pacific-Southern Pacific merger and the breakup of Conrail.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian National and Burlington Northern Santa Fe announced
their proposed $6 billion deal Dec. 20. They planned to form a new
company, North American Railways, creating a system stretching
50,000 miles connecting eight Canadian provinces and 33 states in
the western and central United States.
</P>
<P>
   The board refused to let the two railroads proceed, saying that
its ''current regulations are inadequate to address what will
likely turn out to be the final round of North American rail
restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We must adopt new rules before any major transactions can be
considered,'' the regulators said.

<HEADLINE> Antidepressant Can Boost Sex Drive  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Some women with troublingly low sex drive gained
help from an antidepressant even though they weren't depressed, a
study found.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of eight weeks, 15 of 51 participants had responded
to the drug, bupropion, with their condition rated as much
improved.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary study was led by Dr. R. Taylor Segraves of the
Case Western University School of Medicine in Cleveland. Segraves
was scheduled to present the results Thursday at a meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   The work was financed by Glaxo Wellcome Inc., which markets the
drug as Wellbutrin SR.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the study had been diagnosed with ''hypoactive
sexual desire disorder.'' It is marked by deficient or no sexual
fantasies and desire for sex, causing the person distress. There
are no exact figures on how common it is, but surveys find at least
20 percent of women complain of a persistent lack of sexual desire.
It is more common in women.
</P>
<P>
   It has a variety of causes, including early sex abuse, a
troubled marriage and hormonal problems. Doctors use a variety of
therapies, including psychotherapy and testosterone injections.
</P>
<P>
   But they need more options, said Raymond Rosen, director of the
sexual pharmacology research unit at the Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School in Piscataway, N.J. He called the new study a
significant advance.
</P>
<P>
   Bupropion boosts the brain's production of dopamine, a chemical
messenger linked to sexual desire, Segraves said.
</P>
<P>
   Study participants, whose average age was 41, started to get the
drug after four weeks on a placebo. During that placebo phase, none
improved. But the women began responding as early as two weeks
after going on the antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Women's interest in sex increased from an average of about one
episode per two weeks at the end of the placebo phase to 2.3
episodes per two weeks by the end of their eight weeks on
bupropion. The average number of episodes of sexual arousal per two
weeks rose from 1.3 to 2.4, and of sexual fantasy from 0.7 to 1.8.
</P>
<P>
   Five women stopped taking the drug because they developed a rash
or hives.

<HEADLINE> Specter Advocates Embryo Research  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cure for Lou Gehrig's disease -- a fatal
malady that robs its victims of the ability to control even basic
movements such as swallowing -- might be found faster if only
Congress would allow research using human embryos, Sen. Arlen
Specter said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, R-Pa., long a supporter of stem cell research, once
again waded into the mire of embryo research as witnesses before a
Senate panel asked for more federal funding to find a cure for the
disease, also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cry at the thought of not being able to tell my husband and
daughter that I love them, and I weep at the thought of my father
burying another child,'' 32-year-old victim Shelbie Oppenheimer of
New Hope, Pa., told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
labor, health and human services and education, the panel that
controls funding of health research.
</P>
<P>
   ALS attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Stem cells
are the basic or primordial cells from which all human tissues and
organs develop. By themselves, the cells can't grow into a person.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has not funded any research into
embryonic stem cells because of a 1996 congressional ban on any
research that destroys human embryos -- and taking stem cells from
embryos does destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Specter praised a decision by the National Institutes
of Health to fund experiments using lab-grown stem cells derived
from aborted fetuses and from unused embryos from infertility
treatments. His stand was decried by some anti-abortion groups that
call stem cell research morally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH will spend $20 million this year to find a cure for ALS,
which is often called Lou Gehrig's disease in honor of the New York
Yankee first baseman who died of it in 1941. Funding for ALS
research has been steadily increasing over the years. NIH's total
budget is $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Fischbach, the government's lead researcher on brain
diseases, said researchers feel a ''cautious optimism that stopping
ALS and other neurological disorders is a realistic goal.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ''the problems ALS presents are complex and
medical progress is notoriously difficult to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischbach, director of NIH's National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, said he believes embryonic stem cells could
be helpful in developing a cure because they could create neurons
to replace those destroyed by ALS.
</P>
<P>
   Television actor Blair Underwood also urged more funding. ''We
are on the threshold of great progress in the treatment of ALS,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, the star of the CBS show ''City of Angels,'' said he
a was a caregiver to his maternal grandmother, who died of ALS in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., urged passage of legislation that
would waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for
ALS patients.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 24; Nasdaq Down 58  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in quiet trading today as
investors sought direction in a market facing rising interest rates
and a dearth of significant economic news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is just marking time,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ''We have buyers
and sellers just waiting it out for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 24.33 at 10,794.07.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 58.04 at 3,586.92, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 5.84 at 1,441.96.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell 1} to 56\. The Wall Street Journal reported today
that federal antitrust enforcers have recommended blocking WorldCom
Inc.'s $115 billion buyout of Sprint because it would violate
antitrust law. WorldCom shares fell 1~ to 40[.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose 5 25/64 to 63. After the close of trading Wednesday,
the company reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal
third quarter. Analysts said investors were pleased with the
earnings report, but remain wary of the stock due to concerns about
the proposed takeover of Lycos by Spain's Terra Networks SA.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet as investors continued to
scout a new path in a market facing higher interest rates. The
Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other -- to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating borrowing costs make it tougher to borrow money to
finance growth. Ultimately, that can cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lingering case of interest rate jitters,'' Ackerman
said. ''There are not many who believe the Fed is near the end of
its rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, were modestly higher today. J.P. Morgan rose 1 9/16
to 134 3/16 and American Express rose } to 51 11/16. Merrill Lynch
rose 2[ to 110[.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that the market now faces a dry spell of major
economic reports, with little to indicate whether the long series
of rate increases are successfully slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report
showed that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for
the second week in a row. That suggested that companies are still
scrambling to find workers, leaving themselves vulnerable to
pressure to bump up wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The next economic report with true potential to move markets is
due May 25, when the Commerce Department issues its preliminary
report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 540.34 million
shares, compared with 555.92 million at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.69 to 495.97.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Backs China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With just a week to go, both sides of the
China trade debate ratcheted up their lobbying campaigns Thursday,
with supporters drawing within striking distance of a win in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents posed outside the Capitol with a 200-foot metal chain
to dramatize the plight of China's political prisoners. In a
competing event, President Clinton gave Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
a Rose Garden podium to pitch the landmark legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ''will have profound implications for the free world's
trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American
economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned a five-minute Oval Office speech to the
nation Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend permanent normal trade relations to China
and ease the way for its entry into the 135-nation World Trade
Organization. It would end two decades of annual congressional
votes on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters remained publicly cautious, saying they still lack
the 218 affirmative votes needed for House passage. ''We are not
where we need to be. We have more votes to get,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But, privately, other administration officials and their
congressional allies were far more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The House takes up the legislation next week, with a final vote
expected Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although widely supported in the Senate, most House Democrats
remain opposed, due in large part to a fierce lobbying campaign by
organized labor. Business groups have rallied in support of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides staged increasingly elaborate rallies and news
conferences Thursday to vie for the dwindling band of undecideds.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, the chief
opponent, and four other House opponents joined about 60 exiled
Chinese human rights activists in hoisting the 200-foot chain
outside the Capitol. They said it represented imprisoned human
rights, religious and labor leaders in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ask them and what they'll tell you is that while this trade
deal may lift tariffs, it won't pry open the door to a single
prison cell,'' Bonior said.
</P>
<P>
   The activists erected a display listing the names of victims of
the bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not take all of the pressure and leverage off of
China...,'' said House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., an
opponent. ''When we give China the Good Housekeeping seal of
approval, things get really bad for the forces for democracy and
the dissident voices in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior says as many as two-thirds of the 211 House Democrats
will oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters concede that's a possibility. But Rep. Robert Matsui,
D-Calif., a top Democratic supporter, said he still expects to be
able to deliver 70-80 Democratic votes. If 140-150 Republicans vote
for the measure, as is expected, that puts supporters close to or
just over the needed majority.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters said they expected even more than 150 GOP votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Matsui said. ''It's going to take a little time yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, the bill has picked up the support of at
least 10 previously undeclared Democrats and a like number of
previously undeclared Republicans. More were expected before the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan endorsed the bill last week, but the White House had
the Fed chairman do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know when Chairman Greenspan talks, the world
listens,'' Clinton said. ''I just hope the Congress is listening
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that China accounts for about 3 percent of world trade,
Greenspan said U.S. markets ''are already generally open to China''
and would not be affected by passage of the so-called permanent
normal trade relations bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passage of PNTR, however, will facilitate a further opening of
China's markets to U.S. producers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton would continue to make his case in
one-on-one sessions with undecided House members. Sunday's 7 p.m.
EDT address was partly in response to appeals from congressional
supporters that he do so, he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani set to appear at town hall meeting  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three weeks after he told the world he had
prostate cancer and might not continue his run for the U.S. Senate,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears to be leaning toward staying in the
race against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republican leaders were invited to join the mayor at a
nationally televised town hall forum Thursday night in Manhattan
and a Giuliani campaign aide was sent to Buffalo to prepare for the
state GOP convention, which will nominate a Senate candidate in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani insisted Thursday that he has not yet chosen a
cancer treatment -- a step which he said will precede any
announcement of whether he will keep up the run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not made a decision. ... I don't believe I'll make a
decision today,'' Giuliani said at a morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The medical decision is a much more difficult decision than I
thought it would be,'' said the former federal prosecutor. ''I
thought it would be like a budget or a (court) case, but it is a
much more personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the mayor was insisting that he had not made a
decision, his campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, stood nearby
smiling -- a marked contrast to his gloomy outlook last week when it
appeared as if the mayor would pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's three options for treatment are surgery, external
beam radiation and radioactive seed implantation. The 15-year
survival rate is 95 percent for surgery and 60 to 70 percent for
the two less invasive options.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum confirmed Wednesday that Brendan Quinn, a former top
aide to state GOP Chairman William Powers who is now working for
the Giuliani campaign, is in Buffalo beginning preparations for the
May 30 Republican state convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a further indication that Giuliani had not scrapped plans for
a Senate run, Republican leaders from across the state were invited
to his town hall-style meeting on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The past three weeks have been particularly rocky for the mayor:
He disclosed that he has cancer; announced he is seeking a legal
separation from hiw wife, Donna Hanover; confirmed his relationship
with Judith Nathan, a woman whom he has called a ''very good
friend''; and denied his wife's suggestion that he earlier had an
affair with one of his aides.

<HEADLINE> Mental Health Benefit Laws Skirted  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fourteen percent of employers surveyed by
government auditors are not complying with a law requiring that
they offer the same dollar amount of health insurance coverage for
mental illness as they do for physical illness, a report released
Thursday found.
</P>
<P>
   Many others are placing alternative restrictions on benefits
that skirt the Mental Health Parity Act, which took effect in 1998,
according to the report by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of ... reductions in mental health benefits that the
employers have made to offset the required enhancements, compliance
may have little effect on employees' access to mental health
services,'' said auditors from the GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are considering whether to make the mental health
parity law stricter. Without congressional action, it will expire
Sept. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was discussed Thursday at a hearing of the Senate
Health, Education and Workforce Committee. The committee chairman,
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., said lawmakers have ''demonstrated a
clear interest in increasing access to quality mental health care
for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The law does not require companies to offer mental health
coverage as part of employee health benefits. But if they do, the
maximum annual and lifetime dollar amount of benefits available
must be the same as for physical health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows other restrictions on mental health services to
differ from physical health coverage, such as copayments or limits
on the number of visits allowed per year.
</P>
<P>
   GAO auditors surveyed employers in 26 states and the District of
Columbia to determine their compliance. They found 14 percent of
companies were not abiding by the parity requirement for total
dollar amounts of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Of the majority in compliance, 87 percent have other coverage
rules that are more restrictive for mental health. Many have added
those restrictions recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there may be adherence to the letter of the law, there
are violations of the spirit of the law,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., who has introduced legislation with Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., to close the loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and insurance companies warn against that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Extending full parity in this area will drive up the costs of
coverage and increase the number of uninsured Americans,'' said
Dean Rosen, testifying for the Health Insurance Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said compliance with the existing federal law has
increased insurance claims costs by less than 1 percent in most
cases. In some states where mental health parity laws are more
comprehensive, cost increases have been 2 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not apply to substance abuse treatment, group
health insurance at companies with fewer than 50 employees, or to
individual insurance policies.

<HEADLINE> Fox 'Remakes' Fall Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''The X-Files'' returns with David Duchovny's
agent Mulder a part-timer next season, lending Fox some stability
as it announced the most extensive remake of any of the broadcast
networks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Titanic'' producer James Cameron, ''Ally McBeal'' creator
David E. Kelley, ''The X-Files'' creator Chris Carter and ''ER''
creator Michael Crichton are some of the big names behind Fox's
nine new series.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UPN is adding three new series and picking up ''The
Hughleys'' after it was canceled by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has slumped badly this year and faced further uncertainty
with the retirement of its long-running shows ''Beverly Hills
90210'' and ''Party of Five.'' It couldn't afford to lose its
biggest drama, ''The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The network reached separate deals with Carter and Duchovny this
week to continue. Co-star Gillian Anderson was already contracted
for another year. Duchovny's deal, completed Wednesday, calls for
him to film 11 episodes, or half the 22 new episodes that most
series film each year.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled Fox to keep intact its Sunday schedule, its most
successful night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will also carry ''The Lone Gunmen,'' a spinoff of ''The
X-Files'' that Carter is creating, on its Thursday schedule next
season. It will be paired with a Crichton-created drama that does
not even have a title or cast yet. Fox is giving Carter and
Crichton extra time, and won't debut the Thursday schedule until
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays are being turned over entirely to Kelley. His new
series, ''Boston Public,'' follows a group of teachers working at a
high school in suburban Boston. It will be followed by ''Ally
McBeal,'' his returning series about a group of lawyers working at
a firm in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron is producing ''Dark Angel,'' a science-fiction adventure
series set in ''post-apocalyptic America.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox returns two comedies whose midseason successes were among
the network's only bright spots this year, ''Malcolm in the
Middle'' and ''Titus.'' One new comedy is ''Don't Ask,'' which
stars John Goodman as a gay dad.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from Fox's schedule is the game show ''Greed,'' which was
quickly put together to capitalize on the success of ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.'' Fox has also canceled ''Time of Your Life,''
''Get Real'' and ''Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN recovered from a near-death experience this year to surge
past its archrival, the WB, in the ratings. It was almost entirely
because of its new Thursday night World Wrestling Federation
franchise, which will return.
</P>
<P>
   The network adds two new series on Friday nights: ''Freedom,''
an action series made by ''Matrix'' producer Joel Silver, and
''Level 9,'' a drama about an FBI unit trained to hunt down
high-tech criminals. Both series are trying to grab the young, male
audience that is UPN's target.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are proud to be known as the guy network,'' said UPN chief
executive Dean Valentine. ''Somebody needs to stand up for the
high-testosterone American male.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in February, UPN said it will broadcast games of the
new XFL football league created by the World Wrestling Federation.
NBC is broadcasting XFL games on Saturday nights. UPN also plans to
produce a weekly rap music countdown series with the hip-hop
magazine The Source.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is canceling ''Dilbert,'' ''The Beat,'' ''Malcolm &AMP; Eddie,''
''The Grown-Ups'' and ''I Dare You.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its wrestling theme, UPN said it will hold the first
wrestling awards show next year, the Slammys. Wrestlers will
compete in categories such as ''best hair.''

<HEADLINE> Eastwood Wants Disabled Law Changed  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by a lawsuit against his own hotel,
actor Clint Eastwood urged Congress on Thursday to amend the
Americans with Disabilities Act and discourage what he calls
frivolous lawsuits by attorneys reaping six-figure legal fees from
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really not fair,'' Eastwood told lawmakers in a House
judiciary subcommittee hearing. ''These lawyers cloak themselves
under the guise they're doing a favor for the disabled when really
they're doing a disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood has been speaking out since a California woman sued him
and cited his Mission Ranch Hotel in Carmel, Calif. for violations
to the 10-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed three years ago, claims at least one bathroom
and the hotel parking lot at the 32-room hotel and restaurant did
not comply with the law and there were not enough rooms accessible
to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood says the claims are bogus. An accessible bathroom, for
instance, has been in place since 1988, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   The actor has lashed out at provisions in the federal law that
prohibit the disabled from collecting damages but allow attorneys
to collect fees. Paul Rein, the attorney for plaintiff Diane Zum
Brunnen, is asking for $577,000 in legal fees, Eastwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers drive off ''in a big Mercedes and the disabled end
up riding off in a wheelchair,'' Eastwood said.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Florida Republican Reps. Mark Foley and Clay
Shaw would require plaintiffs to give defendants notice of alleged
violations and then 90 days to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ADA is being used by some attorneys to shake down
thousands of businesses from Florida to California,'' Foley told
the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   He said the problem is especially perverse in Florida, where two
attorneys have filed a barrage of lawsuits against businesses,
including one by a disabled child unable to gain access to a liquor
store that the child would not have attempted to enter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call it legal extortion,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic committee members seemed in a quandary over the
situation. ''It is a very difficult issue to deal with,'' said Rep.
Mel Watt, D-N.C., who added that in 22 years of practicing law, he
never filed a lawsuit without serving a defendant with notice.
</P>
<P>
   Rein, the attorney in the Eastwood case, said it would be unfair
to require the disabled to notify people they believe discriminated
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a black person is not allowed to enter a business because
of his race, he's not required to send a letter. If a woman is not
allowed to ..., she's not required to send a letter. Why should
disabled persons be the only class of persons required to send
letters?'' Rein said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also opposes the measure, saying in a
Justice Department letter to the subcommittee, ''We believe that
this proposed legislation would work to undermine voluntary
compliance ... and it would unduly burden legitimate ADA
enforcement activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Several disabled groups, including the Paralyzed Veterans of
America and the National Council on Independent Living, are also
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Others had a different view. Business owners Donna and David
Batelaan of Lakeworth, Fla., run a mobility equipment business.
They are both in wheelchairs, as are two of their employees and
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Batelaan's said they were hit with a lawsuit by an
attorney in New Jersey who, without notice, cited them for not
painting lines in the parking lot and posting a sign on one
''handicapped'' spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It cost us less than $100 to correct the infraction and $2,000
in attorneys' fees,'' Donna Batelaan told the committee. ''We are
intensely concerned about the results of the greed displayed by
these suits being filed.''

<HEADLINE> Judges Probe Clinton Letter Release  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court expressed serious
reservations Thursday about a ruling that President Clinton
committed a crime in releasing the private letters of presidential
accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the three appeals judges questioned whether they
should take the highly unusual step of intervening in an ongoing
lawsuit to set aside the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In oral arguments, the Clinton administration urged the appeals
panel to step into the case filed by a conservative group, Judicial
Watch, concerning the Clinton administration's alleged violation of
the Privacy Act by gathering hundreds of FBI background files of
former Reagan and Bush appointees.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for appeals courts to involve themselves in
cases before they are disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 29 ruling, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a
Reagan appointee, found the president had the requisite intent to
commit a criminal violation of the Privacy Act when he authorized
the release of Willey's letters in the midst of the 1998 criminal
investigation that led to Clinton's impeachment and acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides viewed the Willey correspondence with the
president as vital to undercutting her allegation that Clinton made
an unwanted sexual advance. Much of Willey's friendly
correspondence with Clinton came after the alleged 1993 encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case began with the FBI files issue, Lamberth gave
Judicial Watch wide latitude to explore whether the White House
routinely gathered and released damaging information about its
political opponents, a decision that led to inclusion of the Willey
letters even though Willey is not a party to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This White House and all White Houses'' and the Justice
Department for more than two decades have said that the type of
action Clinton took with the Willey letters is not a violation of
the Privacy Act, said Appeals Judge Harry Edwards, a Carter
appointee.
</P>
<P>
   ''How in heavens name can a trial court judge say'' there was
intent ''to commit a crime? The Department of Justice makes this
decision,'' said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't start!'' Edwards snapped when Judicial Watch head Larry
Klayman tried to argue the point, saying Clinton's release of the
Willey letters is part of a ''pattern and practice'' of violating
the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of Klayman's arguments, Appeals Judge David Tatel, a
Clinton appointee, said that by the conservative group's logic,
''any release of documents that you believe subject'' to the
Privacy Act ''would be per se evidence of criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The plain language'' of the law suggests that the Privacy Act
does not cover the president and his top advisers, Tatel said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to support the idea that the Privacy Act does apply to
Clinton, Appeals Judge Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee,
pointed to the legislative history of the Privacy Act: It was
enacted in the wake of the Watergate abuses of the Nixon White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But Ginsburg and Edwards suggested Lamberth's ruling could be
dealt with on appeal when the lawsuit ends.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg questioned what harm would be done to the White House
by letting the lower court decision stand for now.
</P>
<P>
   Tatel suggested a different possibility: A ''remand'' of the
issue by the appeals court to the district court so Lamberth could
reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly that would be sufficient,'' replied Justice
Department lawyer William Schultz, though Schultz emphasized that
Lamberth's finding should be tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   The White House contends Lamberth's ruling allows Judicial Watch
to delve into privileged discussions between Clinton and his White
House lawyers that led to the release of Willey's letters.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing the White House's case, Schultz predicted Lamberth's
decision will have far-reaching implications, but Edwards suggested
the Clinton administration is exaggerating any harm.
</P>
<P>
   ''You come here'' saying that ''Judge Lamberth ... says the
president is a crook'' but ''are you assuming'' Lamberth ''is so
dishonest'' that the judge will allow the conservative group to
conduct overly broad inquiries that will invade privileged
conversations inside the White House, Edwards asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's speculative to say the White House is at
risk,'' Schultz replied. He said Lamberth is letting Judicial Watch
range far afield in its lawsuit. Beside the Willey letters, the
judge allowed Judicial Watch to delve into the Pentagon's release
of incorrect information that Linda Tripp put on a form filed at
the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 49; Nasdaq Down 57  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in quiet trading today as
investors sought direction in a market facing rising interest rates
and a dearth of significant economic news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is just marking time,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ''We have buyers
and sellers just waiting it out for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 49.35 at 10,819.09.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 57.37 at 3,587.59, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.16 at 1,443.64.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell 1} to 56\. The Wall Street Journal reported today
that federal antitrust enforcers have recommended blocking WorldCom
Inc.'s $115 billion buyout of Sprint because it would violate
antitrust law. WorldCom shares fell 1 31/32 to 40 1/32.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose 5 1/64 to 62|. After the close of trading Wednesday,
the company reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal
third quarter. Analysts said investors were pleased with the
earnings report, but remain wary of the stock due to concerns about
the proposed takeover of Lycos by Spain's Terra Networks SA.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet as investors continued to
seek a new path in a market facing higher interest rates. The
Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other -- to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating borrowing costs make it tougher to borrow money to
finance growth. Ultimately, that can cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lingering case of interest rate jitters,'' Ackerman
said. ''There are not many who believe the Fed is near the end of
its rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, were modestly higher today. J.P. Morgan rose 1 7/16
to 134 1/16 and American Express rose ~ to 51 13/16. Merrill Lynch
rose 1{ to 109{.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have said unilaterally that that they don't want to own
financial stocks while interest rates are moving higher,'' said
Donald Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisors. ''As a
result, many of them are now very reasonably priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that the market now faces a dry spell of major
economic reports, with little to indicate whether the long series
of rate increases are successfully slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report
showed that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for
the second week in a row. That suggested that companies are still
scrambling to find workers, leaving themselves vulnerable to
pressure to bump up wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The next economic report with true potential to move markets is
due May 25, when the Commerce Department issues its preliminary
report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 639.70 million
shares, compared with 654.12 million at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.79 to 496.87.

<HEADLINE> Prostate patient goes on vandalism spree against doctors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE, N.J. (AP) -- Angry at urologists who
refused to perform diagnostic procedures on him, a man went on a
three-county vandalism rampage, shattering windows and
spray-painting signs at the doctors' offices, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John Murphy, 64, of Toms River allegedly damaged a dozen
doctors' offices in a three-county area of southern New Jersey on
May 10. He was arrested Monday and charged with 10 counts of
criminal mischief; more charges may be added later as the
investigation continues, according to Sgt. Al Della Fave of the
state police.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held Thursday on $2,500 bail in the Cape May County
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is pretty heavy retaliation,'' said police Detective Greg
Hopper in Dover Township, where six offices were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, a retired telephone company employee, was linked to the
incidents when investigators learned that he had been a patient of
every doctor whose office was targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Murphy -- who was denied a procedure that day -- went
from office to office, damaging buildings in Lakewood, Dover
Township, Stafford Township, Linwood, Somers Point, Marmora and
Cape May Court House.
</P>
<P>
   He broke windows and used spray paint to black out the names of
the urologists on exterior signs, police said. In Marmora, he
allegedly threw a hammer and bricks through a plate-glass door. In
Linwood and Somers Point, a hammer and rock were used to break
office windows, according to Somers Point police Detective Michael
Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single one of these doctors had treated Mr. Murphy and
terminated him as a patient after he had insisted on unnecessary
and invasive medical procedures,'' Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear whether he was sick in any way or just wanted
the procedures done. He was given a psychological evaluation before
being jailed, Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims was Dr. Shah Chaudhry of Somers Point, who
examined Murphy more than a year ago. Murphy stormed out of the
office after Chaudhry refused to perform a prostate biopsy,
Chaudhry said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had had one performed by another doctor. Chaudhry told
him to provide the results of the first one.
</P>
<P>
   ''The procedure is pretty invasive. You go through the rectum,''
Chaudhry said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Feneran, whose Stafford Township office had windows
broken and signs spray-painted, said repairs could top $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feneran said Thursday he treated Murphy once, two years ago. He
wouldn't discuss the visit further, citing doctor-patient
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no idea there was anyone else who had this happen to
them until later, when I found out from other urologist friends of
mine. It was so similar, it would be difficult to believe that they
weren't related,'' Feneran said.
</P>
<P>
   State police said Murphy admitted to the vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was trying to put them out of business,'' said
Detective Karl Ulbrich. ''He wanted to get back at the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy could not be reached for comment Thursday. A jail guard
refused to give him a telephone message, referring a reporter to
the public defender's office. Murphy is not represented by a public
defender, a man there said. There was no answer at Murphy's home,
where the telephone rang unanswered Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Number of U.S. Grizzlies Calculated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are 332 grizzly bears in Glacier
National Park -- more or less -- according to scientists from the
U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   That's an increase from the 200 grizzlies estimated to be in the
park during the 1970s, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The new count is based on a study of bear DNA collected from the
animals hair and droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say this gives a more accurate count than trying to
find all the bears individually. It's easier on the bears and the
scientists, too.
</P>
<P>
   Previous grizzly bear population studies in forested habitats
typically were accomplished with live capture, radio collars and
aerial tracking of bears, which is expensive and disruptive to
bears, as well as to park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the count for the park, the researchers estimated
there are 437 grizzlies in the northern one-third of the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem, which includes the park and stretches
from the Canadian border to near Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Because of statistical variation, the actual numbers of bears in
the northern third of the NCDE may vary from 349 to 590 bears and
from 241 to 549 bears in Glacier National Park, said researcher
Katherine Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   While the new numbers are higher than the estimates of the
1970s, Kendall said the earlier numbers are thought to be
unreliable and thus people should not draw any conclusions about
population trends by comparing the two.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly bears once roamed most of the North American continent,
but researchers estimate that fewer than 1,000 remain south of the
Canadian border today.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall reached the new numbers by identifying species, sex and
individual bears from DNA extracted from bear hair and scats -- bear
poop. The bears were lured to collecting areas where their hair was
caught on wire or was scraped off on trees they rubbed against. DNA
is the material contained in every living cell that provides a
blueprint for that individual organism.

<HEADLINE> GOP Gaining Support on Estate Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The perennial Republican effort to repeal
inheritance taxes is gaining significant Democratic support,
prompting House GOP leaders to set an early June vote to gradually
phase out the estate tax over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   An almost-identical repeal was included in the GOP's $792
billion tax cut that was vetoed by President Clinton last year, but
supporters say the 44 Democrats who are among the current version's
238 House co-sponsors could help persuade the White House to sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is broad support for this bill,'' said Rep. Jennifer
Dunn, R-Wash. ''The death tax is unfair, unethical and
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of Americans pay estate taxes, and under
current law $675,000 in assets are exempt. That exemption is
scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006, but supporters of repeal
say the tax that ranges up to 55 percent still would most hurt
small business people and land-rich farmers while the wealthiest
people are often able to escape through tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The very rich are not paying it because they know how to get
around it,'' said Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C. ''This tax
disproportionately falls on the people who can't adjust their
accounts ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is among the Democratic members of the Congressional
Black Caucus, many from rural districts, who have signed onto the
bill. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has also called in her New
York Senate campaign for raising the exemption to $1.75 million for
family farms and family-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's learning what all of us here have known for some time --
that the death tax doesn't just affect the rich, it affects
Americans up and down the economic spectrum,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats say outright repeal of the tax would mainly
benefit the wealthy and take too much surplus money away from other
priorities, such as providing a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
The repeal would cost an estimated $65 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Internal Revenue Service statistics show that in
1997 about 43,000 returns were filed in which $16.6 billion in net
estate taxes were owed.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 329 were for estates of $20 million or more, owing
$3.4 billion in taxes, while 36,000 returns for estates between
$600,000 and $2.5 million generated about $5.1 billion for the
government. Stocks make up about a third of the assets of estates
subject to the tax, the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders, acknowledging the political potency of
the issue, are likely to propose an alternative -- similar to that
advocated by Mrs. Clinton -- that would raise the amount of exempt
assets for farms and family-owned businesses. A Democratic measure
introduced earlier this year would raise that exemption to $4
million for a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can eliminate the estate tax for the overwhelming majority
of American families,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. ''However, a total
repeal of the estate tax gives an enormous windfall to a tiny few
of the wealthiest American families.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee will consider the repeal bill next
week, Archer said.

<HEADLINE> More Cities Join Gun Safety Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Thursday
that officials from 411 governments around the nation have now
joined the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Million Mom March showed us that ordinary Americans across
this country want swift and sure government action to protect our
families from gun violence,'' Cuomo said, referring to a rally that
drew tens of thousands to the nation's capital on Mothers Day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson -- the nation's largest handgun maker -- became the
first and thus far only company to adopt new gun safety standards
in a landmark agreement with the Clinton Administration and state
and local officials on March 17.
</P>
<P>
   The standards require major changes in the design, distribution
and marketing of guns to make them safer and to help keep them out
of the hands of children and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Smith &AMP; Wesson will be the preferred choice for law
enforcement officials in the 411 communities that have joined the
Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The preference applies to comparable weapons available at a
comparable price that meet law enforcement agency needs, HUD
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven gun makers and an industry group sued the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and 16 cities Wednesday over the plan
to give preferential treatment to Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in an Atlanta federal court alleges an illegal
conspiracy in restraint of trade.

<HEADLINE> CDC To Change Exercise Guidelines  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans may be getting a lot more exercise than
previously believed, once researchers take into account physical
activity while on the job and working around the house, the
government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found -- like
others before it -- that almost two-thirds of working Americans do
not get enough exercise during their leisure time. However, the
study also showed that nearly 44 percent of working Americans got
at least one hour of hard occupational activity a day on the job or
doing housework.
</P>
<P>
   The survey questioned 20,766 adults in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''Typically we've been measuring leisure time activities,'' said
the study's author, Deborah Jones, a scientist at the National
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. ''But
now we see the importance of accounting for other activities that
people are participating in, and we'll start doing that in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has developed a new questionnaire that takes into
account physical activity at work, during child care and in
maintaining a home, with activities such as vacuuming and
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   The government recommends adults participate in 30 minutes or
more of moderate physical activity every day to maintain fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 survey indicated that of employed adults, 20 percent
reported one to four hours a day of physical labor during the work
day and 24 percent reported five hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey asked working adults about their leisure-time
activity. It found that 36 percent got the recommended amount of
exercise through leisure activities alone.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Posts Record Monthly Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, thanks to a flood of tax
receipts, posted a record budget surplus of $159.5 billion in
April, a month that typically generates a lot of cash because of
the April 15 income tax deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The government's surplus for last month, announced by the
Treasury Department on Thursday, was 40.6 percent higher than the
$113.5 billion surplus recorded in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''This dramatic news is yet more evidence that our strategy of
fiscal discipline, investing in people and opening markets abroad
is working,'' President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's surplus was in line with the $158 billion surplus
many analysts expected, but was slightly smaller than the $163
billion bounty projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for April totaled a whopping all-time monthly high of
$295.1 billion, while expenditures came to $135.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the booming economy, the government collected
$184.2 billion in individual income tax payments last month
compared with $164.8 billion for April 1999. It received $27.7
billion in corporate tax payments, up from $21.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first seven months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1,
the government is running a surplus of $123.9 billion -- just about
matching the record $124.4 billion surplus recorded for all of
fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue during the first seven months of fiscal 2000 totaled
$1.72 trillion, while spending came to $1.04 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   If a surplus materializes as expected for fiscal year 2000,
which ends Sept. 30, it would be the first time the government has
reported three consecutive years of surplus since 1947, 1948 and
1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $166.69 billion
surplus for fiscal 2000, while the CBO believes the surplus will
exceed $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the biggest spending categories were Social Security,
$33.8 billion; programs of the Health and Human Services
Department, $27.6 billion; military spending, $20.4 billion; and
interest on the public debt, $19.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ronstadt Stalker May Be At It Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A man convicted in 1998 of stalking singer
Linda Ronstadt is accused of doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say 55-year-old Bernie Salazar Ortiz sent letters
and a package to Ronstadt's brother Michael at his Tucson-area home
between Nov. 9 and April 30. In the package: a 59-page handwritten
letter, a gold bracelet with jewels, a gold cross and three
cassette tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was arrested May 6 outside an arena west of Phoenix hours
before Ronstadt was scheduled to perform.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty in 1998 to attempted stalking for sending
letters and gifts to Ronstadt. He was released from jail last June.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 106; Dow Up 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks meandered to a mixed finish today as
investors failed to find direction in a market facing rising
interest rates and a dearth of significant economic news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is just marking time,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ''We have buyers
and sellers just waiting it out for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.54 to close at
10,777.28.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 106.12 to 3,538.84.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's largest technology stocks led the index lower
today. Cisco Systems, Oracle and Microsoft all declined.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and WorldCom both fell. The Wall Street Journal reported
today that federal antitrust enforcers have recommended blocking
WorldCom's $115 billion buyout of Sprint because it would violate
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while investors haven't truly turned against
technology stocks, there's little interest in buying into the
volatile sector while interest rates are rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of cash out there, and yet we see only very
selective buying,'' said Donald Berdine, chief investment officer
at PNC Advisors. ''There's very, very little conviction, and very
few heroes to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose. After the close of trading Wednesday, the company
reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal third quarter.
Analysts said investors were pleased with the earnings report, but
remain wary of the stock due to concerns about the proposed
takeover of Lycos by Spain's Terra Networks SA.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet as investors continued to
seek a new path in a market facing higher interest rates. The
Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other -- to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating borrowing costs make it tougher to borrow money to
finance growth. Ultimately, that can cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lingering case of interest rate jitters,'' Ackerman
said. ''There are not many who believe the Fed is near the end of
its rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, were modestly higher today. J.P. Morgan, American
Express and Merrill Lynch rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have said unilaterally that that they don't want to own
financial stocks while interest rates are moving higher,'' Berdine
said. ''As a result, many of them are now very reasonably priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that the market now faces a dry spell of major
economic reports, with little to indicate whether the long series
of rate increases are successfully slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report
showed that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for
the second week in a row. That suggested that companies are still
scrambling to find workers, leaving themselves vulnerable to
pressure to bump up wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The next economic report with true potential to move markets is
due May 25, when the Commerce Department issues its preliminary
report on first-quarter gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rescinds U.S. Troops Threat  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate stepped back Thursday from a
showdown with the White House over the future of U.S. ground troops
in Kosovo, removing language from a bill that would have set a
date-certain for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 53-47 to take out a provision in a military
construction spending bill that would have terminated U.S. military
participation in Kosovo on July 1 next year unless the president
requested and Congress approved an extension.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of how serious the administration took the vote, Vice
President Al Gore made a rare appearance in his capacity as
president of the Senate to cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To force an artificial withdrawal, Gore said, would have
''demoralized our allies ... and handed (Yugoslav) President
Milosevic a victory that he could not win through military force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action came a day after the House voted to tie
continued U.S. troop presence in Kosovo to Europe carrying its fair
share of the financial burden there.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate provision was authored by Senate Armed Forces
Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., and Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., a fierce defender of the legislative branch's
constitutional powers. It would also have linked U.S. funds for the
Kosovo operation this year to Europe's contribution to humanitarian
aid and reconstruction costs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen recommended that President
Clinton veto the bill, which contains $8.6 billion for military
construction in 2001 and $4.7 billion in emergency funds for the
Kosovo operation and anti-drug efforts in Colombia, if the
Warner-Byrd provision was not removed. After its removal, the bill
passed 96-4.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden U.S. departure, the administration said in a statement,
''would undermine this mission and could lead to the unraveling''
of the peacekeeping force. ''It could damage the strength and
durability of the NATO alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   White House budget director Jacob Lew also warned of ''rigid,
mechanical burdensharing tests'' in linking U.S. funds to European
contributions. ''Failure to meet the targets by even a day could
compel withdrawal of U.S. forces,'' he wrote in a letter to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The debate affects about 5,900 U.S. troops who are part of a
37,000-member NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The
peacekeepers moved in after the 78-day air war to drive Yugoslav
troops out of the province ended last June.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and Byrd insisted they were not trying to force an end to
U.S. participation but only to give Congress its proper role in the
stationing of American military forces abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration would much prefer Congress to keep quiet,
roll over and play dead, while the administration continues to do
whatever it wants to do in Kosovo,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has long claimed that its constitutional power over the
purse gives it the right to determine when U.S. troops will be sent
abroad and how long they will stay. Both Republican and Democratic
presidents have resisted pressure from Congress for a greater say,
insisting that as commander-in-chief they have the ultimate
decision-making power. Probable Republican presidential nominee
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has backed Clinton in opposing the
Warner-Byrd language.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kosovo, Congress has tried, without great success, to
limit military deployments in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the House, currently considering a $309 billion
defense authorization bill, voted 264-153 for an amendment that
would require the president by April 1 next year to certify that
European allies have met their financial commitments to the Kosovo
operation. If he can't, the president would have until April 30 to
submit a plan for the withdrawal of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Passage ''sends a strong message that NATO is not a one-way
street,'' said chief sponsor Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. ''And that's
a message that will have an impact far beyond our presence in the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, in a statement, said the Kasich
amendment could ''seriously jeopardize the relationship between the
United States and our NATO allies.'' It said the president, as
commander-in-chief, ''should retain the flexibility to judge our
progress on burdensharing and encourage good faith efforts.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Informant no longer overseeing Virginia boxing  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- For nearly two decades, the regulation of
professional boxing and wrestling events in Virginia was handled by
a retired Navy corpsman, C. Douglas ''Doc'' Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   That reign ended last month as Beavers, who was also the
longtime ratings chairman for the International Boxing Federation,
began testifying that he and IBF founder Robert W. Lee took bribes
to rig the boxer ratings.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was no surprise. Boxing insiders have long
suspected that Beavers was cooperating with the FBI corruption
probe, and a 59-page sworn statement by Beavers outlining years of
bribery became public Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia official said the state did not learn of the
statement until a reporter called in April.
</P>
<P>
   That statement has served as a road map in the prosecution of
Lee, with Beavers outlining payoffs from some of boxing's biggest
promoters, including Don King and Cedric Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   The East Orange-based IBF is one of boxing's three major
sanctioning organizations, and its rankings play a big role in
determining whom a boxer fights, and his purse.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony over the past month in Lee's trial in Newark,
Beavers, 56, of Portsmouth, Va., described dozens of payments and
led the jury through 83 covertly made tapes of his conversations
and meetings with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers became executive director of the Virginia Athletic
Commission in 1981, succeeding a friend, IBF championship committee
chairman Bill Brennan, of Warsaw, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The agency regulated boxing and wrestling in the state until
1995, when those functions were contracted to a private company
owned by Beavers, the Virginia Boxing and Wrestling Association
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia suspended the contract April 17, and ended it on April
19, the day Beavers began his testimony, said Doug McCartney, chief
deputy director for the Virginia Department of Professional and
Occupational Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers remained on the stand Thursday, his fifth day of
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney on Wednesday said Virginia learned of Beavers' sworn
statement in April when a reporter called. He said the state had no
knowledge prior to that of Beavers' activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is frustrating to us that the feds couldn't tell us what
was going on,'' McCartney said. ''Obviously, they were trying to
protect their investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract with the Virginia Boxing and Wrestling Association
gave Beavers 95 percent of the state's 5 percent take on all sales
in professional boxing and wrestling matches in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers' company received $156,000 in 1999 and the first three
months of 2000, McCartney said. Beavers had to pay his expenses out
of that money.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers had testified that wrestling provided the bulk of the
company's income.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Beavers engaged in any illegal
activities in his capacity as a Virginia regulator, McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The observations were that Mr. Beavers ran a tight ship,''
McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the state had no good reason to drop Beavers'
company, said Beavers' attorney, Joel Weintraub.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our position that they didn't have cause to terminate the
contract,'' Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has the right to terminate the contract for any
reason, but must provide 120 days' notice unless it has good cause,
Weintraub said. He suggested Beavers may be entitled to
compensation because the contract was canceled without notice.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the state has done its own regulation of
boxing and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's probably no chance that we're ever going to contract
it out again,'' McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, was indicted in November with three other
IBF officials, accused of taking $338,000 in payoffs to rig
rankings and provide favors since 1983, when he founded the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Lee took a leave of absence in December, and the IBF is being
run by another federation official under the watch of a
court-appointed monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of Scotch Plains, are the only
defendants on trial. They face multiyear prison terms if convicted
on conspiracy, racketeering, fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S. Boxing
Association, a group that became the IBF, was severed from the
trial due to ill health.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth defendant, Francisco Fernandez of Colombia, the IBF's
South American representative, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   The trial before U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell began April
11 and is expected to last about two more months.

<HEADLINE> 7 Bow Out of Clinton Disbarment Case  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY P. KISSEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Half the members of a state panel with
the power to strip President Clinton of his law license have bowed
out of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The recusals leave barely enough members to consider whether to
discipline him for lying under oath in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-member Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional
Conduct meets Friday and could consider two requests that Clinton
be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did not say Thursday why any of the seven
committee members removed themselves. Four had contributed to
Clinton's presidential campaigns or to other Democratic Party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is heartening to know that Arkansas Committee members who
have recused themselves for apparent or perceived political reasons
are helping to maintain the integrity of this process,'' said
Matthew Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation of
Atlanta, which filed one of the two complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also lost an alternate member when his term
expired this spring, leaving five lawyers and a lay person,
Chairman Ken Reeves said Thursday. Four votes are needed to impose
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation and U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright
referred Clinton to the conduct committee, saying the president
lied under oath in the Jones case by denying he had a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also cited Clinton for civil contempt last year and fined
him $90,000 for giving ''intentionally false'' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin has said he wants Clinton disbarred for the lies and for
obstructing justice. Wright has not publicly suggested a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seeks something no harsher than a letter of reprimand,
Glavin said last week, citing Clinton's still-unreleased response.

less traumatic for their patients.
</P>
<P>
   A drug called Mylotarg was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use only by patients over age 60 whose acute
myeloid leukemia has relapsed and cannot tolerate standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Mylotarg is a two-part drug that pairs chemotherapy with genetic
engineering in a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   One is a ''monoclonal antibody,'' a biotherapy that seeks out
and binds to leukemia cells. The other is a chemotherapy along for
the ride. Mylotarg is the first anti-cancer monoclonal antibody
that can bind a chemotherapy directly to cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Acute myeloid leukemia strikes over 9,000 Americans a year, most
over age 60. Most eventually relapse.
</P>
<P>
   But standard treatment for this type of leukemia causes so many
serious side effects in older patients who relapse -- and is less
effective in them -- that many doctors do not even offer it, FDA
oncology chief Dr. Richard Pazdur said.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that Mylotarg will offer these elderly patients a
viable option. ''That's the real need, and why we approved it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pazdur cautioned that the drug's effects are not yet proved.
The FDA approved Mylotarg under a special rule that lets promising
drugs for certain lifethreatening diseases to sell before studies
prove just how well they work.
</P>
<P>
   In studies where 80 patients over age 60 were given Mylotarg, 26
percent went into remission, Pazdur said.
</P>
<P>
   That is very little research, and Mylotarg was not compared with
traditional therapy. But the median survival was 6.8 months, about
what doctors would expect from such patients who could try
conventional treatment, Pazdur said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mylotarg is given in two outpatient infusions, while
standard chemotherapy for these patients requires a week's
hospitalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mylotarg did cause typical chemotherapy side effects, including
infections, immune suppression and a need for blood transfusions,
Pazdur said. But oncologists hope these side effects will prove
fewer than those caused by conventional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   To win FDA approval, manufacturer Wyeth-Ayerst had to pledge to
continue studying Mylotarg's effect. Studies in younger patients
continue, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst said Mylotarg will be available within two weeks,
but refused to disclose the price.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs African Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring that trade ''must work for all
people,'' President Clinton signed Thursday legislation that opens
U.S. markets to more goods from poor African, Caribbean and Central
American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by smiling members of Congress, the president signed
the Trade and Development Act of 2000 from a small wooden desk atop
an oversized stage on the White House South Lawn. Afterward, a
military band played ''The Impossible Dream'' while Clinton mingled
happily among the lawmakers for so long that all but a few went
indoors without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This day has been a long time coming. But it is here,''
Clinton said. ''We must not avoid our neighbors in Central America
and the Caribbean, or our friends half a world away in Africa. We
must build a better future, together, with both.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the legislation was really about ending,
officially, the Cold War notion that ''Central America was a
battleground and Africa was a backwater.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All that has changed,'' Clinton said. ''Our agenda for the
developing world must be multifaceted, recognizing that trade must
work for all people, and that spirited competition should lift all
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Foote, executive director of the advocacy group Constituency
for Africa, said while the new law does not fully redeem the flaws
in Clinton's Africa policy, it does establish a mechanism for
pushing improvements through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a first step. We can't look at the job as done,'' Foote
said. ''We all know there are weaknesses in the bill. But this bill
sets the framework in which we are engaged with Africa, and that's
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people attended the ceremony, including African
diplomats, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and the mayors of
Detroit and Atlanta. It took place just after Clinton met privately
with former South African President Nelson Mandela, who updated
Clinton on his efforts to negotiate an end to civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday's good news about trade was tempered by
sad circumstances in Africa, such as unrest in Sierra Leone and the
resumption by Ethiopia and Eritrea of ''their senseless war.'' He
appealed to those nations to step back from conflict and reach for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Backing away from self-destruction is not the same thing as
backing down,'' Clinton said. ''Giving your people a future is not
cowardice, it's common sense and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   It took five years for the trade bill to move through Congress.
The legislation was combined with a Caribbean initiative and passed
last week on a 77-19 Senate vote, the first major trade legislation
approved since a 1994 bill that led to creation of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in love with Europe, but Africa is on the map,''
said Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., ranking member of the Ways and
Means Committee. ''For those of us that come from multiracial
communities, this bill means so much, because our young people can
identify now with all parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   During his historic 1998 tour of Africa, Clinton touted the
trade bill as a means through which the poorest African countries
could build their own economies, reduce their debts and stabilize
their governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (is) a beautiful day of hope for peace, for opportunity,
for a better way of life for so many millions of additional people
around the world,'' said House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas. ''That's what America should stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, countries can ship, duty-free, clothing made
with U.S. yarn and fabrics, provided they meet certain human rights
and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing made in Africa from African fabric would be allowed to
rise from 1.5 percent of U.S. imports to 3.5 percent over eight
years, boosting African exports of these products from about $250
million a year now to as much as $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   African nations whose gross domestic product is less than $1,500
a year per person -- all but six of the 48 sub-Saharan nations --
would have four years of quota-free benefits for apparel made with
third-country fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Caribbean nations helps level the trade playing
field that tilted in Mexico's favor after the North American Free
Trade Agreement went into effect.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 106; Dow Up 8  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks meandered to a mixed finish Thursday as
investors failed to find direction in a market facing rising
interest rates and a dearth of significant economic news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is just marking time,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ''We have buyers
and sellers just waiting it out for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.54 to close at
10,777.28. Earlier in the session, the index had been up as much as
95 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 106.25 to 3,538.71, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell
10.59 to 1,437.21.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's largest technology stocks led the index lower
Thursday. Cisco Systems fell 2| to 55], Oracle lost 5[ to 73 1/16
and Microsoft slipped 1{ to 66 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell 1} to 56\ and WorldCom fell 2 7/16 to 39 9/16. The
Wall Street Journal reported that federal antitrust enforcers have
recommended blocking WorldCom's $115 billion buyout of Sprint
because it would violate antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while investors haven't truly turned against
technology stocks, there's little interest in buying into the
volatile sector while interest rates are rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of cash out there, and yet we see only very
selective buying,'' said Donald Berdine, chief investment officer
at PNC Advisors. ''There's very, very little conviction, and very
few heroes to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose 4 45/64 to 62 5/16. After the close of trading
Wednesday, the company reported better-than-expected results for
its fiscal third quarter. Analysts said investors remain wary of
the stock due to concerns about the proposed takeover of Lycos by
Spain's Terra Networks SA.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet as investors sought a new
path in a market facing higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve
raised rates for the sixth time since June on Tuesday, pushing the
federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other for
overnight loans -- to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating borrowing costs make it tougher to borrow money to
finance growth. Ultimately, that can cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lingering case of interest rate jitters,'' Ackerman
said. ''There are not many who believe the Fed is near the end of
its rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, were modestly higher. J.P. Morgan rose 15/16 to 133
9/16 and Merrill Lynch rose 1 1/16 to 109 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have said unilaterally that that they don't want to own
financial stocks while interest rates are moving higher,'' Berdine
said. ''As a result, many of them are now very reasonably priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it could take several weeks before the market
breaks out of a narrow range. Investors now face a dry spell of
major economic reports, with little to indicate whether the long
series of rate increases are successfully slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report
showed that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for
the second week in a row. That suggested companies are still
scrambling to find workers, leaving themselves vulnerable to
pressure to bump up wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The next economic report with significant market-moving
potential is due May 25, when the Commerce Department issues its
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 986.89 million
shares, compared with 980.57 million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Volume, which has been running low for the past two weeks, could
spike on Friday, which is a ''double witching'' session. Stock and
index options positions will expire, which typically causes a rush
of large orders to buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.71 to 490.95.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.1 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.02 percent.

<HEADLINE> Delay in Peru Election Runoff Urged  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Protesters shouting ''Get out, tyrant!''
stoned President Alberto Fujimori's vehicle at a campaign rally in
Ayacucho on Thursday after the Organization of American States
demanded a postponement of Peru's election runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bodyguards fired automatic rifles into the air to
drive back dozens of demonstrators who ran after his pickup truck,
hurling stones as he pulled away from the plaza in Ayacucho, high
in the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   The windshield of Fujimori's vehicle was cracked by the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters appeared to be students from the state university
in Ayacucho, the birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency that
bloodied this Andean nation through the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Fujimori had ended a campaign speech to
thousands of supporters gathered in the plaza, including
Quechua-speaking campesinos trucked in from the countryside to hear
him.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori promised to build roads and irrigation systems as a way
of creating jobs in an area that saw the worst of the guerrilla
violence until rebel leaders were captured in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before boarding a plane back to Lima,
Fujimori condemned the stone throwing and rejected an OAS request
for postponement of the May 28 presidential runoff. The OAS said it
was necessary to put off the polls to avoid a repeat of the fraud
that plagued the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In its strongest statement yet, the OAS said it was giving
Fujimori's government until Monday, after a nationwide test of the
election authority's vote counting software, to make necessary
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot endorse the results'' of the runoff ''if what
happened in the first round continues,'' said Eduardo Stein, chief
of an OAS mission of election observers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the OAS request, Fujimori said: ''We can't change
the rules at this stage of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenger Alejandro Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist, has
repeatedly warned that he will pull out of the race if conditions
do not improve.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has refused to postpone the runoff election, saying it
was set by constitutional guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Peru narrowly avoided political turmoil after the April 9 vote
when election officials announced that Fujimori had fallen a hair
shy of the absolute majority needed to win another five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The result came amid intense international pressure for a
second-round vote, including threatened sanctions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Independent monitors were denied access to tabulation centers
during the vote tally. Ballot totals mysteriously decreased as the
tally progressed and when the results were delivered, the figures
showed about 1 million more ballots were cast than there were
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Stein on Wednesday complained that Peruvian officials handed his
mission an incomplete copy of vote-counting software for the
upcoming election. And he said that he was still waiting for a
promised report detailing how election officials plan to train vote
counters.

<HEADLINE> Muslim prison guards reach deal with state allowing beards  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Muslim state prison guards will be exempt
from a new policy barring guards from wearing beards, under a
settlement reached Thursday with the state Department of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Some 33 guards, practitioners of the Sunni branch of Islam, sued
the state in March, claiming the policy violated their right to
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The policy had been on hold since then, when U.S. District Judge
Faith S. Hochberg blocked enforcement to explore a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Impetus for a deal included an October decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court that upheld rulings from lower courts that Newark's
effort to bar two Sunni police officers from wearing beards
violated the officers' freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that ruling, the Justice Department on Tuesday sued
Newark, claiming the city is still discriminating against Sunni
Muslim officers because of their religion.
</P>
<P>
   The state Corrections policy provided that violators could be
fired. Department Commissioner Jack Terhune, who took office March
1998, rescinded a longtime policy six months later that permitted
prison officers to grow beards. Enforcement was not to begin until
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The policy provided an exemption on religious grounds, but the
guards maintained it still infringed on their rights because it
required each Sunni guard to get a Muslim cleric to certify
annually that they are practicing.
</P>
<P>
   The guards maintain that Sunni Muslim practice requires men to
wear beards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal approved by Hochberg, the guards can make that
certification themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Corrections Department can ''independently assess the
sincerity'' of applications for religious exemptions, under the
settlement. If the department believes a guard has lied, it agreed
to give the guard an explanation. The guard does not have to shave
the beard while disciplinary proceedings are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Cannan, a lawyer for the guards, said they were
pleased with the settlement. ''They get to keep their beards,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections spokesman Chris Carden said Thursday that some
bearded guards may be transferred to duties in which they would not
have to wear face masks because the department must comply with
federal safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Cannan said the guards have a total of 366 years of experience
and have never had trouble putting a gas mask or air pack mask over
their beards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't anticipate any transfers or changes,'' Cannan said.
''The employer is obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation
to religious practices, and this settlement assures that they
will.''

<HEADLINE> Mississippi gives nod to MGM Grand's purchase of Mirage, Beau Rivage casino </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi gaming regulators have given
unanimous approval to MGM Grand Inc.'s acquisition of Mirage
Resorts Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission granted MGM Grand the regulatory approval
Thursday after investigating the company's corporate officers,
including director Kirk Kerkorian, and examining all of its
holdings and subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.4 billion merger will give MGM ownership of the Beau
Rivage and its first casino in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to gaming commissioners, Kerkorian said the first trip
he took to see Mirage's properties was to the casino in Biloxi.
Kerkorian holds a 60-percent stake in MGM.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was totally impressed with the people and the hotel. I just
couldn't believe it,'' Kerkorian said of the recent trip.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1999, the $700 million, 1,800-room Beau Rivage is
regarded as the largest and most luxurious casino in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But it has suffered from lingering criticism that its luxury is
too upscale for Southern customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The property is probably too much for that market on a lot of
different levels,'' said Daniel Davila, senior leisure and
entertainment analyst with Hibernia Southcoast Capital in New
Orleans. ''There is clearly a need for that type of product, but
not along the scope to which Mirage built it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Redmond, co-CEO at MGM, said the company will market the
resort to a cross-segment of customers, and use its other resorts
around the United States as promotional tools for the Beau Rivage,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes sense to look at this property as something that we
would want to cater to all market segments, as opposed to just
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MGM co-CEO Daniel Wade said the company doesn't plan to change
the name of Beau Rivage or its management team. Jeff Dahl, Beau
Rivage's recently named president, will stay on in that position.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said the casino has been ''kind of undernourished a little
bit and we need to grow it a little more and that's our intent.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM Chairman Terrence Lanni said ''Biloxi is a very important
market to us'' and has no plans to close Beau Rivage.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Las Vegas MGM owns 18 casinos in on three continents,
including the Las Vegas MGM Grand, the world's largest
hotel/casino. MGM had net income of more than $86 million on sales
of $1.3 billion for 1999. It employs more than 6,700 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage, also based in Las Vegas, has casinos in Nevada and Monte
Carlo and plans to build one in Atlantic City, N.J. It had earnings
of $110 million on sales $2.4 billion during 1999. It employs
nearly 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange,
shares of MGM were down 44 cents to close at $33.12, a decline of
1.3 percent. Shares of Mirage held steady at $20.62.

<HEADLINE> Army Corps Chided on Environment  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two already endangered species could be driven
to extinction by the federal government's transformation of the
upper Mississippi River into a commercially navigable waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency in charge of endangered species announced
Thursday that the agency in charge of maintaining the nation's
water transportation systems is placing the future of the pallid
sturgeon and Higgins' eye pearlymussel in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   At fault, says the Fish and Wildlife Service, is the Army Corps
of Engineers' 60-year-old system of 37 locks and dams on the
Mississippi and Illinois rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could have huge implications for the fierce battle
over whether the corps should move ahead with a $1 billion project
to double the length of seven locks.
</P>
<P>
   Politically powerful agribusiness companies say massive lock
expansions are crucial to keeping transportation costs low as grain
exports -- and barge traffic -- rise. Otherwise, they say, Midwestern
products will not be able to compete on the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say that river's fragile ecosystem would be
further endangered by more large-scale changes. They applauded the
service's decision as bolstering that argument.
</P>
<P>
   The corps is expected to complete this year a $54 million study
into what should be done, but its initial conclusions appear to
favor the expansion. That study became even more controversial in
February with allegations that top corps officials rigged the data
to justify the costly construction.
</P>
<P>
   Several investigations into those charges are pending, including
by the Army inspector general, the National Academy of Sciences,
the General Accounting Office and at least four congressional
committees.
</P>
<P>
   In its ''biological opinion,'' the Fish and Wildlife Service
does not order any changes to the current operation of the
navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   But it was conducted primarily to provide a baseline for another
round of negotiations if new construction is proposed. That process
could call for more drastic remedies such as changing dredging
procedures or alterations to dams, and that could make the proposed
project too expensive to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the corps must protect the pallid sturgeon, a large
fish with a shovel-shaped snout and long feelers, by creating new
backwater habitats. The pallid sturgeon has been on the endangered
species list for 10 years, mostly because of the loss of a
free-flowing, diverse river.
</P>
<P>
   The corps already spends $19 million a year to improve the
health of the Mississippi. Service officials could not estimate how
much it may cost to help the pallid sturgeon recover.
</P>
<P>
   For the three-inch pearlymussel, listed since 1976 and now being
virtually smothered by invasive zebra mussels, the corps must
relocate significant numbers of them out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Galford, a spokeswoman with the corps Mississippi Valley
Division, said the agency had no comment, as it has not had enough
time to review the opinion.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Interim Gov't Dissolved  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Ivory Coast's military leader
dissolved the country's interim government Thursday, but it was not
immediately clear whether Gen. Robert Guei was moving toward
elections or entrenching army rule.
</P>
<P>
   The move came five months after a Christmas Eve military coup
and in the face of increased opposition protests in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the dissolved Cabinet, Communications Minister
Levy Niamkey said the shakeup was intended to ''usher in the new
phase of the transition'' to elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   But an official of the opposition Rally of the Republicans
Party, Alain Lobognon, said the move was designed to ''force
civilians out of the government and create a military
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, initial public reaction to the news was muted. The
commercial capital of Abidjan was calm and there was no unusual
military presence visible on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Until the coup, which ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, Ivory
Coast had long been one of Africa's most stable, prosperous
countries, with only two governments -- both civilian -- in its
40-year history. December's coup was the country's first military
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on who Guei would appoint in his new
Cabinet although a senior civil servant, Georges Wognin, said it
would include some members of the outgoing government.
</P>
<P>
   The dissolved Cabinet included members of various civilian
political parties and a few key military officers.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup Thursday followed mounting calls from some
opposition parties for democratic elections allowing a full range
of political leaders to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has promised elections for Sept. 17. Although he has not
said if he will run, critics say Guei wants to use the elections to
legitimize his government and exclude a popular politician, RDR
leader Alassane Ouattara, who could challenge him. Guei himself has
suggested he may not allow Ouattara to run.
</P>
<P>
   Although the army takeover was initially popular with Ivorians
who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under
Bedie, that enthusiasm has since faded.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have been accused of harassing civilians and summarily
killing suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, army leaders lifted a ban on political meetings, but
warned all party leaders to seek government permission before
leaving the West African country.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally Tuesday in Abidjan, RDR official Ali Coulibaly told
several thousand party members that Ivory Coast was fast becoming a
''fascist dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   International lenders have threatened to withdraw development
assistance to Ivory Coast unless it holds elections. The country is
among the world's biggest cocoa and coffee producers but also has
one of Africa's heaviest debt loads.

<HEADLINE> Appellate decision erodes distinction between libel and slander  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A ruling by the state Superior Court's
Appellate Division erodes the distinction between print and
broadcast media when it comes to defamation cases.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, defamation suits against radio and television
stations were tried as slander cases. Newspapers, magazines and
other print outlets were subjected to libel standards, which
require plaintiffs to show actual damage to their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   An appellate court ruling on Wednesday erases that distinction,
under which libel carries a higher burden of proof for damages, and
sets a precedent in which all media would be considered equal.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cafferty, an attorney who represents the New Jersey Press
Association, hailed the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should applaud the language of this case, which would
indicate that a plantiff in a defamation action must establish by
concrete evidence '' there was damage to his reputation, said
Cafferty, who is also chair of the New Jersey State Bar
Association's Media Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the court reversed a 1998 jury decision in favor
of Camden County Sheriff Michael M. McLaughlin in his defamation
case against William Simon, his opponent in the 1994 sheriff's
race, and RB&AMP;T, a Cherry Hill advertising agency that produced
radio spots for Simon's campaign, because McLaughlin's case was
tried under slander laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are of the view that slander per se is on its last legs in
New Jersey, and may no longer be viable ... basis for awarding
damages when there is no demonstrable harm,'' the decision reads.
</P>
<P>
   A Burlington County jury awarded McLaughlin $40,000 in
compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages. Simon and
RB&AMP;T were ordered to split the payments. Simon and McLaughlin
settled shortly after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The slander suit concerned a radio advertisement during the
hotly contested race.
</P>
<P>
   The ad said McLaughlin, a former New Jersey State Police
intelligence officer, had leaked confidential information to an
organized crime family during an investigation. Simon had approved
the script, which said: ''... how far can you trust a man who
breaks the rules of the New Jersey State Police ... and then tries
to cover it up?''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court did not dispute that Simon and RB&AMP;T defamed
McLaughlin. It disputed the standard of slander, saying McLaughlin
did not produce enough evidence of the harm done to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the court noted that McLaughlin handily won the
sheriff's race, and that many of his supporters called him to say
they did not believe the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This brings New Jersey into line with other jurisdictions and
more modern trend of thought,'' said Richard S. Hyland, the Cherry
Hill attorney who represented RB&AMP;T. ''This is a significant
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's attorney, William Tambussi, said Thursday that he
would appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The net effect of this ruling is that the only way a
politician who is defamed with malice can win a case, is if he or
she loses the election,'' Tambussi said. ''You will now see more
scurrilous and insubstantial ads from fringe candidates, who,
unless they beat them, won't be held liable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A check on negative campaigning has been eliminated by virtue
of a technicality on the distinction between libel and slander,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Austria Plans To Compensate Jews  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's chancellor pledged to start
work on compensating Jews stripped of property under the Nazis, and
on Thursday appointed an envoy to negotiate claims.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel announced the plans on state radio
a day after U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat
urged Austria to set up a fund for Jews who were forced to hand
over houses, businesses and other property as part of what the
Nazis called ''aryanization.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor had said previously that most aryanization claims
had been covered under laws passed after World War II. But on
Thursday, he announced the appointment of diplomat Ernst Sucharipa
as a ''negotiating partner'' on outstanding claims.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that a commission of historians set up in 1998 to
determine which Nazi-era crimes needed remedying would begin work
on the aryanization issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sucharipa, who spent years in New York with Austria's U.N.
delegation, was considered well qualified to deal with U.S.
officials on restitution issues.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel said he hoped for ''very quick'' work, but said the
historians examining the Nazis' aryanization campaign first had to
put their ''facts on the table.'' In the mean time, he said, he
would begin contacting ''victims, not their lawyers,'' the Austria
Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Muzicant, head of Austria's Jewish community, welcomed
Schuessel's comments as an ''important step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Austrian officials have reacted coolly to a class-action suit
filed in New York City Court, demanding that Austria compensate
property stolen from Jews and other Holocaust victims. The
officials said the $18 billion asked in damages was outrageously
out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat on Wednesday urged quick action in creating the fund
for those stripped of property under the Nazis. He was in Vienna to
co-chair an international conference with Austria on setting up a
separate fund to compensate forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Austria announced the outlines of the separate
fund -- about $393.4 million -- for people who were forced into labor
under the Nazis. According to the agreement, the 150,000 or so
surviving victims are each entitled to between $1,300 and $6,900.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ''slave-laborers'' -- those forced to work in Nazi
concentration camps -- would be eligible for the highest payment,
while others pressed into work on farms would receive the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Forced factory workers would be eligible for $2,295. Women who
gave birth while in Austria for forced labor would receive $328,
while children up to age 12 who accompanied parents could claim the
same amount their parents are eligible for.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would be paid for by the Austrian government and
companies that benefited from the forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders began acknowledging in the 1980s that Austria
was not only a victim but also a perpetrator during the Nazi era.
The discussion has increased in recent months, in part because of
the prominence of the far-right Freedom Party in government.
</P>
<P>
   The party gained a reputation for anti-foreigner sentiment under
Joerg Haider, and Haider himself was condemned for statements
praising the Nazi era. Earlier this year, the 14 other EU nations
imposed sanctions on Austria to oppose the party's government role.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Urged To Resist Revenge  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Calling captured rebel leader
Foday Sankoh ''a very vicious man,'' Sierra Leone's attorney
general said Thursday the government is nonetheless determined to
resist pressure from angry citizens to take drastic action against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Many Sierra Leoneans want Sankoh harshly punished for wreaking
havoc on the country during more than eight years of civil war. His
fighters also have plunged the country back into civil war and were
holding hundreds of U.N. captives.
</P>
<P>
   American envoy Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, arrived in Nigeria on a
mission from President Clinton to help put the peace effort back on
track, which has all but collapsed amid the renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by Jackson's comments earlier this week that perceived
as sympathetic to Sankoh, the government has said the U.S. envoy is
not welcome. It remained unclear whether Jackson would visit Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebel attacks, Sierra Leone's beleaguered government
has been reluctant to exclude Sankoh from talks to resolve the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''No views have yet been crystalized as to what to do,'' said
Solomon Berewa, the justice minister and attorney general. ''Foday
Sankoh committed a lot of crimes. He himself is a very vicious man
and has a lot of vicious boys around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was seized Wednesday by troops loosely allied to the
elected government. The news of his capture prompted celebrations
to Freetown, where numerous war victims bear the scars of rebel
brutality -- in the form of hands, legs, ears and lips intentionally
lopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Berewa said the government would resist pressure by angry
citizens to ''take drastic action'' against Sankoh. However, the
government ''might not be as accommodating with him'' as it was in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Lagos, Nigeria, Jackson said the United Nations
''must restore democracy and assert the sovereignty of Sierra
Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today West African stability is being challenged,'' he said.
''The commitment of the West is also being challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson flew on to Benin City, Nigeria, where he was to hold
talks with Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was imprisoned in 1997 and subsequently convicted and
sentenced to death for treason. He was freed last year to take part
in peace talks, and received a government post and unconditional
amnesty for war crimes under a peace deal signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   But he is widely blamed for undermining the agreement earlier
this month, when his forces seized 500 U.N. peacekeepers and
resumed clashes with pro-government forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government might use a different technique this time to
deal with him.'' Berewa said. ''We misjudged him to be a rational
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who was shot in the leg Wednesday during his capture,
underwent surgery overnight to have the bullet removed and was
recovering Thursday, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Human Rights Watch called for Sankoh to be
given a fair trial for crimes against humanity. ''Foday Sankoh must
not be subjected to mob rule,'' said the group's Africa director,
Peter Takirambudde.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the rebels would respond to
Sankoh's detention.
</P>
<P>
   During his last period of captivity, his rebels launched an
offensive culminating in the invasion of Freetown in January 1999,
leaving thousands dead before they were driven out of the city
several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers loosely allied with the government captured Sankoh
early Wednesday next door to his Freetown home. He had disappeared
from the house May 8 after fighters from his Revolutionary United
Front opened fire on thousands of demonstrators, killing 19 people.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to be holding more than 300 of their
original 500 U.N. hostages in dense forests in the east of the
country. Information Minister Julius Spencer said efforts were
ongoing Thursday to free the remaining U.N. personnel held at rebel
bases.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations initially said 80 peacekeepers were freed
Wednesday, but on Thursday revised the figure to just 13, according
to U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and U.N. officials said Thursday that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was expected to recommend a
significant increase in the size of the beleaguered U.N.
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke in New York and Freetown on condition
they not be identified, said Annan would suggest the force be
increased by a few thousand in a report to be issued in the next
few days. Original estimates of 17,000 were revised later Thursday
to as many as 16,500, one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The force, currently authorized to have 11,100 troops, is
already the largest U.N. peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has also proposed expanding the size of the force -- from
its present 11,100 to 13,000 -- to accommodate new units promised by
India, Bangladesh and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Task force seeks subpoena power in auto emissions probe  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After several members said they couldn't do
the job without it, a task force investigating a $400 million
contract to privatize auto emissions tests agreed Thursday to ask
the state Senate for subpoena powers to aid in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   But a defiant Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union,
refused to act and demanded that the task force begin its hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to give it to them when they need it,'' DiFrancesco
said of the subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very upset they haven't had a hearing,'' DiFrancesco said.
He created the task force in February and there has yet to be any
public meeting on the contract with Parsons Infrastructure and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to hear some testimony. I want to hear some facts,''
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the full state Senate has the ability to grant a committee
subpoena powers. As it stands now, the task force is simply an
advisory body. Unless DiFrancesco puts the issue up for a vote, the
Senate cannot act.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic senators on the task force tried to force the
issue before the full Senate on Thursday. Other senators ignored
them and proceeded to the next item on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco ordered the task force to investigate what led to
the deal with Parsons, a seven-year contract that is estimated to
cost taxpayers $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began once Parsons was on the job in December. Foul-ups
in computer programs and testing systems forced motorists to wait
hours at inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration blames Parsons, while the company
says New Jersey officials are partially at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Recent audits show testing equipment that failed in winter
weather could again malfunction in high temperatures. Earlier tests
prompted the state to halt tougher emissions test and the use of a
complicated computer system at 15 of the state's 32 inspection
lanes to allow Parsons time to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the task force -- Republicans and Democrats alike,
as well as a former U.S. district court judge -- voted to seek the
subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just not prepared to sit in with all this unless we're
prepared to be an authentic and investigative body,'' said Herbert
J. Stern. Stern, one of two public members appointed to the
committee, was a former U.S. Attorney, as well as a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either we're going to be a real committee and do a real job or
we're not,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Bryant, D-Camden, said he would think twice about
sitting on the task force without the power to compel witnesses to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Norm Robertson, R-Passaic, said he has assurances from
the governor's office and other state executives that they will
cooperate. Robertson said Thursday he has received word that
documents, possibly as many as 100,000 pages, will be produced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care whether or not they are cooperating, it is a
difference when people are under oath,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to win support from the Senate, Sen. Garry
Furnari, D-Essex, promised to petition again for the subpoena
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue is not going to rest,'' Furnari said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Senate task force, the state Attorney
General's Office began a probe in January. In March, retired state
Supreme Court Justice Alan Handler was appointed to lead that
investigation after Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. cited a
conflict of interest.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Pound South Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli air and ground forces attacked
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon on Thursday, leaving one
militant dead and five people wounded, Lebanese security officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a top aide to Prime Minister Ehud Barak
acknowledged Thursday that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon,
promised by July 7, is being driven by public pressure to end
Israeli casualties there.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has stepped up attacks in recent weeks as Israel
begins to dismantle its positions in preparation for a complete
withdrawal. The attacks have prompted harsh Israeli retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel announced three Israeli soldiers were injured and a
soldier of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army was slightly hurt
in strikes overnight and early Thursday by Shiite Muslim guerrillas
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiite Hezbollah group said one of its guerrillas was killed
in the fighting near the port of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   A shell fired by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army exploded in
the village of Mansouri, wounding a 34-year-old woman, her
daughter, 8, and son, 6, Lebanese officials said on condition of
not using their names.
</P>
<P>
   A Fijian soldier in the U.N. peacekeeping force suffered
shrapnel wounds in the same village when another shell hit his
position, a U.N. officer said, speaking on the same condition of
not being named.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Hezbollah guerrillas attacked several outposts
manned by Israeli troops and the South Lebanon Army in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon, according to a Hezbollah
statement and an Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   One South Lebanon Army militiaman was slightly wounded, Israeli
and Lebanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli jets and helicopters fired missiles at guerrilla targets
near Tyre, the town of Nabatiyeh and in the Hezbollah mountain
stronghold of Iqlim al-Tuffah, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said Israeli missiles also hit targets in Ein el-Tineh and
Birket Jabbour on the edge of the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the U.N. forces stopped their movements between
Naqoura, where the U.N. headquarters are located, and southern
Lebanon after a South Lebanese Army commander threatened to open
fire on all U.N. vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,500 U.N. peacekeepers have been in Lebanon since the 1978
Israeli invasion, which led to Israel's occupying a swath of south
Lebanon to protect northern Israeli towns from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> UK, US Slashes Breast Cancer Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Better treatment over the last decade has slashed
breast cancer death rates by about a quarter in the United States
and Britain and will save the lives of 14,000 women this year in
the two countries, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to the drug tamoxifen, taken by about 1
million women worldwide, said Sir Richard Peto, a professor of
epidemiology at Oxford University who headed the study, published
this week in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time that improvements in the treatment of
any type of cancer have ever produced such a rapid fall in national
death rates,'' Peto said. ''They really are remarkable trends.''
</P>
<P>
   While ''a lot of things contribute, I think the key one is
tamoxifen,'' he said, adding that it's much too sudden a drop to be
due to changes in the causes of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States were studied mostly because they
had the most current, detailed statistical information and because
they were among the first to use tamoxifen, Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of other Western countries would show they already
are starting to see a similar trend, said Dr. Kent Osborne,
director of the breast center at Baylor University in Waco, Texas,
who was not connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne agreed with Peto that breast cancer screening, which
only started to become widespread in the 1980s, has not been around
long enough to cause the death rates to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Peto said death rates will continue to decline once the benefits
of screening emerge and other countries begin to more widely use
tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   His research showed that breast cancer deaths will be down 30
percent in Britain this year, compared with the late 1980s, before
chemotherapy and tamoxifen became widely used. It indicated 13,000
women would die of breast cancer this year, compared to 17,000 in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will experience a 25 percent drop in death
rates, with about 40,000 women dying of cancer this year, Peto
said. If treatment methods were at their pre-1989 stage, 50,000
would die this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is slightly ahead, probably because tamoxifen was
invented there and used there first, Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer is particularly problematic because remnants may
remain after a tumor has been cut out and can cause a recurrence of
cancer years later.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main treatments after surgery. Radiotherapy
targets the remnants of cancer lurking in or near the breast.
Chemotherapy is a cocktail of cell-killing drugs, and tamoxifen and
other hormonal drugs block hormones from nurturing the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen alone has been found to head off one in six
recurrences and cut the risk of relapse by more than one-third. It
also halves the risk of a new cancer occurring in the other breast,
according to Peto's analysis, which examined the largest-ever
collection of existing evidence on cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   While tamoxifen fights cancer, it also can cause womb cancer and
blood clots in the lungs. But using the drug for five years does 30
times more good than harm, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 women who take it, tamoxifen leads to 80 fewer
deaths from breast cancer, two more deaths from womb cancer and one
more death from blood clots in the lungs, it found.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy seems to work as well as tamoxifen in young women,
but only about a third as well as tamoxifen in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   When the two are used together, the chances of survival are even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Radiotherapy, the oldest treatment, prevents about two-thirds of
recurrences, but has yielded only a 1 percent decrease in the
overall death rates. While it works well in clearing up rogue bits
of cancer in the breast, it also increases the risk of heart
attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, radiotherapy has reduced the death rate from breast
cancer by 5 percent since the late 1980s, but has increased the
rate of death from other causes by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This radiotherapy effect is certainly not going to explain the
trend,'' said Jack Cuzick, a professor of mathematics, statistics
and epidemiology at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London,
which funded the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates from lung cancer have plummeted, but that has mainly
been due to people quitting smoking. Cervical cancer rates have
also fallen, but mostly because of early detection.
</P>
<P>
   While improved treatment has led to better survival in rare
cancers such as Hodgkins disease and childhood leukemia, none of
the other major cancers have benefited as much as breast cancer,
Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the breast cancer deaths prevented will be
among women aged between 20 and 69, the research found.

<HEADLINE> US, Mexico To Combat Alien Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Mexico agreed Thursday
to intensify efforts to curb the smuggling of Mexican migrants into
Arizona and their illegal detention by vigilante groups once they
cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced at the close of a day-long meeting
of senior officials from both countries.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement said the two governments committed themselves
to ''strengthen efforts to monitor, investigate and, if warranted,
prosecute'' unlawful behavior by private citizens or law
enforcement authorities on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   They also promised to intensify separate and joint efforts to
combat criminal organizations of migrant smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as co-chairs of the meeting of the U.S.-Mexico
Binational Commission were Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Albright said the two countries ''are
cooperating more closely than ever before on counter-narcotics
matters'' and are ''determined to intensify our joint efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green earlier expressed concern about the ''intolerant
expressions of some American ranchers who promote the persecution
of migrants along the border.'' Green has cited 32 incidents of
vigilante acts committed against Mexican immigrants in the United
States since January 1994 including 27 were in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mexico hired a U.S. law firm to help gather
evidence and bring charges against Arizona ranchers, claiming that
they illegally detained immigrants in vigilante actions.
</P>
<P>
   A report this week by KOLD television station in Tucson, Ariz.,
showed a ranch hand detaining five men, apparently illegal
immigrants, and holding them at gunpoint for the arrival of the
U.S. Border Patrol. A ranch worker was shown pushing one of the men
from a seated position onto his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Arizona, ranchers in the Douglas area started
patrolling their properties in force when the number of illegal
immigrants crossing into that region jumped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers say illegal immigrants crossing their land cut their
water lines and litter their properties. According to one report, a
group of ranchers distributed flyers inviting people ''to hunt
undocumented Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   On the narcotics issue, Green reaffirmed Mexico's disagreement
with the annual process whereby the United States evaluates the
counter-drug performance of countries that produce drugs or are
used as transit points for traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has routinely certified Mexico as
fully cooperating in counter-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But a critical analysis of the Mexican effort was offered Monday
in congressional testimony by William Ledwith, a top official of
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said powerful Mexican drug traffickers have been able to
avoid arrest because of their ability ''to intimidate witnesses,
assassinate public officials and corrupt many of the civilian law
enforcement agencies in Mexico, often at the command level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledwith also said the DEA is ''extremely concerned'' about the
Mexican government's ability to ensure the safety of DEA agents in
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Christians Freed in Vietnam Amnesty  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Two Christian dissidents were among the
more than 12,000 prisoners released in a mass amnesty last month,
Vietnamese officials confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two -- a Catholic clergyman and a member of a Protestant sect
-- were freed along with 12,262 others in the country's largest
pardoning ever, marking the 25th anniversary of the end of the
Vietnam War on April 30, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has repeatedly said that no political dissidents are
being held. However, the country's broadly worded national security
law has been used to clamp down on spiritual movements not approved
by the government and to silence political dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch released a 34-page report
detailing Vietnam's continuing repression of critics, who are
routinely subjected to harassment, restrictions on travel and
communications, house arrest and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based rights group named the two Christian
dissidents -- Catholic clergyman Brother John Euder Mai Duc Chuong,
64, and Protestant sect member Vu Gian Thao, 32 -- among those who
had been jailed for religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Chuong, also known as Mai Huu Nghi, a member of the Congregation
of the Mother Co-Redemptrix, was arrested in 1987 for disrupting
public security and ''conducting propaganda to oppose the socialist
regime and undermining the policy of unity.'' He was sentenced to
18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Thao, a member of the Hmong ethnic minority from the northern
province of Lai Chau, was arrested in 1997 for ''abusing religious
freedom and infringing on the state's rights.'' Thao was sentenced
to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials confirmed that Vietnamese journalist Nguyen
Ngoc Tan, who spent five years in jail for advocating human rights,
also was released in the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, 80, who used the pen name Pham Thai, was an activist in the
unofficial Movement for the Unity of the People and Construction of
Democracy and also pushed for press freedom. Arrested in 1995, Tan
was sentenced to 11 years for ''conspiring against socialist
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups estimate Vietnam holds at least 40 religious
or political dissidents prisoner. Among those being singled out are
senior party officials who have advocated political reform,
religious leaders, intellectuals and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   According to state prison statistics, there are more than 100
people convicted of crimes against national security, the Human
Rights Watch report said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Approves Defense Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee approved a $287 billion
defense bill Thursday containing $460 million for a controversial
amphibious assault ship being built in Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott's home state of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted 27-0 to approve the
bill, which is for fiscal 2001. The measure has $3 billion more
than President Clinton requested, and is about a $20 billion
increase over this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has a $460 million installment for continued work on an
LHD-8 amphibious helicopter carrier, which costs $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained that the ship, being built in Lott's
hometown of Pascagoula, was not requested by the Navy, which
preferred to refurbish one of its older carriers instead of buying
a new one. The Republican leader has argued that the project will
let the Navy modernize an important part of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contains $285 million for cost-overruns in
construction of four LPD-17 amphibious transport ships, and $4.1
billion for U.S. operations in Kosovo, Bosnia and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   A House subcommittee approved a version of the bill last week
that is $1 billion larger than the Senate's.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee also approved a $1.7 billion measure
financing Congress' own operations that contains slight increases
for most programs.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 billion House version of the bill cut spending by 6
percent from this year's levels. Democrats complained that it would
force the elimination of 1,600 jobs, including legislative aides
and Capitol police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Each chamber's bill finances only its own budget plus joint
operations like the Congressional Budget Office. When combined, the
measures will total $2.5 billion, about $40 million more than this
year.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued in Fireworks Blast  </HEADLINE>
By JOHAN VAN DER TOL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- An international arrest warrant was
issued Thursday for the owners of a fireworks warehouse that
exploded last weekend, killing at least 20 people and wounding
almost 1,000, Dutch media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations said Rudi Bakker and Wilhelm Pater are
wanted on suspicion of ''responsibility for possible illegal
activities'' by the S.E. Fireworks firm. The reports said police
searched the suspects' homes and offices Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse caught fire Saturday afternoon, sparking a
firestorm from 100 tons of explosives that left several city blocks
looking like a war zone. More than 600 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said earlier this week that the two owners had
contacted them through their lawyer and promised to cooperate with
the investigation. But the whereabouts of the suspects remained a
mystery. One newspaper reported that Bakker was in a hospital in
neighboring Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities could not be reached to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   At least 21 people were still missing after detectives tracked
down hundreds of people in the days since the blast, Jan Cryns of
the Disaster Victim Identification Team said Thursday. A list of
their names was broadcast on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Police were overwhelmed with reports of 4,400 missing after the
blast, and called in reinforcements to help track down those
unaccounted for and quell fears that the death toll exceeded by far
the official figure.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tuesday, a 70-member task force worked to whittle down the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jan Mans said rescue workers expected to finish sifting
through the remains of some 400 houses by the weekend. The
explosion flattened several rows of houses, wounding 945 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch and German media have speculated that the death toll could
be significantly higher than the official toll of 20, which has not
changed since several hours after Saturday's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Aad Groos suggested the figure was a reliable
estimate after the recovery of 18 bodies. ''All other figures are
speculation,'' Groos said.
</P>
<P>
   But regional Police Chief Aad Meyboom raised the possibility
that more victims be uncovered in a basement now buried under 660
pounds of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hard work is being done, based on practical detective
information ... to look into the possibility that victims may still
be found,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Networks May Skip Clinton Address  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's speech Sunday night
promoting a U.S-China trade deal will air live on only one of the
three major television networks.
</P>
<P>
   CBS and ABC said Thursday they will not carry the speech,
despite a request from the White House. NBC, CNN and FOX will air a
live broadcast of the five-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of internal debate, the White House announced
Thursday morning that Clinton would make a nationally televised
address on the China deal -- the last major trade fight of his
administration and a significant legislative victory if the
Republican-led Congress passes it next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president thinks that this is an extremely
important issue. He wants to make sure that he has a chance to
articulate why a positive vote ... is in our economic and national
security interests,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS decided the speech amounted to lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally the White House asks for time in prime time when it
is a matter of national security,'' CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius
said. ''This seemed to us more like part of the political debate on
this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS will make the speech available to any local affiliate that
chooses to broadcast it live, Genelius said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokeswoman Su-Lin Nichols said the network decided against
a live broadcast because ''it has already covered very thoroughly
both sides of this issue on our news programs, and we will continue
to cover the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC spokeswoman Barbara Levin said the network will pre-empt a
movie to broadcast Clinton's remarks ''on an issue of national
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think both the president and the congressional leadership
feel strongly on this issue. We've decided to honor the request,''
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech comes as Congress is set to debate the trade
bill, which would open Chinese markets to more U.S. goods and end
annual review of China's trading status. The deal is opposed by
organized labor and many environmental and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for a speech to the nation came in part from members
of Congress who wanted Clinton to take the case directly to their
constituents, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the speech is an attempt to give wavering members
''political cover,'' Lockhart said no.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is also responding to ... a number of members of Congress
who indicated it would be useful for him to go and make the case,
you know, in the most public way you can,'' Lockhart said, ''And
that is to talk to the country from the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked for, and got, national television time for four
previous speeches on pending legislation, Lockhart said. The last
was in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Border Crossings  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two lawmakers want a national computer
database of information collected whenever agents conduct spot
check questioning of foreigners at U.S. border points.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the idea, Sen. Spence Abraham, R-Mich., and Rep.
Lamar Smith, R-Texas, hope to block a law that was set to go into
effect next year that would require border agents to question and
keep track of every foreigner who travels in and out of the
country. That law said everyone should be questioned but didn't
specify how that information should be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham and Smith have disagreed for years over how to better
enforce U.S. immigration and customs laws at border crossings
without bottling up traffic. But together Thursday, they announced
legislation that they say will accomplish both goals. The measure
was introduced in the House, and is expected to be introduced in
the Senate early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The original law --Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigrant Responsibility Act -- was designed to stop visitors
from staying in the United States longer than their visas allow.
</P>
<P>
   But many business groups and lawmakers from states along the
Canadian border worried that it would create massive delays and
slow international commerce and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just would have been economic chaos if the original
legislation would have been enacted,'' said Dick Blouse, president
and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce. ''There's
13,500 trucks a day that go back and forth a day between Detroit
and Windsor (in Canada). They estimate those trucks would have been
backed up 17 hours if this legislation was enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has voted three times to repeal the law, but the
House has yet to go along. Congressional and White House
negotiators agreed in 1998 to delay the law's original start until
2001, giving the INS time to come up with a workable plan.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached by Abraham, who led opposition to the law, and
Smith, the leading supporter, does not call for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to collect any more information from
foreigners than is currently collected by agents on pieces of
paper, such as name, country of origin and date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   However, the information that is collected would now be kept in
a computerized database that would allow immigration and law
enforcement agents to have continuous access to the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''For people crossing the border, they are going to see very
little difference,'' said Smith spokesman Allen Kay.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said without the database, border agents have no way of
knowing if the person they are allowing to enter the country is
wanted by the FBI or other law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the INS released illegal immigrant Angel Maturino
Resendiz back to Mexico, not knowing he was wanted by the FBI,
Texas Rangers and Houston police for questioning about murders near
rail lines in this country. He was later captured on charges of
killing nine people in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would require air and sea ports to enter
information into the database by Dec. 31, 2003. The 50 busiest land
border crossings would be required to have the system installed by
the end of 2004 and the rest of the crossings by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for the creation of a government and industry task
force to examine the needs and costs of any additional measures at
borders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that we will have a system that enhances
law enforcement capabilities and will not impose new or onerous
requirements on travelers that would damage Americans or the
American economy,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Eileen Schmidt said Thursday that the agency was
reviewing the legislation.

<HEADLINE> AM-NJ--Floyd-Business Losses, Bjt,600  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOUND BROOK, N.J. (AP) -- Local governments in communities
ravaged by Tropical Storm Floyd last year should consider cutting
or forgiving property and sales taxes for flood-damaged businesses
that commit to rebuild, a federal report suggested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the
U.S. Economic Development Administration also urged communities to
move critical facilities like hospitals, police and fire stations,
power plants and utilities out of flood plains, or take measures to
better protect them from rising flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimated the damage to New Jersey businesses at $127
million, most of it in the hardest-hit communities of Bound Brook
($77 million); Passaic ($17 million); Lodi ($12 million); Trenton
($9 million); Paterson ($8 million) and Manville ($3 million).
</P>
<P>
   The tax waiver proposal would need the approval of state and
local officials, and FEMA officials did not recommend how long the
break should remain in effect. But some hard-hit merchants said it
would be one of the quickest ways to help them recover from
thousands of dollars in debt incurred by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be fantastic,'' said Stan Biniek, whose shoe
store on East Main Street in Bound Brook was wiped out by the
flood. ''We need all the help we can get, and that would be a big
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Saving all or part of the $2,700 a year he pays in property
taxes would help him dig out from about $170,000 in losses Biniek
sustained when the Raritan River spilled over onto East Main Street
and inundated his store, which specializes in orthopedic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one I took on the chin,'' he said. ''We lost everything,
from the floor right up to the ceiling. We lost our entire
inventory, we had to put in new floors, new ceilings, new air
conditioning, wiring, a furnace. The day before the flood, we got a
shipment of $12,000 worth of work boots, still in the cartons,
never touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends in the construction business agreed to defer billing him
for work on his store, but shoe manufacturers didn't want to hear
about any flood, he said. He took out a $70,000 loan from FEMA,
which still must be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bound Brook Mayor Frank J. Ryan said his borough already has
provided tax relief for the approximately 840 businesses and homes
damaged in the storm, lowering property tax assessments by about 20
percent. He said he does not know if the government could afford to
take in any less tax money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost $45 million in ratables as a result of the storm,'' he
said. ''We just got clobbered.''
</P>
<P>
   The borough is lobbying Gov. Christie Whitman for $3.9 million
in discretionary state aid this year to help recover from the
flood.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Herman, a spokesman for the governor, could not say whether
Whitman was likely to endorse the tax waiver proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We share the goal of reducing the economic impact of the
storm, and will carefully review the recommendations of the
report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks the tax waiver is the best way to help
struggling merchants. Randy Fender's bar, the Pour Man's Pub on
South Main Street in Manville was wrecked by the flood, and he has
grown disillusioned with FEMA.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated he lost between $30,000 and $40,000 in the flood,
which he paid for out of his own pocket. A tax waiver wouldn't help
him because he leases the building from a commercial landlord. And
he said FEMA's application process was so daunting he simply gave
up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need a grant, but they won't give me one,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Toledo Won't Enter Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Alejandro Toledo announced Thursday he will
not participate in the May 28 runoff against President Alberto
Fujimori, and he called for a postponement to resolve alleged
election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have come to tell you that Peru Possible will not
participate in the election on May 28,'' Toledo said at a news
conference, referring to the name of his political movement. ''We
have requested an extension until June 18.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would not participate in a runoff on June 18 if
the election irregularities that marked the first round were not
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist, had repeatedly warned that he
will pull out of the race if conditions did not improve.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, protesters yelling ''Get out, tyrant!'' stoned
Fujimori's vehicle at a campaign rally in Ayacucho on Thursday
after the Organization of American States demanded a postponement
of Peru's election runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bodyguards fired automatic rifles into the air to
drive back dozens of demonstrators who ran after his pickup truck
hurling stones and shouting insults as he pulled away from the
plaza in Ayacucho, high in the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters appeared to be students from the state university
in Ayacucho, the birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency that
bloodied this Andean nation through the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The windshield of Fujimori's pickup was cracked by thrown rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Fujimori had ended a campaign speech to
thousands of supporters gathered in the plaza, including
Quechua-speaking peasants trucked in from the countryside to hear
him.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori promised to build roads and irrigation systems as a way
of creating jobs in an area that saw the worst of the guerrilla
violence until rebel leaders were captured in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before boarding a plane back to Lima,
Fujimori condemned the stone throwing and rejected an OAS request
for postponement the runoff. The OAS said it was necessary to put
off the polls to avoid a repeat of the fraud that plagued the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   In its strongest statement yet, the OAS said it was giving
Fujimori's government until Monday, after a nationwide test of the
election authority's vote counting software, to make necessary
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot endorse the results'' of the runoff ''if what
happened in the first round continues,'' said Eduardo Stein, chief
of an OAS mission of election observers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the OAS request, Fujimori said: ''We can't change
the rules at this stage of the process.'' The Peruvian president
has refused to postpone the runoff election, saying it was set by
constitution guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Peru narrowly avoided political turmoil after the first round
vote on April 9, when election officials announced that Fujimori
had fallen a hair shy of the absolute majority needed to win
another five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The result came amid intense international pressure for a
second-round vote, including threatened sanctions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Independent monitors were denied access to tabulation centers
during the vote tally. Ballot totals mysteriously decreased as the
tally progressed and when the final results were delivered, the
figures showed about 1 million more ballots were cast than there
were voters.
</P>
<P>
   Stein on Wednesday complained that Peruvian officials handed his
mission an incomplete copy of vote-counting software for the
upcoming election. And he said that he was still waiting for a
promised report detailing how election officials plan to train vote
counters.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes $15 billion school construction bill  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two years after the state Supreme Court
ordered New Jersey to pay to replace crumbling and overcrowded
school buildings in 30 of the poorest districts, legislation
funding the program is finally heading toward the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed, by a 36-1 vote, the huge school
construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has evolved into a catchall for affluent
suburban schools as well, comes with an estimated $15 billion price
tag over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has an uncertain future, however. A
substantially different version is scheduled for action next month
in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins on Thursday pledged to pass a bill
by the Supreme Court's spring deadline. Yet, the bill's final form
is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Senate passage sets the stage for what promises to be
weeks of intense negotiations among Collins, Senate President
Donald DiFrancesco and Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   One major point of contention involves facilities funding for
the special needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version provides 100 percent funding for all projects
in the poor schools, in keeping with the court ruling that most
interpret as ordering full funding.
</P>
<P>
   But the Assembly bill provides full funding only for emergency
repairs and for projects designed to ease overcrowding. The state
would pay only partial aid for other items, such as cafeterias and
media rooms, under the Assembly version.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to go by the court order. I don't know how we can get
around it,'' Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, the bill sponsor,
told reporters after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' position that the court did not order full funding
could only lead to more legal delays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there would be action taken quickly and we'd be back
in court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins has sought a judicial clarification to determine whether
the court in fact ordered full funding for the poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Another growing concern about the bill is its ballooning
pricetag.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would provide about $6 billion in aid to the
special needs districts and $5.6 billion to the hundreds of others
not covered by the court order. Interest payments would bring the
final cost to about $15 billion over the 30-year repayment
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version provides a minimum of 40 percent construction
funding for all school districts, in some cases retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he supports the minumum funding levels, but
believes the state also should set a ceiling on the amount of aid a
district receives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be nervous voting on a bill, whatever the amount
is, without any indication from the commissioner of Education of
what his standards might be,'' the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley and other Senate supporters defended the inclusion of
the money for the suburban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only appropriate that when we solve and address the court
case, that we address the needs of the rest of the schools in the
state,'' he said. ''We tried to strike an accord for fundamental
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Martin, R-Morris, chairman of the Senate Education
Committee, reminded lawmakers that the state can still practice
fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a school asks for fluff, like a swimming pool or something
else that isn't absolutely essential, the state has the obligation
to turn it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other differences between the competing bills include:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Senate would have the state Economic Development Authority
oversee the building project, the largest in state history, but
allows some local districts leeway to manage their own affairs.
Collins wants another state agency, the state Building Authority,
to head the effort.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Senate bill also includes six unidentified community
development projects to be built in conjunction with school
improvements, to upgrade entire neighborhoods. The Assembly version
has no such provision.	   The Assembly Appropriations Committee is expected to
take up the
lower house's version of the school construction bill on June 1,
with a full Assembly vote tentatively set for June 5.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the Legislature about two weeks to work out any
unresolved issues between the two bills, before the court's spring
deadline looms.

<HEADLINE> Speaker retaliates against supporters of coup attempt  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
retaliated Thursday against supporters of an ongoing attempted coup
by former Majority Leader Michael Bragman, and picked up the
backing of one of the chamber's most powerful members in the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, the leader of the Assembly majority's more conservative
upstate wing, called the retaliatory moves by his fellow Democrat
''intolerable'' and boasted of enough support among Democratic
colleagues to send Silver packing.
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch said her boss was solidly in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, supporters of the Manhattan Democrat were working
the telephones furiously behind the scenes on Thursday in an
attempt to turn back the Bragman challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That effort appeared to pay off, at least to some extent, when
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic cdhairman of the Bronx,
announced Thursday night that he was backing Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent behind Speaker
Sheldon Silver,'' Ramirez said, adding that the 10-member Bronx
Democratic delegation to the Assembly appeared to be in agreement
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman went public with his coup attempt on Wednesday, saying
he planned to formally make his move Monday when the Assembly
reconvenes. Silver immediately stripped Bragman of the majority
leader's title and its $34,500-a-year, extra pay stipend and
temporarily closed the majority leader's state Capitol office.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman continued to work Thursday out of the majority leader's
office in the nearby Legislative Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Silver stripped two veteran members of the Assembly
of their committee chairmanships for supporting Bragman. Lynch did
not rule out further retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   In losing their chairmanships, Martin Luster of Ithaca and
Ronald Tocci of Westchester County also lost the $12,500 stipends
that go with the posts. New York's state legislators receive base
salaries of $79,500, but most also receive the extra stipends for
committee or party leadership posts. Assembly committee chairmen
serve at the pleasure of the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Luster, elected to the Assembly in 1988, has been chairman of
the Assembly's Real Property Taxation Committee while Tocci,
elected to the chamber in 1984, has been head of the Veterans'
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said it was an attempt to intimidate Assembly members
that would backfire and bring him even more support.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of action that has prompted me doing what I
have done,'' he said, adding that it was a sign Silver was
''absolutely panic-stricken.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The members are very unhappy. They don't participate. They're
not part of the process. They are treated with disrespect,''
Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting here this morning with 50 rock-solid (Democratic)
votes,'' he added. That would give the majority leader the
advantage within the 98-member Democratic majority in the
150-member house that will decide on Bragman's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he was considering making the names of his 50
colleagues public, but was hesitating because of possible further
retaliation by Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're so treacherous in their actions here. They're so
heavy-handed that I am reluctant to put out the list,'' the
Syracuse-area Democrat said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   In a later statement, Bragman said Silver's style has been
''secretive and aloof'' and that during the current leadership
battle ''he has surrounded himself with paid lobbyists and other
non-legislators who are seeking to influence members on how to vote
on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's statement came out as several powerful New York labor
union leaders, including state AFL-CIO President Denis Hughes,
issued their own statement saying ''a divisive battle for the
speakership at this time is counterproductive.'' The statement did
not specifically endorse Silver.
</P>
<P>
   But just minutes later, a revised statement was issued by the
same labor leaders in which the claim that a leadership battle
would be counterproductive was removed. A spokesman for Hughes said
the first statement had been issued in error. The second statement
took no position on the wisdom of having a leadership fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman indicated he was being supported in his effort by state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I am concerned, Carl and I are partners,'' Bragman
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he was not helping either Silver or Bragman and that
when Assembly members called asking for advice, ''I'm telling them
that they've got to make a decision about what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Pataki offered a similarly neutral stance
when current state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno moved
successfully to oust Ralph Marino as the GOP leader of the Senate
over the Thanksgiving Day weekend in 1994. At the time, the Pataki
statement was viewed by many Republicans as the go-ahead for GOP
senators to join the revolt against Marino.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the current situation was different. ''I'm not the
governor. I don't have that kind of influence ... I'm not involved.
It doesn't help me to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is preparing for a run for governor in 2002, is the
only black ever elected to statewide office in New York and has
great sway with the Assembly's black lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the battle between Silver and Bragman stems at least in
part from the former majority leader's backing of McCall's
gubernatorial effort over federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo's
possible run for the job his father, Mario Cuomo, lost to Pataki in
1994. Silver has been widely seen as a Cuomo supporter.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Thursday that should it be evident by
Monday that Silver doesn't have the votes to remain as speaker,
some other Assembly Democrat from New York City may step forward to
challenge Bragman for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a Democratic speaker of the Assembly from
outside New York City in more than 80 years. Should Bragman get the
job it would mean the city wouldn't have one of its own in the room
when Pataki, Bruno and the Assembly speaker negotiate budget deals
and other major issues.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Eyes Bigger Sierra Leone Force  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is preparing to
recommend a significant increase in the size of its Sierra Leone
peacekeeping force in hopes of propping up the West African
nation's peace process, diplomats and U.N. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke in New York and Freetown on condition
they not be identified, said Secretary-General Kofi Annan would
suggest the force be to as many as 16,500 in a report to be issued
later this week or next.
</P>
<P>
   The force, currently authorized at 11,100 troops, is already the
largest U.N. peacekeeping mission currently deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council had been expected Thursday to approve a
stopgap British-sponsored resolution raising that limit to 13,000
in order to accommodate Indian, Jordanian and Bangladeshi troops
that have already been promised but haven't yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States said it needed another day to consult
Congress for approval of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   In the next week or so, the council could take up Annan's new
recommendation for additional troops.
</P>
<P>
   West African countries, which supplied forces that kept the
peace in Sierra Leone before the U.N. presence, have already agreed
to send at least 3,000 additional reinforcements, said Elian Diop,
a spokeswoman for the West African political and economic
community, ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday urged
that Russian peacekeepers and helicopters be sent to the country.
Russia's Defense Ministry has prepared a contingent of four
helicopters and about 110 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came despite widespread uncertainty about how the
peace agreement signed last July in Lome, Togo could be saved after
rebels took up arms against the government and United Nations
peacekeepers in the past few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Group Cancels Gay Therapy Discussion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Psychiatric Association canceled a
scheduled panel discussion of whether homosexuality can be altered
through therapy, a move that has upset some self-described former
gays.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over what is known as reorientation therapy was
pulled from the APA's convention agenda on Wednesday. APA
spokeswoman Lynn Schultz-Writsel said organizers could not find any
doctors who would argue for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation led to a protest by Exodus International, a
non-denominational Christian organization that seeks to help gays
switch their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here as one representative for a virtually unseen but
sizable population,'' said Exodus' national board chairman, John
Paulk of Colorado Springs. ''I once lived as a gay man, but now I'm
heterosexual, something the American Psychiatric Association says
does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulk said he is a former drag queen who has two sons with his
wife, Anne, a former lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   The canceled debate was organized by Dr. Robert Spitzer, the
same person who spearheaded the APA's decision in 1973 to remove
homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. At the time, the
Columbia University psychiatry professor argued that homosexuality
does not meet the criteria necessary to be considered a mental
disorder, calling it instead an ''irregular'' form of sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Now Spitzer wants to explore whether homosexuality can be
reversed for some people. He contends that the only way to
determine whether that is possible is to conduct scientific
experiments and share information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no documentary evidence showing someone's sexual
preference can be changed by therapy,'' Spitzer said. ''There is
only anecdotal evidence, mostly from the therapists themselves,
claiming that what they do works. That's not very scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the other hand, there's no scientific evidence to show that
this is impossible,'' said Spitzer, who called the cancellation
distressing. ''It hasn't been studied.''

<HEADLINE> 'Smart gun' technology wins Senate approval  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After the Senate on Thursday backed four
bills promising safe handguns, dozens from New Jersey's Million Mom
March contingent pledged to pressure the Assembly to outlaw the
sale of new pistols without ''smart gun'' features.
</P>
<P>
   Moms, children and a smattering of fathers ringed the floor of
the Senate, cheering after each vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The march on Sunday was like giving birth to a baby. These
votes are like a baby's steps. The Senate is a baby step. The
Assembly is another baby step,'' said Julia DeSantis, a mother from
Westfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 34-2 to mandate features that allow only a
gun's owner to fire the weapon. Bills making 21 the legal age to
buy handguns, requiring all new guns to undergo a ballistics test
and spending $5 million to supplement enforcement efforts passed
38-0.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters agree that no gun sold now has the safety features
warranted by the Senate bill. But the measure calls on the attorney
general to decide when they are commercially available before the
ban on other handguns begins.
</P>
<P>
   If this becomes law, it would not affect used guns, antique
weapons or the regulation arms issued to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a similar Senate measure died when the Assembly did
not take it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the day of compromise is over. I think we proved that
on Sunday,'' said Donna Dees-Thomases, a public relations executive
from Short Hills who helped organize the demonstration in
Washington. Mothers and activists crowded the nation's capital to
lobby for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the majority of America. We proved that Sunday,''
Dees-Thomases said at a news conference before the vote. ''The
technology will not be there until we force it. Not until we force
childproof technology will it be available.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other mothers in the group already have meetings
scheduled with their Assembly representatives, Dees-Thomases said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident that the upper house will overwhelmingly
support this package,'' said Senate President Donald T.
DiFrancesco, R-Union after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no excuses this time for not doing everything
possible to protect our children from an accidental or criminal
encounter with a gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief Senate debate, ranking Democrat Richard J.
Codey, D-Essex, urged Republicans to lobby Assembly leaders to at
least have the bills up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not make what we're doing today meaningless,'' Codey
said. ''Whether it fails or it passes, it deserves its day on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two dissenters, Sen. Anthony Bucco, R-Morris, said he
supports the intent behind the bill but could not vote to legislate
technology that does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to make sure it's a foolproof, childproof weapon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said the state does have tough gun laws ''but that's
not good enough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to send a message that where child safety is
concerned, that's our highest priority,'' DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Miller, director of Cease Fire New Jersey hailed the bill
as a landmark action.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wonderful measure. This is a first in the nation,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman supports DiFrancesco's bill because it
''is a reasonable approach to smart guns,'' said spokeswoman Jayne
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is a supporter of smart-gun technology,'' O'Connor said.
The governor would review any bill once it reaches her desk,
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said he supports the age
limit and the ballistics measures. But he said he has problems
requiring technology that isn't available.

<HEADLINE> Justice Said Pressured on Fund Probe  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote a memo in the
earliest days of the Democratic fund-raising investigation
suggesting a top Justice Department official was under pressure not
to proceed with the probe to save Attorney General Janet Reno's
job.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, belatedly turned over to Senate investigators this
week, also discloses that Freeh urged Reno and Justice Department
public integrity chief Lee Radek to step aside from the
investigation as early as December 1996 because of purported
comments made by Radek.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was described to The Associated Press by several
government officials. They had seen it since the FBI turned it over
to the Justice Department to produce to the Senate and House
Judiciary committees investigating the fund-raising matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dec. 9, 1996 memo to Deputy FBI Director William J.
Esposito, Freeh recounted, third-hand, comments Radek allegedly
made to Esposito suggesting he was being pressured in connection
with the investigation into Democratic fund-raising improprieties
during President Clinton's 1996 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's memo quotes Radek as telling Esposito he was ''under a
lot of pressure not to go forward with the investigation'' because
Reno's job ''might hang in the balance,'' the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were reports speculating in Washington on
whether Reno, who requested the Whitewater independent counsel
investigation, would serve a second term as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   She steadfastly resisted an independent prosecutor for
fund-raising, but has named a total of seven independent counsels
to investigate the president and his administration, at times
angering Clinton's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wrote Esposito that he met with Reno and told her about
Radek's purported comments and suggested ''on that basis'' both
Radek and Reno should step aside from the investigation, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached late Thursday, Radek said he never was under pressure to
scrap the investigation to help Reno and did not recall ever making
such comments to Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no recollection of ever saying I was under pressure
because the attorney general's job hung in the balance. Nor is it
something I would have said because it has no basis in fact,''
Radek said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collinwood declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the Freeh memo comes at a sensitive time for
the FBI and Justice Department, whose relations have been strained
by very public disputes over the investigations into China
espionage and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials told AP that Reno has received an
internal report on the government's handling of the case of nuclear
lab scientist Wen Ho Lee that criticizes both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
report by prosecutor Randy Bellows blames the FBI for not providing
enough oversight and resources into the early part of the
investigation when leads of Lee's possible spying for China
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   After months of suggestions that Lee would be indicted for China
espionage, the scientist was charged last December with lesser
offenses of removing nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos lab with
no suggestion he gave them to China.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report sides with the FBI on one issue -- that the
Justice Department had enough grounds to approve a warrant for
electronic surveillance in the Lee case, the officials said.
Justice had rejected the FBI's request, angering its agents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bellows report adds that the FBI did not provide the
department with all the information it collected that could have
helped in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeh memo involving the fund-raising issue emerges more
than two years after Congress first began reviewing the conduct and
quality of the criminal fund-raising investigation, in which
several Democratic donors and fund-raisers have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the FBI did not disclose the existence of the
memo to Justice officials until late last month and that it wasn't
turned over to Senate investigators until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers mostly have focused on debates within Justice and the
FBI in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to name an independent prosecutor to
take over the probe of Clinton and Vice President Al Gore's
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and the former head of the Justice task force that ran the
investigation both have acknowledged they fervently argued later in
the investigation for appointment of a special prosecutor, but Reno
turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeh's memo provides the first evidence that such arguments
dated to the very beginning of the investigation in late 1996 and
were based in part on concerns about possible political pressures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials' description of the 1996 memo, Freeh
wrote that Radek's public integrity section was not capable of
conducting a thorough investigation and that Reno and Radek should
recuse themselves from the investigation in favor of aggressive
investigators -- or ''junk-yard dogs,'' according to the memo -- from
outside the Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> NY Judge Arrested After Wife Stabbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge was arrested Thursday after
allegedly stabbing his wife in the back during an argument at their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kowtna, 51, was taken into custody after police responded
to a domestic dispute call about 8:20 a.m., said Det. Sgt. John
Giambrone. He said the judge placed the call to police.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found Mary Gail Kowtna, 45, suffering from two stab
wounds to the upper left side of her back. She was in stable
condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kowtna was hospitalized for a psychological evaluation. Specific
charges against him were pending, Giambrone said.
</P>
<P>
   Kowtna has been a Nassau County Court judge since 1994, handling
criminal cases. He previously worked in the district attorney's
office, where his primary responsibility was fraud cases.

World Focuses on Edmonton Researchers Diabetes Treatment
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Diabetics worldwide clogged the phone
lines at a small medical foundation in an Edmonton industrial park
Thursday after it became the focus of a major breakthrough in
treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have got a lot of very, very emotional diabetics calling us
wanting to get in on the clinical trials,'' said Joanne Langer,
executive director of the Alberta Foundation for Diabetic Research.
</P>
<P>
   The group called a hasty news conference Thursday to discuss the
findings by a team of Alberta researchers it funded.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also emphasized the importance of organ donations
after the potentially life-saving technique was described at a
medical conference in Chicago on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls from Israel, Germany, Australia and across the U.S.
and Canada were in response to news that a research team at the
University of Alberta in Edmonton has come close to a cure for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The team is the first in the world to successfully transplant
insulin-producing cells from a donor pancreas into the livers of
eight patients with severe diabetes.
Observers: Gas Prices Likely To Stay High All Summer
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Prices at the gas pumps across Canada crept up
again this week leading to the Victoria Day long weekend, and
industry watchers say higher world oil prices could make fill-ups
more expensive all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier this spring, when soaring prices were deflated by
a decision from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to pump more oil, fast relief isn't expected during the busy
driving season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the high-demand period now,'' says Michael Ervin,
president of Calgary-based petroleum marketing firm M.J. Ervin &AMP;
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ''So that alone is going to have an upward pressure on gasoline
prices right through until Labour Day weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin's weekly pump price survey shows the national average
price rose 2.1 cents in the last week to 72.2 cents a litter. The
largest increase was in Windsor, Ontario, with an 8.4-cent jump to
73.7 cents a litter
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunt, national president of the Canadian Automobile
Association, doesn't think extra gas costs will deter many from
getting on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers are fighting back, with boycotts of the oil
majors or Internet-related efforts to track and publicize the
cheapest gas prices.
Nova Scotia Said Short More Than 600 Nurses
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Two newly released studies indicate
Nova Scotia is in dire need of more than 600 additional nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point is quickly approaching where public safety will be
at risk,'' concludes a report on the nursing crisis presented to
Health Minister Jamie Muir in January.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were obtained by The Canadian Press under the
provincial Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, four nurses who spoke at a news conference organized
by the NDP on Thursday said the crisis has already arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Nova Scotia's Tory government says more research is needed.
Klein Gov't Announces Extra $54M for Health
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The Alberta government will spend an
extra $54 million this year to cut wait times for joint
replacements, cancer treatments and heart surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The end result will be significantly better access to health
services in Alberta,'' Health Minister Halvar Jonson said Thursday
at the Royal Alexandra Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The money is a rough 50-50 split of federal money from the
Canada Health and Social Transfer and surplus provincial money.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of $180 million in funding to be announced by the
province over the next week to cut waiting lists and buy new
medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The funding comes a week after Premier Ralph Klein's
Conservative government passed its controversial private-health
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Liberal health critic Karen Leibovici said the new
money is a failed plan to smooth ruffled feathers over Bill 11.
Lloyd's of London To Search for Missing Swissair Valuables
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Lloyd's of London has plans to
search the Swissair crash site off Nova Scotia for $300 million in
diamonds and jewels that were aboard the ill-fated plane.
</P>
<P>
   CBC-TV reported Thursday night that Lloyd's has staked a claim
to the crash site through a Canadian insurance company and has
applied for a treasure trove licence from the Nova Scotia
government.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Estabrooks, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature who
represents communities near the crash site, wants the province to
reject any treasure trove application ''because of the sacredness
of the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the ocean off Peggy's Cove on
Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's manifest indicates that two kilograms of diamonds
and five kilograms of jewelry were aboard when it went down. The
valuables were never found.
</P>
<P>
   A Lloyd's spokesperson said they hope to begin the search this
summer.
Diagnosis on Ailing Rocket Expected Next Week
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Results of tests on former Montreal Canadians
great Maurice (Rocket) Richard for a suspected recurrence of
abdominal cancer are expected next week, his agent said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Jean Roy said Richard, 78, may be released from Hotel Dieu
hospital today to await the results of a battery of tests and
observations taken since he entered hospital on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said there would be a news release or news conference to
update Richard's condition once the results are known.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who scored a team-record 544 goals for the Canadians in
the 1940s and 1950s, was diagnosed with a rare form of abdominal
cancer more than two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Defense Bill Ups Veterans' Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major defense bill passed by the House on
Thursday improves health care and prescription drug access for
military retirees and opens up all military hospitals to
Medicare-eligible vets.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which authorizes nearly $310 billion in defense
programs, also includes a 3.7 percent military pay raise and
provides up to $500 a month in assistance for economically strapped
military personnel, including those who depend on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed 353-63 and now goes to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Health care for the nation's military retirees has become a
prominent issue in Congress as the retiree population ages and base
closings deprive them of many of health facilities near their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill seeks to improve TRICARE, the HMO-like health
care plan for retirees and military dependents. It eliminates
inequities where family members stationed far from military
facilities pay more for health care than those living near a base,
covers travel expenses for visits to facilities more than 100 miles
from primary care services and reduces limits on catastrophic
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes available a mail-order prescription drug service
to all Medicare-eligible retirees with an $8 copayment and a 20
percent copayment at network retail pharmacies. Currently, military
retirees, who switch to Medicare at age 65, can still get
prescription drugs but half can't take advantage of the benefit
because they don't live near a military base.
</P>
<P>
   The House, by 406-10, approved an amendment offered by Rep. Gene
Taylor, D-Miss., that would make permanent and nationwide a 1997
demonstration project under which six military health facilities
were opened to those 65 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor argued that retirees ''justifiably feel betrayed''
because the nation has not lived up to the promise of a lifetime of
free health care at military facilities. ''They don't need any more
demonstration promises, they don't need any more halfhearted
efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., argued that military hospitals don't
have the space or the training to treat a large population of
elderly veterans and that the demonstration project, meant to be
cost-neutral, has cost the Pentagon more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   By making what is called Medicare subvention permanent ''we're
taking a crippled program that has not been fixed and putting it on
the road to financial disaster,'' he said. His proposal to add
sites to the current demonstration program was defeated 323-95.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it wanted the demonstration
project extended one or two years, after which expansion or its
lifetime could be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers approved by 218-201 an amendment offered by Rep. Ike
Skelton, D-Mo., to remove language in the bill at odds with an
agreement reached last January between President Clinton and the
governor of Puerto Rico on the future of Navy training on the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, growing out of long-lasting protests against live
ordnance training on Vieques, permitted the Navy to resume training
with dummy bombs and promised a referendum on whether the Navy
should leave Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, however, would have barred the secretary of the
Navy from transferring the eastern end of the island from Navy
jurisdiction and allowed $40 million in economic aid to the people
of Vieques only when live-fire training was resumed on the range.
The administration, in a statement, said that provision would
unilaterally alter the agreement and was ''unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which provides $4.5 billion more than the
president requested, also contains $2.2 billion for research and
development of a national missile defense system and $5.9 billion
for Energy Department environmental cleanup programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers approved, 415-8, an amendment that would reduce from
180 to 60 days the congressional review period for administrative
changes in rules on high speed computers. They also voted 264-153
to end funds for U.S. ground troops in Kosovo if the president by
next April 1 doesn't certify that European allies are paying their
fair share in the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> $92M Award in NY Police Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury awarded $92 million Thursday to a
plaintiff who sued the city after a police officer's bullet left
him paralyzed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment in favor of Jason Rodriguez, now 22, more than
doubled the $41 million awarded him by another jury last summer -- a
verdict that was thrown out on appeal. City attorneys said they
would appeal again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an outrageous verdict, very much against the weight of
the evidence in this case,'' said Daniel Connolly, special counsel
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   The award includes $75 million for future pain and suffering and
$10.5 million for future medical care, said David Dean, an attorney
for the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said the total ''may be high, but what would you take to be
paralyzed from age 17 on?''
</P>
<P>
   The excessive-force lawsuit alleged the off-duty officer, David
Dugan, shot Rodriguez twice after the teen had complied with orders
to halt and drop his gun after a dispute on a Brooklyn street. One
of the bullets shattered his spine.
</P>
<P>
   The defense claimed that Dugan -- who was never charged
criminally and is still on the force -- only fired after Rodriguez
refused to freeze and pointed his gun at the officer. A civilian
witness backed the officer's version of the 1995 incident, Connolly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan ''took the action he should have taken, which was to
defend himself and others,'' Connolly said.

<HEADLINE> Weather hits hard in Hudson Valley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.(AP) -- About 100 homes were damaged as severe
thunderstorms over the state tore through sections of Orange,
Dutchess and Ulster counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County Emergency Management Office reported high
winds, nickel-sized hail, torrential rains and scores of trees and
power lines blocking primary and secondary roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we've been through this with Floyd and other
storms; so we'll be able to do get through this one too,'' the
office's Dominick Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Fallen power lines trapped several people in a car in the town
of Hamptonburgh 25 miles southwest of Poughkeepsie. Workers with
the Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp. joined local firefighters
in freeing the passengers. None were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The three utility companies serving the area -- Central Hudson,
Orange and Rockland, and New York State Gas and Electric -- were
still figuring how many customers lost power to the storm as of
8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   State Police in Ulster County said a collapsed tree about five
miles south of the Kingston Interchange backed traffic about three
miles.
</P>
<P>
   According to Trooper James Fulmer of the state police in
Poughkeepsie, detachment members spotted a funnel-shaped cloud.
National Weather Service meteorologists planned to survey the
damaged areas Friday to investigate the report.
</P>
<P>
   The same east-blowing storm ripped through most of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Broome, Tioga and Chenango counties, several homes were
damaged by falling trees and blowing debris. NYSEG reported more
than 15,000 customers without power in the three-county area, with
many customers likely to be without power until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rush-hour traffic was slowed in Binghamton and surrounding
communities as streets were flooded and traffic signals stopped
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said a house in Harpursville in northern Broome
county was damaged in a fire that may have been started by sparks
from downed electric lines.

<HEADLINE> Infamous Little Italy Eatery Reopens  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't bother looking for bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Umbertos Clam House -- the venerable Little Italy
institution where mobster ''Crazy Joey'' Gallo ate a lead dessert
after a last supper of scungilli -- hosted a grand reopening
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But no, this is not your godfather's restaurant. This Umbertos
is actually a new restaurant found two blocks from the original on
Mulberry Street. The lone constant is its owner, Bobby Ianniello,
who ran the old space between 1972-96.
</P>
<P>
   Ianniello, the brother of well-known Genovese family capo
Matthew ''Matty the Horse'' Ianniello, dismissed talk of the
restaurant's most infamous moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's 30 years ago,'' he said shortly before a party to
christen the new place. ''Joey Gallo -- kids today don't know his
name. That's not why people come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, a member of the Colombo crime family, became a celebrity
hoodlum of sorts in the early '70s -- surfacing at Broadway openings
and in gossip columns. His style and mouth often irritated his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   One of those competitors helped Gallo turn Umbertos into an
indelible part of New York mob lore.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours of April 7, 1972, Gallo arrived there
after a long night celebrating his 43rd birthday. Earlier, he
partied at the Copacabana with actor Jerry Orbach -- now a
television cop on ''Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, accompanied by his bodyguard and a small entourage,
stopped in around 5 a.m. for a late-night snack.
</P>
<P>
   In a mistake he would never repeat, Gallo sat with his back to
the front door of the two-week-old restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A hitman with a .38-caliber weapon entered. Bullets flew. Gallo,
mortally wounded, staggered to the street and died alongside his
parked Cadillac. No one was ever arrested for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   After the hit, Matty Ianniello was reportedly cornered in
Umbertos kitchen by Gallo's bodyguard, ''Pete the Greek''
Diapioulas. When the bodyguard accused The Horse of setting Gallo
up, he quickly denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ''You think I'm crazy?'' Matty Ianniello asked. ''To let this
happen in this place?''
</P>
<P>
   The slaying immediately stamped Umbertos as a must-see for
tourists who scanned its woodwork and kitchen door for leftover
bullet holes. Its lure remained unabated, even when The Horse was
jailed in '86 for skimming its proceeds, or when a federal monitor
ran the place in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But the restaurant closed down in October 1996 after losing its
lease, Bobby Ianniello recounted. He opened a smaller restaurant
about a year later; the new space, with more than double the
seating of the old, officially opened this week.
</P>
<P>
   Why stay down on Mulberry Street?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still the character of the neighborhood,'' Ianniello
replied. ''It's old New York. And the fact that it still attracts
many tourists -- Little Italy.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Extinguishers Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A California company is recalling 26,000 fire
extinguishers because they can explode, causing puncture wounds and
blast injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The company, 99 Cents Only Store, which is located in City of
Commerce, Calif., has received five reports of the fire
extinguishers exploding in consumers' homes, causing property
damage, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no injuries, one person was hit by flying
debris, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled ''Firestopper'' fire extinguishers are yellow with
a black top and a red spout. ''FIRESTOPPER'' is written on the side
of the extinguisher in orange. The ''I'' in the name is written to
resemble a flame.
</P>
<P>
   The extinguisher, originally marketed by Bombay Productions Inc.
in California, is about 10 inches high and weighs 12 ounces. Other
writing on the unit includes ''ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE,''
''NON-TOXIC,'' ''The Portable Liquid Fire Extinguisher'' and ''MADE
IN THE USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollar-type discount stores, including Only Deals and Bargain
Wholesale, and wholesalers sold these fire extinguishers nationwide
from January 1999 through February 2000 for between 99 cents and
$4.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission advises consumers to discharge these fire
extinguishers into a plastic garbage bag or similar container
outside, in an open area. They should return the discharged units
to the store where purchased and obtain a refund. For more
information, consumers can call 99 Cents Only Stores at
1-888-289-3325 between 9 a.m and 5 p.m. PDT Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Defender Da Guia Dies at 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Defender Domingos da Guia, whose
elegant style of play earned him the nickname the ''Divine
Master,'' died Thursday of complications following a stroke. He was
87.
</P>
<P>
   Da Guia starred in the 1930s and 1940s for the Brazilian club
soccer teams Bangu, Flamengo, Vasco da Gama and Corinthians,
winning Rio de Janeiro state championships in 1934, 1939, 1942 and
1943. He also won titles for Nacional of Uruguay in 1933 and for
Argentina's Boca Juniors in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Da Guia, using technique rather than force, set the standard by
which all Brazilian defenders came to be judged. He started on the
Brazilian team that finished third at the 1938 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Ademir da Guia, inherited his father's style and also
became a star player. As a midfielder with Palmeiras, he won
national championships in 1972 and 1973 and played in the 1974
World Cup, where Brazil finished fourth.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 3 HRs To Reach 539th  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit three home runs Thursday
night and moved past Mickey Mantle into eighth place on the career
list with 539.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire leads the majors with 17 homers this year.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis star broke a tie with Mantle when he connected for
No. 537, a three-run drive in the first inning off Philadelphia's
Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire then hit a two-run homer into the upper deck in the
second inning. He connected for a two-run shot to center in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 64th multi-homer game, moving him into second place
ahead of Willie Mays. Babe Ruth is first with 72.
</P>
<P>
   It was McGwire's fifth three-homer game and first since hitting
three at Veterans Stadium on May 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for McGwire on the career home run list is former
Phillies star Mike Schmidt at 548.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is 4-for-18 lifetime off Schilling with all four hits
being homers, including one on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had been 0-for-6 with four strikeouts in the three-game
series against the Phillies.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Passes Hmong Citizenship Bill  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed legislation Thursday that
would make it easier for members of a Laotian ethnic group to
become U.S. citizens, agreeing on compromise language on who would
be found eligible for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The bill waives the English-language requirement for Hmong and
other Laotians who were recruited by the Central Intelligence
Agency in Laos for covert military actions during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   A similar version, sponsored by Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., has
already passed the House. Backers of the bill hope to get a quick
second vote in the House on the new Senate language, and avoid
having to work out the difference in a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said that the Hmong have found it
difficult to learn English because their language did not have a
written form until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., had raised concerns about the
legislation because as it passed the House it would allow the Lao
Veterans of America to certify who would qualify for the waiver.
Grams' substitute bill, which passed the Senate, called for the CIA
or the Defense Department to make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the Justice Department, in determining whether
someone is eligible for citizenship, ''may consider any
documentation provided by organizations maintaining records with
respect to Hmong Veterans or their families.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire homered three times to pass
Mickey Mantle for eighth place on the career list and had a
career-high seven RBIs, leading the St. Louis Cardinals over the
Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who took over the major league home-run lead with 17,
broke a tie with Mantle in the first inning when he hit No. 537, a
three-run drive off Curt Schilling (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit a two-run homer in the second inning -- only the 54th
to reach the left-field upper deck at Veterans Stadium -- to make it
5-0. He added a two-run shot in the eighth off Wayne Gomes for No.
539.
</P>
<P>
   With the fifth three-homer game of his career, McGwire became
the only NL player with a pair of three-homer games at
Philadelphia; he also did on May 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 64th multihomer game of McGwire's career, breaking a
tie with Willie Mays for the second-most ever. Babe Ruth had 72.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is 4-for-18 in his career against Schilling, with all
four hits being homers, including one on April 30. McGwire had been
0-for-6 with four strikeouts in the three-game series against the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for McGwire on the career home run list is former
Phillies star Mike Schmidt at 548. McGwire received a standing
ovation after his second homer and fans booed loudly when he was
intentionally walked in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has homered in 36 of 40 games and are on pace to hit
344, shattering the record of 264 set by the 1997 Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, making his fourth start since offseason shoulder
surgery, allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings, walked
five and struck out five. With his second subpar outing in less
than a week. his ERA rose to 3.15 to 4.15.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (6-0) allowed two runs and nine hits in 5 2-3
innings. The Cardinals are averaging 9.3 runs in his seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia made it 5-1 on a two-out double by Mickey Morandini
in the second, and Desi Relaford singled in a run the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The loudest cheers of the night from the crowd of 17,137 --
the smallest to see McGwire this season -- came when the
Philadelphia Flyers scored in their 4-2 playoff win over the New
Jersey Devils. Twice after the fans erupted following a Flyers'
goal, St. Louis catcher Mike Matheny called time and walked to the
mound. ... Stephenson is 3-0 against the Phillies, who traded him
to St. Louis along with Ricky Bottalico for Ron Gant, Jeff Brantley
and Cliff Politte in November 1998. ... St. Louis catchers have not
committed an error this season. The Cardinals are the only NL team
with no errors at the position.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Senate on Thursday closed a
loophole in a law banning nude bathing that allowed swimmers to
sunbathe naked on federal land within the state.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, S-1225, clarifies current law to ensure that no one
can disrobe on government-owned land. It passed 36-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Sen. James Cafiero, R-Cape May, the bill amends a
1999 law that said a town could forbid nudity only on ''state owned
lands within its borders.''
</P>
<P>
   After passage of that law, nude bathers found a loophole because
part of Higbee Beach in Lower Township is owned by the United
States, and not the state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The revised measure would allow towns to prohibit nudity on all
land ''under the jurisdiction of the state,'' which includes both
the state and federally owned sections of the popular Cape May
County beach.

<HEADLINE> Padres 6, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins stole 10 bases -- one short of
the modern NL record -- yet still lost to Stan Spencer and the San
Diego Padres 6-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo and Cliff Floyd stole three bases and Mark Kotsay
and Preston Wilson swiped two for the Marlins, who were 10-for-10
on steal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The post-1900 NL record of 11 was set by the New York Giants in
1912 and tied by St. Louis in 1916. The modern major league mark of
15 was set by the New York Highlanders, later the Yankees, in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   The last time any team had 10 steals in a game was June 30,
1996, when Colorado did it against Los Angeles. The Marlins'
previous team record for stolen bases was six, done on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Castillo set a team record with four stolen bases in
a game, the Marlins set a team mark by swiping four in the first
inning. Castillo scored both runs after steals.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, who homered, and Al Martin each stole a base for
the Padres. Bret Boone was caught stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer (1-1) won for the first time in 14 starts. He had not
earned a victory since making his major league debut on Aug. 27,
1998, against Philadelphia, going 0-8 with a 7.20 ERA in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer pitched 6 1-3 innings, allowing two runs and five hits.
He struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Florida loaded the bases in the seventh, but Donne Wall struck
Wilson out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko hit a solo home run for the Padres. Eric Owens hit a
two-run single in the second inning and Ruben Rivera had a two-run
single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Fernandez (4-4), who missed his last start with a strained
elbow ligament, was pitching for the first time since a May 6 win
against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez threw 29 pitches in the first inning alone, and
struggled to get ahead of hitters. He gave up three runs and nine
hits in five innings, and left after throwing 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's eighth home run made it 3-1 in the fifth. The Marlins
scored in the bottom half when Castillo singled, stole second and
third and came home on Floyd's single.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo drew a leadoff walk in the first, stole second and
scored on Floyd's single.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin tripled home a run in the Padres ninth.
Notes: Marlins shortstop Alex Gonzalez has committed seven errors
in the last 22 games. ... Florida reliever Dan Miceli had a
10-minute throwing session Wednesday and didn't feel tightness in
his right forearm. Manager John Boles said the right-hander could
pitch in this weekend's series against the Dodgers. ... It appears
as if Marlins starter Ryan Dempster is a good-luck charm for the
Miami Heat. Dempster has pitched and won on the same days the Heat
has knocked off the New York Knicks in Games 1, 3 and 5 of their
NBA Eastern Conference semifinal playoff series. ... Floyd tied a
career high with two stolen bases, both in the first inning. ...
Padres OF Tony Gwynn, who was 2-for-8 since coming off the disabled
list, was given the night off. ... Klesko set a career high with
his seventh stolen base of the season.

<HEADLINE> Vegetable stand, other businesses, teeter on edge of roadside precipice </HEADLINE>
Pursuing AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. (AP) -- A vegetable stand teetering for two days
on the brink of a steep roadside toppled Thursday in the aftermath
of a mudslide that dammed the creek below, threatening the city of
Albany's main water line.
</P>
<P>
   The California Produce Market had lost a good portion of the
land beneath it to a landslide Tuesday; officials said Thursday's
severe thunderstorms only hastened the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Both a car wash and an instant oil change business were forced
to close indefinitely due to lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like we're going to be shut down for a while,'' said
Tom Hoffman of Hoffman's car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem police and Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings were among many
officials staked out at a command post along the well-traveled
Delaware Avenue linking downtown Albany with one of the city's more
affluent suburban areas. Huge chunks of the avenue had already
fallen away and the road was closed indefinitely. Officials were
contemplating evacuation of nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   Town of Bethlehem Supervisor Sheila Fuller declared a local
state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide late Tuesday displaced about 400 linear feet of
earth, trees, and shrubs, which slid into the Normans Kill below,
creating a wall of dirt and vegetation that blocked off the creek.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a blanket of earth just slid down the hill,'' said
John Keller of William J. Keller &AMP; Sons Construction Co., the
city's emergency contractor.
</P>
<P>
   City Water Commissioner Robert Cross worried that the Normans
Kill would cut a new channel underneath the main, forcing it above
ground or bursting it. Keller &AMP; Sons worked through the night to
cut through between 2,000 and 3,000 of yards of earth and form a
new path for the creek.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the produce stand, the crumbling ground
threatened a commercial car wash and an instant oil change
business.

<HEADLINE> Florio, Corzine face final debate in Democratic primary for Senate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- In the last scheduled face-to-face meeting
before the Democratic primary election for U.S. Senate, former Gov.
Jim Florio found himself defending his credibility against the
attacks of his opponent, Jon Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   While Florio had been aiming in four debates over the past week
to throw his less experienced opponent off balance or to goad him
into a mistake, Thursday's debate, broadcast live from the studios
of the News 12 New Jersey cable television station, had Florio
trying to recover from a mistake of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Jewish News weekly newspaper this week released a
tape recording in which Florio explicitly supported the idea of
investing Social Security funds in the stock market. He made the
remark at a forum in May 1999 before Corzine was in the race, and
his campaign now says he misspoke at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Corzine entered the race and proposed investment of
Social Security funds, Florio has centered caustic attacks against
Corzine on the issue, doing it again Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The transcript that came out clearly indicates I misspoke. I
did not think it was a good idea in the past. I do not think it is
a good idea now,'' Florio said. ''Volatility is not compatible with
security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy over the tape gave Corzine fuel for
counterattacking, something at which he has become more adept as
the week of debates has unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said the disclosure of the remarks destroyed Florio's
credibility. ''Today we have learned that for an entire year, he
has been misleading the voters about his position on Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of the debate prevented the candidates from attacking
one another as much as in previous debates, but they managed to get
a few shots in.
</P>
<P>
   ''For my opponent, the truth sometimes is a political
inconvenience,'' Corzine said. ''He says he has experience money
can't buy. The truth is he has given us an experience we would
rather forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio continued to try to depict Corzine, a former executive at
the Goldman Sachs investment firm, as untrustworthy because his
work at the firm conflicts with the promises he is making now
regarding, for instance, gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I was taking on the gun lobby, Jon was financing the gun
industry,'' Florio said. ''This whole thing comes down to if you
send one of us to Washington, who is going to go down there to
represent Wall Street, and who is going to go down there to
represent Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine replied, ''I have a very, very strong position with
regard to guns, and there is nothing in the history of Goldman
Sachs that is going to limit my feeling on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of four Democratic debates began one week ago at
New Jersey Network studios, the state's public television station.
The candidates also debated Monday morning at a New York City radio
station and Tuesday night before an audience of 500 in Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has criticized Corzine for refusing to attend a debate
with the League of Women Voters to be taped next Friday and aired
on ABC-TV network affiliates in New York and Philadelphia. It would
have been the only one to be shown on network television, where
Corzine has been spending millions of dollars a week in a blitz of
TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine defended his decision not to debate on network
television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think the debate about the debates is not focused on
prescription drug benefits and the kinds of things people want to
hear candidates talk about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said, ''If you are going to spend $2 million a week on
television beating me up, come and have the guts to discuss whether
he supports property tax relief or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have for a year been trying to get Jon to engage in a
debate. We have (had) four in the last couple of days, but this is
not mass audience. The people of this state are going to be called
upon to vote for someone they know absolutely nothing about,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Munich of WPVI-TV said air time has been reserved and they
would be able to schedule the debate until the last minute next
Thursday if Corzine were to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The election will be held June 6.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Powers To Eliminate Weapons  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The five nuclear powers agreed Thursday to
eventually eliminate their nuclear arsenals, a decision hailed by
several countries without such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement specified no timetable for implementation and
delegates said it would take many years to achieve a nuclear-free
world.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary deal could become part of a final document
expected to be approved by Friday, at the conclusion of a
187-nation conference reviewing the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations on other issues continuing Thursday night, even
the most staunch advocates of disarmament expressed only cautious
optimism over the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't count my chickens until they're hatched,'' U.N.
Undersecretary-General for Disarmament Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala
said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official had no comment on the agreement, explaining that
the conference documents were not yet final.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the agreement on key disarmament issues, which
Dhanapala called ''an important development,'' lifted the gloomy
atmosphere at the four-week conference and sparked hope among
delegates that a final document could be adopted by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, a group of seven moderate countries without
nuclear weapons known as the New Agenda Coalition has been
campaigning to get the nuclear powers to make an unequivocal
commitment to total nuclear disarmament -- as called for in the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   When the conference started, the five original nuclear powers --
the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- reiterated
their ''unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of a complete
elimination of nuclear weapons and a treaty on general and complete
disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   But the seven coalition members -- Mexico, Ireland, South Africa,
Egypt, Sweden, New Zealand and Brazil -- rejected their statement
saying ''the total elimination of nuclear weapons is an obligation
and a priority and not an ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy negotiations, the nuclear powers and coalition
members reached agreement Thursday on ''an unequivocal undertaking
... to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear
arsenals.''
</P>
<P>
   Darach Mac Fhionnbhairr, the top disarmament expert in Ireland's
Foreign Ministry, said the agreement is the culmination of ''a
long, hard struggle'' with the nuclear weapon states.
</P>
<P>
   But any prospect of total elimination is tempered by concerns
about India and Pakistan, which exploded nuclear devices in 1998,
and Israel, which is believed to have nuclear capabilities. The
three countries, along with Cuba, are the only nations that have
not signed the treaty.

	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.(AP) -- About 100 homes were damaged as severe
thunderstorms plowing through the state hit especially hard in the
Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologists said they planned to do
on-site investigations following several reports of funnel clouds
touching down in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Orange, Dutchess and Ulster counties, the storm's
powerful winds blew off roofs and left streets carpeted with leaves
and broken branches. Pounding rain and pelting hail tore of
rooftops and punched out lights for thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Hail the size of marbles bombarded Sullivan County, and
three-quarter-inch hail was reported in surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange and Sullivan counties, some 15,000 Orange and Rockland
Utilities customers lost power, said spokesman Jim Lois. As of 9
p.m., 13,000 O&AMP;R customers were still in the dark. Some 52,000
customers of Central Hudson Gas &AMP; Electric's 8-county area were
without power, with company officials saying some of them could be
in the dark until Saturday. Widespread power outages were also
reported in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area as well as Columbia
County to the south. Outage estimates for New York State Electric
and Gas customers were not immediately available Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The power outage forced Ulster County Community College to
postpone its graduation.
</P>
<P>
   On Route 211 in the Ulster County town of Wallkill, roofers Gary
Curtis and Barry Johnson say they saw funnel clouds touch down,
blowing the roof off a German deli.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw the roof fly off and figured we better pull in to see
if we could help,'' Curtis told the Middletown Times Herald-Record.
Rain was pouring through the roof at the Home Depot where the duo
went to buy a tarp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was raining inside as hard as it was outside,'' Curtis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state police in Poughkeepsie say they too spotted
a funnel-shaped cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers closed much of Route 211 as bits of shredded
roof material littered the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Fallen power lines trapped several people in a car in the town
of Hamptonburgh 25 miles southwest of Poughkeepsie. Workers with
the Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp. joined local firefighters
in freeing the passengers. None were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   State Police in Ulster County said a collapsed tree about five
miles south of the Kingston Interchange backed traffic about three
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The same east-blowing caused damage across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Broome, Tioga and Chenango counties, several homes were
damaged by falling trees and blowing debris. NYSEG reported more
than 15,000 customers without power in the three-county area, with
many customers likely to be without power until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rush-hour traffic was slowed in Binghamton and surrounding
communities as streets were flooded and traffic signals stopped
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said a house in Harpursville in northern Broome
county was damaged in a fire that may have been started by sparks
from downed electric lines.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued overnight flood watches for
the western Southern Tier, including Allegany, Cattaraugus, and
Chautauqua counties. Meteorologists said a low pressure system over
northern Indiana was expected to bring batch of rain and
thunderstorms across lower Michigan and western Lake Erie and
across the Southern Tier after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, Friday's forecast called for brisk
winds, cool weather, and possible showers.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County west of Schenectady, a barn was reported
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It blew away,'' said Dispatcher Adam Schwabrow of the
Montgomery County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The barn was found after the storm subsided, several hundred
feet away.
