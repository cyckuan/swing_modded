<HEADLINE> Weizman Denies Wrongdoing in Alleged Money Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Sunday dismissed widespread rumors that he would resign or at least
step aside temporarily over an alleged money scandal, saying he did
not do anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I have never committed any offenses...I have consulted with my
lawyer and I was told from time to time that everything done is
absolutely legal," Weizman told a news conference he summoned at
his residence.
</P>
<P>
There had been wild speculations that Weizman might announce a
leave of absence from office at the special news conference since
the president has been under intensive pressure to resign or step
down temporarily over the alleged money scandal.
</P>
<P>
"There are two things I can do. One is to have the whole truth
revealed, or to resign. I have no intention of resign," Weizman
read from a terse statement.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think taking a leave of absence is the right thing to
do," the president said. "There is no difference between a
president on leave and a president in office," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police launched a criminal investigation Sunday into
suspected business ties between the president and French
millionaire Edouard Saroussi, who allegedly offered him 453,000 U.
S. dollars between 1988 and 1993, when Weizman was a member of the
parliament and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has admitted that he received money from Saroussi, but
less than that sum and Saroussi gave him the money as a personal
gift without political or business purpose.
</P>
<P>
The police decided last week to launch the criminal inquiry
after initial investigation discovered that the two were former
business associates.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's lawyers said the president and Saroussi had business
ties only between 1983-1984, or before he entered politics. Weizman
was elected president in 1993 after serving in the parliament and
several cabinets.
</P>
<P>
Since investigative journalist Yoav Yitzhak broke the alleged
scandal last month, the 75-year-old president, who is on his second
five-year term, has been resisting rising pressure to resign or
take a leave of absence pending the outcome of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
A former airforce commander, Weizman said he had never run away
from battles and would not run away from the current one, pledging
to fight to the end.
</P>
<P>
The president, popular in Israel for his outspoken and
straightforward style, has been criticized by right-wing opposition
blocs for neglecting his symbolic position and openly supporting
the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- French exports to the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
reached more than 5 billion dirhams (about 1.36 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first nine month of 1999, a 71 percent increase
compared to the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total imports by France from the UAE, however, dropped to 164.3
million dirhams (44.8 million dollars) in the above-mentioned
period from 298.6 million dirhams (81.4 million dollars), according
to the latest figures provided by the French Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
French imports of energy-related products dropped remarkably,
which was the main factor in the fall in total imports from the
UAE.
</P>
<P>
French exports of industry-related products went up by 75
percent to 4.75 billion dirhams (1.3 billion dollars) in the nine
month period in 1999, which was the major reason for the rise of
total exports, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Jordanian Minister of Water and Irrigation Kamel
Mahadin said that "Our plan is to get 90 million cubic meters of
water from Turkey," reported Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Turkish English newspaper
during his three-day visit to Turkey this week, Mahdin said that
right now Jordan has an annual water shortage of about 50 million
cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
One option for transporting the water to Jordan is to pump
Turkish water from the Israeli Mediterranean Port of Haifa through
pipelines. Jordan will discuss the idea with Israel.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Japan remained the main car supplier to Cyprus, with
Made-in-Japan autos accounting for 63 percent of total registered
cars in 1999, local mass media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicles from the European Union (EU) countries
accounted for 26.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Receives Message from Jordan's King on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Sunday received Jordanian Minister of Trade and Industry
Mohammed Halayka who conveyed King Abdullah's message on bilateral
ties, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said the Jordanian King's message also tackled means of
enhancing bilateral relations, but it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Saddam asked Halayka, the King's personal envoy, to convey his
greetings and wishes to the King and the Jordanian people.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Energy Minister Wael Sabri, who arrived here Friday
evening together with Halayka, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian trade minister on Saturday co-chaired the 20th
meetings of the Iraqi-Jordanian Joint Committee for Trade and
Economic Cooperation with Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi
Salah.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iraq and Jordan renewed an oil agreement under
which Iraq will supply Jordan with 4.8 million tons of crude and
oil by-products this year at a maximum price of 19 U.S. dollars per
barrel, much lower than the market reate, in return for Jordanian
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, the two countries signed a trade agreement
which raised the ceiling of the trade transactions between them to
300 million dollars this year, compared with last year's 200
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed a total of 843 million U.S. dollars worth of
contracts with Jordan under the past six phases of the oil-for-food
program, said the Iraqi trade minister on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, now in its seventh phase, Iraq
is allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
humanitarian supplies for its people who are hardest-hit by the U.
N. sanctions imposed since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has since become the main transit route of Iraq to the
outside world and Iraq is the sole source of oil for Jordan. Iraq
exports about 80,000 barrels of oil per day to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's oil purchases from Iraq are exempted from U.N.
sanctions which ban Baghdad from freely exporting its oil as
punishment for its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Pursue Detente Policy: Vice Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice Speaker of Iranian Majlis
(parliament) Hassan Rowhani on Sunday reiterated that Iran is
pursuing detente policy aiming at helping establish peace and
stability in the world and forming balanced relations among
countries on the basis of dialog.
</P>
<P>
Iran makes every endeavor to make the Middle East free from
weapons of mass destruction and to establish peace and stability in
the region, Rowhani told visiting Swiss Deputy Foreign Minister
Franz von Daniken.
</P>
<P>
He called on international forums and organizations to safeguard
their independence and help remove the mistrust between nations,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani, who is also secretary of Iran's Supreme National
Security Council, voiced Tehran's concern on stockpiling weapons of
mass destruction, presence of the U.S. military force in the
Persian Gulf and the phenomenon of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Terming parliamentary relations between Iran and Switzerland
as "constructive and friendly," he expressed pleasure with the new
moves made by the two countries to develop relations.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the readiness of Iranian Majlis to take effective
steps in boosting relations with Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Von Daniken said his visit to Iran is aimed at exchanging views
on ways to develop bilateral cooperation in the economic and
cultural fields within the international forums.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government welcomes any moves made to bring about
balanced relations between the countries and sees the dialog among
civilizations as a suitable ground for balanced relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Swiss government is willing to finance the plan on
dialog among civilizations in the year 2001, which was named by the
United Nations as "the year of dialog among civilizations," and
keen on holding consultation with Iran in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Von Daniken arrived here on Sunday on a two-day visit. He also
held talks with his Iranian counterpart Morteza Sarmadi, calling
for a boost in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and Iran have good capacity for economic cooperation
and Bern is willing to sign a trade agreement with Tehran, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said the enhanced relations between Iran and Bern will
serve to prepare the grounds for the economic, political and
cultural cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Builds Canal to Reduce Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Sunday inaugurated the main phase of a canal, the most
important part of a grand project to build an underground network
to collect surface water of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The 400-kilometer canal is under construction, with the first
phase of 40 kilometers operational within three years by the Tehran
municipality at a cost of over 127 million U.S. dollars, including
a loan of 77 million dollars from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The canal, which has four major branches, will direct surface
water from the central parts of the city to a reservoir with a
capacity of 600,000 cubic meters in the south of Tehran, the
official Islamic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to filtrate water and lower rate of
pollution caused by surface water due to meteorological changes.
</P>
<P>
Having inspected the main branch of the canal built 30 meters
under the ground, the president recalled the three devastating
floods in Tehran in the past three decades, which inflicted heavy
damage and claimed tens of lives.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Tehran people would no longer witness
such catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also pointed to surface water and air pollution as the
main problems the metropolis faces and said carrying out such
gigantic plans is a proof of the merit, potential and high capacity
of Iranian experts.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Pollution Lingers in Kuwait: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Almost nine years after the
1991 Gulf War, pollution caused by the flow of burnt oil from
hundreds of oil wells is still affecting Kuwait's environmental
conditions, especially in the desert areas, said a specialized
report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Evaluation of the Environmental Conditions
in Kuwait Since the 1991 Gulf War," said that although less
polluted areas began to show signs of recovery, the desert
environment, with areas polluted with oil lakes, is getting worse
because pollution is seeping deeper into the sands.
</P>
<P>
The scientific report, which was prepared by a team of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and financed by the
Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences, said that oil
lakes polluted more than 40 percent of the Kuwaiti water reserves,
but no technological solution has been found to the problem so far.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that environmental conditions in the
sea are better than in the desert, as the nature of the sea helps
resist oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
The report expected the sea creatures need 15 years to regain
balance, though the bad effects will not completely disappear
within such a period.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, quoted by the Kuwait News Agency, the
sea resources, which are among the basic source of food in the
desert state, have also been irreversibly reduced by the
environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
The amount of fish and shrimps on the market is above the
maximum level that could be naturally renewed, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Over 700 Kuwaiti oil wells were set on fire by Iraqi troops in
February 1991 when they were forced to withdraw from the oil-rich
Gulf emirate. The last burning oil well was extinguished in
November 1991, eight months after the end of the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Hold Open Trial of Policemen for Attacking Dorms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Sunday to hold
an open trial on policemen responsible for attacking Tehran
University dormitory in a crackdown on student protest last July.
</P>
<P>
Military prosecutor of Tehran province Abbasali Farati said that
the trial is set for February 29 and legal proceedings are underway
to provide indictments against 20 policemen, including former
commander of Tehran metropolis security forces.
</P>
<P>
He called on the students who suffered physical or financial
losses in the police raid to lodge complaint with the military
court, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Riot policemen stormed Tehran University dormitory on July 8
without permission from the Interior Ministry, following a student
rally to protest the newly-approved Press Law and a ban on the
popular daily Salam (Hello), which supported moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The illegal crackdown triggered a week-long political unrest in
the country, the worst one since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Conservative plots were believed to be behind the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Supreme National Security Council announced in
August that three people, including a civilian opponent, a police
officer and a conscript of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, were
shot by bullets in the incident. The conscript died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Organization of the Iranian Armed Forces said that
the police's illegal entry into the student dormitory was illegally
ordered by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
Farati also said that the military court is not empowered to
deal with civilians charged with attacking the dormitory, but the
revolutionary court is to probe into the cases and try those
involved in the attack and the ensuing street violence.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that one of the victim Ezzatollah Ibrahimnejad
was killed after the police had withdrawn from the university
dormitory and the assassin has not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
The legal investigation of the murder on the campus is going on,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests to Iraq over MKO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday lodged an official
protest to Iraq over the recent cross-border attack on its villages
by the Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), outlawed in Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a protest note, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said that its
government condemned Iraq for contravention of international norms
and the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Iraq of "harboring MKO members and creating
favorable grounds for launching terrorist operations against Iran,"
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Baghdad should bear the consequences of
these actions and Tehran reserves the right to take action to
preserves its legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Iran expects the Iraqi government to weigh the consequence of
these sorts of actions on normalization of bilateral relations and
to take serious and effective measures to put an end to these
operations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Three MKO members attacked villagers in Chalsarab of the western
Ilam province, killing three people and injuring five others, when
the Iranians were celebrating the Eid-e Fitr to mark the end of the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
They were killed on January 12 by Iranian military forces when
trying to flee into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO, labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," was
a famous political-military organization which fought against the
former Iranian Shah's regime before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
It was outlawed in 1981 and escaped into Iraq following
wranglings with the clerics who came to power during the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has launched slews of cross-border attacks on Iranian
targets, and carried out assassination of senior Iranian officials.
In retaliation, Iranian military forces have also raided the MKO
bases near Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Egypt Join Hands to Promote Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein and visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have agreed
to work together to promote the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a closed-door meeting Sunday, the two leaders reviewed
the latest developments and stumbling blocks in the peace process,
Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew in earlier in the day from Syria where he held
talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
During their talks Sunday, Mubarak and Abdullah viewed the
resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli and the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks as positive developments, and called on all parties concerned
to work for a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that opportunities available for the moment should
be seized and used to promote peace in the region, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks have hit a snag after two rounds of
talks since last December, with the third round announced on hold
indefinitely due to the rift between the two sides on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian track, the third-stage Israeli troop
withdrawal from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank slated for
January 20 was postponed while the final status talks have achieved
no substantial progress, with the mid-February deadline for a
framework agreement, the forerunner of a permanent peace deal by
September, at hand.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats say the two-nation tour is part of Mubarak's efforts
for holding an Arab summit to show support for the stances of Syria
and Palestinians in the tough talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had visited Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates last months to the end.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has ended his brief visit to Jordan. Before his
departure, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa accompanying the
president on the visit, said that chances were high that Arab
leaders would soon hold their first summit in four years to promote
Arab solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Back Home After Visit to Syria, Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
was back home Sunday after winding up visit to Syria and Jordan to
seek solidarity and coordinate stances with Arab leaders on peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chances were high for an Arab summit in the near future, said
Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister who accompanied Mubarak on
the visit. He did not elaborate, but if materialized, the summit
will be the first one in four years.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit followed his previous tour to four Gulf Arab
countries - Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Mubarak's talks Friday and Saturday with Syrian and
Jordanian leaders "were successful" and showed "the depth of links
and full understanding" between the leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was briefed on the details of the peace process on the
Syrian track and Damascus' position on talks with Israel by
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have held two rounds of negotiations since late
last year to make peace. But the stumbling block was the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Damascus now requires a written promise from Israel on a full
return of the strategic plateau before it comes back to the
negotiating table, while Tel Aviv dodged from doing so.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Syria responded to what peace requires, notably
security arrangements, normalization of relations, but the Israeli
side showed procrastination on border demarcation and water.
</P>
<P>
Egypt supports Syrian demand that Israel withdraws to the June
4, 1967 borders, Moussa said, adding his country will exert its
utmost to remove all obstacles before peace. It was not known if
Egypt has been approached by any side to play a mediating role.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Cairo is keen on working fast to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
During his talks in Jordan, Mubarak and King Abdullah bin
Hussein viewed the resumption of peace talks on Syrian and
Palestinian tracks as "positive developments" and called on the
parties to work for just, durable and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
They stressed opportunities available for the moment should be

<HEADLINE> Turkey Detains over 250 Hezbollah Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 250 members of
Hezbollah, a radical Islamic terror group in Turkey, were rounded
up in nationwide operations launched by Security Forces, the
Anatolia News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has lately intensified raids against the terror group's
hideouts across the country, including 19 main provinces such as
Istanbul, Ankara, Adana, Mersin, Antalya and others.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that bodies of victims murdered by Hezbollah have
successively been unearthed by police in several provinces, with
their total number reaching 31.
</P>
<P>
Turkish media claimed that the group's shocking atrocities has
once more brought Iran to the forefront - Interior Minister
Saadettin Tantan has blamed Tehran for giving training to the
Turkish Hezbollah militants.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who visited Turkey last
week, was quick in denying the statement of Tantan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Hezbollah, thought to be unconnected with
the pro-Iranian Lebanese organization of the same name, seeks to
set up an Islamic republic ruled by strict Sharia (religious law)
in secular but overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The group began life in the late 1980s in the turbulent
southeast. It targeted supporters of the Kurdish Workers' Party
separatist militants, leading many to accuse them of being state-
sponsored contra-guerrillas.

MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Major-General Mikhail
Malofeyev, who was reportedly wounded and missing in a battle with
Chechen rebels Thursday, was found dead Sunday, reported the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Malofeyev's body was found in the Chechen capital Grozny Sunday,
the agency quoted Russian acting President Vladimir Putin's aide
Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>

Yastrzhembsky said the body was discovered at the place of the
battle where Malofeyev died several days ago. Today, after bidding
farewell to the general, his remains were sent to Vladikavkaz.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the version that the general was taken prisoner falls off
in full, Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Government Would Stay, British Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's education minister
said on Sunday that the Labor government would aim at staying in
power for several terms, despite an unhappy new year of bad
headlines.
</P>
<P>
"You need decisive leadership, which is what (Prime Minister
and the Labor Party leader) Tony Blair has been giving," David
Blunkett told BBC radio when asked how the government was coping
with the recent bad press.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Labor should be aiming not just to win the
next general election, which could take place next year, but the
following two elections as well.
</P>
<P>
"Not just, I hope, into a second term, but let's have the kind
of aspiration that Conservatives had, in terms of the third and
fourth," Blunkett said, referring to 18 years of the Conservative
rule before Labor's 1997 win.
</P>
<P>
Blunkett said winning next general election was key to
continuing Labor policies such as increased state funding for the
health service instead of switching to partial privatization.
</P>
<P>
Sunday newspapers here were filled with stories detailing Blair
's recent problems, one of his roughest periods in office so far.
</P>
<P>
It happened just in time for the media stories about his first
1,000 days as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Blair saw his popularity drop sharply in one poll.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said Sunday that it will work hard in 2000 as it is the last
year to deal with the immunization of polio in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has aimed to wipe out the child killing disease in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most efforts should be made to deal with the immunization of
polio in the poor continent so that it would not carry a lot of
workload into the next year, a WHO official said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the world health body has set up a team to implement
in June the Expanded Program on Immunization in Africa, the
Zimbabwean News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The year 2001 would see the organization focusing on
surveillance programs and continue with the vaccination of
measles, another child disease, in some African countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization believed that within the next three years it
would have eradicated measles though the program was set to be
through by the year 2020.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Advises on Economic Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa must act to
improve its economic efficiency, productivity and competitiveness
in order to secure a much higher and more sustained growth, a
senior official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa must also continue to adhere to sound fiscal
and monetary policies, which are critical for economic growth,
Director of the IMF African Department Goodall Gondwe said in the
latest issue of the Finance and Development Magazine available
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Policies must aim to increase the level and efficiency of
investment and stimulate substantially higher domestic and foreign
savings," the IMF magazine quoted Gondwe as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Each country must define a comprehensive strategy to reduce
poverty that takes into account the links between macro-economic,
structural and social policies," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF official, the sub-Saharan growth
performance is still constrained by inadequate infrastructures,
poor public services, persistent weakness in regulatory incentive
systems and low savings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that "there must be an environment of
peace, characterized by political stability and democratic,
participatory forms of government."

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that
he has not been asked to present a written pledge to withdrawal to
the June 4, 1967 borders as a condition for the resumption of
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a cabinet meeting Sunday morning, Barak said that in
any case, Israel will not give such a commitment before the talks
take place, but only as a result of them, according to Israel
Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
High-level talks between the two sides were due to reopen in

Reports from Damascus said Syria is demanding a written pledge
from Israel to full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which were
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
To break the impasse in the talks, U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have maintained
intensive contact this weekend with Barak and Syrian President

<HEADLINE> Singapore Consumer Price Index Rises by 0.4 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's consumer price
index rose by 0.4 percent year-on-year in 1999 after registering a
decline of 0.3 percent in 1998, the Singapore Department of
Statistics (SDS) said in a press release Sunday.
</P>
<P>
SDS also said that Singapore's consumer price index in December
1999 was 1.4 percent higher compared to the same month a year ago
but only inched up 0.1 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
SDS attributed the moderate pickup in 1999 mainly to price
increases in food, education and miscellaneous groups which were
partially offset by lower costs of housing and transport and
communication.
</P>
<P>
The marginal increase in December 1999 was from higher costs of
transport and communication as well as dearer miscellaneous items,
SDS added.
</P>
<P>
Data given by SDS for price movement in 1999 shows that food
prices rose by 0.9 percent as a result of dearer fresh pork and
cooked food, the education increased by 4.3 percent due to higher
tuition fees at commercial institutions, universities,
polytechnics as well as school miscellaneous fees, miscellaneous
items moved up by 0.7 percent thanks to dearer cigarettes and
higher cost of domestic help, and clothing prices and health care
costs picked up 0.6 and 0.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, SDS said, costs of transport and communication and
housing in 1999 fell o.4 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The estimate for world wheat
production shows a net increase of 1 million to 583 million tons
in 1999/2000, according to the latest Grain Market Report released
by International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
The wheat output will rise in Argentina, Canada, Russia and
Kazakhstan while it will drop in the European Community (EC), Iran
and Ukraine, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report expects the world wheat trade to increase
1 millin to reach 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast 2 million higher at 591
million tons. Much of the increase is attributed to the growth of
feed use in the United States where the number of cattle in
feedlots has set a new record since December 1.
</P>
<P>
The projection for world wheat stocks is unchanged at 116
million tons. Declines are expected in both the EC and the United
States, but aggregate stocks in the five major exporters are the
second highest since 1992/93, the IGC said.

Kono made the remark in a telephone interview with Xinhua while
referring to a gathering held by a small group of Japanese right-
wing activists in Osaka, western Japan, earlier in the day to
promote the claim that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre "never occurred."
</P>
<P>
There are many versions in regard to the what he called "
Nanjing incident," but the Japanese government thinks that it is
an undeniable fact that after the Japanese troops entered Nanjing
in 1937, there were non-combatants killed, looting and other acts,
Kono said.
</P>
<P>
The opinion of the private group which held the gathering is
different from the Japanese government's opinion, so it could not
gain support from most of the Japanese people, Kono added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government maintains its view on history as
manifested by former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in 1995, and
expounded in the 1972 Japan-China Joint Statement and the 1998
Joint Declaration, the Japanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
There is no change in the Japanese government's view, and most
of the Japanese people share the view, Kono stressed.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 members of the Japanese rightist group attended the
rally held in the Peace Osaka museum on Sunday, claiming that the
1937 Nanjing Massacre "is a lie."
</P>
<P>
Several Japanese civic and overseas Chinese groups staged
rallies around the museum, condemning the right-wing group's
gathering for denying the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers were
slaughtered by Japanese aggressor troops following the fall of
Nanjing in 1937.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops Sunday
flied their flag over Staropromyslovsky, Chechen capital Grozny's
largest residential district, which was liberated from rebels
Saturday, said the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The flag was raised over the office of the district military
commandant, where the first meeting between top officials of the
Russian Combined Group in the North Caucasus and local residents'
representatives was held, Itar-Tass cited Major-General Alexander
Serov, deputy commander of the group, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Serov assured the local residents that all federal agencies
responsible for restoring regular life will start to work in the
area in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
It took the federal troops more than one month to free
Staropromyslovsky. Initial reports about its liberation appeared
early January, but fierce fighting continued there until Saturday.
Several residential areas changed hands several times.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting in Grozny is becoming increasingly
intensive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The federal troops are fighting their way through the streets
to the center of the city, rebuffing the rebels' strong resistance,
" said the headquarters of the combined federal group.
</P>
<P>
Five residential areas, a railway depot, a hospital, a cannery
and the Prigorodny settlement have been liberated. The strategic
motor bridge across the Sunzha river and the Minutka Square were
seized by the federal troops Saturday, said the Russian Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting is underway in the central part of the city and
the rebels are fighting in small groups with the guerilla warfare
tactics, said the Russian military.

<HEADLINE> A Great Decision of Strategic Importance: Editorial (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will run an editorial tomorrow titled "A Great
Decision of Strategic Importance", highlighting the central
government's initiative to develop the vast western regions.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has
put forward the initiative of developing the economically backward
western part of the country at a time when China has nearly
successfully completed its second-stage strategic modernization
objectives and is ready to enter the third-stage, says the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
It says the CPC has always paid great importance to coordinated
economic development. In the early 1950s, the late Chairman Mao
Zedong emphasized the need to manage well industrial development
in both the coastal cities and the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping put forward the two-step strategy
of national economic development: first, to concentrate on
accelerating the development of coastal areas in the east; and
then to shift the focus to the west, which needs the already
developed coastal areas to help the hinterland to develop for
common prosperity. Now Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC
Central Committee, has placed the strategy of developing the west
on top of the agenda of the Party and government.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Commentary on Concern for People's Well-Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A commentary in tomorrow's "
People's Daily" calls on Communist Party organizations and
governments at all levels to make the welfare of the Chinese
people a top priority.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quotes President Jiang Zemin as saying that
being concerned with the well-being of the masses of the people "
is a major task of top priority" of the current work of the
Chinese Communist Party and government.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "a current task of top priority --
showing real concern for the people's well-being," says that the
importance of this issue is derived from the Communist Party's
purpose and the socialist system, China's basic national
conditions and economic development. As the Chinese lunar New Year
draws near, the issue becomes ever more urgent.
</P>
<P>
Since China started to implement the reform and opening-up
policy in the late 1970s, the living standards of the Chinese
people have improved significantly. The Chinese people are
satisfied with all these positive changes.
</P>
<P>
However, as imbalance still exists in the country's economic
development, the living conditions of a certain number of people
have not markedly changed, with some still living in poverty. As
China undergoes further reforms and restructuring of its economy,
there will emerge new problems such as some people being laid off.
"At present we must see the encouraging situation as well as some
temporary difficulties," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also warns against extravagance and engaging in
corrupt activities during the Spring Festival, and calls on Party
organizations and governments at all levels to promote a thrifty
and frugal spirit during the festive holidays.

<TEXT>
<P>
The western regions, abundantly rich in resources and largely
inhabited by minority ethnic groups, have achieved great progress
over past 50 years. However, there still exists a fairly big gap
between the eastern and western parts of China. Developing the
west will help expand domestic demand, narrow economic differences
between China's east and west for common prosperity, and maintain
national prosperity, social stability and border security.
</P>
<P>
The time is ripe for faster development in the western regions
as the rapid economic growth has enabled the government to give an
unprecedented strong support, the editorial says, adding that the
eastern areas, after years of development, have been able to lend
a hand, while the western regions also have certain material
conditions for economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for a pragmatic approach in carrying out
the strategy for coordinated regional economic development, saying
that infrastructure construction must be stepped up to lay a sound
foundation, with priority given to eco-environmental protection,
industrial restructuring, and science and education.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technologies from at home and overseas should be fully
utilized to make good use of local resources and capital for
healthy economic growth. Policies are needed for attracting
talented professionals from across the country.
</P>
<P>
The central government will continue to increase investment to
support infrastructure and environmental projects in the western
areas, says the editorial, calling on governments at all levels,
especially in the east, to make their contributions.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Irrefutable Evidence May Not Be Subject to Denial by Zhang Jingfang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A handful of Japanese rightists
staged a farce in Osaka Sunday designed to deny the notorious 1937
Nanjing Massacre that has been proved by history, arousing strong
indignation of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people and the peace-loving forces in Japan
strongly condemned the gathering staged by the Japanese rightists
in the International Peace Center in Osaka Sunday to blatantly
deny the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, a wartime atrocity committed by
Japanese troops against the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
More than half a century ago, the Japanese militarists launched
a war against China which had wantonly trampled on the land of
China and killed innocent Chinese people. The whole world was
appalled by the Nanjing Massacre in December 1937, during which
the Japanese aggressor troops slaughtered more than 300,000
Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers and raped tens of thousands
of Chinese women and girls in the city, an atrocity rarely seen in
the human history.
</P>
<P>
Yet, 60 years after the massacre, Japanese right-wing forces
attempted to reverse the judgment in the case of Nanjing Massacre,
openly terming the Nanjing Massacre "false," "a fable and the
biggest lie in the 20th century," and even holding mass rallies to
publicly deny the hard historical facts.
</P>
<P>
An 86-year old Japanese, Shiro Azuma, a veteran soldier who
personally took part in the attack on Nanjing in 1937, uncovered
the atrocities by the Japanese militarists through his diaries.
</P>
<P>
However, Azuma's appeal was repeatedly rejected by Japanese
courts, which turn black into white, running against the common
morality.
</P>
<P>
Yet the truth of the crimes by Japanese militarists can never
be whitewashed. The Nanjing Massacre is an irrefutable fact.
survivors of the massacre and other witnesses have come out to
tell their experiences, and some Japanese contrite veterans, such
as Azuma, have revealed the brutality of the Japanese aggressors
in their diaries. Countless data in China and other countries have
shown the truth of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
The then investigation by the Far East Military Court had
proved that the Japanese aggressor troops killed more than 300,000
Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers during the Nanjing Massacre,
an unprecedented record in the human history. In recent years,
more evidence has been coming out to prove the crimes committed by
the Japanese militarists.
</P>
<P>
Among others, "Rabe's Diary" and other documents as well as
piles of bones of the victims found in Nanjing are the most direct
and convincing proofs of the crimes of the Japanese militarists.
Large amounts of human testimony and material evidence have made
the Japanese aggressors bound to the disgraced history. So the
Japanese rightists will find them in vain when trying to deny the
occurrence of the atrocities before all these hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
The reflux to distort the history of Japanese aggression and to
cover up and even beautify the crimes by the Japanese militarists
have long existed in the Japanese society. Those holding the
ghost of militarists are attempting to totally deny the history of
Japanese aggression against China by repudiating the Nanjing
Massacre, which is the biggest evidence of the crimes committed by
the Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
In terming the Nanjing Massacre the "biggest lie in the 20th
century," the Japanese right-wingers are themselves telling the
biggest lie in the 20th century. But, whatever how many lies they
are telling, the fact that millions of Chinese people were killed
by the Japanese aggressors can never be covered up.
</P>
<P>
If the adverse trend of denying hard historical facts of
Japanese aggression runs rampant, the foundation for Japan's road
to peace and development will be foundering, and the political
basis of Sino-Japanese relationship will be undermined. So,
people must keep vigilance against this trend in Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
To respect history and to use the past as a mirror are a major
basis and essential starting point for the development of stable,
long-term Sino-Japanese relations of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Only by keeping in mind the bitter memory of the Nanjing
Massacre by avoiding the repetition of such a historical tragedy,
can the Chinese and Japanese people maintain their friendship
generation after generation, and can Japan be ensured to continue
to embark on the road of peaceful development.

<HEADLINE> China strongly condemns Japanese Right-Wing Activists Denying Nanjing Massacre (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu said that history between the two countries has been
problematic placing an enormous strain on Sino-Japanese relations,
and hence is a matter of principle. Today, after more than half a
century, he said, there often emerges an adverse current in Japan,
openly defending militarism, denying historical facts and going
against people's common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
He added that this fact cannot but invite deep thought and call
on the Chinese people and the people of the whole world as well to
maintain sharp vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that how to treat the history of Japanese militarists
indulging in wanton massacre or persecution during their
aggression of China is a political foundation and the touchstone
for judging whether the Japanese government has the sincerity to
safeguard Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Japanese government is responsible for and
obliged to fulfill its commitment, and must be true in words and
resolute in deed.
</P>
<P>
China demands that the Japanese government take immediate
measures to check the domestic adverse current of denying the
history of aggression, avert the very bad effect of this gathering,
and be effectively responsible to ensure that such an incident
never occurs in the future again.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Condemns Japanese Right-wing Activists Denying Nanjing Massacre (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua)-- China today condemned a
gathering of Japanese right-wing activists today in Osaka denying
that the Nanjing Massacre ever took place.
</P>
<P>
A January 21 Japanese Supreme Court ruling once again rejected
the statement of a former Japanese soldier, Azuma Shiro, who
openly confessed to atrocities committed by Japanese aggressors
during the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in no uncertain
terms that the court ruling was totally unreasonable, encouraging
right-wing activists in Japan to deny the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The gathering and the court ruling "have seriously hurt the
feelings of the Chinese people and disturbed the growth of Sino-
Japanese relations. The Chinese government and people hereby
express their extreme indignation and strong condemnation," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that the Japanese government and Osaka authorities
have taken a laissez-faire attitude toward this sensitive issue,
totally disregarding repeated serious representations by the
Chinese. The Japanese government and Osaka authorities "must be
held responsible for the current situation," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Key Project to Search for New Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a national
key research project recently to study mineralization and search
for mineral deposits in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
The research project will cost between 30 million to 50 million
yuan (3.6 million to six million U.S. dollars). The team of
experts will be led by senior scientists from the Chinese Academy
of Geological Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
About 70 to 80 percent of China's industrial raw materials come
from mineral resources. However, among the 45 major mineral
resources proven in China, only 30 of these can meet the demand at
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists are making efforts to develop new ways of
searching for new mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, they will study the formation mechanism of
minerals in some selected areas and establish the country's
theoretical system on large-scale mineralization to guide the
search for mineral resources.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 10 million
yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) in a project to look for
underground water and terrestrial heat resources in the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
A research group, made up by geologists from the Chinese

</P>
<P>
Scientists will also focus on the control of salinization and
desertification for improving the ecological system there.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the major problem restricting Ningxia's development
is shortage of water. The annual amount of precipitation in the
region is less than 400 millimeter.

<HEADLINE> China Pushes Forward International Cooperation in Oceanic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will actively take part
in the international cooperation in oceanic research and
strengthen its contacts with United Nation's Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC), said Chen Lianzeng, deputy
director of the State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
At a recent working conference, Chen said China should become
familiar with the latest trends in international marine research
and develop China's marine protection and research.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts in promoting marine science and
supporting the international marine community since China joined
the IOC in 1977. A large number of professionals in oceanography
has been trained, according to him.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the function of the IOC has grown from
scientific research to developing coastal regions. The State
Oceanic Administration will accelerate international cooperation
in this respect, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
According to Su Jilan, chairman of IOC and a scholar at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, IOC has 127 members around the world
and studies the ocean vis-a-vis global environmental and
atmospheric changes.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Denies Syrian Withdrawal Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that he has not been asked to present a written
pledge to withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 borders as a condition for
the resumption of peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a cabinet meeting Sunday morning, Barak said that in
any case, Israel will not give such a commitment before the talks
take place, but only as a result of them, according to Israel Radio
reports.
</P>
<P>
High-level talks between the two sides were due to reopen in the
United States last Wednesday, but were postponed indefinitely.
Reports from Damascus said Syria is demanding a written pledge from
Israel to full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which were
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
To break the impasse in the talks, U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have maintained intensive
contact this weekend with Barak and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
to bring them back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also flied to Damascus on
Saturday to meet with Assad and try to bridge the gap between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Following a request from Clinton, Barak agreed to send Uri
Saguy, head of the Israeli negotiating team, and Moshe Kohanovsky,
head of the borders committee, to Washington for discussions over
the stalled negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are due to leave for the U.S. on Wednesday to
present comments and requests for clarifications on the U.S.
working document, a seven-page paper drafted by Washington at the
last round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The paper has been described as a preliminary draft, spelling
out the positions of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Saguy and Kohanovsky will spend two or three days in the U.S.,
working mainly with Clinton's Middle East special coordinator,
Dennis Ross, according to a spokesman for Barak.
</P>
<P>
They have no plans to meet with their Syrian counterparts, who
will be in Washington to present their own positions on the working
paper to Ross on Monday or Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Forces Kill 32 Islamic Insurgents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's security forces killed
32 Islamic insurgents and lost 25 of its own soldiers in a raid on
a rebel stronghold, the local newspaper "El Watan" reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The raid was launched in a mountainous, wooded area near
Relizane, 300 kilometers west of Algiers, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the raid, the security forces met strong resistance from
the insurgents. As a result, the government sent more troop
reinforcements to the area so that the raid continued into the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The fierce raid was the first of its kind since the government
set a January 13 deadline for Islamic insurgents not guilty of
murder, bombing or rape to lay down their arms in return for an
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The government has repeatedly declared that insurgents who
refused the offer would be mercilessly crushed.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that in another crackdown, security forces
killed 12 Islamic insurgents in a raid on a market in Sid Ali
Bounab, near the Kabylie capital of Tizi-Ouzou, 130 kilometers east
of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Muslim rebels have surrendered, Algeria's
Interior Minister Yazid Zerhouni said last week.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's Islamic Salvation Army, a moderate militant group
which had held a cease-fire since October 1997, dissolved in
January, but the Armed Islamic Group, the country's most radical
insurgency movement, and other radicals are holding out against the
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic insurgency has left more than 100,000 people dead
since 1992. It was triggered by the army's cancellation of the
second round of legislative elections that the Islamic Salvation
Front was poised to win.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Visits Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban's Foreign
Minister Maulvi Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil arrived here Sunday on a
three-day visit to consult Pakistan on the possibility of holding
talks with the Afghan opposition.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit of a Taliban's foreign minister to
Pakistan since the government change in the country in October
last year.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil will meet Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is open agenda for the talks" between the Taliban and
Pakistani officials, an official sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, a diplomatic source revealed that Pakistan wants to
discuss with Mutawakil ways for the resumption of dialogue between
the ruling Taliban and their rivals.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf had urged the
establishment of a representative government in Afghanistan and he
had asked for cooperation from Iran for the restoration of peace
in the war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian delegation is currently in Afghanistan and had
reportedly held talks with Taliban officials. Unconfirmed sources
said a meeting between Mutawakil and Iranian officials is likely
to be held in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement is another
major issue for talks. Taliban are under pressure from their
traders to resolve the long-standing dispute with Pakistan over
the transit trade.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Reaffirms Stand on DRC Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Affairs Department Sunday reiterated its firm position to support
the international community to find durable solutions to ending
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This is unquestionable, the department stressed in its
statement issued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the criticism made by the DRC President Lauren
Kabila earlier this week that South Africa was arming the DRC
rebels to topple his government, the statement said South African
National Conventional Arms Control Committee has suspended the
sales of weapons to all belligerents involved in the conflict
since the DRC civil war broke out in August,1998, and Kabila's
claim is totally rootless.
</P>
<P>
South Africa supports the perspectives of the Lusaka agreement
that the existence of the rebel movements and the non-military
opposition groups is a fact in the political dynamics of the DRC,
and that there will be no progress in the full implementation of
the ceasefire unless the fact is accepted, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will continue to hold discussions with all parties
involved in the conflict in an effort to ensure that the Lusaka
agreement will be implemented as soon as possible, the statement
reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said South Africa will go on cooperating with
the United Nations, the Organization for African Unity and the
Southern African Development Community in a search for a lasting
solution for the Great Lake region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will send troops as a part of the international
peacekeeping force in the DRC if the U.N. makes such a request to
South Africa, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Daily Denounces Japanese Rightists for Denying Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A signed commentary to be
published by the People's Daily -- the Communist Party newspaper --
on Monday denounced a handful of Japanese rightists for their
Sunday gathering in Okasa aimed at denying the notorious 1937
Nanjing Massacre staged by Japanese aggressor troops and exposed
their attempt to "revive Japanese militarism."
</P>
<P>
The following are extracts from the commentary, entitled "Who
are telling lies?"
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the new year was ushered in, Japanese rightists
are again engaged in activities to call back the spirit of the
Japanese militarists.
</P>
<P>
This time, members of a right-wing Japanese opinions
association gathered Sunday at the International Peace Center in
Osaka, staging a farce meant to deny the Nanjiang Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Under the slogan of "Thoroughly Verifying the Nanjiang Massacre,
" they blatantly clamored that the Nanjing Massacre is "a biggest
lie of the 20th century," deeply hurting the feelings of the
Chinese people and rousing their great indignation.
</P>
<P>
Japanese rightists' attempt to decorate the world-acknowledged
Nanjing Massacre as a "lie" is indeed a mock of the history and
the height of absurdity.
</P>
<P>
The world was shocked to learn that Japanese aggressors had
cruelly slaughtered more than 300,000 Chinese citizens and unarmed
soldiers in a little over one month after they invaded Nanjing in
December 1937.
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, the Far Eastern International
Military Court formed by China, the Soviet Union, the United
States, Britain and France and six other states brought Japanese
war criminals to justice and made a special investigation into the
case in accordance with the principles of justice and peace and
international law.
</P>
<P>
With plenty of testimonies and material evidence, the court
ruled that "Japanese troops committed continuous massacres for at
least six weeks after they occupied Nanjing." Matsui Ishine, the
principal criminal perpetrator, was sentenced to death by hanging.
</P>
<P>
Lies written in ink cannot cover up facts written in blood.
The heaps of bones in the Memorial Hall to Victims of the Nanjing
Massacre and the testimonies from survivors and Japanese veteran
solders who took part in the massacre have all served to verify
that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre is one of the most cruel and
appalling crimes against humanity in the 20th century. Even the
Japanese government has clearly admitted that the Nanjing Massacre
is "an irrefutable fact."
</P>
<P>
By calling for the "verification," a handful of Japanese
rightists have revealed their vicious intentions of tampering with
historic facts, whitewashing the atrocities of aggression and
undermining the friendly relations between China and Japan. It is
precisely this handful of rightists who are telling "Lies of the
Century."
</P>
<P>
It is by no means accidental for a pack of Japanese rightists
to have staged such farces. Such actions on the part of the
Japanese rightists have come as an inevitable result that up till
now, Japan has not reckoned with its wartime aggression against
other nations and that the Japanese society is turning more
rightist.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the circumstance, the right-wingers
agitated narrow nationalism, saying that to admit aggression
amounts to "bringing shame" to the Japanese and that to review
history means "self-maltreatment," in an attempt to blur the
distinction between the "victimized" and the "victimizer" and
confuse the minds of members of the Japanese public.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, a veteran Japanese soldier who participated in the
Nanjing Massacre and made public his wartime diary out of
repentance to prove the massacre, was even attacked and persecuted
by the rightists. On Friday, the Japanese Supreme Court once
again ruled that Azuma Shiro lost his case for alleged "libeling."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Japanese rightists, trying hard to cover
up the country's history of aggression and free the country from
various post-war restrictions, are attempting to revive the dream
of "the Great Japanese Empire."
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that these developments have alerted the world,
especially countries in Asia that suffered the brutal aggression
by the Japanese militarists.
</P>
<P>
What is worth mentioning is the fact that the International
Peace Center in Osaka is funded, built and administrated by the
Osaka Prefecture and the Osaka municipality, which has it as its
aim to contribute to world peace by conveying to future
generations the misery of war and the essence of peace. Such a
gathering held in the center can be nothing but blasphemy and mock
to peace and an insult to all peace-loving people, including
Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Even in Japan, the farce is unpopular. Ikuma Dan, President of
the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, said, "We are
strongly indignant and worried that such an evil gathering
distorting reality and damaging Japan-China friendly relations
should take place in such a public site built for teaching future
generations the misery of war and the value of peace."
</P>
<P>
How to treat issues of history is the political basis for the
development of Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese government
admitted its aggression against China and expressed deep
introspection for the grave suffering of the Chinese people in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and a series of other documents,
which led to the normalization of relations and the maintenance of
good relations.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Chinese President Jiang Zeming paid a state visit to
Japan, when the two countries issued a Joint Declaration,
announcing the establishment of a friendly and cooperative
partnership devoted to peace and development.  Only by using the
past as a mirror can the Sino-Japanese relations go forward on a
sound track and progress in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Japan's basic interests and future lie in following the path of
peaceful development. One must keep extreme alert against the
Japanese rightists' activities of whitewashing and denying their
country's wartime past.

<HEADLINE> Map Shows More Evidence of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- An old map of Nanjing in the
hands a Sichuan collector provides even more evidence that the
Nanjing Massacre was committed by the Japanese soldiers invaders
in December 1937.
</P>
<P>
Fan Jianchuan, vice-chairman of Sichuan Association of
Collectors, said he was filled with indignation to know that the
Japanese right-wing forces were holding a meeting today in Osaka
to deny that such atrocities ever took place.
</P>
<P>
Fan said the atrocities were known all over the world and were
even recorded by a Japanese veteran in his wartime diary.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma was among the soldiers who occupied Nanjing in
December 1937. In the following weeks Japanese soldiers killed
more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese soldiers and civilians. Azuma
recorded the atrocities in a secret diary.
</P>
<P>
He published this diary in April 1996 and was promptly sued by
a former soldier named in it who was described as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in that man's favor and instructed
that his name remain anonymous and he not be charged.
</P>
<P>
In his diary, Shiro claimed that the man who sued him took part
in atrocities such as forcing a Chinese civilian into a sack
soaked in petrol and tied with hand grenades, then igniting the
bag and kicking the sack into one of the ponds in front of the
then Nanjing court.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tokyo High Court ruled that there had never been
such pond in front of the Nanjing Supreme Court in the 1930s. But
Fan pointed to three ponds on the map.
</P>
<P>
Fan said he bought the map in an auction last year in Chengdu.
The map was later confirmed to be a 1939 edition published by the
Japan-controlled puppet government run by warlord and traitor Wang
Jinwei.
</P>
<P>
A Nanjing map published in 1935 was found in Tianjin in 1998
and gives the same evidence of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the map, Fan has collected sabers, jugs and ashtrays
used by Japanese invaders in 1930s. "The efforts of Japanese right-
wing activities denying that such atrocities ever took place are
futile. The Japanese should learn from the Germans who were brave
enough to admit their crimes," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
Fan will soon publish his book titled "Circumstantial Evidence"
exposing the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders with a
large number of pictures and other historical records.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Conflicts in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministry said here
today that China welcomes the scheduled meeting on the conflicts
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to be held by the United
Nations Security Council next week, and hopes that the meeting
will yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao, China has all
along paid a great deal of attention to the conflicts in the DRC
and has kept promoting the Security Council in resolving the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held a special meeting on conflicts in the
DRC last March when China chaired the council.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China has always maintained that all parties concerned
should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
DRC, and seek a peaceful resolution to the DRC issue through
dialogue and consultation in the spirit of African unity and
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
China supports and appreciates the efforts of the Organization
of African Unity, the Southern African Development Community, and
related countries in trying to reach a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China regards the peace agreement signed in Lusaka,
Zambia, in 1994 as a positive move made by African countries for
resolving conflicts in Africa independently. It also serves as a
foundation for the peaceful settlement of the DRC issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is an urgent matter that relevant parties should earnestly
implement the peace agreement, and the international community
should also offer their support and help," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the United Nations will take concrete measures
and make greater efforts to resolve the DRC issue. "China supports
the UN Security Council in carrying out peace-keeping activities
in the DRC as soon as possible and sending in peace-keeping troops
if necessary," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will as
always continue to play its role in seeking peaceful resolution to
the conflicts in the DRC, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Political Parties in Cyprus Cautious to Greek FM's Visit to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Cyprus has
expressed cautious welcome to Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou's recent visit to Ankara, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visit was the first by a Greek Foreign Minister in 38 years
and is part of a recent thaw between the two long-time rivals.
Panayiotis Demetriou, deputy chairman of the ruling Democratic
Rally party, on Saturday termed the visit as part of the framework
of a new philosophy and strategy of rapprochement promoted by
Greece in Greco-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Demetriou said that the new philosophy must be tried before any
conclusions can be drawn.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Christou, parliamentary spokesman of the main opposition
leftist AKEL party, maintained that the new approach pursued by
Athens is in the interests of both Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Christou hoped that in the long run it will help solve the
Cyprus problem as well.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish communities
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island after a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for years to bring the two
sides back together in a bizonal bicommunal federation, but so far
no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party deputy chairman, Nicos Cleanthous, said
that nobody had expected miracles from Papandreou's visit to
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The New Horizons chairman Nicos Koutsou said he disagreed with
Greece's new strategy of rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the idea that the threat of war had been eliminated,
citing the increased spending on armaments by both Greece and
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Promote Intra-Regional Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Tourism ministers from the 10
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
agreed here on Sunday to promote tourism within the region.
</P>
<P>
During the ASEAN Tourism Ministers' Meeting held here earlier
Sunday as part of the on-going ASEAN Tourism Forum, the ministers
pledged to promote intra-ASEAN travel in their individual
countries.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN people should introduce themselves to each other first
by visiting each other's country," Malaysia's Minister of Culture,
Arts and Tourism Dato' Kadir Bin Haji Sheikh Fadzir said at a
press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 30 percent of the region's tourism industry,
intra-ASEAN traveling is a "sizable base" for member countries'
tourism markets, said Lim Swee Say, Singapore's Minister of State
for Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers stressed that markets outside ASEAN will
be attached to equal importance to create a good environment for
healthy tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to promote ASEAN as a single tourism
destination by launching a "Visit ASEAN Campaign" in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"It will make tourism industries among ASEAN members less
competitive and more complementary," Gemma Cruz-Araneta, tourism
minister of the Philippines, said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed the role of tourism in sustained
economic growth, agreeing to cooperate in enhancing investment in
tourism facilities, removing barriers to tourism and working out
complementary marketing programs for ASEAN tourism.
</P>
<P>
They identified that relaxation of visa requirements, the
promotion and development of cruise tourism, air services
liberalization, strong ASEAN presence in major travel markets are
among the important areas to be further looked into.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 ASEAN tourism and travel executives, government
officials, buyers and sellers of travel trade from 40 countries
attended the 18th annual tourism forum among ASEAN, which runs
from January 20 to 26.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Prisons Congested With Refugee Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Prisons in Tanzania's
western Kigoma Region are congested with many refugee inmates from
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
These refugee inmates are either serving sentences or remanded,
 according to a Sunday News report.
</P>
<P>
The report issued recently by the Kigoma Regional Commissioner
Abubakar Mgumia said that the prisons in the region have been
overwhelmed by offenders, mostly refugees who are charged with
crimes like rape, armed robbery and murder.
</P>
<P>
Bangwe prison in Kigoma town which was meant for 64 inmates has
now been forced to accommodate 419 lawbreakers, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said 178 refugees from Burundi and 37 from the DRC
are serving sentences for various offences, particularly armed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
There are 190 Burundian, 50 Congolese and six Rwandan refugees
who are remanded in the region prisons.
</P>
<P>
The report shows from 1994 to 1999, there have been 465
criminal incidents in the region involving refugees.
</P>
<P>
The region has seen the increase of weapons brought in
unlawfully by the refugees between January 1994 and December 1999
when 60 firearms, 4,084 bullets and two hand grenades were
confiscated by police.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that thousands of refugees from Burundi, some
of whom are armed, unleashed violent attacks on local Tanzanians
in Kigoma Region last year. Scores of villagers were reported to
be killed or hurt in conflicts with refugees.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is home to over 800,000 refugees from Burundi, the
DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and Uganda. However,
more than 450, 000 refugees nation-wide are not residing in camps
or settlements.

HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong received 10.68
million visitors in 1999, an 11.5 percent increase over 1998, and
the highest number since the peak 11.7 million visitors in 1996,
according to statistics released today.
</P>
<P>

when over 900,000 arrivals were recorded and the 18th month of
continuous growth, according to the statistics of the Hong Kong

we can start the new millennium on a firm foundation with great
prospects for continued growth," she said.

DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka was selected by Japan's
Ministry of Transport as a case city for "Eco-Transport Assistance
Study" to promote more rational transportation system, Bangladeshi
National News Agency (BSS) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Japanese embassy here said a

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Strike Enters Second Week in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Kindergartens, elementary
schools and most junior high schools in Israel remained closed
Sunday as a teachers' strike entered the second week over a dispute
on pay rise.
</P>
<P>
Some 85,000 teachers continued their week-long strike after
late-night talks between representatives of the Finance Ministry
and the Teachers Union failed to bridge the gaps between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides said after the meeting, which lasted into early
Sunday morning, that their stances remained far apart. About one
million school children remained at home.
</P>
<P>
The teachers have demanded a 15 percent compensation for erosion
of their salaries since 1994, or a total package of 1.8 billion
shekels(about 450 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Treasury, however, has stuck to its plan for a 1.2 percent
increase plus a one-time payment of 900 shekels (about 225 U.S.
dollars).

<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- German prosecutors investigating the corruption scandal
surrounding Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor, have named a
senior British aircraft industry executive who was allegedly
targeted with at least 1.75 million pounds (about 2.87 million U.S.
dollars) in kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- The Royal Air Force is facing a front-line "crisis" with
hundreds of jets unable to fly, a shortage of crack fighter pilots
and millions of pounds wasted on technology that does not work.
Insiders said this is a chronic problem facing Britain's air
defenses and strike attack forces.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Mike Tyson, the United States boxing champion, has had an
invitation to tour the British House of Commons withdrawn after
protests by female members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- The future of ground-breaking human gene therapy experiments
was in disarray Saturday after a damning report into the death of
a teenager. U.S. health officials ordered an end to all gene
experiments at the world-renowned Pennsylvania Institute for Human
Gene Therapy, where an 18-year-old human guinea pig died. This
brought calls for a halt to all such programs in Britain and
America.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Leading European Union officials are trying to broker a

-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Saturday held talks
with Saleh Tarif, member of the Israeli Knesset (parliament) who is
on a visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks should continue, Tarif said,
adding that he believes that the talks on the Syrian track might
lead to a stop on the Palestinian track for some time.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- President Hosni Mubarak has issued directives to give
Egyptian industry's technological development top priority in the
coming period, a senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of a number of industrial projects,

development, said his ministry is preparing the final stages of a
national program for technological development.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Jim Hall, chief of the National Transportation Safety Board,

several issues still under investigation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Arrest 150 Hezbollah Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police detained some 150
Hezbollah suspects in southeastern Turkey over the weekend,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a suspected Hezbollah mole in the prime
ministry identified as Abdulsamet Yildiz, was recently picked up by
police when he was on vacation outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz had been temporarily employed for monitoring the traffic
of all the official cars including those of the cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told reporters Saturday that it is
possible that Hezbollah has infiltrated into state organs, but, if
so, the infiltrators will be brought to light as the probe against
the terrorist organization deepens.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Hezbollah, reported to have no links to the Lebanese
Hezbollah that has been engaged in a guerrilla war against Israeli
occupation troops in south Lebanon, seeks to establish a
fundamentalist Islamic state in Moslem-dominated but officially
secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah was born and grew up in 1980s in the country's
Kurdish-populated turbulent Southeast. It targeted supporters of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, a fact that has led many to
doubt whether the Hezbollah militants were state-sponsored contra-
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the speculation, Ecevit said that "I do not have
much to say without concrete evidence. However, in recent years, we
know this has not been the case."
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide dragnet against the clandestine Islamist group
started with an assault on a Hezbollah militant hideout in Istanbul
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After an exchange of machine-gun fire, police stormed the house
and shot dead a militant who was identified as Hezbollah's leader.
Two key members captured in the operation confessed that the
terrorist organization abducted and killed some 40 businessmen in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 bodies of missing businessmen were recovered in
Istanbul, Ankara and Konya in the following days while hundreds of
Hezbollah suspects were apprehended.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Uri Saguy, head of the negotiating team for the Syrian talks,
and Moshe Kohanovsky, head of the borders committee, will leave for
Washington on Wednesday to present Israel's responses to the U.S.
working document drafted at the previous rounds of negotiations
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Saturday

American officials are to convene separate talks with Israeli and
Syrian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- As a criminal investigation gets underway Sunday against
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, his lawyers are contemplating the
possibility of having him take a leave of absence before his
scheduled appearance at a ceremony next Tuesday, in which he is to
swear in new judges.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor Edna Arbel told Haaretz Saturday that Weizman
may be questioned as early as this week. She said the president has
not yet given his account and that he himself asked to be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Hezbollah guerrillas are searching for missing Israeli airman
Ron Arad's remains with the help of German experts, the German
magazine Der Spiegel reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah told the magazine that
the search is concentrating on where Arad, who was captured in
Lebanon in 1986, might be buried. Israel has been looking for the
whereabouts of Arad in the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's National Fraud Squad will begin investigating
suspected business ties between Weizman and millionaire Edouard
Seroussi Sunday to determine whether tax or criminal offenses were
committed.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors said that besides the documents on the
business connection between Weizman and Seroussi, there are other
reasons for opening the investigation. Weizman has vowed to fight
to the end.

<HEADLINE> 14 Tamil Rebels Killed in Fresh Clashes in S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 Tamil rebels were
killed in fresh clashes in the north of Sri Lanka when security
forces clamped a curfew just north of the capital, a military
spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman R.P. Witana said five rebels were killed on Saturday
when troops destroyed a bunker with rocket-propelled grenades at
Kondawilkulam in the northernmost Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Troops killed two rebels in retaliatory fire at Jaffna's
Muhavil, said Witana, adding that one soldier was killed by rebels
' mortar fire in the same area.
</P>
<P>
He said troops assaulted a rebels' bunker with machine guns and
small guns at Kambiliwewa in the Welioya region, killing five
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Two rebels of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) were killed in an armed confrontation with government troops
at Maruthamadu in the Wanni area, Witana said.
</P>
<P>
The sporadic clashes in the north were echoed with a 10-hour
curfew and search operation on Saturday in the south for LTTE
infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
State radio said two suicide bombers and nine hard-core LTTE
rebels have been identified and seized in the operation in
suburban Colombo's Kolonnawa and in the nearby Gampaha district.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened in and around Colombo following a
series of suicide bomb attacks in recent weeks blamed on LTTE
rebels who have been fighting for independence for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Minister's Visit Fruitful  By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian State Minister for
External Affairs Ajit Kumar Panja's three-day goodwill visit to
Bangladesh from Thursday to Saturday yields abundantly, observers
here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As the first minister of the new Indian government, which took
office late last year, to visit Bangladesh, Panja met with Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, and held talks with his counterpart Abul
Hasan Chowdhury, Agriculture Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury and
other government officials.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Panja witnessed the signing of a memorandum
of understanding (MOU) to institutionalize agricultural
cooperation between the two neighbors through exchange and
training of scientists, joint publications and promotion of joint
ventures in agro-industries. The MOU envisaged the establishment
of a joint agricultural working group, which will review progress
of activities, provide guidance and facilitate cooperation in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and India also agreed in principle to run a bus
service between Dhaka and Agartala, capital of India's eastern
state of Tripura.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka-Agartala bus service is part of the overall idea of
linking the region's countries including Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar
with a unified communication network to help movement of people
and goods among them in comfort and economically, said Panja.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint press statement issued at the end of Panja
's visit, the creation of opportunities for young artists, greater
collaboration on improving border management, water resources,
measures to enhance trade and commerce, curbing smuggling and
consular matters were also covered in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reiterated the need to cooperate in combating
trafficking of children and narcotics, noting that an agreement in
these areas is expected to be concluded soon. They also recognized
the need to conclude a bilateral investment promotion and
protection agreement expeditiously, and said the Joint Economic
Commission is expected to meet at an early date in Dhaka,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The high-level contact between the two governments has proved
useful in yielding a better appreciation of each other's positions
on varied issues. Analysts here said Bangladesh's economic
development is not merely in the country's own interest, it should
also be of paramount interest to India as well. India stands to
benefit from a stronger, developed and thriving market in
Bangladesh, they said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Farm Output Grows in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural output in the
Philippines expanded by 6.49 percent in 1999 thanks to improved
weather conditions, as compared with a sharp contraction the
previous year, the government said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This is really a welcome development. We've exceeded our
earlier growth forecast," said Secretary of Agriculture Edgardo
Angara in a report released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 6.49 percent increase overshoot the 6 percent growth target
of the government and almost wiped out the 7.18 percent drop
recorded in the El Nino and La Nina-stricken year of 1998, Angara
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that contributing largely to last year's outstanding
growth was good performance of the crop sector as its production
volume grew by 10.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Favorable weather conditions combined with production area
expansion and government interventions enabled the crops sector to
perform well, Angara said.
</P>
<P>
However, production of coconut, mango, coffee and tobacco fell
respectively by 9.43 percent, 18.81 percent, 5.1 percent and 9.48
percent, largely due to weather disturbances like typhoons, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Crime Officers to Train in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The sixth batch of
Tanzanian police officers left here for the United States at the
weekend to attend special training aimed at improving their
performances, local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The group is comprised of 24 senior officers including tutors
of Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Zanzibar police colleges and district
criminal investigation officers from all over the country, Sunday
News quoted a statement issued by the Police Headquarters as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Dar es Salaam Deputy Regional Crimes
Officer and Superintendent of Police Geoffrey Puka.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, Tanzania was receiving maximum cooperation from
U.S., especially through the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI).
</P>
<P>
In 1998, FBI agents came to Tanzania to conduct a joint
investigation in collaboration with the local personnel from the
Criminal Investigation Department, following the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam on August 7 in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanzanian police sources, since 1998, members of
the Police Force have been trained in the U.S. in various fields.
</P>
<P>
They are faced with the increasing crimes such as illegal
immigrants and smuggling of firearms, drugs and stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The on-going civil wars in the neighboring countries like
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) also pose a
threat to the existing peace and stability in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Coffee Export Remains Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite of its sustained
efforts, Ethiopia failed in the last six months to export more
coffee as it expected before, the Capital weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia earned 89.3 million U.S. dollars from 42,843 tons of
coffee export in the second half of 1999, Tsegaye Birhane, general
manager of Ethiopian Coffee Export Enterprise, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The volume of coffee export has fallen short by 11 percent of
the targeted plan although it has increased by 15 percent from
last year's coffee export volume.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye said the main reason for the failure to earn more
foreign exchange from coffee export is due to continued low price
of coffee in international market.
</P>
<P>
Coffee has long been number one foreign exchange earner in
Ethiopia, accounting for 63 percent of total foreign exchange
income.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of 73 coffee exporting countries in the world,
supplying 40 countries and covers two percent of the world's
coffee supply.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the biggest coffee exporter, providing one third of
coffee supply in the world.

CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi ended local hope
Mark Philippoussis' Australian Open challenge with a four-set
victory in the fourth round at Melbourne Park Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the supreme opportunist, won the points that mattered
most to win 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-3 to set up a quarter-final
fight against Moroccan Hicham Arazi.
</P>
<P>
The victory left teenager Lleyton Hewitt as the only Australian
in the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt meets Magnus Norman of Sweden Monday for a place in the
quarter-finals.
</P>

Philippoussis had his chances Sunday, but failed the test on
the vital points.

<P>
He blew a break point in the eighth game of the first set
before dropping his own serve the following game to hand Agassi
the early advantage.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, one of only five man to win all four grand slams,
fended off another three break points in the second then won six
straight points to take the second-set tiebreak 7-4 after trailing
4-1.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis took the third 7-5 when he twice broke Agassi
after letting slip a 4-2 lead. It was the first time in the
tournament that Agassi had dropped a set.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippoussis' third-set effort seemed to have taken
its toll and Agassi was on the path to victory after breaking

NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen Somalis have been
arrested in a major police swoop in Kenya's Coast Province, the
state-run Herald newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>

The Somalis were arrested Friday while being secretly ferried
on a vessel near Lamu Island along the coast. The Somali
nationals disguising themselves as students on their way back to
schools in the port city Mombasa, were seized by the Kenya Navy on

Last week, nine Somalis were found hiding in a Middle East ship
for discharging fuel, moored at the Kilindini Harbour in Coast
Province.

<HEADLINE> Largest Sino-U.S. Joint Venture Reports Profits (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asian Brand News, a Hong Kong-based magazine, named SGM's Buick
the "1999 Brand Builder of Asia", and orders for Buick cars topped
20,000 last year, beating the original target of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lingyi, a senior economist with the Shanghai Academy of
Social Sciences, said that SGM's success is also attributable to a
series of policy measures taken by the Chinese government over the
past years to boost the economy, such as cutting related fees on
car purchase, and issuing car loans.
</P>
<P>
The investors have not discussed the distribution of the
profits yet, Chen said, but it is most likely that they will spend
the money on developing new products.
</P>
<P>
SGM plans to make 50,000 Buick cars and wagons this year.
</P>
<P>
"Our eventual aim is to become an auto giant that can compete
globally," said SGM's Vice General Manager Philip Murtaugh.
</P>
<P>
China is regarded as one of the world's largest potential auto
markets in the 21st century, and last year about 550,000 cars were
sold. So far, auto giants like Volkswagen and Toyota as well as GM
have all set up subsidiaries in China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, which has listed the auto industry as a pillar of the
local economy, has approved more than 20,000 overseas-funded
enterprises, with combined contractual overseas investments of
about 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of these enterprises have been performing well, and they
as a whole generated 6.2 billion yuan in profits during the first
11 months of last year.

<HEADLINE> Largest Sino-U.S. Joint Venture Reports Profits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai General Motors (SGM),
the largest Sino-U.S. joint venture which went into operation on
April 12, 1999, netted a profit of 600 million yuan in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
SGM President Chen Hong said here today that it is very rare
for a GM subsidiary out of the United States to become profitable
in the first year of its operation.
</P>
<P>
"We never thought of beginning to gain profits so soon although
both investors have been confident about the prospects of SGM,"
Chen said, adding that "It's really an exciting surprise."
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics indicate that SGM, co-funded by the Shanghai
Automobile Industry Corporation and General Motors with 1.52
billion U.S. dollars, produced a total of 23,000 Buick cars last
year, with after-tax sales volume amounting to some six billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed SGM's success to mainly the "sincere
cooperation" between the two investors and their motto: customers
first.
</P>
<P>
Both investors have taken into account China's possible entry
into the WTO since the joint venture was initiated years ago, and
have therefore set the goal of maintaining its production and
services in this country at international standards to meet
possible competition from other automakers.
</P>
<P>
While stepping up development of new models, SGM has been
improving its Buick car service centers in major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
All this has helped SGM and its products build a fine image,
Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Sea Ports Urged to Improve Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has challenged the Tanzania Harbors Authority to
improve efficiency and fight corruption, local media reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the recently dredged channel of the Dar
es Salaam port should be an inspiring force to improve efficiency
and weed out corrupt elements in all ports in the country.
</P>
<P>
Juma made these remarks at the commissioning ceremony of the
Dar es Salaam Entrance Channel, Night Piloting Operations and the
inauguration of the West Ferry Passenger Terminal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Dar es Salaam port has, for a long time, been
associated with corruption, cargo theft and delay in off-loading
and clearing of cargo.
</P>
<P>
"The authority should make every effort to fight these vices to
place it in a good competitive position," Juma was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Though Tanzania's ports were geographically well-placed, the
Authority and the Ministry of Works should strive to improve the
quality of ports to claim a share in the current competitive
environment, said the vice- president.
</P>
<P>
With the deepened and straightened channel, he said the port
stands to attract larger vessels that it used before and therefore
improve its services to clients.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Entrance Channel expansion projects have cost
a total of 23.3 million U.S. dollars, of which 60 per cent has
been contributed by the government of the Netherlands and the rest
40 per cent funded by the Tanzanian government.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A home that will offer free
medical services to children with HIV/AIDS and counselling
services to their families has established in Kenya's capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The home was officially opened Saturday by visiting Director of
the U.S. National AIDS Policy Sandra Thurman, the Sunday Nation
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The home, to be funded to the tune of 250,000 U.S. dollars by
the U.S. Agency for International Development, will initially
accommodate 30 HIV positive children from the slum.
</P>
<P>
Angelo D'Agostino, founder of the Children of God Relief
Institute, said the home will offer community-based care to
between 200 to 300 children suffering from HIV/AIDS by training
their families on ways to giving them appropriate care at home.
</P>
<P>
Thurman said her government was committed to assisting African
countries including Kenya to fight the pandemic through additional
funding.
</P>
<P>
She announced Thursday in Nairobi an additional seven million
dollars funding by the U.S. government to help fight HIV/AIDS in
Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's President Meets Maradona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
Saturday met soccer super star Diego Maradona, who is being
treated at the Grassland international health resort center in
Havana for cocaine addiction, and his wife Clausia, chating for 20
minutes in private.
</P>
<P>
Castro also congratulate Clausia on her birthday in the meet
after knowing the birthday from Maradona's talks to a television
station based in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Maradona, who checked in the center last
Tuesday, said the encounter had acted like a tonic for his damaged
health.
</P>
<P>
"If I have visits like the one I had from Fidel then my heart
will hold out and this Diego will be around for a while," Maradona
was quoted by reporters as saying late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former Argentine national team captain and the Cuban
President are known to be mutual admirers.
</P>
<P>
Maradona appeared surrounded by his wife, his two young
daughters, his parents-in-law and other relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
The fallen soccer idol, who had flown to Cuba suffering from
hypertension and an irregular heart beat, said he was "fine",
although he acknowledged that his damaged heart had been running
only at "50 percent."
</P>
<P>
Maradona was expected to spend at least three months in Cuba
undergoing a rehabilitation programme for drug addiction. He asked
the journalists to respect his need for rest and quiet.
</P>
<P>
Doctors had recommended long-term treatment for his cocaine
habit and he had chosen Cuba, whose free public health system has
won worldwide recognition. Cuba also offers medical services to
fee-paying foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Maradona first dabbled in drugs in 1983 while playing for
Barcelona. The habit earned him two 15-month suspensions from
soccer in the 1990s and he retired in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Major Port Strike Ends in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The major strike by India's
port and dock workers that crippled the country's all 11 large
ports in the past five days was called off late Saturday night
following an agreement reached between the government and the
workers' representatives, local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The end of the strike was jointly announced by Minister of
Surface Transport Rajnath Singh and President of the All-India
Port &AMP; Dock Workers Federation S.R.Kulkarni as a result of 12
hours of marathon talks, the Hindu newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the port workers' demand for better
wages will be taken up by the minister of surface transport "at
the appropriate level" for a solution before March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Singh assured the five port and dock workers' federations
representing the 100,000-strong port strikers across the country
that he would plead their case with "full sympathy and strength."
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the agreement, we are advising the port and
dock workers to call off their present strike," S.R.Kulkarni was
quoted as saying by the Indian Express. The trade union leader
also promised that no worker would be victimized for their
participation in the strike.
</P>
<P>
The port strike began at midnight Monday after earlier talks
between the government and the workers' federations failed to
reach any consensus. The workers' federations were invited by the
government on Thursday to return to the negotiation table and the
talks resumed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's deployment of the navy and territorial
army at the strike-hit ports to help maintain some essential
maritime operations, loading and unloading operations at these
ports were seriously affected. A port management official
estimated that the ports had suffered economic losses worth some
half a million U.S. dollars every day during the strike.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Crosses 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- After a two-week spell below
the three percent mark, India's inflation rate vaulted to 3.11
percent for the week that ended on January 8, 2000, mainly on
account of increases in the prices of various food and non-food
articles.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.41 percentage
points jump in the annual inflation rate to 3.11 percent as
against 2.70 percent the previous week was triggered by rises in
indices of Primary Articles and the Manufactured Products.
</P>
<P>
The Inflation rate was, however, higher at 4.52 percent during
the corresponding week last year. The highest rate of inflation in
recent months was recorded at 3.13 percent for the week that ended
on December 18, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Balkan PMs Meet for Regional Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Ministers from seven
countries bordering Yugoslavia Saturday discussed the situation in
the Balkans and ways to fully implement the so-called Stability
Pact for Southeast Europe, a European Union-led commitment by some
40 countries to back economic reconstruction in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
During an informal meeting at Hissarya, central Bulgaria, the
heads of government from Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania,
Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Hungary, expressed their concern
over the failure of an effective implementation of the Stability
Pact, endorsed at the Sarajevo summit last June for the
reconstruction of the Balkans and southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski warned of the
emergence of widespread discontent from the Balkan states if
western countries further delay their investment there. The
reconstruction of Kosovo is also lacking proper progress, he added.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa said international
sanctions against Yugoslavia are unnecessary, although some other
leaders considered them important political means.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Matesa's remarks, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov,
who initiated the meeting, said the sanctions "are ruining the
overall economic environment in the (Balkan) region" and are
hurting the ordinary Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
"We all agree that the sanctions are affecting all the
countries in the region," said Kostov, adding that his country has
suffered a direct economic loss of 200 million U.S. dollars and an
indirect loss of 180 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the EU and NATO were also attending the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shooters' Chances Slim in Qualifying for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian female shooters have
slim chances of qualifying for the Olympic Games in Sydney in
September due to their poor world record.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Shooting and Hunting Association official in
charge of target shooting Sita Razni expressed her doubt that four
national female shooters, who will compete in the Asian Shooting
Championships in Langkawi, Malaysia, next week, could improve
their personal best.
</P>
<P>
"With many countries competing in the championships, especially
Australian shooters, who have better records than Indonesians, our
athletes have little chance to qualify in the Olympics," she was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is fielding Suparni, Gusti Ayu Indradevi and Yuniarti
in the individual and team air rifle match events, and Bari
Agustini in the air pistol and sports pistol in the championships,
which will take place from January 25 to 30.
</P>
<P>
For example, Sita said, a Chinese shooter was holding a world
record of 399 points, in comparison to Indonesia's Suparni, whose
personal best was 393.
</P>
<P>
Sita hoped the four shooters could sharpen national records in
the championships, which will be attended by about 600 shooters.
</P>
<P>
"We hope they can improve their technical skills so they can
match their Asian counterparts," she said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Host World-Class Table Tennis Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual Women's Table Tennis World Cup is certified by the
International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). It is the first time
for Cambodia to host a world-class women's table tennis
competition.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, sponsored mainly by Thai Boon Roong Company,
will feature 16 athletes from 14 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Table tennis has long been a favorite sport in Asia and during
the then-Prince Norodom Sihanouk regime of the '60s, women's table
tennis was quite popular in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The last medal won by Cambodia in table tennis was a bronze by
the teenage boys team in a regional event, Friendship 1996 Table
Tennis Competition.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's Keo Vanny, 25, will compete in the match, although
she has yet to win a medal in international competition. It was
reported that some very highly ranked international players will
take part in the match, such as Wang Nan of China who is currently
the No. 1 female player in the world and Li Ju, also of China, who
is No. 2.
</P>
<P>
The Women's World Cup has the biggest prize money and is
regarded as the most important event on the ITTF calendar after
the World Championships and the ITTF Pro Tour Grand Finals.
</P>
<P>
Every participant will leave with prize money provided by Teng
Bunma's 200,000 U.S. dollars sponsorship, according to organizers.
The winner gets 28,000 U.S. dollars, the second placer gets 14,000
and the third finisher 9,000.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Invest More on Economy Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to invest 9.56
billion yuan (about 1.15 billion US dollars) in the construction
of economy housing this year to provide more affordable houses for
medium and low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly (China Daily) quoted Vice-Mayor Wang
Guangtao as saying the total construction will be 9.18 million
square meters, including construction that was started last year
and to be completed this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the housing planned will add 6 million square meters to
the city's inventory.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the local construction commission indicate the
city began 4.5 million square meters of economy housing
construction in 1999, with 1.5 million square meters being
completed before the year end. About one million square meters of
the housing was sold.
</P>
<P>
The housing was built on land allocated by the local government
and benefited from a series of favorable policies, including tax
reductions.
</P>
<P>
The price for economy housing ranges from 2,400 yuan (about 289
dollars) to 4.450 yuan (about 536 dollars) per square meter, which
is about 600 yuan (about 72 dollars) per square lower than the
price for commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
With a down payment of 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 dollars), a
buyer can move in and pay the rest in installments of about 1,000
yuan (about 120 dollars) to 2,000 (about 240 dollars) each month.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Seizes 11 Tamil Rebels in 10-Hour Curfew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's security forces
have identified and seized 11 Tamil rebels in a 10-hour surprise
curfew and a search operation just north of the capital, state
radio said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 rebels, two are suicide bombers, while nine others
are hard-core members of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), said the radio in its morning broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The government slapped the curfew from 4:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
on Saturday in Kolonnawa, a suburb of Colombo, and in the nearby
Gampaha district.
</P>
<P>
During the curfew, a large number of policemen and army
soldiers were brought from neighboring areas to conduct the cordon
and search operation.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were detained for questioning in public
buildings and police stations in and around Gampaha district. Most
of the detainees were freed after being photographed and video
filmed.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, there was a similar curfew and search operation
in Colombo, during which hundreds of ethnic Tamils were detained
but most of them were freed after questioning.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened in and around Colombo following a
series of suicide bomb attacks in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The attacks are blamed on the LTTE rebels who have been
fighting for independence for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north
and east since 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of five religious
communities in Indonesia on Saturday pledged their support for
strict measures against perpetrators of violence, the Jakarta Post
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The five leaders signed a joint statement to reject anarchic
conduct and all acts prone to causing chaos under the mask of
religious interest.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are Muslim representative Habib Ali bin Abdurrahman
Assegar, Protestant representative Rev. Sularso Sopater, Catholic
representative Aloysius O., Hindu cleric Nyoman Purwaka and
Buddhist priest Bhiksuni Firyaguna.
</P>
<P>
They said in the joint statement that they would comply with "
check and recheck procedures" should they hear reports of alleged
religious harassment.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to preserve peace among people of
different religions. We support the police to take the strictest
measures against those proven to provoke religious or sectarian
conflicts," Habib was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Habib stressed that a religion could pose a danger if its
believers lost their common sense.
</P>
<P>
Communal clashes remain unabated in Maluku, with the death toll
in the year-long conflict at over 1,000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Exports Show Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's textile and garment
exports have shown signs of recovery from a record 14-month-long
decline, today's Business Weekly (China Daily) quoted an official
with the State Textile Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
"China's textile and garment have turned away from a headlong
decrease," said Wang Lie, deputy director of the industry
administration department of the State Textile Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Exports were valued at 38.857 billion U.S. dollars during the
first 11 months of 1999, the same compared to the same period of
1998. Of the exports, textiles contributed 11.73 billion dollars,
up 1.68 percent from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports, valued at 27.13 billion dollars, declined by 0.
8 percent on a year-on-year basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's textile and garment exports have already shown sign of
recovery from the severe setback the industries experienced
beginning in the middle of 1998," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the recovery sign to a stronger international
export market and the central government's policy support.
</P>
<P>
The fact that textile companies have enhanced their
competitiveness by doing away with surplus production capacity and
by laying off redundant workers also contributed to the good signs
of recovery.
</P>
<P>
China became the world's largest textile and garment exporter
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country witnessed its first export decline in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Negatively influenced by Southeast Asia's financial crisis,
China's textile and garment exports experienced a continuous 14-
month, 21 percent decrease from May 1998 to June 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will offer land-use
rights to more than 200,000 square meters via an auction to be
held on February 18.
</P>
<P>
"Companies from both home and abroad will be allowed to
participate in the auction," Li Lin, deputy director of the
Beijing Municipal Housing and Land Administrative Bureau, was
quoted by today's Business Weekly (China Daily) as saying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Sells Land Protection Certificates In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province has started selling 20,000 land protection certificates
in Hong Kong to raise money for environmental protection projects
in the province's river-sources area.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Qinghai Environmental
Protection Bureau, the 20,000 land protection certificates vary
from 10 to 30 square inches each in size.
</P>
<P>
They said a Hong Kong environmental protection agency, "Friends
of the Earth," is responsible for selling the certificates, and
all money collected will be used to build ecological projects in
the river-sources area.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the first land protection certificate was
bought by Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze and Yellow rivers, China's first and second longest,
both originate from Qinghai province. Due to climate changes,
excessive logging, and a lack of funds for grasslands development,
the ecological environment at both river sources has deteriorated
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have been making great
efforts to improve the environment and protect the river-sources
area. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Specialists Being Promoted to Leading Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has been employing the strategy of promoting more
specialists to leading posts in local Party committees,
governments, enterprises, and scientific institutions.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to put Guangdong in an advantageous
position for facing the challenges of the new century, and help
the province take the lead in realizing nationwide modernization.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has grown from an economically poor region into a
place of prosperity due to China's reform and opening-up, and it
now ranks at the top in the country in terms of gross domestic
product (GDP), total export volume, and revenue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Liu Fengyi, head of the
Organization Department of the Guangdong Provincial Party
Committee, said the province has been using a special program
under which 3,000 well-trained people will be promoted to leading
posts in local Party committees and governments, and to leading
posts in enterprises, as well as in research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The program has clear and detailed requirements as to age,
political and professional capabilities, and job skills for those
seeking these promotions.
</P>
<P>
A databank has been set up for candidates who are subject to
annual inspections and will be removed if they fail to pass muster.
The databank now contains information about more than 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Liu said they have worked out a plan to send people who are
included in the databank to receive advanced studies at central or
provincial Party schools and at Chinese and foreign universities,
or to work in grass-roots units and in poor areas, in a bid to
improve their political quality and professional capability, and
to improve their skills.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, a total of 167 such people have been promoted to
leading posts in the province, and 77.8 percent of them have
earned bachelor or postgraduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
Guangfa Securities Co. Ltd. of Guangdong, to cite one instance,
has more than 1,000 employees, forty of whom have doctorate
degrees, with 200 others now doing postgraduate work.
</P>
<P>
This company, which was once just a small business office, has
now grown into an enterprise operating 37 business offices across
the country with profits of 429 million yuan in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sets Industrial Goal for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has set the goal of
increasing local industrial added value by 9 percent this year,
and securing the future of the sector for the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
Local industry completed 175.8 billion yuan in added value last
year, up 9.6 percent over the 1998 figure, and earned 20.9 billion
yuan in profits from January to November in 1999, a 29.2 percent
rise on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai completed nine major industrial projects last year and
imported technology for 40 other major industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial enterprises also intend to see profits grow by
10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to invest 62 billion yuan in industrial fixed
assets in 2000, and 31 billion yuan in upgrading industrial
technologies, and to attract three billion US dollars of
contractual overseas money.
</P>
<P>
The asset-to-liability ratio of local industrial enterprises is
scheduled to be reduced to below 50 percent, and the industrial
production-to-sale ratio will be retained at above 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will also accelerate the construction of 25 large
industrial projects each with an investment of over 200 million
yuan, and complete 37 each with more than 50 million yuan of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai vows to spare no effort to improve its industrial
production and seize every opportunity to strengthen local
industry.

<HEADLINE> Letter Writing No Longer Number One in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Writing letters is no longer
the primary means of long-distance communications among Chinese, a
recent survey released here suggests.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in 14 Chinese major cities revealed that
those responding said they seldom contact family and friends by
letters or telegraph these days, but instead head for the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted at the end of last year by the Beijing-
based China Mainland Marketing Research Company, found that 94.2
percent of these residents in these cities use telephones now,
compared with 29 percent who still write letters.
</P>
<P>
Pagers and e-mail have also become important ways to
communicate, accounting for 18.3 percent and 6.3 percent of the
respondents, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey was conducted among 6,400 people
representing a total of 40 million in the cities of Beijing,
Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Ji'nan,
Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Lanzhou.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Cameroon Tied 1-1 In African Cup Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana scored the equalizer in the
second half for a 1-1 draw with Cameroon in the opener of the
African Cup of Nations, much to the relief of the home fans at the
National Stadium in Accra on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian spectators were upset greatly, when the Ghanaian
team was drawn blood first 19 minutes after opening of the group A
match by Marc Foe of the Cameroon team.
</P>
<P>
But the Ghanaian stars filled up their loopholes in their
defense quickly at the beginning of the second half, and started
merciless carpet bombings in front of their opponents' gate, which
culminated in a successful long-distance shoot by Kwame Ayew.
</P>
<P>
The score brought the excitement of the home fans back to the
stadium, which in return helped the Ghanaian players launch
relentlessly attacks from all angles to the dismay of the Cameroon
players, who could only managed to hold on till the final whistle
much to their relief.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, colorful displays marked the opening ceremony of the
finals of the 22nd edition of the African Cup of Nations on
Saturday in Accra in the presence of the chairman of the African
Football Confederation Issa Hayatou of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
Hayatou, re-elected Thursday to head the African soccer
governing body for a fourth four-year term in office, was with
FIFA President Joseph Blatter at the capacity stadium.
</P>
<P>
The spectators appreciated the Ghanaian traditional dancers who
performed well while waiting for the game.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the biennial tournament's history that
this year's event was jointly hosted by Ghana and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Accra-based Group A also includes Cote d'Ivoire and Togo
who will play on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Kumasi, west of Ghana, the Group B is made up of South
Africa, Algeria, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
South Africa will play with Gabon on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Forces Britain to Delay Pinochet Ruling: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A final British ruling on the
fate of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet has been delayed
after last-minute objections by the Belgian government,a Reuters
report said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely not going back home on Tuesday," the report
quoted "source close to the Belgian Foreign Ministry" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian ministry had won extra time in its bid to persuade
British Home Secretary Jack Straw not to let the 84-year-old
general return home and escape trial on torture charges in Spain,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Belgium wanted a new medical investigation on an objective and
independently verifiable basis and told Straw that Belgium would
go to court if he didn't accede to that request.
</P>
<P>
The Pinochet case appeared to be nearing its conclusion when
Straw said last week he was "minded" to release Pinochet after
British doctors declared him medically unfit to be extradited to
Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian foreign minister had raised concerns about the
report.
</P>
<P>
Belgium wanted a new investigation with one of their own
doctors present, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Straw has refused to release details of Pinochet's examination,
which was carried out by four doctors at a hospital near London on
January 5, on the grounds of patient-doctor confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the British Medical Association said the report
could in fact be made public.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Defense Ministry Denies Funding Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Defense Ministry on
Sunday played down newspaper reports that British armed forces
were being crippled by a lack of resources and said they were
ready to jump into action at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
"The point is we're capable of meeting our operational
requirements," a Reuters report quoted a ministry spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on reports that a lack of fuel had
forced the Royal Navy to confine most of its warships to port and
that two out of every three Royal Air Force (RAF)Tornado bombers
were grounded.
</P>
<P>
"It's true to say we have to live within our budget and that is
clearly a challenge, but we are meeting that challenge," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Media reports on Sunday came amid growing fears that Britain's
defense forces were being stretched to the limit by their role as
peacekeepers in hotspots around the world.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied that the armed services were unable to
cope with their transition to rapid reaction forces.
</P>
<P>
"We've shown over the last year that we're fully capable of
meeting requirements, whether in Kosovo or East Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that the ministry was taking measures to
counter a shortage of pilots, including restructuring pay and
assisting pilots in finding a second career in return for a
commitment to staying longer with the RAF.

<HEADLINE> Reagan's Condition "Not So Good", Daughter Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Reagan
's daughter Maureen Reagan said her father's condition "is not so
good".
</P>
<P>
Her father cannot speak coherently and can no longer join her
in working simple jigsaw puzzles, because his motor skills are
failing, Maureen recently wrote in an essay in Newsweek magazine.
Reagan has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
Maureen said she and her father began doing the puzzles, which
were mainly of animal scenes, shortly after the diagnosis more
than five years ago that he had incurable brain disease.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Republicans March to Honor IRA Guerrilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
Sunday gave an endorsement of the Irish Republican Army
objectives and policies at a massive republican rally in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at an open air memorial ceremony for IRA man
Tom Williams who was hanged for shooting a policeman in 1942 and
was reburied this week.
</P>
<P>
His address came amid rising pressure from Ulster Unionists for
the IRA to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Commission on Decommissioning is due to report
by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister and Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble said on Sunday he would either resign and force the
collapse of the Northern Ireland executive or ask London to
suspend the Good Friday institutions if IRA decommissioning had
not started by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
But Adams did not call on the IRA to start handing over arms.
Instead he paid tribute to the sacrifice made by IRA volunteers
and political republicans.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader joined thousands at the largest republican
rally for many years to Milltown cemetery in west Belfast where
Williams was reburied on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 19, was hanged in 1942 and buried in Crumlin Road
Court House Prison in north Belfast after he was convicted of
involvement in the murder of a policeman.

<HEADLINE> UK Denies Plan for Sinn Fein Offices Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Sunday
denied it had dropped a proposal to give parliamentary offices in
London to Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish Republican
Army, saying no decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
Senior Ulster Unionists, members of the largest Protestant
party in British-ruled Northern Ireland, told the BBC that the
British government had decided against a plan for a Sinn Fein
office at the British parliament in Westminster.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Britain's Northern Ireland Office said the
government was still looking at the question -- although it added
that ultimately it was for parliament to decide.
</P>
<P>
But it added that Peter Mandelson, secretary of state for
Northern Ireland, "remains committed to the principle of access
for Sinn Fein".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, recently
appointed to the province's power-sharing executive, are both
elected members of Britain's parliament.
</P>
<P>
But because the Irish republicans refuse to take an oath of
allegiance to Queen Elizabeth, they have never been allowed to sit
in the House of Commons or use parliament's facilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mandelson wrote to leaders of Northern
Ireland's political parties to gather their views on whether Sinn
Fein could have access to British parliamentary facilities even if
its deputies did not take their seats.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson was suggesting that Sinn Fein could have access to
offices, phone lines and the like and the expenses that every MP
is entitled to, which officials say amount to about 50,000 pounds(
83,000 U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
His move was widely seen as a bid to encourage the IRA to start
handing in the weapons it used to wage a 30-year guerrilla
campaign against British rule -- still the key issue in efforts to
build a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> France Telecom Makes Inroad Into Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- French Telecom, in collaboration
with the Arab Bank, agreed Sunday to buy a 40 percent stake in the
state-run Jordanian Telecom Company (JTC), marking a major step by
the French giant in its way into the fledgling market of the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
At a brief ceremony in Amman, French Telecom and Arab Bank
signed a partnership agreement with the JTC on the acquisition of
the shares which are valued at 508 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Bank, the largest financial institution in Jordan,
bought about 12 percent of the shares valued at some 51 million
dollars while the French Telecom took the lion`s share.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the signing ceremony, Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh stressed his government's keeness to develop
the telecommunications sector in the kingdom to cope with the high-
tech development in the world.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the cooperation between the JTC, the Arab Bank and
the French Telecom, and stressed that his government hoped to build
a strong platform in the telecommunications sector in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
For his part, French Telecom Board Chairman Michael Boon praised
the development of the telecommunications system in the kingdom,
and said his company would provide support for its further
development when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The deal was the largest in the privatization drive in the
kingdom after talks with the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been under pressure from the major international
lending organizations and its creditor countries to privatize its
non-profitable state enterprises to improve the economic
performance of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1999, the French firm La Farge bought 33.3 million
shares of the state-owned Jordan Cement, marking a start of the
privatization drive.
</P>
<P>
Other targets for the privatization campaign are the national
flag carrier Royal Jordanian and the railway system in the southern
harbor city of Aqaba.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ocean Rim Association to Emerge As Major Economic Bloc: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Ocean Rim
Association for Regional Cooperation has the potential to emerge as
a major economic bloc for its member states enjoy rich resources of
energy and raw materials, and a promising market, a senior Omani
official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean rim region traverses three continents, namely
Africa, Asia and Australia, which means the association is a major
bloc, Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The population density of the vast region also ensures a large
promising market, he told a press conference in Muscat at the end
of a two-day extraordinary ministerial conference of the
association.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "successful", Yousef said that the
organization would play a more and more significant role in world
trade and economic activities as long as its members provide
necessary facilities and try to enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting approved a number of organizational-structure-
related matters, including the headquarters agreement, rules and
regulations governing the association and the association's
criteria for membership.
</P>
<P>
It also called for member countries to work "seriously and
patiently" to fully exploit their abundant natural resources and
special advantages for the prosperity of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and other senior officials from the 15 member
countries, namely Oman, India, Australia, Kenya, South Africa,
Singapore, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Tanzania, Yemen, Madagascar,
Malaysia, Bangladesh, Mozambique, Iran, the United Arab Emirates,
Seychelles, Thailand and Mauritius attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Japan were also represented at the meeting as dialog
partners.
</P>
<P>
The organization was founded in 1995 with the aim of improving
trade links and promoting investment in the Indian Ocean region.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames "Foreign Enemies" for Serial Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian military judicial
official on Sunday blamed foreign enemies for the serial political
killings of Iranian opposition leaders and dissident writers in
1998.
</P>
<P>
It has been proved that those involved in the murders "were
linked with foreign enemies", head of the Judicial Organization of
the Iranian Armed Forces Mohammad Niazi told officials of the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known which country, or countries he was
referring to, but he said those involved in the killings had
nothing to do with political factions as was previously speculated.
</P>
<P>
Niazi said that some others involved in the killing are still at
large, and that first hand information about the serial political
killings will be announced soon, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Darius Forouhar, leader of the Iran Nation Party and his wife
were stabbed to death at home while at least three dissident
writers were mysteriously murdered in Tehran in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry has admitted that some of its own
agents were involved in the killings. This shocked the whole
society and forced then Intelligence Minister Qobanali Dorri
Najafabadi to resign.
</P>
<P>
Then Deputy Intelligence Minister for Political and Security
Affairs Saeed Emami was believed to be the mastermind behind the
political killings. But Emami committed suicide in prison last June
by taking in depilatory substance while taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
Niazi announced earlier last year to broadcast the video on the
confessions of those involved in the killings, but the airing was
stopped by a four-member special committee formed by President
Mohammad Khatami on behalf of the Supreme National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for preventing the video from being made
public.
</P>
<P>
Niazi said that had the chain murders plot not been discovered,
the Islamic Republic system would have faced serious problems. The
continuation of the group's sabotage could eventually led to the
destruction of the Islamic Republic, the official said, without
elaborating.
