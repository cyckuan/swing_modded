<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Candidate of the ruling
Pakistan Muslim League (N), Senator Rafiq Tarar, swept Wednesday's
presidential election and was elected the ninth head of state of
Pakistan as expected.
</P>
<P>
Tarar, a 68-year-old former judge, bagged a lion's share of 374
votes out of the calculated votes of 457, in Wednesday's
presidential polls while former defense minister Shahban Mirani,
nominee of the major opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP),
managed to get a humble 58.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan's presidential election rules, the total
electoral college votes are 476, including 87 Senators, 217
members of the National Assembly and 43 votes of each of the four
Provincial Assemblies.
</P>
<P>
And whosoever secures 51 percent of all 476 electoral college
votes, or 239 votes, will be declared next President of this south
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The President-elect will take oath of his office Thursday
morning at a ceremony to be administered by Chief Justice Ajmal
Mian. It is the first time that Pakistan has elected a former
judge of the Supreme Court as its president.
</P>
<P>
The just concluded presidential polls were taking place as a
result of the resignation of President Farooq Leghari early this
month at the climax of a worst ever constitutional crisis
involving the government and the judiciary. Leghari had refused to
sign a reference against the then Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as
required by the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Tarar's nomination as the official candidate by the ruling
PML-N and its allied parties, had come as a surprise to all, as
his name was not among those who were tipped to occupy the
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Tarar, who hails from a relatively humble origin, is noted for
his legal scholarship, honesty and devotion to justice.
</P>
<P>
Tarar, who was born on November 2, 1929, got his law degree
from Punjab University Law College in 1951 and started his legal
practice.
</P>
<P>
He was elevated to the Supreme Court in January 1991, and was
part of the 11-member bench which restored the first government
led by Prime Minister Sharif in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Tarar, who is married with one daughter and two sons, retired
in October 1994 and was elected as a Senator on a ticket of a
Pakistan Muslim League (N) in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The nomination papers of the PML-N candidate were first
rejected by the Election Commission for his alleged remarks
ridiculing the judiciary. Yet he has his name cleared from the
Lahore High Court which Tuesday allowed him to contest the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still uncertain whether Tarar will hold the
office he wins as the order of former acting chief election
commissioner Mukhtar Ahmad Junejo to disqualify Tarar's
candidature remains suspended in the Lahore High Court.

<HEADLINE> AL Launches Arab Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
announced the implementation of the Arab free trade zone from
January 1, 1998, a prelude to an Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid told a press conference
here that "a new era for the Arab nation" has begun, asserting
that the implementation of the zone is the foundation stone of
realizing the dream of Arab economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that Arab countries will enter the 21st century
as one economic bloc, beginning with setting up the free trade
zone to ensure the flow of Arab goods without restrictions,
customs or other fees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab free trade zone is expected to herald an Arab common
market over 10 years with the liberalization of tariffs in the
Arab world. The accumulative Arab GDP is no more than 529 billion
U.S. dollars and inter-Arab trade accounts for merely 8 percent of
Arabs' trade with the world.
</P>
<P>
Customs between members will be cut 10 percent a year in the
coming decade and will be eliminated by the end of 2007 when the
Arab common market comes into being, said Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
He voiced conviction that the Arab market will find a place
among other great economic groups.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an Arab common market was first floated in the
1950s and a June 1996 Arab summit called for free trade zone be
established by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The prospective market is expected to group 18 members of the
22-member Arab League, namely Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Change Position Towards Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today called on neighboring Turkey to change its
stance towards Greece.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, Tsohatzopoulos stressed that
aggressiveness did not help Turkey's relations with the European
Union (EU), and Turkey should give serious consideration to the
problems noted by the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if Turkey realised this in the future, it
would greatly help to improve the current climate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the EU decided not to include Turkey on the
list of nations waiting to join the bloc, on the grounds of
Turkey's "poor human rights and bad relations with Greece."
</P>
<P>
After that, Turkey announced the suspension of its political
dialogue with the EU and increased its pressure upon Greece.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two neighboring countries intensified
recently with the mutual expulsion of diplomats and violations of
Greek airspace by Turkish jet fighters.

<HEADLINE> CBI Warns Strong Pound Spoils Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) - A plea for a drop in the value
of the pound to help exporters was urged today by Colin Marshall,
president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
In his new year message to CBI members, Marshall said: "a lower
and more sustainable exchange rate would be the best present
Britain's exporters could have going into 1998."
</P>
<P>
"Despite good news in many areas of the economy, the strength
of sterling has had a dramatic effect on many firms trying to win
overseas order," he added.
</P>
<P>
The plea was echoed by the Institute of Export which predicts
that many firms will have to reduce exports in 1998 because the
level of sterling is crippling profits.
</P>
<P>
In European export markets, such as Germany and France, the
price of sterling has risen dramatically in 18 months - up by over
25 percent in the year-and-a-half to November against the mark and
the franc.
</P>
<P>
Marshall argued that a lower level for sterling would have a
positive effect on the economy and build on domestic growth. The
25 percent appreciation in the pound had produced a loss of
confidence as well as business, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export, said
that companies would not be able to continue to maintain the low
prices and margin squeezes that they had experienced this year.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are getting very concerned that interest rates are
remaining high and therefore continuing to keep sterling high."
</P>
<P>
Campbell also said that prospects for exporters in 1998 would
be further damaged by the financial crisis in South-East Asian
markets.

being the top priority.

The budget, totalling 1,445 billion riel (about 419 billion
U.S. dollars), is about five percent lower that of this year due
to the decrease of international aid.

Defense spending, which is about 20 percent of the budget, is

<HEADLINE> Salim Calls for Stepping up Economic Recovery in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today appealed to Africans to accelerate economic recovery and
development in their continent.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message issued here, Salim said: "One of the
ways of building peace in our continent is through the
acceleration of Africa's economic recovery and development and
full integration into the global economy."
</P>
<P>
Salim stressed that Africa must no longer be left behind in
the global attempt to promote trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inaugural summit of the African Economic
Community held in Harare last June signaled the determination by
Africa to take its destiny in its own hands and assume greater
responsibility for the economic development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim hoped that Africans will work for the integration of
their respective economies to pull together to boost trade and
their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all those in leadership positions, especially
in those societies where innocent young men, women and the
elderly have been traumatized by the scourge of war and conflict,
"to take advantage of the blessings that come with the new year
to observe a truce, cease all hostilities and allow the efforts
towards peace and reconciliation to yield the required
dividends".
</P>
<P>
Salim stressed that the struggle for peace, security and
stability of our continent is " the responsibility of each and
every one of us whatever his or her position is and wherever he
or she is".

<HEADLINE> Feature: HK People Celebrate New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- John Hall, an engineer who
came to Hong Kong two months ago, joined thousands of Hong Kong
people Wednesday evening in celebrating the first new year after
the handover at Victoria Park, Causeway Bay, where a family fun
carnival was being staged.
</P>
<P>
"We have just arrived. We enjoy the performance," he said,
pulling his wife in his arms. The couple were pushing to a stage
for a better look at an ongoing peacock dance.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of seats under the temporary stage were already packed
with people, with more standing behind the railing or watching a
big screen live televising the performance.
</P>
<P>
Programs started at 8:30 PM (0:30 PM GMT) Wednesday, but people
were pouring in about an hour earlier for the traditional carnival
ushering in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Provisional Urban Council (PUC), the New
Year's Eve Family Fun Carnival is Hong Kong's largest outdoor
party providing four hours of non-stop entertainment for all age
groups.
</P>
<P>
The six football pitches of the park were decorated as a
spectacular carnival, with glamorous setting including the music
stage, dance and fringe stage, big top disco, nostalgic ballroom
dance tent and the children's fun corner.
</P>
<P>
At the music stage, the China Armed Police Blue Band from
Beijing were playing jazz music. The uniformed band plays the
national anthem in the national flag raising ceremony at
Tian'anmen Square. Their maiden show in Hong Kong won warm
applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
The dance and fringe stage features the incredible performance
by the great American magician and comedian Peter Gross, country
and western dance by Joseph and Mark, also from the United States,
as well as the "Beyond 1997" showcase featuring Chinese dance,
ballet, cha-cha and modern dance by the City Contemporary Dance
Company, a local troupe.
</P>
<P>
Young people were clustering in the disco where DJs were
offering hit music and exciting games.
</P>
<P>
Winding queue appeared at the children's fun corner. Not only
kids and parents but also those young at heart would like to share
the fun with pop songs stars and mime artists and participate in
the various workshops.
</P>
<P>
There were also clowns, jugglers, stilt walks, puppeteers,
balloon-twisters roving around to filling every corner with
laughter and happiness.
</P>
<P>
According to police source, the carnival attracted some 30,000
people shortly after it started. They expected more to show up
when the countdown to the new year approached.
</P>
<P>
Beside the Victoria Park where the carnival was held for the
fifth year in a row, other popular venue for welcoming the new
year include the Times Square, a shopping mall in Causeway Bay,
the pub district Lan Kwi Fong, and Tsim Sha Tsui on the southern
tip of the Kowloon Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Under a huge TV screen on the outer wall of the Times Square,
the fifth annual New Year's Eve Apple Countdown was held. Jubilant
people filled in the nearby streets where special traffic
arrangements were made to facilitate the celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
When the clock clicked from 1997 to 1998, 15 apple light bulbs
light up one by one. People joined the countdown of the last
seconds of the old year and burst into deafening cheers when 1998
appeared right on the screen.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people, in this way, said good-bye to 1997 and
ushered in a more prosperous new year.
</P>
<P>
Just as what John Hall said in the park, "it's my first time
working abroad and I hope I can do a good job and have a nice time
here in Hong Kong." He will work a few years here.
</P>
<P>
A shy boy caught by TV camera told of his wish, that is,
"making better in the new year."

<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Current Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe today praised countries and organizations involved
in the peace process for their efforts leading to the signing of
reconciliation agreements between major warring groups in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said in a statement that he hoped agreements reached
after meetings in Cairo, Egypt, from November 12 to December 22,
would contribute to peace and reconciliation in war-torn Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to thank all countries, regional and international
organizations that have played a part in this process and urge
them to continue to render assistance to the process of national
reconciliation and transition to peace and stability as
necessary," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Mugage said he was grateful for the communication sent to him
jointly by Hussein Aidid and Osman Ali Mahdi Mohammed who
co-chaired the Cairo meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two are Somalia's key warlords who have fought a bitter
civil war for years.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe noted that the decisions taken provided for the
establishment of a central authority within a federal system of
governance, an independent judiciary, a transitional government
and the convening of a national reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that these and other agreements reached at the meeting
contribute to the prospect for peace, stability and
reconciliation in Somalia," he said.

LUANDA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Prime Minister Franca
Van-Dunem said here today that considerable progress has been
made in the country's peace process in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is no denying the fact that peace has
become reality in Angola which saw in the past year free flow of
people and goods nationwide and reunion of families broken by the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace is still fragile, he noted, adding that to
consolidate peace in the war-torn country is one of the
government's top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faustino Muteka, the Angolan Minister of
Territorial Administration, stressed that the re-establishment of
local governments in the areas under the control of the
opposition UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola) is an important task in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that positive progress has been made in the work in
1997. Local agovernments have been re-set up in 233 regions
controlled by the UNITA, including one provincial capital, 56
cities and 176 towns, he added.
</P>
<P>
Muteka revealed in the coming year of 1998, local governments
will also be re-established in the remaining 114 regions occupied
by the UNITA.

<HEADLINE> UK Casts Doubt on Kenya's Election Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain Wednesday expressed
concern over the widespread reports of confusions and chaos during
Kenya's general elections and questioned the credibility of the
polls.
</P>
<P>
Tony Lloyd, junior foreign office minister, said in a statement
that "I share the widespread concern at the confusion and delays
that have accompanied the election process in Kenya, and deeply
regret the deaths and outbreaks of violence over the last few
days".
</P>
<P>
He noted that reports of irregularities in the general
elections taking place on December 29 and 30 had raised question
marks over the efficiency and credibility of the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain will not make a final assessment as to whether
the elections had been free and fair before reports from
independent election observers come out.
</P>
<P>
"Britain has helped to finance a large number of independent
election observers. We shall study their reports closely before
making a final assessment as to whether the will of the Kenyan
people has been genuinely reflected in the outcome," Lloyd added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were great confusions and chaos
during the elections because of ballot paper mix-up, unauthorized
movement of ballot boxes, violence, bribery and vote-buying by
political parties and the election was extended for a further 24
hours due to the confusions.

<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today rewarded teachers and other education workers in the
traditional honors bestowed by the Queen in the New year.
</P>
<P>
For the first time there were three knighthoods for
headteachers in state schools, and 55 awards for others involved
in education.
</P>
<P>
"There are few more important jobs than teaching. it is for
many a vocation," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of this year's awards went to ordinary members of
the public, instead of famous people, reflecting Blair's pledge to
make the honors system less political.
</P>
<P>
The singer Elton John, who sang Candle in the Wind at Diana's
funeral, received a knighthood, as does actor Michael Gambon and
former England footballer Tom Finney.
</P>
<P>
The former Conservative party chairman and final Governor of
Hong Kong, Chris Patten, became a Companion of Honor. The former
Bishop of Liverpool and England batsman, David Sheppard, was made
a life peer.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the awards came as a result of
recommendations made by the local community. There were also a
host of honors for citizens of Commonwealth countries.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean Government on Somali Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government
has said that the recent Cairo negotiation between Somali faction
leaders ''has not brought about the desired consolidation of the
process of building consensus and reconciliation among the key
somali protagonists''.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a statement issued by the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry on Tuesday in Asmara, capital of the state of
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government in the statement reiterated its three
views regarding efforts aimed at promoting peace and
reconcilitation in Somalia:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, any endeavour must take into account the complexity
and sensitivity of the Somali crisis;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the endeavours that result in the exclusion of one
part or another, or that appear to tip the delicate balance in
favour of one faction at the perceived expense of the other, will
not succeed in bringing about the desired peace and
reconciliation;
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the problem in Somalia can only be resolved by the
Somali people themselves, so no international or sub-regional
initiative can serve as a substitute to this fundamental
requirement.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on Somalis to show the necessary courage
and wisdom to bring its tragedy to an end. The Eritrean
governmenmt expressed readiness "to contribute to the
reconciliation process together with its partners in the
region'', it added.
</P>
<P>
After almost six weeks of negotiations in Cairo, Somali
faction leaders, including the two big factions of Hussein
Mohammed Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohammed, agreed last week on
measures to end seven years of fragmentation udner rival
warlords. The agreement provides for the formation of a
presidential council, a provisional government and a constituent
assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano, in a new year message today, called on his people to
make their own contributions to ensure success of the country's
1998 social and economic plan.
</P>
<P>
In the message, he said the government will step up the
control of inflation, reduce the economy's dependence on external
donors and promote efficiency and modernization of the banking
sector in the coming new year.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government will adopt a loan policy which
will not neglect small loans to enable the national economy to
achieve a sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the economic growth should reach some
9.5 percent in 1998, up from 6.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
For this goal, the government will continue to encourage
foreign investment in Mozambique, support domestic enterprises
and improve economic growth mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the government will make efforts to
safeguard public order and social safety, reduce unemployment and
eliminate unequality between men and women.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides of
Cyprus today called for unity of the nation in 1998 to resolve the
protracted Cyprus problem and become a member of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In his new year message broadcast nationwide this evening,
Clerides said he hoped "that 1998 will pave the way for a
settlement of the Cyprus problem and our accession to the EU."
</P>
<P>
He expected that new initiatives for a settlement of the Cyprus
issue will be taken after the presidential election next
February in the Greek Cypriot-controlled southern part of the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
over the northern third to protect Turkish minorities in the wake
a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president warned against "wrong moves" on the part
of Greek Cypriots which he said may cost the country the EU
membership and leave it in the continuing state of division.
</P>
<P>
The EU has decided to begin accession talks with Cyprus early
next year despite strong opposition from Turkey and the Turkish
Cypriots in the island.
</P>
<P>
"We all want to safeguard the future of Cypriot Hellenism in
the land of our fathers and we must all help to achieve these
goals," Clerides stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at Turkey for "the bitter and painful
memories of the Turkish invasion and the continuing occupation of
one third of cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said "justice for Cyprus means conditions of permanent peace
and security, progress and prosperity in the Federal Republic of
Cyprus, which will be a member of the great European family."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island in a bizonal, bicommunal
federation, but so far little tangible progress has been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Processing Industry Records 74 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Angola's processing industry
recorded a growth of 74 percent in the first 11 months of this
year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The metal processing grew by 234 percent, the highest in the
whole processing industry, followed by papermaking with a growth
of 122 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The food processing industry saw a growth by 111 percent,
consumer electronics 67 percent, and the beverage sector 66
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed the brisk growth in the processing industry
to the government's efforts in stablizing the
macro-economy in the past three years since the end of the civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts in attracting private and foreign
investment has been paid off. Since 1990, the authorities have
approved 296 foreign investment projects, with contracted
investment totaling 700 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, the authorities received 25 pieces of foreign
investment applications, while more overseas businesses are still
coming.
</P>
<P>
It, however, takes Angola many more years to completely
rebuild its industry sector ruined by two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country's industrial
capacity utilization was only 35 percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 1998, the Angolan government is expected to take
more measures in encouraging the development of the private
sector, which will make up the loss in the state-owned
department.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage the development of
import-replacing industries so as to save the precious fund for
the recovery of demostic production, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Orders to Trasfer Prisoned Kaunda to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba here today signed a presidential order to tranfer
</P>
<P>
At a news conferrence held this morning in the State House,
Chiluba signed the order with immediate effect to transfer Kaunda
from Mukobeko Maximum Prison in Kabwe, 120 kilometers north of
the capital to house arrest in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"Kaunda will be under the police care in his Kalundu residence
and no political activities are allowed there until all the
police investigations (into the abortive military coup last
October) are over," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he made this decision in consideration of
the former president's old age and the approaches made by some
leaders, namely former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, and
Zimbabwean President and Chairman of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that Zambia is an independent country and it is
not subjective to external pressures.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda is not the nation and the nation is not Kaunda, said
Chiluba, adding that "no one is above the law."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noticed that Chiluba's presidential order came
one day after Nyerere's two-day visit to Lusaka. Nyerere paid his
personal suprise visit on Monday and had a meeting with Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Nerere was entrusted by several
southern African leaders, including Nelson Mandela of South
Africa and Mugabe with a mission to press for Kaunda's immediate
release.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 73, also leader of Zambia's biggest opposition party,
the United National Independence Party, was detained on 25
December for alleged connections with the country's abotive
military last October which aimmed to overthrow Chiluba's
government.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 91 people, mostly soldiers, are detained on
presidential orders under the state of emergency declared by
Chiluba following the foiled coup.

LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all ended the final session of this year on a firm note, with big
gains over the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The London stock market opened for only four hours today, but
closed modestly higher on the last trading day of 1997, with the
FTSE 100 index up 3.2 points at 5,135.5, a rise of 24.7 percent on

It was reported that Wall Street's hesitant start today and US
financier George Soros' warning that the international financial
system was suffering a systemic breakdown failed to dampen
European traders' high spirits.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that financial stocks fared well amid end-of-year
press tips and bid speculation.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares ended the year 23.44 points or 0.79

<HEADLINE> Head of Nigeria's Coup Panel Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Major-General Chris Garuba has
been named chairman of the special investigation board set up by
the government to determine the role of the persons being held in
connection with the December 21 foiled coup plot.
</P>
<P>
Garuba is an officer from Nigeria's War College, the Defense
Headquarters announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to Rear Admiral Festus Porbeni, chief of defense
administration, the board, whose other members have not been
disclosed, has been divided into two to enable it to cover all
facets of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
About 15 officers have been drawn from the army, navy, air
force, police and the state security services to probe the cases
of the 12 coup suspects, including Chief of General Staff
Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations were completed before the
establishment of the special board was announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, electronic documentary materials about the
botched coup attempt have been shown to the provisional ruling
council which is the highest policy making body, the cabinet,
state administrators and a group of traditional rulers.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to be exhibited before the country's leaders
of thought and media executives.
</P>
<P>
Although investigation is going on, Porbeni said the suspects
would be allowed to have legal representatives. However, the
lawyers must come from the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
According to him, more people have been arrested in connection
with the coup bid but the government would not disclose their
names because it did not want to stigmatize those who might be
found innocent.
</P>
<P>
The defense headquarters has said the special investigation
board will have one month to finish their job.

</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued at the end of a five-day Women
Parliament Members Forum held in Ardaita of Oromo region, the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Changeable Political Climate in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba announced here today that detained former President
Kenneth Kaunda will be released but kept under house arrest in
his home in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said Kaunda will be restricted to his house in Lusaka under
tight security and will not be allowed to carry out political
activities until his case is determined by the courts of law.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba warned that the police will not hesitate to take him
back to prison if he does not abide by the conditions and police
orders.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement one day after former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere's surprise visit to Zambia, during which
he held talks with Chiluba and met with Kaunda in Mukobeko
maximum prison in the central city of Kabwe, 150 kilometers north
of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper of Zambia Monday quoted diplomatic sources
as saying that southern African presidents approached Nyerere to
intercede with the Zambian government in order to secure the
release from detention of Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was reported to be spearheaded by South African
President Nelson Mandela in consultation with Ketumile Masire of
Botswana, Joachim Chissano of Mozambique, Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested last Thursday allegedly in connection with
the October 28 abortive coup. He returned home last Monday after
a Marathon overseas trip, which took him to India, South Africa,
Zimbabwe, the United States and Britain among other countries.
</P>
<P>
He went abroad on the eve of the coup to*seek international
pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
After the abortive coup there were rumors that Kaunda would
not come back and instead would seek asylum abroad. He denied the
speculation and returned home last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some southern African countries like South Africa and others
in other part of the world expressed their concern and urged the
government to release Kaunda or he be charged.
</P>
<P>
After the arrest of Kaunda his United National Independence
Party (UNIP) and many others pulled out of the proposed
inter-party dialogue due to be held early next month.
</P>
<P>
After Zambia gained its independence in 1964 Kaunda had been
in power for successive 27 years until 1991, when he lost to
current president Chiluba in the country's first multi-party
elections.
</P>
<P>
After his defeat Kaunda resigned from politics. However, it
was not long before he returned to the political stage in 1994
and tried to regain power.
</P>
<P>
At the election year of 1996, Zambian parliament passed a
constitution amendment bill, which bars Kaunda from running for
the presidency because of his foreign parenthood.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and some opposition parties spared no efforts to
remove the amendment but failed in the end. In protest against
the bill the UNIP boycotted the elections.
</P>
<P>
After elections the opposition parties have been continuing
their campaigns demanding an interim government and a fresh poll.
</P>
<P>
Through international mediation the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and opposition parties agreed to hold
inter-party dialogue in July of 1997. But the planned dialogue
didn't materialized because of the opposition parties' demands
that the repeal of the constitution amendment, formation of the
interim government and a new election be included in the agenda
of the dialogue and the government's categorical rejection.
</P>
<P>
After the dialogue was plunged into deadlock a number of
incidents happened. In mid August mysterious fires gutted cabinet
office and swallowed vendors' stalls in Lusaka, on August 23
Kaunda suffered a gunshot wound on the head in a police
clamp-down on a abortive opposition rally in Kabwe and on October
28 the coup attempt occurred.
</P>
<P>
The political situation improved early December with 31
parties working out at a preliminary meeting an agenda for the
inter-party dialogue. The agenda includes most contentious issues
like constitution, electoral process and voters' register and
fresh registration.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary meeting was hailed as a good start for a
breakthrough of the political stalemate and the achievement of
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
As presidents of the parties are going to participate in the
inter-party dialogue Kaunda was arrested. In protest against the
arrest many parties announced their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Now the government has made a compromise by transferring
Kaunda from prison to under house arrest. People doubt whether
the opposition parties will buy the move? The political
situation in the country now is at a crossroad.

LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of air passengers in
Nigeria's 20 airports dropped from 2.3 million last year to 1.73
million this year, the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria
(FAAN) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a FAAN report, the fall follows the pattern of
passenger traffic in the country since 1983 when a total of 6.05
million passengers travelled by air.
</P>
<P>
It shows that 5.19 million passengers used the airports in
1982 while in 1984 passenger traffic was 5.98 million.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1987 and 1988, 5.79 million and 3.95
million passengers were recorded respectively, while in 1990 the
figure dropped to 3.76 million.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5.06 million passengers used the facilities in
1991, and the number of air passengers increased to 5.47 million
and 5.51 million in 1992 and 1993 respectively, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The figure was down to 4.54 million in 1994 and went up
slightly to 4.86 million, the News Agency of Nigeria quoted the
report as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
Baghdad, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq again expressed its
strong condemnation today of Turkish troop invasion of its
territory and called for its immediate withdrawal from northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The denouncement was uttered by a Foreign Ministry spokesman in
response to Turkey's announced termination of the latest Turkish
cross-border military operation in northern Iraq Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the announced termination of Turkish
military operation in northern Iraq which began December 25 was in
fact a recurrence of what Turkey used to say in the wake of its
continuing invasions.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have been engaged in frequent operations in
northern Iraq to wipe out the militants of its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party since 1995 when Baghdad lost effective control over
the area.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that once again Turkey used this ploy
to justify its practices, namely, the pursuit of rebel elements
hostile to the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out such statements were nothing but attempts to
mislead the Turkish public opinion, and to contain worldwide
condemnation of Turkey's aggressive policies.

very alarming and a remedy should be found."
</P>
<P>
The junta has been under economic sanctions and embargo
imposed by west African countries and the United Nations not long
after it seized power in a coup on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
Fuel and petroleum products are in the list of embargoed
goods, along with arms and other military equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, fuel supplies have virtually dried
up and prices have sky-rocketed since the coup.
</P>
<P>
Petrol is now only available on the black market at 12 U.S.
Dollars a gallon, instead of the official price of three Dollars,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Diesel, he said, which is used by the majority of passenger
vehicles, has almost disappeared from the open market and now
sells at 10 Dollars a gallon, five times the official price.
</P>
<P>
"It could be disastrous if the prices are not checked," warned
Bottor, adding that many fuel products are contaminated with a
mixture of jet fuel and soft drinks to give it a reddish color.

<P>
PARIS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-eight civilians were
massacred from Tuesday night till this morning in western Algeria
by Islamic militants, on the eve of the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan which began today, according to reports from Algeria
quoting Algerian security force.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one people were killed and 20 injured in one attack by

<HEADLINE> Iraq Holds US Responsible for Delayed Food Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq rejected U.S. allegations
that Baghdad caused delay in delivering milk powder for children,
instead blamed the U.S. for the miserable situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the U.S. charges
were groundless as Baghdad has always followed the measures of the U.N.
Sanctions Committee in implementing the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
He urged foreign companies having contracts with Baghdad to
adhere to the U.N. measures so as to secure early delivery of
commodities to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The contracts between Iraq and foreign companies always took
weeks before being approved because British and U.S. experts
adopted a selective policy toward them and laid down all possible
obstacles to hinder transactions, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the U.S. delegate to the U.N. committee
exacerbated the delay with objections that have nothing to do with
purchase, sale and distribution of goods, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Many contracts have been delayed or revoked during the first
and second phases of the oil-for-food deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deal between Iraq and the U.N., which came into effect a
year ago, allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said all these show how hostile the U.S.
administration has been toward Iraq and its people, accusing
Washington of harboring malicious political purposes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was "using all illegal means of lying and cheating to
justify the heinous crimes against Iraqi people," he said,
asserting that all such policies would surely fail.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Political Party Announces Its Formation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A party named Iranian People's
Freedom Party today declared its existence, a challenging
political move to the Islamic rule which has been banning any
political parties in the country for years.
</P>
<P>
The party announced in a statement that its main objectives
were to safeguard freedom of expression, individual and social
security, equal social rights, to eliminate racial, religious,
cultural, language discriminations, to create peaceful atmosphere
for all Iranian tribes.
</P>
<P>
The party would also make efforts to reform the country's
economic structure and look into the needs of the young generation
and the legal demands of millions of Iranians living abroad.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Iranian People's Freedom Party was
demanding legal approval from the authorities, adding that after
being approved, it would make public its detailed goals and
objectives.
</P>
<P>
The party expressed regret for the absence of political parties
in Iran, because of which the traditional religious groups had
played an active role in Iran's politics, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The party called for the establishment of political parties
with clear objectives under the situations after Khatami came to
power last August.
</P>
<P>
Since Khatami was elected Iran's president, moderate Iranians,
including intellectuals, women, young people, began to consider
forming their own political parties.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of former Iranian
president and incumbent Chairman of the powerful Expediency
Council Hashemi Rafsanjani, announced that the moderate Group-6
have decided to form a political party in the near future.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- In China's sprawling territory,
people celebrated New Year's Day in merry and diverse ways.
</P>
<P>
In early morning in the Chinese capital, more than 40,000
people from all walks of life braved a chilly winter breeze to
watch the hoisting of the national flag at Tian'anmen Square while
listening to the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
Major streets in Beijing were lined with national flags and
colorful banners. Large lantern-like balloons floated in the
air. Parks, stores and entertainment places were filled with
people greeting a new festival.
</P>
<P>
In China's northeast, the 25-below-zero Celsius temperature in
Harbin did not reduce people's enthusiasm for the New Year.
</P>
<P>
On the ice-covered Songhua River in Harbin, a recently opened
amusement park was the first option of many people on New Year's
Day. The ice sculptures created a novel wonderland.
</P>
<P>
At about two in the afternoon, more than 200 people in cartoon
costumes took to the streets, a prelude to cartoon night. Children
and young people had their photos taken beside cartoon figures.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast with the chill in Harbin, the warmth in
Guangzhou reminded people of spring. Today's parade in downtown
Guangzhou was similar to parades in urban and rural areas
throughout Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The parades, sponsored by local tourism departments, are aimed
at exhibiting the city's long history and demonstrating its
changes during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 compatriots from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region went to Guangzhou to participate in today's
parade.

In sunny Haikou, capital of south China's Hainan Province,
parks were also teeming.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province maintained steady economic growth after
surmounting serious difficulties from an overheated economy. The
province's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to
rise by 6.7 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Basking in warm sunlight, people in Xi'an greeted the first day
of the new year in the clean ancient city decorated with colorful
banners, red lanterns and balloons. Some people ascended the bell
tower, sounding the bell to greet the new year. And throngs of
people went to the downtown squares and parks.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Zhengzhou City, stilt-walking, drumming and
dancing performed by local farmers attracted crowds of people.
Along the picturesque bank of the Jinshui River, the performances
of old folk artists won applause.
</P>
<P>
On a square in the center of Shijiazhuang, more than 2,000
pigeons fluttered in the company of melodious music, sometimes
settling on the ground and playing with people. It was the first
time that pigeons were released for New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
In China's plateau city of Lhasa, a flag-raising ceremony was
held early this morning on the Potala Palace Square. Local
officials, servicemen and lamas were among 3,000 people on the
square.
</P>
<P>
Local citizens, in new clothes, went shopping or visited
relatives to extend New Year greetings.
</P>
<P>
For residents of Chongqing, the New Year's Day was the first
since Chongqing was made a municipality under the direct
administration of the central government. Sunlight managed to
break through a light mist and shine on the mountainous city.
</P>
<P>
Some 180,000 fresh flowers sent in from southern Guangzhou made
Chongqing residents fancy the flavor of spring.

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Most of the polluters along the
once heavily polluted Huaihe River in east China's Jiangsu and
Shandong provinces have met state standards for the emission of
pollutants, local sources said today.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu, as much as 70 percent of the pollutants released
into the Huaihe River have been eliminated, the provincial
environmental protection agency told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Among the 385 major provincial polluters along the river, the
agency said, 230 have completed pollutants-control and passed the
state examination; 88 have finished pollution-control projects and
are awaiting for examination; and 67 have been closed either
permanently or temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Recent monitoring data shows that the water quality of the
Jiangsu section of the Huaihe River has been greatly improved,
with water quality in 82 percent of the entire section improved
over 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
In Shandong, the Huaihe River clean-up efforts also have shown
positive results. Today the newest monitoring data shows that the

<HEADLINE> Manila Lowers Tariff Rate on Refined Oil Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
approved a uniform three percent tariff rate on imported crude oil
and refined petroleum products, the Presidential Press Office said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a press release that President Fidel Ramos
approved Wednesday the reduction of tariff rate on finished
petroleum products to three percent from the present seven
percent.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment is expected to pave the way for the creation of
a new oil deregulation law to save the country's downstream oil
industry early this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's old oil deregulation law was nullified by the
Supreme Court in November 1997 after taking effect for nine
months.
</P>
<P>
Under the old oil law, crude oil imports have a tariff rate of
three percent, while imported finished oil products have a rate of
seven percent. The rates were designed to encouraged firms to
invest in refineries in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said forcing firms to choose between
investing huge amounts in refineries or paying higher tariffs
amounted to a restriction on free trade and violated the intention
of the law.
</P>
<P>
But the new tariff rate, to be implemented from 1998 to the
year 2000, will translate to an annual revenue loss to the
government of about 485 million pesos (12 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Kenyan EC Complains of Delaying Delivery of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission (EC)
of Kenya today complained of the delaying tactics by returning
officers, urging them to deliver their counting results of the
votes immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here today, the commission said,
"Many returning officers who have completed counting are yet to
deliver the relevant certificates of results to the Electoral
Commission."
</P>
<P>
The commission directed these officers to send their counting
results to Nairobi today and those who have a valid reason should
let the commission know by telephone immediately.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial results show that over 100 of Kenya's 210
constituencies had completed their counting of votes by midday
today as the counting has been going on at a snail's pace since
the closure of the elections on December 30.
</P>
<P>
Results of around half of all the constituencies provided by
Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) and Kenya Television Network
(KTN) show that incumbent President Daniel arap Moi, National
Chairman of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), takes
a comfortable lead over his four leading challengers for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition leaders predicted that they would
win the general elections taking place on December 29-30 and
promised to form a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued here today, opposition
presidential candidates Mwai Kibaki, Raila Odinga and Michael
Wamalwa Kijana said, "We believe that we shall win the on-going
elections despite all odds."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, presidential candidates Joseph Martin Shikuku,
Kimani wa Nyoike and Wangari Maathai, former ministers Joseph
Kamotho and Jackson Kimeu Mulinge are among the notables who were
knocked out of parliamentary race.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission said yesterday that it would not
release any official results until counting is complete
throughout the country, saying that the law forbids it from
issuing partial presidential results.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Employees possessing
confidential state information or commercial secrets will not be
allowed to change jobs freely in Beijing as the result of a law
that went into effect today.
</P>
<P>
Those employees would have to compensate their employers or
face criminal penalties if they leave their working units without
authorization, divulge commercial secrets or infringe on
intellectual property rights, according to the law on the
administration of job markets.
</P>
<P>
Units that hire violators will also face a fine from 10,000 to
50,000 yuan (1,200-to-6,000 U.S. dollars). The law was recently
passed by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the local
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said the law is "necessary" for the further
development of booming job markets in the city.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 job seekers found their employers in Beijing's
job markets last year. Chinese people are enjoying more latitude
in choosing suitable careers in accordance with their skills,
abilities and wishes, said Gao Yunhou, director of the Beijing
Bureau of Personnel.
</P>
<P>
"However, legal rights and interests of employers and
intellectual property rights must be protected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Beijing, the Ministry of Personnel and dozens of
provinces and cities have published regulations on the
administration of job markets.

<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 407 persons were
injured in the Philippines due to firecracker use and
indiscriminate firing of guns during New Year's Eve revelry, the
Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing reports from various government hospitals nationwide,
the agency said 384 people were injured by firecrackers and 23
others were wounded by stray bullets from December 1 up to
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Of the 407 injured, 147 were reported from Wednesday night up
to Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said compared to the same
period in 1996, there was a significant decline in the number of
firecracker-related injuries this year.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, 623 firecracker-related cases were recorded
by hospitals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Reodica attributed the decline to a campaign launched by the
health department against firecracker use, a local tradition to
greet New Year, and indiscriminate firing of guns.
</P>
<P>
Reodica also said it is necessary to ban the sale of alcoholic
beverages on New Year's Eve as most of the injured were under the
influence of liquor.
</P>
<P>
While more cases are expected to be reported, especially from
the provinces, Reodica expressed confidence that the total cases
would be much lower compared to previous years.

vehicles burnt and public properties destroyed, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three vehicles were burnt from Wednesday night till this
morning and some bus stops and telephone cabins destroyed by rioting
youths in Strasbourg, where 500 vehicles were burnt in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 teenagers aged from 10 to 20 joined riot in all the
rough districts of the capital of Alsace Wednesday, burning dustbins
and throwing stones and cocktail molotov bombs, despite a deployment
of 400 policemen by the city police department.
</P>
<P>
A kindergarten, a cultural center and a gymnasium were also
damaged by the rioters, said police.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Luc Faivre, director of public security of Strasbourg,
said that no clash took place between police although the
anti-riot police had to disperse the rioting crowds several times.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the riot in Strasbourg was different from
those which took place in other French cities over the past several
weeks, as the former had a "socio-economic background."
</P>
<P>
Riots took place in Lyon and Fontainbleau two weeks ago after two
youths were killed by police, and the youths in Toulouse rioted
early this week after an immigrant youth was killed in a traffic
accident while driving a stolen car and being purchased by police.
</P>
<P>
Smaller scale riots and acts of street violence also took place
in Seine-Saint-Denis in the Paris region, Mulhouse in eastern
France, and Evry in Essonne south of Paris Wednesday night and this
morning.

<HEADLINE> S. Leoneans Hope for Peace in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The new year slipped almost
unnoticed in the west African state of Sierra Leone as soldiers
heeded a warning from the military junta not to fire gunshots to
usher in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"No gunshots were heard throughout the capital and its
environs", according to reports available here today.
</P>
<P>
Civilians in the capital had braced themselves for a barrage
of gunshots which normally welcomes the new year whether under a
military or civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Gunshots fired to greet the new year in 1997 killed 10
civilians in the capital and wounded over 30.
</P>
<P>
At the main checkpoint at Jui, 13 miles east of the capital
occupied by Nigerian troops in the peacekeeping ECOMOG contingent,
the Nigerians looked very cheerful and handshaked all commuters
with a better 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are for peace and we hope there would be no more fighting
with our Sierra Leonean brothers," one captain said.
</P>
<P>
At another checkpoint some three miles away manned by rebel
combatants of the People's Army, a commander said, "We hope the
year will usher peace among all of us, the Nigerians included."
</P>
<P>
An uneasy calm has, however, been reported in the southern
town of Bo, where Kamajor militiamen are said to be massing
around the fringes.
</P>
<P>
However, government troops are searching all vehicles entering
or leaving the town.
</P>
<P>
In Kenema in the east, six Kamajors and two soldiers were
killed on New Year's eve in a shoot out at a village 10 miles
east of Kenema.
</P>
<P>
The north is reportedly quiet and the provincial secretary
said "it is the quietest of all times."

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Gulf Countries Regulate Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1997 has seen an
intensified campaign by the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states to replace expatriates with locals in labor market in fight
against unemployment and other social problems.
</P>
<P>
The region currently hosts more than 10 million foreign
laborers and their families, who are active in almost all
occupations.
</P>
<P>
The swarm into the Gulf region by foreigners started from 1930s
when oil was discovered. Since then, they have been praised for
making outstanding contributions to the development of the once
poor and backward desert region.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that expatriates account for nearly 52
percent of the GCC's total population. The biggest percentage
constituted by expatriates of the local population is 80 percent
in Qatar, followed by 76 percent in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and 63 percent in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They now occupy almost all the jobs in the private sector and
take a large share of the manpower in management, science and
technology sectors. They also account for a marginal share in the
working staff in governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of local skilled manpower, disinclination of local
people to take manual or technical jobs and low employment rate in
women of the region are believed to be the main reasons of this
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
A number of knotty social problems resulted from this
phenomenon constitute the motives for the GCC countries to launch
the campaign of Gulfization. High unemployment rate in the GCC
countries' nationals is the foremost one.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries now have an average unemployment rate of
around 10 percent, which may grow higher in future because 50
percent of their population are under 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
In its five-year plan ending at the year 2000, Saudi Arabia
decided to create 630,000 jobs, while Kuwait needs to create
50,000 jobs in the next five years to meet the demands of newly
graduated students.
</P>
<P>
Capital outflows by expatriate workers, who remit dozens of
billions of U.S. dollars from the region to their home states
every year, also constitute a negative element to the ongoing
economic diversification process in the region.
</P>
<P>
The fear and worries about the implications of alien cultural
traditions and customs on local Islamic identity have been another
reason.
</P>
<P>
To control the foreign labor market, the GCC countries took
various measures. Firstly, they tried to restrict the employment of
foreign laborers.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Gulf Countries Regulate Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this aspect, they sped up the implementation of regulations
formulated earlier to ban the hiring of expatriates by those who
are not their sponsors. If found violating these regulations, the
laborers will have their residence canceled and be deported. The
sponsors and the employers will be penalized by barring them to
recruit any new foreign laborers for six months.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia hosts more than 6 million foreign residents, more
than half of the number in the whole region. The government has
asked each private firm with 20 workers or more to make Saudis
account for at least five percent of their payroll in 1997 and to
increase the same proportion each year to be followed.
</P>
<P>
Relevant offices in Saudi Arabia were required in July to stop
issuing new work permits or extending existing ones to expatriates
in seven areas. Kuwait decided to restrict issuance of work
permits to foreigners in 13 sectors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also decided to replace foreigners in the public sector
with Kuwaitis at an annual rate of 10 percent and planned to make
it less attractive for the private sector to hire foreigners by
obliging it to provide them with health care and raising residency
and entry fees.
</P>
<P>
The UAE set up a committee to study ways of increasing the
number of nationals employed in the private sector although it did
not have a plan to force the sector into employing nationals.
</P>
<P>
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain have reported tangible progress in
replacing foreign laborers with their nationals as the newly
established private firms successfully managed to hire 20 to 25
percent of local people.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, repatriating illegal workers is another effort in
GCC's campaign of Gulfization process. Saudi Arabia implemented a
three-month amnesty till October 15 during which about 500,000
illegal foreign residents were deported.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 people left the UAE in a four-month grace period
ending October 31. In Kuwait, December 15 was set as the deadline
for illegal expatriates to leave in a 40-day period.
</P>
<P>
All the three countries have said the illegals who failed to
leave would, when arrested in nation-wide searches after the grace
period ended, face maximum fines of up to 10,000 U.S. dollars and
a half to two years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, concrete incentives to encourage private sectors to
employ local laborers have been drafted or under preparation.
</P>
<P>
The UAE intends to set up a fund to encourage the private
sector to employ nationals and a time frame is expected to be
worked out to phase in more local staff without affecting
productivity.
</P>
<P>
In joint efforts, the GCC has set up a special committee in
August to draw up joint strategy aimed at achieving demographic
balance and replacement of the expatriate labor by the national
workforce.
</P>
<P>
However, observers believe that GCC's new efforts to reduce
reliance on foreigners might continue to be blocked by the private
sector's reluctance to hire more costly local labor and a shortage
of skilled native workforce.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen warned that they can not do their businesses
without foreign manpower.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the region's education system is not able to provide
local people with enough skills wanted by the private sector,
economists said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Opens Borders to Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel today opened its
borders to Palestinian agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The decision, in line with the 1993 Paris Agreement between the
Israelis and Palestinians, is expected to spur an increase in
exports of Palestinian agricultural products to Israel and a
subsequent drop in prices, particularly those of vegetables, in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel used to have unlimited access to the Palestinian market
although it imposed quotas on Palestinian agricultural products
sales to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, exports of Palestinian agricultural products to Israel
totalled 20 million U.S. dollars, while imports from Israel stood
at about 8.57 million dollars. The Palestinian agricultural
exports to Israel are mainly tomatoes, cucumbers and melons.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the Paris Agreement negotiations, Israeli
farmers protested the previous Labor government's decision to
expose Israeli agriculture to increased competition.
</P>
<P>
Despite the objections, the current Israeli government voted
in favor of free trade, but decided to drop the restructive trade
barriers slowly in order to help the Israeli agriculture sector
adjust to the increasing competition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to
allocate an additional 8.6 million U.S. dollars in the 1998
state budget for agriculture investment.
</P>
<P>
The government said the extra money will help Israeli farmers
complete the transition from low to high-tech farming.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Throughout the country, central
and local Communist Party and governmental officials have been
active around the New Year showing compassion for laid-off workers
and others in need.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China, Liaoning Governor Wen Shizhen and other
officials braved biting cold on Wednesday and Thursday to visit
financially troubled state-run factories and poor workers, calling
on the staff members to work hard to solve the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Led by Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Chairman

poor workers in the last two days of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before the New Year, the Liaoning provincial government had
dispatched nine delegations to convey solicitude for those in
financial difficulty across the province.
</P>
<P>
In Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
more than 20,000 Party and government officials went to the homes
of poor workers to deliver money, flour, meat and vegetable for
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, the city
government has been emphasizing the relocation of laid-off
workers. This morning, dozens of previously laid-off workers went
to the city's re-employment training center to write New Year's
couplets as a way to express their gratitude.
</P>

Pu Haiqing, mayor of Chongqing, also sent flour, rice and money
to poor retired workers. Local sources said that the city has set
up a special 10-million-yuan fund for poor workers.

</P>
<P>
ACFTU Vice-chairman Zhang Dinghua went to Zhengzhou City in

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 1 (Xinhua) --The Ugandan government has
established cholera treatment centers in 10 areas worst hit by
the epidemic, The Monitor newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The areas include Kampala, Mpigi, Luwero, Masaka and Mukono in
central Uganda and Jinja, Iganga, Bugiri, Mbale and Rukungiri
in the west, Health Minister Crispus Kiyonga was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the treatment centers, the government also keeps
its surveillance on the disease all over the country, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle in preventing the spread of the disease is
the lack of fund and classified staff, he added.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member Wasswa Lule has attributed the outbreak partly
to poor living condition of local communities.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains in recent weeks have damaged the drainage
systems in many Ugandan cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
According to Kiyonga, the cholera outbreak has claimed 188
lives in Uganda by December 29, but Sam Okware, Chairman of the
Anti-Cholera Task Force put the toll number at nearly 300.

More than 40,000 people from all walks of life braved a chilly

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- As a part of new year's
celebrations, tens of thousands Chinese fans Thursday took part in
sports competitions ranging from climbing to running.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 people spent their first morning in the year of
1998 to climb the Badalin section of the Great Wall on the
mountains in suburban Beijing.
</P>
<P>
in Shanghai, a thousand swamped onto the stairs in the Oriental
Pearl television tower and took a challenging trip toward the
platform 380 meters above the ground.
</P>
<P>
Both activities were televised in nationalwide by CCTV and
Shanghai Oriental Televition.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- "Tick tock", as the clock hands
jointly pointing to the zero hour of Jan. 1, 1998, only one
voice could be heard at a room at China's environmental protection
headquarters: "I declare the start of the 'Midnight Operation'."
</P>
<P>
At that very moment, other voices could be heard outside
hailing the new year.
</P>
<P>
Through telephones, the concise but forceful words of Xie
Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection Agency,
were delivered to more than 3,100 law-enforcement officers waiting
in the Huaihe River Valley. A large-scale, on-the-spot inspection
of the 270,000-square-kilometer area was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
As it's known to many Chinese people, lots of solemn and
stirring stories have taken place in the river valley since
ancient times. However, the anti-pollution efforts in Shandong,
Jiangsu, Anhui and Henan provinces could be the most touching in
modern history. The provinces have closed thousands of polluting
plants and spent billions of yuan during the last few years to
restore Huaihe's cleanliness and beauty.
</P>
<P>
By the zero hour today, among the 1,562 factories with daily
wastewater emissions exceeding 100 tons, 73 percent, or 1139 have
completed pollution control projects, another 190 others have been
closed, or 12 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the polluting factories will face closure or stop
production from midnight to seven this morning," said an official
with the agency.
</P>
<P>
About 82 percent of another 1,800 factories whose daily
emissions are below 100 tons have also completed their
anti-pollution projects. The rest will be dealt with today by
law-enforcement officers in the same way as major polluters,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace Process Rocked by Belfast Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace
process has suffered another crushing blow after a man was killed
and five others wounded in a Belfast bar shooting on New Year's
Eve, local press said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two masked gunmen, believed to be loyalist
paramilitaries, opened fire Wednesday night on drinkers in a
Catholic bar in north Belfast, the Northern Ireland capital.
</P>
<P>
This was the third killing in the province in five days. It
casts doubts on the peace process as any upsurge in sectarian
attacks is bound to place further strain on the negotiations and
could bring a violent end to the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
So far no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the masked gunmen were seeking further
revenge for the killing of the Loyalist Volunteer Force leader
Billy Wright at the Maze prison last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland Secretary, had earlier issued a
New Year's message urging people to "keep the past few days in
perspective." He said peace could only come through political
talks.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, said the peace process was "shattered" by the
shooting, and called the incident a "abominable" attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist deputy leader Ken Maginnis
attacked the government after the shooting, saying the "perverse
government" had made too many concessions to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
He said his party did not excuse the attack, but pointed out
that some people now felt violence was "the only thing that pays."

China had set a deadline of midnight Dec. 31 for all factories
in the Huaihe River Valley to meet wastewater emission
standards. Those who did not comply faced temporary or permanent
closure. Last year China closed nearly 5,000 small plants with
serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
"To date, emission of organic pollutants has been reduced by
more than 40 percent, and the water quality of Huaihe's main
stream has shown remarkable improvement," said Xie, adding that
the goal of the first-phase of Huaihe's anti-pollution war has
been met.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that pollution on some tributaries is
still serious. "Black, stinking water still flows at some places,
and that still falls far short of the target to clean up the river
by the year 2000," he said, asking the four provinces and
departments concerned under the State Council to increase their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes after midnight the environmental protection
headquarters was still busy. On the huge multimedia screen on the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will intensify traffic
control this year with the implementation of two new regulations
today.
</P>
<P>
The regulations give priority to public transport, enhance the
role of traffic police, establish new procedures on application
for new license plates and certificates, and ban the use of mobile
phones or pagers while driving.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, violators will face severe
penalties.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling for fines against an institution has been raised
from 1,000 yuan (120 U.S. dollars) to 30,000 yuan, and the ceiling
for individuals has been increased from 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 1.2 million vehicles
in the capital, and more than 1.9 million people have driver's
licenses. The increasing number of vehicles and limited road
facilities, along with roaming pedestrians, have resulted in
deteriorating traffic conditions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said most of the regulations used previously had
been worked out 10 years ago and are unable to cope with current
traffic conditions.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Action to Huaihe Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-five factories in the
Huaihe River Valley were closed this morning after a large-scale
spot inspection which proved their failure to meet state-set
emission standards. Production was temporarily halted at another
198 plants.
</P>
<P>
The inspection from midnight to seven this morning covered
1,300 factories with a daily wastewater emissions of more than 100
tons each in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the inspection showed that 99 percent of
the valley's factories are meeting emission standards.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the result of the inspection meets the
requirement of the State Council," said Lu Xinyuan, director of
the monitoring and environmental management department of the
National Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
The inspection showed that pollution control facilities at
eight factories' were not operating properly. Lu pledged they
would take further action for them.
</P>
<P>
The move, with the code name "Zero Hour Operation," involved
more than 3,100 law-enforcement officers. Paper strips were used
to seal the door of closed factories in some provinces.
</P>
<P>
China had demanded that all factories in the Huaihe River
Valley meet emission standards at the end of 1997 or they will
face closure or stop production.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the "Zero Hour Operation" is to implement the
central government's regulations, and to ensure the completion of
the first phase of the Huaihe River anti-pollution war, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The river valley extends 270,000 square kilometers, slightly
larger than Great Britain, and has a population of 150 million. It
is an important center of grain and energy production. The valley
has become one of the country's most seriously polluted regions
during the past decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A roving exhibition about Hong
Kong's service industry was opened Thursday at Times Square,
Causeway Bay, raising the curtain for a publicity campaign on
promotion of Hong Kong's services in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the exhibition of "Hong Kong
at Your Service" as a beginning of a "Good Service Good Reward"
campaign to promote Hong Kong's service industry, Donald Tsang,
Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, said that the campaign message meant more than only
material reward.
</P>
<P>
"It is also about nurturing a sense of pride in Hong Kong
people so that we see ourselves as sophisticated service
providers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The service sector is a 'people' industry. It is about people
using the best of their brains to meet the needs of other
people. It is about human development," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the financial secretary, the services sector
contributed to 80 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of
Hong Kong and it would continue to play a big part in sustaining
Hong Kong's economic development in future.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition featured different aspects of the services
industry. There were photo displays of the services sector,
information on the service economy as well as messages on
government commitments. Interactive game booths were also
installed to arouse the interest of visitors.
</P>
<P>
A video film titled "Hong Kong at Your Service" was premiered
during the opening ceremony. The video film would be shown to
overseas business community to promote international awareness of
the service strengths of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was also screened for public audience at the exhibition to
inform them of the development of the services industry.
</P>
<P>
As part of the publicity campaign, a new television commercial
and a new radio announcement "Service Provider" have been
broadcast on local television and radio channels since December
18.
</P>
<P>
These commercials depicted the qualities of Hong Kong people
that are essential to the success of the services industry with an
aim to reinforce the message of "Good Service Good Reward".
</P>
<P>
A new poster of the same theme will also be displayed at
government poster sites and subway stations starting 1998.
</P>
<P>
The roving exhibition will tour around at 13 major shopping
arcades on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and the "New Territories"
from January to May this year.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, Tsang told reporters that the
exhibition demonstrates to local people and the international
community the importance of services to the economy of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Services have helped us to be able to overcome a lot of
difficulties associated with the recent financial turmoil in
Asia," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure our excellence in service industry will bring us
into a higher plateau of excellence and a new level of
achievements in 1998 and give us great opportunities," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Media Confident in Future of China, SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Some major Hong Kong
newspapers on Thursday published New Year's Day editorials and
commentaries, expressing their confidence in the future of China
and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the past year, Ta Kung Pao said in a commentary
that 1997 was a year full of changes in the history of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Hong Kong returned to the motherland smoothly, the SAR
government had a good beginning of its work, the chief executive
and the SAR government were trusted by the central government,
supported by the Hong Kong people and praised by foreigners, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the six million Hong Kong people will
not be defeated by temporary difficulties such as the Asian
financial turmoil and the "bird flu".
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in 1998, the Hong Kong people will face new
tests which are by no means less difficult than those in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election to be held in May is another
demonstration of the further implementation of the policy of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong",
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Wen Wei Po said in an editorial that the Chinese people
experienced a great sorrow in early 1997 when Deng Xiaoping, the
chief designer of the reform and opening up of China, passed away.
</P>
<P>
The past year was also a happy year for the Chinese people, the
editorial said. The Chinese government not only resumed its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong but also successfully kept
its prosperity and stability, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China achieved a nine-percent economic growth, a
record of 135 billion U.S. dollars of foreign exchange reserves
and a 20 percent exports expansion, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic development will give strong support to
the economic development of the Hong Kong SAR, the editorial
pointed out. Hong Kong will have a better future, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in a commentary that the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held
in September 1997 has drafted a guideline of action for the
transcentury development of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, China will continue to carry out the policy of
reform and will be further opened up and the country's economy
will keep growing, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The fast economic development of the country offers a good
environment for the economic development of the SAR, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy of "one country, two systems", the roads
leading to the 21st century for China and its Hong Kong SAR will
become broader and broader, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Palestinian Prisoner Mistreated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli General Security
Service (GSS) has admitted that it had used methods such as
depriving a Palestinian prisoner of sleep in order to elicit
information to prevent terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
This came in a report by the GSS to the High Court of Justice
in response to a petition lodged by the Public Committee Against
Torture in Israel (PCATI) on behalf of a Bir Zeit University
student, Fuad Kuran, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kuran, who is under intensive interrogation had been deprived
of sleep for a long time, said the GSS.
</P>
<P>
The petition asked the GSS to stop torturing Kuran and allow
him to see a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Kuran, arrested on December 10, is the brother-in-law of Adel
Awadallah, who is suspected to have masterminded at least two
suicide bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as a precedent-setting decision, the
High Court of Justice on Sunday ordered the GSS to provide the
court with its detailed interrogation log book within 48 hours,
including the rationale for the methods used.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the State Attorney's Office said that one section
of the log book would have to remain secret for reasons of state
security. But it revealed part of its report.
</P>
<P>
"The petitioner (suspect) is not permitted to sleep as he
wishes, is interrogated for different periods of time or is in a
state of waiting for interrogation without enjoying the period
meant for sleep," the report reads.
</P>
<P>
"However, he is sent to his cell for sleep when the needs of
the interrogation make this possible," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Court President Aharon Barak, who heads the three-member panel
hearing the petition, said on Wednesday that he could not convene
another hearing until all the material of the report had been
studied.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem District Court on Wednesday remanded Kuran for
a further eight days and ruled that he would still not be able
to meet a lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation of Bangladeshi Tribal Refugees Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Repatriation of Bangladesh's
remaining 35,000 tribal refugees from the Indian state of Tripura
resumed Thursday after a 25-day break, the independent United News
of Bangladesh reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth phase of repatriation process from
Kathalchharl refuge camp in Tripura State.
</P>
<P>
Nine hundred and forty-one refugees from 185 tribal families
returned home from Kathalchharl camp through the Dakbanglaghat
frontier point on the first day of the phase.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the refugees Thursday morning were Refugee Affairs
Task Force Committee Chairman Kalparanjan Chakma and Chittagong
Division Commissioner Sakhawat Hossain Khan.
</P>
<P>
All preparations have been taken to receive the refugees at the
frontier and rehabilitate them in their respective homesteads in
the three hill districts.
</P>
<P>
In the past phases, about 20,000 tribal refugees have so far
returned home from India.
</P>
<P>
Many tribal people sought shelters in India in 1962 after the
Kaptai Hydro-electric dam flooded 350 square miles (906.5 square
kilometers) of their most fertile land and displaced over 100,000
people from their homes. From then on, the tribals had been waging
struggle for autonomous rights.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's refusal in 1973 to restore the area's historic
special status led to more than 20 years' guerrilla wars between
the government and the tribals, which were ended by the signing of
a peace agreement between them on Chittagong Hill Tracts early
last month.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi's GDP Up 9 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region topped 200 billion yuan in gross domestic
product (GDP) last year,
</P>
<P>
That figure represents a rise of 9 percent over the previous
year, sources at the region's statistics bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The economic achievements were mainly attributed to the rapid
development of semitropical agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the agricultural output increased 11 percent
over the 1996 figure. With the regional government's emphasis on
agriculture, the region produced a bumper crop of grain.
</P>
<P>
The region produced 16.6 billion kilograms of grain last year,
up 3.4 percent over 1996. And the total output of subtropical
fruit -- such as longans, litchi, bananas and pineapples -- was
3.18 million tons, three times more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The cane sugar output topped 2.6 million tons, ranking first in
the country for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index increased one percentage point last
year, almost equal to 1996. As a result, 1.2 million farmers in
the region escaped poverty last year.
</P>
<P>
To open wider to the outside world, the region paid close
attention to infrastructure construction. The region built the
Guilin-Beihai expressway, and expanded Guilin International and
Nanning airports. The ports of Fangcheng, Qinzhou and Beihai now
can handle more than 10 million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
The region topped three billion U.S. dollars in imports and
exports, up 6 percent over 1996, and utilized more than one
billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment last year.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Looming for Shippers in Third World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A crisis could be looming in
third world shipping industry as most seafarers are finding it
difficult to be employed in world class vessels, the East African
Standard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This follows the imposition of new rules by International
Maritime Organization (IMO) on the standards of training that
must be met by all seafarers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
IMO introduced standards in February last year for training
certification and watch-keeping, known as STCW, under which sea
worker must undergo from internationally recognized training
institutions and get a certificate that meets the requirements of
the STCW.
</P>
<P>
The new move was aimed at ensuring that those working in the
shipping industry are highly qualified and could serve
effectively.
</P>
<P>
However, most seafarers in the developing countries get
haphazardly "trained" while they go about their daily duties.
</P>
<P>
Most third world states have not been putting emphasis on
training of seafarers and, therefore, leaving a majority who
fails to get formal training and would find themselves
unemployable one day, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, with the worldwide liberalization of the shipping
industry, stiff competition has been witnessed and more and more
shipping merchants now prefer quality service, making new
challenges to the third world.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the developing countries with ports to make
efforts to train qualified seafarers so as to meet increasing
challenges in the fields of both technology and service of the
maritime industry, otherwise they will be in the mire.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chairman: Most Africa's Problems Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Organization of
African Unity and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said
remaining military rules in Africa should move away to allow
civilian rule in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told a New Year's eve party he hosted in Harare that
1998 should see most of Africa's political turmoil being resolved
saying more effort would be put in to boost the fragile peace
processes.
</P>
<P>
Painting a hopeful picture for the resolution of conflicts
bedevilling the world's poorest continent, he said his
organization supported most of the liberation movements making
legitimate demands.
</P>
<P>
"There are still other places where there are military
dictatorships and we hope these areas will go to civilian rule,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's most populous nation of Nigeria is still under the
military rule of Sani Abacha who has promised however, that
elections to bring in a civilian government would be held in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the situation in Somalia is about to get
its solution as the war lords have now come together," said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Another trouble spot of Africa is neighbouring Angola where
the Lusaka protocol signed between Eduardo Dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi is threatened by the latter's non-compliance with
provisions of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi who has apparently ignored some sections of the
protocol is expected this year to make major compromises that
will see Angola finally get over its civil war that tore the
southern African country for years and caused the death of
thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
On Saharawi, a nation seeking autonomy from the rule of
Morocco, Mugabe said he was hopeful that a referendum to be held
later this year would grant the Saharawis their desired goal.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see them (Saharawi) emerge as an independent state
and we hope Sudan will also get corrected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking strongly against continued sanctions on Libya by the
international community, Mugabe said it was time that the air
embargo was lifted.
</P>
<P>
Libya ostracized for its refusal to have its nationals tried
in Scotland for the Lockerbie downing of an plane, has promised
that it would release the suspects as long as the trial was held
in a neutral country like Switzerland, though presided over by
Scottish officials.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also called for renewed dialogue between the Palestine
Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the Israeli government of
Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa/Zimbabwe Trade Imbalance Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's trade imbalance with
neighbouring South Africa continues to increase and the trend is
not expected to change unless Harare introduces effective export
incentives, the Zimbabwe News Agency, Ziana, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Ziana, President of the Confederation of
Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) Jonee Blanchfield said the imbalance
threatened local industry as the market would be choked by South
African imports.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we can do something about the trade imbalance we are
going to see a collapse of business even more in this country,"
said Blanchfield.
</P>
<P>
Of Zimbabwe total import bill, nearly 40 percent is South
African exports.
</P>
<P>
While Pretoria exported goods worth more than 10.8 billion
Zimbabwean Dollars to Harare, it imported two billion Zimbabwe
dollars worth of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. Dollar equals to 17 Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Blanchfield, a staunch critic of the delay in reviewing the
1964 trade agreement which expired in 1992, has been castigated
by South African President Nelson Mandela for her previous
scathing comments which he said would not help the situation.
</P>
<P>
But Blanchfield prefers the issue to be resolved once and for
all and erase the animosity currently prevailing between the two
countries' business communities.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade imbalance with South Africa should be objectively
resolved, we either speed up the trade agreements or put in some
form of counter measures because the imbalance is widening and it
is denting our cash crisis," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added Zimbabwe should in the new year concentrate on
improving its image to attract potential investors.
</P>
<P>
On devaluation of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major
currencies in recent weeks, she said reduction of the national
budget deficit was the only way out.

<HEADLINE> Israel Greets New Year Without State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel greeted the year 1998
today without a state budget, as the government failed to gain
sufficient support for its draft budget proposal overnight.
</P>
<P>
The inner bickering and bargaining within the coalition
continued into midnight Wednesday, but the main dispute between
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy
remained unsettled.
</P>
<P>
Overnight negotiations held between Levy and Netanyahu's office
ended without an agreement. Both Levy and Netanyahu returned
to their homes in disappointment. It is not clear if Levy
will return from his home in Beit Shean in the West Bank
to the Knesset (Parliament) to attend further debate over the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Levy accused Netanyahu for failing to honor his promise made to
Levy's Gesher's party that the budget incorporates more funds for
control of deficit in health sector and the development of towns.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gesher, another coalition party United Torah
Judaism and several lawmakers of the ruling Likud party also
remained opposed to the budget of 207 billion shekels (59.1
billion U.S. dollars), which includes a 2.6 billion-shekel
expenditure cut.
</P>
<P>
The religious United Torah Judaism is fighting for allocation
of more funds to offer cheap housing for the religious
students.
</P>
<P>
And three hardline Likud lawmakers Zeev Begin, Uzi Landau and
Rubi Rivlin conditioned their support to the budget on
Netanyahu's promise to limit the scope of planned troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government, now boasting 66 seats, needs at least 61 votes
of the 120-seat Knesset to get the budget passed. Without the
support of the Gesher, with five seats, and the United Torah
Judaism, with four seats, and the three Likud lawmakers, the
government would fall if it puts the budget proposal for voting
now.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who has long been at odds with Netanyahu over
political and economic policies, is once again reportedly
considering resignation and working for early elections. Some
coalition lawmakers have already called for holding early
elections in order to stop what they called the "blackmailing"
of the government by small parties.
</P>
<P>
Gesher lawmaker David Magen said he believed it might be
possible to find the 80 votes needed to oust Netanyahu without
dissolving the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp, meanwhile, stepped up its offensive
against the government over the budget crisis. The leading
opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak said Wednesday night
that the government's failure to pass the budget "is a sign
of the total collapse of the Netanyahu government."
</P>
<P>
Still, Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman said that he was
confident that the budget would be finally approved imminently
with its original framework remaining roughly intact.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is to continue voting on the economic arrangement
bills accompanying the budget today. And the government is

<HEADLINE> Israelis' Income Sees First Drop Since 1985 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's per capita
disposable income dropped by 2 percent in 1997 after continuous
increases since 1985, today's The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics as
saying that the decline was coincident with the slowdown of
Israel's economy this year. And it was also affected by the
increase in payments to the National Insurance Institute and
to income tax.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the bureau Wednesday,
Israel's Gross Domestic Product increased by only 2 percent in
1997, compared with 4.5 percent in 1996 and 7 percent in 1995 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
And Israel's per capita pre-tax income remained unchanged in
1997 at 58,000 shekels (about 17,000 U.S. dollars), compared to a
2 percent increase in 1996, and 4 percent in both 1995 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that Israel's per capita income, as compared
with other Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECE) countries, is similar to income in Finland and New Zealand,
and higher than in Spain and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's consumer spending also slowed in the past
year, growing by less than 1 percent, compared with an increase of
3 percent in 1996 and 5 to 6 percent increase from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, consumption of durable goods in Israel dropped by
2 percent per capita, including a 19 percent decline in new
car purchases. And expenditure on food dropped by 2 percent
after continuous increases from 1992.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Embassy in S. Africa (Detailed) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen opened China's embassy in South
Africa here today.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint communique signed by Qian and South African
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo Tuesday, the two countries have
established diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level as from
today.
</P>
<P>
China's national flag was raised in the yard of the embassy,
and the national anthem, March of the Volunteers, was played
while hundreds of people watched with emotion.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Chinese government, I formally declare the
Embassy of the People's Republic of China in South Africa opens,"
Qian said at the ceremony presided over by Wang Xuexian, the
first Chinese ambassador to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Qian unveiled a plaque bearing the name "Embassy of the
People's Republic of China" among a warm applause.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said in a brief speech that the embassy would
contribute to the enhancement of understanding and traditional
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who was also present at the ceremony, said: "On this
first day of the establishment of diplomatic relations, the
unveiling of the plaque marks a historic occasion in our
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"In the years to come, this name plaque will remind us of the
first step in a journey of a thousand miles that was started here
today -- to quote a famous Chinese proverb."
</P>
<P>
"From now on, this embassy will take on an even more important
role as we seek to develop not only our bilateral relations to
their fullest potential, but also to coordinate our efforts to
pursue the interests of the developing countries in the
international political and economic system."
</P>
<P>
Deputy minister of China's Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, Shi Guangsheng, assistant foreign minister, Ji
Peiding, also attended the ceremony held at 972 Pretorius Street,

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Faces Difficult New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania faces a tough
new year after the country started with drought and ended with
floods in 1997, President Benjamin Mkapa has said.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message broadcast to the nation last night,
Mkapa said 1998 is likely to be difficult for all Tanzanians even
if weather turns better.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said donors have pledged to provide Tanzania with 68,640
tons of food in response to the government's appeal last
September. The food relief supplies are expected to arrive in the
country from January 15 and will be distributed to needy areas.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said last September the country would face a shortage of
916,000 tons of food during the 1997/1998 season.
</P>
<P>
To ease food shortage, the government last year waived taxes
on imports of maize in a bid to encourage private businessmen to
import food. However, the response was cold.
</P>
<P>
By yesterday 53,300 tons of food, including 20,000 tons of
maize had been imported by private businessmen, merely 13 percent
of the needed amount.
</P>
<P>
The food situation was worsened by floods starting from early
December, which have paralyzed a number of roads, bridges and the
Central railway. Food and other necessities are difficult to
reach the market, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments predicted that the floods linked to
El Nino weather phenomenon will last until April.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the weather is favorable we should expect 1998 to be
a difficult year, as much damage has been done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses have yet to be known as floods have blocked
traffic or cut off communication to a number of areas. But
Tanzanian Prime Minister told reporters yesterday that the floods
have killed 38 people and left tens of thousands of people
homeless.
</P>
<P>
The president also said between January and September last
year, 1,249 people died and 10,195 were injured in 11,420 road
and railway accidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,984 people on Tanzanian mainland and 140 others
in Zanzibar isles died of cholera last year. A total of 36,182
people contracted the disease in 1997, he said.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Decries Post-Election Atrocities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force in Liberia known as ECOMOG has expressed deep concern about
what it called dangerous trends characterizing the post-election
era in that country, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG chief of staff Brig.-gen. Adbul One Mohammed, who
voiced the feeling Wednesday, warned that unless the trends were
checked by the political leadership of that country, they were
capable of generating fresh bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The general listed a number of things as some of the bad
developments that could re-ignite the conflict.
</P>
<P>
They include alleged abduction and assassination of known
political figures and prominent politicians; re-enlistment of
soldiers who have been identified with the seven-year fratricidal
war in the country and indiscriminate arrests of journalists on
flimsy excuses.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention Nay Culprit, saying his warning was
part of the duty ECOMOG owed the people of Liberia before it
finally moves out of the country next month.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, a former ally of President Charles Taylor,
Sam Dokie was abducted and found dead three days later.
</P>
<P>
Dokie allied to Taylor at the beginning of his rebel struggle
against the former government. He later fell out with Taylor, the
then leader of a major warring faction, National Patriotic Front
of Liberia (NPFL), complaining that Taylor did not want the war
to end.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, a journalist, who reportedly went to cover the
burial of Dokie, was also abducted at Gbarnga, the former
headquarters of NPFL where he had gone to interview certain
personalities.
</P>
<P>
"The problems would not help in bringing peace to the country.
But since we are still on the ground, we will continue to appeal
to them to do the right thing," the ECOMOG chief said.
</P>
<P>
As several ECOMOG soldiers lost their lives and billions of
U.S. Dollars were spent during the peacekeeping operations, the
general said "we do not want to see what will bring about
uprising in the country so as not to defeat the purpose of our
being here."
</P>
<P>
"If we leave this country, we can't imagine what will happen
to them," he said, adding that this concern is also expressed by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The entire international community is watching the
development with grave concern," he noted.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Chapter in China-South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- With the opening of the
Chinese Embassy in South Africa in Pretoria today, the two
developing countries, influential in Asia and Africa
respectively, finally completed the process of the normalization
of relations, opening a brand-new chapter for bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who
opened the embassy, said the diplomatic facility will make
contributions to the enhancement of understanding and traditional
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said: "The name
plaque (of the embassy) will remind us of the first step in a
journey of a thousand miles that was started today."
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a joint communique Tuesday to
establish diplomatic relations as from today.
</P>
<P>
Together with the joint communique signed by Qian and Nzo, the
two countries also signed agreements on diplomatic representation
in each other's countries, investment protection and aviation.
</P>
<P>
During meetings with Qian, South African leaders stressed that
China plays an important role in international affairs and that
the establishment of diplomatic relations with China is in the
interests of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela declared in November
1996 that his country would sever ties with Taiwan and recognize
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said after talks with Qian on Monday that China is the
most populous nation in the world and a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interests of South Africa to have relations with
such a country. They are also one of the fastest growing economic
giants in the world and therefore it is in the interests of both
countries to have diplomatic relations."
</P>
<P>
Nzo told a reception in honor of Qian on Tuesday evening that
the establishment of diplomatic relations with China would have
been a "foregone conclusion a long time ago" if it had not been
for the apartheid system.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been totally untenable that a situation should
continue to exist where one of the leading countries in Africa
does not have formal relations with one of the leading countries
in Asia and the world."
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of such a situation would have been
inconsistent with decisions taken by international bodies such as
the UN and the OAU (Organization of African Unity), international
law and the state practice followed by the overwhelming majority
of countries," Nzo said in a cordial speech.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier that the establishment of formal relations
with China is an important achievement of diplomacy of the
African National Congress and the South African government.
</P>
<P>
National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala said in a meeting with
Qian on Sunday that after the normalization of relations, the two
countries could forge better cooperation in bilateral relations
and in international politics. She described Qian's visit and the
establishment of diplomatic relations as an important milestone
in the history of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges and cooperation between China and South Africa dated
back to long time ago. In not more than a year after the founding
of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chinese leader Mao
Zedong sent a message to liberation organizations in Transvaal to
express China's support to their just course against apartheid.
Ever since then friendship was established between South Africa's
major black liberation groups and China.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has said repeatedly that the Chinese government and
its people have always been supportive to South Africans during
apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
When explaining to reporters the reason for the establishment
of diplomatic relations with China on Tuesday, Nzo said
relationship with China was long-standing and that the diplomatic
recognition was a continuation of friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He told the Tuesday reception that the move was a "natural
outcome" of contacts of more than 300 years.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and South African leaders believe that the
establishment of formal ties will give fresh impetus to trade
relations since both countries face the common task of developing
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed rapid growth in bilateral trade.
Trade volume jumped to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars from merely 14
million dollars in 1991. It is expected to exceed 1.6 billion
dollars this year, not counting South Africa's trade of 1.4
billion dollars with China's Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
Two figures combined, China is South Africa's sixth largest
trading partner in the world.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is now China's biggest trading partner in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Strong trade links will lay a firm foundation for future
cooperation, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the traditional friendship, strong trade links and
each other's important role in international and regional
affairs, South African leaders have indicated that the two
countries should enhance cooperation on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said Tuesday that South Africa and China, both developing
countries, share many similar ideals and objectives, such as the
equality of every member of the international community and the
safeguarding of the interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, South Africa, as a non-aligned country
pursuing an independent foreign policy, is looking forward to
forging a strategic partnership with China for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Both sides believe that with the normalization of relations, a
new era of bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields
is unfolding before the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Consultative Body Holds New Year's Tea Party (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Council (CPPCC) held a tea
party here today to mark the coming of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese leaders including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi,
Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Wei Jianxing, Li Lanqing and
Rong Yiren attended the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Also present were leading members of the CPPCC National
Committee, non-Communist Parties, the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), personalities without party
affiliation, seniors officials of departments of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
government, and representatives of different circles and all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the tea party, President Jiang Zemin, who is general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, extended festival greetings, on behalf of the
CPC Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military
Commission, to all non-Communist parties, the ACFIC, non-Party
personages, to the broad masses of workers, farmers, intellectuals
and carders, to officers and men of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), the armed police and public security
officers, to compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, Macao and Taiwan and overseas Chinese, and to people of
other countries who have shown concern or help for China's
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called 1997 "a very important and extremely unusual year
in the history of our Party and nation."
</P>
<P>
After the death of Deng Xiaoping at the beginning of the year,
the whole Party, the whole army and people of all ethnic groups in
China rallied closely around the CPC Central Committee and
unswervingly adhered to the Party's basic theory and basic line to
push ahead the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government smoothly resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintained its prosperity and
stability, marking a stride forward in completing the
reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC's 15th National Congress held high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory, summed up historical experience, worked out
the Party's fundamental program in the primary stage of socialism
and unveiled a cross-century plan for reform, opening and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Those two major political events greatly inspired the whole
Party and people of all ethnic groups in China in uniting more
closely and working hard to build China into a prosperous,
democratic and modernized country and to realize the reunification
of the motherland. More

<P>
In 1997, China also made notable headways in pushing forward
its reform, opening-up and modernization drive, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The national economy continued its good growth momentum by
realizing high growth coupled with low inflation, with all major
economic indices basically reaching the macro-control targets,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic situation during the past year was favorable on
the whole, which signals consolidation and further development of
a good beginning for realizing targets set forth in the Ninth Five
Year Plan (1996-2000)," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang said that 1998 will be a crucial year for
fulfilling the Ninth Five Year Plan targets as well as the first
year to overally implement tasks set forth at the 15th CPC
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the whole nation will need to hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, vigorously push ahead in the
spirit of the 15th Party Congress, and open up new ground with
well-made plans, a down-to-earth attitude, and firm unity.
</P>
<P>
China will convene the first session of the Ninth National
People's Congress and that of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) next year, and the local People's
Congresses and CPPCC at lower levels will also be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
"This marks a great event in China's political life," Jiang
said, while calling on party committees and governments at all
levels to work towards the perfection of the system of people's
congress and that of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation led by the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Jiang concluded the speech by calling upon the whole nation to
carry on the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21 century in an all-round manner and
with the guidance of Deng Xiaoping theory.
</P>
<P>
The tea party was presided over by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, president of the China Democratic National
Construction Association delivered a speech on behalf of all the
democratic parties and people without party affiliation.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Workers Get Re-employment Help in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from the Guangdong
Provincial Labor Department shows that 310,000 laid-off workers
and 130,000 jobless people were re-employed from January through
September last year in this southern province of China.
</P>
<P>
With re-employment rate dramatically rising to 62 percent,
unemployment rate was brought down further to 2.3 percent in the
province, according to an official in charge of re-employment in
the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong set up a provincial re-employment fund in
October. Cities such as Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Zhongshan
also have their own funds to aid the jobless.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that 180,000 laid-off workers and jobless
people attended training in the first half of 1997, accounting for
35 percent of those out of work. The re-employment rate of the
trainees reached 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The workers laid-off by state enterprises are mostly from
traditional industries. Their cultural and technical qualities
usually fall short of the demands of newly emerging industries,
high-technology companies and such high-grade service sectors as
information and finance, a provincial official said.

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin

<HEADLINE> Jiang: 1997 Diplomatic Work Scores Important Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China's diplomatic work scored
important achievements in 1997, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today.
</P>
<P>
At a new year tea party sponsored by the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Jiang said
that in the past year, China's good-neighborly relations with its
neighboring countries have been further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
China's unity and cooperation with the vast number of
developing nations have been further consolidated, and its ties
with the developed nations in the west have been improved and
enhanced, noted Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Through high-level exchanges of visits, Jiang said, China has
formulated goals and policies guiding its 21st-century-oriented
relations with such big nations as the United States, Russia,
France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
As of today, China normalized its ties and forged diplomatic
relations with South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the country has taken an active part in regional and
inter-continental economic, trade and technological cooperation
and exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China's international status and its
influence in the world are being further enhanced, and the world's
media generally holds that the country is playing an increasingly
significant role in promoting world and regional peace, stability
and development.
</P>
<P>
In less than two decades of reform and opening-up, he
continued, "We have made achievements that has caught world-wide
attention and has laid a solid basis for new victories of our
cause," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that "we must see clearly that as
international competition is getting increasingly fierce, there
remains a long way to go in accomplishing the arduous task of
modernization in a country with a huge population of 1.2 billion."
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that China will stick to its
independent foreign policy of peace, and continue to develop
friendly cooperative ties with all countries based on the five
principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Together with people of the whole world, China will continue to
make positive contributions to the establishment of a fair and
reasonable new international order, to the lofty cause of
promoting the world peace and development, and to the opening-up
of a beautiful future for mankind, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Hurt in New Year's Revelry in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary reports showed that
at least nine people have been hurt by stray bullets fired by
those who violated government orders in New Year's revelry in the
Philippines, the Philippine News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said hospitals in Metro Manila alone reported that
they have initially admitted at least 95 persons victimized by
exploding firecrackers and more were still intermittently checking
in.
</P>
<P>
It added that the bulk of the patients poured in right after
the revelry reached its height at midnight. Streets in Manila were
reduced to nearly zero visibility at midnight due to the heavy
smoke brought about by exploding firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
However, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said the number of
blast victims were lower than that of last year. She added that a
final report on blast victims might be available latter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the celebration of New Year, several fires also took
place in Metro Manila and its nearby cities, destroying millions
of pesos worth of properties and injuring at least 20 people, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Coastal, Inland Areas Seek Common Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in China's developed
coastal areas have provided funds and technologies for the
less-prosperous central and western areas as a way of common
development.
</P>
<P>
On a mutually beneficial basis, the central and western areas
have provided energy and raw materials in large amounts in their
cooperation with the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, enterprises in the coastal areas have established
stable economic ties with and helped promote economic
restructuring of their counterparts in the central and western
areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the proportion of primary industry has
dropped 0.4 percent in the national economy and 0.8 percent in the
secondary industry in the central and western areas this year,
while the proportion in the service sector has increased 1.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, an undeveloped province in north China, has introduced
more than 4,000 items of new technologies from the coastal areas
in the past three years, and upgraded its light industry, textile
and clothing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The province, a leading coal producer in the country,
transports more than 200 million tons of coal to 26 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions every year. The raw coal
produced in the province accounts for one-fourth of the country's
total. And the province effectively utilized the earnings from
coal in 280 items of technological innovations.
</P>
<P>
As the country's largest industrial and financial center,
Shanghai has invested 3.5 billion yuan (437.5 million
U.S. dollars) in the fields of education, culture and public
health in the central and western areas, including 200 million
yuan of free economic aid.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, the city has committed 100 million
yuan to the building of a hydropower station and a hospital in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai has sent 150 groups of outstanding
professional technicians to the region, as well as Yunnan and
Guizhou provinces, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and
launched more than 1,500 anti-poverty projects there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Top Judge Criticizes Senate for Inaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist warned that the "quality of justice" of the country
may be threatened by the Senate's delay in acting on scores of
President Bill Clinton's judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
In his year-end report, the nation's top-ranking judge pointed
a finger of blame at the Senate for "serious delays in the
appointment process."
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said that 82 of 846 federal judgeships remain vacant,
and 26 of those vacancies have existed for 18 months or longer.
</P>
<P>
He said such a high level of vacancies cannot continue "without
eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been
associated with the federal judiciary."
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said both the president, who nominates judicial
candidates, and the Senate, which must confirm them, "bear some of
the responsibility" for the judicial crunch. But he was more
critical of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time
for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote,"
Rehnquist said. "The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and
36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994."
</P>
<P>
In September, President Clinton accused Senate Republicans of
putting politics above justice, but Senator Orrin Hatch, the
Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said Clinton's
criticism was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist's report said federal courts' workloads continue to
grow, due in part to federal laws that have expanded federal
jurisdiction over crimes involving drugs and firearms.
</P>
<P>
"If federal jurisdiction remains at its current level -- or,
worse, increases -- judicial vacancies will aggravate the problem
of too few judges and too much work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist also criticized President Clinton's failure to name
new members of the Sentencing Commission, which conducts
sentencing-related research and issues guidelines on punishment
for federal crimes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Balloonist Launches Third Around World Try </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Adventurer Steve Fossett
launched his "Solo Spirit" balloon into sky from a sports stadium
on Wednesday night in his third try for a nonstop balloon trip
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett's balloon lifted off flawlessly at 5:04 p.m. CST (2304
GMT) from Busch Stadium in downtown St. Louis, local media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Fossett will sail on a favorable upper
air jet stream that would push his balloon over the Atlantic Ocean
on a trip that would last about 15 days if successful.
</P>
<P>
Fossett planned to balloon over northeast England, Ukraine,
Russia, Kazakhstan, China, southern Japan and over the Pacific to
British Columbia with a landing northeast of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared properly and we have a very realistic
chance," the 53-year-old stock options broker was quoted as saying
prior to departure.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic at Lambert Field in St. Louis was diverted around
the stadium to give Fossett clear sailing.
</P>
<P>
Fossett has already set a record in time and distance as he
ballooned last January with a six-day, 16,000-kilometer trip from
St. Louis to India.
</P>
<P>
Because of shortage of fuel to cover the whole journey, Fossett
had to touch the land near Sultanpur, India in the last try.
</P>
<P>
This time he is carrying 50 percent more fuel and his balloon
is 28 percent larger at 350,000 cubic feet (9,800 cubic meters).
He will burn an ethane and propane fuel mixture to heat air
surrounding the helium encapsulated in the balloon and thus
control his altitude.
</P>
<P>
Fossett also has an oxygen mask and a separate heating system
for the unpressurized capsule to combat upper altitude
temperatures that drop as low as as minus 45.4 degrees Celsius.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Calls on EU to Renew Trade Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav government Wednesday
called on the European Union (EU) to reconsider its decision of
terminating trade privileges extended to the southeastern European
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic hosted a meeting Wednesday in response to the EU's
refusal.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the EU move shows that the bloc is
adopting double standard in handling international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision, which is nothing but discrimination against
the country, will set back the country's fledging economic reform
and hurt the development of the Southeastern Europe as a whole,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
An EU spokesman said on Tuesday that the bloc has decided not
to renew trade privileges to Yugoslavia next year because of human
rights and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade preferences for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia
are expected to be renewed for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU trade benefits included offering Yugoslavia duty-free
access to the EU and eliminating restrictions on imports of
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The EU move is another blow to the country, which was hit by
years of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed a trade embargo on Belgrade in 1992
for its alleged role in the Bosnian war, but lifted it in October
1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the so-called outer wall of the sanction was left in
place, which bans the country from access to international
financial organizations and foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United States decided to extend
financial sanctions against Yugoslavia for another year as part of
the "outer wall" sanction.

<HEADLINE> Romania Gives Special Treatment to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Romania will grant special
treatment to overseas investors in an effort to attract more
foreign capital, under an urgent decree put into effect Wednesday
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The decree, "On Encouraging Direct Investment," says foreigners
can make investments in every economic field and by any forms
permitted by law.
</P>
<P>
It also says investors will enjoy more preferential policies no
matter what their nationalities, whether or not they reside in
Romania and regardless of the amount of their investments.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that imports of machine equipment are free of
customs tariffs, and that investors can reduce profit taxes by
subtracting 20 percent of a machine's purchase costs or its
depreciation charges from before-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
The favorable policy won't be altered within five years, the
order says.
</P>
<P>
Romania passed a law on foreign capital in April of 1991, and
has since amended it several times.
</P>
<P>
Romania attracted about 150 million U.S. dollars in overseas
capital in 1997, the largest amount in recent years.
</P>
<P>
But compared with Poland, Hungary and some other eastern and
central European countries, Romania still needs to strengthen
efforts to attract more capital.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Economic Growth Forecast at 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth for
1997 could be only 0.3 percent, compared with 6.4 percent posted
in 1996, according to the National Economic and Social Development
Board, the country's national planning agency.
</P>
<P>
The board also forecast that the economy would grow by just 0.4
percentage points to 0.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the board Wednesday spent five hours
reporting to the cabinet on the country's economic performance of
1997 and making policy suggestions for 1998, according to the
Bangkok Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the board sees a much improved current account deficit
situation. In 1996, the deficit stood at 14 billion US dollars,
equal to 7.9 percent of gross domestic product. While in 1997, the
deficit dropped to 4 billion dollars, or 2.4 percent of GDP, and
is forecast to fall further in 1998 to 1.5 billion dollars, or 1.5
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth estimate of the board is not far away from
the forecast of the international monetary fund (IMF), which had
forecast a 0.6 percent growth for 1997, and a growth of between 0
and 1 percent for 1998.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Per-Capita GDP Tops 3,000 Dollars in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis, has become the first city in the populous country that
registered a per-capita GDP of over 3,000 US dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure indicates that Shanghai has hit the national target
of quadrupling the per-capita GDP by the year 2000 three years
ahead of schedule, according to officials from the Shanghai
Municipal Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, economists note, the figure is still low as compared
with international standards, particularly those of developed
countries. World average per-capita GDP was 4,470 dollars in as
early as 1994.
</P>
<P>
Bureau statistics also show that the annual GDP exceeded 300
billion yuan (8.32 yuan equals one US dollar) in Shanghai last
year, the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat performance of GDP and per-capita GDP is indicative
of the fact that Shanghai economy has entered a period of fast,
steady growth, economists say.
</P>
<P>
By now, Shanghai has experienced three phases of rapid
per-capita GDP growth: 1978-1988, 1989-1993, and 1994-1997, with
the latest keeping its momentum.

<HEADLINE> 1998, Year of Challenge for Sri Lanka: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Central Bank
Governor A.S. Jayawardena Thursday described 1998 as a year of
challenge for the economy but expressed confidence that overall
resilience would help overcome difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact of the Southeast Asian currency crisis and a
speculated drought at home in 1998 might pose difficulties for Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Due to the difficulties that may emerge this year, the
government may revise and scale down the six percent growth rate
projected for 1998. Last year the country achieved a growth rate
of six percent.
</P>
<P>
The governor believes that the Sri Lankan economy was too small
to attract speculators who have been blamed for their role in the
Southeast Asian financial crisis, which he described as an
"economic El-Nino".
</P>
<P>
He said that despite external and internal shocks the
resilience of the private sector and that of the economy helped
Sri Lanka to recover exceptionally from the 1996 slump.
</P>
<P>
The banker also predicted a good harvest in 1998, which he said
will result in lower food prices and bring down the annual average
inflation to six or seven percent from nine percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Privatize Domestic Timber Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will gradually privatize
its domestic timber trading, which is mainly run by the
state-owned Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE), official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MTE will concentrate only on export business in the future,
 Minister for Forestry U Aung Phone was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Myanmar Timber Entrepreneurs' Association
here Wednesday, the minister also disclosed that his ministry is
planting 41.5 million trees annually for commercial use, adding
that 57 townships in three divisions of Magway, Mandalay and
Sagaing are being reafforestated.
</P>
<P>
He also urged entrepreneurs of the wood-based industries in the
country to join projects being jointly undertaken by the MTE and
the Forest Products Joint Venture Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with forests covering about
51 percent of its total land area.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's export of forest
products including teak and hardwood amounted to 71.4 million U.S.
 dollars in the first eight months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs and bans the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
Forest Law in 1992. However, export of value-added products is
encouraged.

NANJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China officially opened the 1998
urban and rural travel year at the scenic spot of Suzhou city in
east Jiangsu Province at aero hour today, winding up the
monumental '97 China Travel Year.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Luo Gan declared the new year in and old year
out at a grand ceremony held at the well-known Hanshan (Cold
Mount) Temple, which drew thousands of travellers from across and

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Required to Report Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will require banks to make detailed, periodic reports
of their loan exposures, including bad loans, local press reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank deputy governor for bank supervision Alberto Reyes
said the new rules could take effect by March this year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive non-performing loans is one of the reasons that
caused the current financial crisis sweeping Asia. Amid the
financial storm, the Philippine peso has devaluated by 52 percent
to the current level of around 40 pesos to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Reyes was quoted as saying that the government was taking the
measure to improve "transparency amid eroded confidence" into the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This is being done by almost all countries," he said, adding
that imposing the regulation would give banking authorities an
"advance warning" on the health of local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank would probably require commercial banks to
make a report every three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the report would have to include the level of bad
loans, restructured loans, loans loss provision for specific
accounts, provision for losses of asset accounts, unbooked
valuation reserves, investment in government securities and other
items.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Give Priority to Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto vowed today that the government will take every possible
measures to stabilize the country's financial system and restore
the economy to a healthy state.
</P>
<P>
"The government will never allow either a financial crisis or
an economic crisis to start in Japan (and spread to other
countries)," Hashimoto told a news conference marking New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly resolved to recover national confidence in the
economy by putting business conditions back on a recovery track
and stabilizing the financial system which constitutes the artery
of the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
A series of collapses of Japanese financial institutions since
the fall of last year has undermined confidence both at home and
abroad in Japan's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Citing the fact that Japan has 1,200 trillion yen (about 9.2
trillion U.S. dollars) in personal financial assets, 800 billion
dollars in net external assets of the state, and the world's
biggest foreign reserves worth more than 200 billion dollars,
Hashimoto urged the public to have confidence in the nation's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he expects a proposed package of economic and
financial measures, featuring 30 trillion yen (about 230.7 billion
dollars) for disposal of failed financial institutions and
protection of depositors, will combine with a proposed 2 trillion
yen (about 153.9 billion dollars) income tax cut to help pave the
way toward economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
To bring about a bright 21st century, Hashimoto said, he will
continue promoting his "six reforms," targeting the
administrative, fiscal, monetary, economic, social security and
education systems, to comprehensively change an arrangement that
is now 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
also expressed his resolve to lead the LDP to a simple majority in
the Upper House in the election scheduled for July. The LDP now
has 117 seats, nine short of a majority, in the 252-seat chamber.

BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will continue to be the
focus of ASEAN's peace efforts in 1998, Thai Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A major task of the ASEAN troika is to encourage negotiations
between the parties in conflict, because the internal turmoil in
Cambodia has affected peace and stability in the whole region,
Surin was quoted by Thursday's local press as saying.

Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines comprise the ASEAN team
set up to help solve the Cambodian problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian conflict is an urgent matter which ASEAN should
tackle so that peace and prosperity can be restored in that
country."
</P>
<P>
Surin said ASEAN had a duty to help Cambodia hold national
elections scheduled for July this year, through the provision of
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia needs assistance from ASEAN. If we do not help
Cambodia hold elections, we cannot say that the elections are free
and fair," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN's guarantee is important to ensure the freedom and
fairness of election," he said.

BUDAPEST, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian President Goncz
Arpad said Wednesday Hungary would, in 1998, give priority to
solving its long-term agricultural crisis and the dispute over the
Danube with Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
In his new year address, Goncz said parliamentary and local

<P>
He said the year 1997 was a turning-point for Hungary which was

<P>
He said Hungary kept economic and political stability in 1997
as the whole nation endured the pains and burdens caused by a
tightened economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the stable political situation and realistic
foreign policy ensured the economic achievements of 1997. These
included the reduction of foreign debt and budget deficits, the
rise of industrial output and production efficiency and the
increase of exports and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
However, Goncz said, Hungary faces greater challenges in 1998
such as high inflation, price rises, poverty, unemployment and
unequal opportunities in education.

BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The first day of 1998 marks the
end of selling and using thin plastic bags in the Chinese capital
for they cause serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
From the new year, plastic bags thinner than 0.015 millimeters
are banned from the markets and stores of Beijing, according to a
circular issued by the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Food sellers will not be allowed to use such bags. The circular
said many of the bags fail to meet sanitary standards for they
are made from recycled materials and such materials will be
allowed to wrap foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
As the plastic bags, which are hard to disintegrate, are
generally casually discarded around, they cause serious "white
pollution," the circular noted.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of Beijing are encouraged to use thick plastic bags
repeatedly or cloth ones in a bid to reduce pollution.

<HEADLINE> 2670 2119 1341 2646 2661 EDS: More to Follow hke010102--News Analysis: 1998, Year of Adjustments for East Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- 1998 is expected to be "a year of
economic adjustments" for East Asia, where reforms and adjustments
aimed to combat a financial crisis have already started and will
be in full swing in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, people celebrate a new year with great joy and
best wishes. But that is not the case for some East Asians when
1998 approaches. They are embracing the new year with mixed
feelings, as the six-month-old crisis is still lingering and lot
of uncertainties are awaiting them with the deepening of painful
reforms and adjustments in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, reforms and adjustments are the only option for the
troubled East Asian nations to clean the mess in their houses.
</P>
<P>
Since a Thai currency crisis spread to other parts of East Asia
last July, the regional financial markets have been in a terrible
mess. Currencies and stocks in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Japan have fallen to their
record lows in years.
</P>
<P>
Facing the worst crisis in three decades, Thailand, Indonesia
and South Korea have turned to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for help. The IMF has put together international bailout
packages for them totaling over 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Admitting its misjudgment of the impact of the turmoil, the IMF
recently painted a gloomy picture for East Asian economies hit by
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In its interim World Economic Outlook last month, the IMF
predicted the Japanese economy will grow by only 1.1 percent in
1998 compared with 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
It slashed its growth estimate for South Korea by 3.5
percentage points to 2.5 percent, and reduced Indonesia's by 4.2
percentage points to 2 percent. Thailand, where the trouble began
last July, will see no economic expansion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although some economists described the IMF's forecast as too
pessimistic, growth is almost certain to be much slower in the
region in the year because most regional economies have entered a
period of adjustments.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, East Asian countries will restructure their
economies by reforming their fiscal systems, keeping monetary
policy tight and overhauling weak financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
All these move are aimed at eliminating the risks that have
caused the crisis and bringing about a quick and strong recovery,
economists said.

Last month, the Japanese government announced an economic plan
that will cut income tax by two trillion yen (15.29 billion
dollars) and inject 10 trillion yen of public funds into the
banking system that has recently been rocked by bank and
securities-firm failures.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the plan should alleviate concerns
about Japan's economy, though economists warned the nation's
problem is far from over with these measures.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, the Malaysian government worked out a self-reliant
plan to rescue the country's economy. The government decided to
bail out some ailing companies and force restructuring in others.
</P>
<P>
It will postpone infrastructure projects worth 17 billion
dollars, lower the current-account deficit from 8 percent of GNP
(gross national product) to 4 percent. Of 37 banks in the country,
the weak will be forced to merge with the strong.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the government last week also resorted to
belt-tightening measures to deal with the crisis, though they came
a bit late as some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration's tough cost-cutting plan for the new
year include suspension of implementation of new capital projects,
suspension of acquisition of new equipment and motor vehicles,
suspension of foreign trips by government employees, and
suspension of payments of honoraria, overtime payment and
additional benefits to state personnel.

The austere plans of Malaysia and the Philippines will
unavoidably affect daily life of their people. But for Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, which have received IMF bailout
packages, their reforms and adjustments are more painful as
everything must be done under IMF conditions.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the 57 billion dollar bailout package offered
by the IMF came with a stiff price of austerity. The country must
keep a tight budget policy so as to relieve burdens of costs on
the restructuring of the finance system.
</P>
<P>
It must narrow tax-break benefits, raise rates of special
excise taxes, transportation taxes and others so as to expand
taxation sources.
</P>
<P>
That is still not enough. South Korea must also slow its
economic growth rate to 3 percent, the slowest in about 20 years;
reduce the current account deficit to below 1 percent of GNP; push
inflation rate below 5 percent; allow domestic interest rates to
rise, and maintain a flexible foreign exchange system.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF pressure, 14 financial institutions in South
Korea were suspended, while many banks and conglomerates will have
to undertake massive cutbacks and lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Indonesia are expected to take the same bitter
pills offered by the IMF in the course of economic adjustments.
The Thai government said last month that it will liquidate nearly
all 58 insolvent finance companies shut down by the central bank,
beginning the biggest ever revamp of the nation's financial
system.
</P>
<P>
As the reforms and adjustments are all austere in nature, the
actions taken by the governments are likely to leave 2 million
people unemployed in the year and create some social problems.
</P>
<P>
However, in a year or two, when adjustments in the region
complete, East Asian economies will become stronger and healthier,
and the social problems will disappear, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Family Sues Georgian Diplomat in Fatal Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The family of a 16-year-old
girl killed in a drunken driving crash here early this year filed
two civil lawsuits today against a Georgian diplomat, who was
found responsible for her death, and the Republic of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court and the District
of Columbia Superior Court by the family of Joviane Waltrick,
seeking 15 million U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
Gueorgui Makharadze, 36, a former diplomat for the Republic of
Georgia, whose nation waived his immunity, pleaded guilty in
October to one count of involuntary manslaughter and four counts
of aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian diplomat was sentenced on December 19 to seven to
21 years in prison for the death of Waltrick in the January 3
crash.
</P>
<P>
It will be at least six years before Makharadze, formerly the
second-highest ranking diplomat in the Georgian Embassy, is
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
The case had stirred debate about diplomatic immunity, which
was waived in the case by Georgia, a former Soviet republic.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Bulk Shipping Firm Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bulk Shipping Company of the
China Ocean Shipping Group (COSCO), the largest bulk goods
shipping firm in the country, was founded in north China's Tianjin
Municipality today.
</P>
<P>
COSCO, the country's leading shipping company, has made it part
of its strategic efforts to reorganize its fleet to improve
management and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to its reform plan, COSCO branches will
specialize: Tianjin in bulk goods, Shanghai in containers, Dalian
in oil and Guangzhou in sundry goods.
</P>
<P>
The new-born COSCO Bulk Shipping Company has been based in
COSCO Tianjin, while the name of COSCO Tianjin will remain as well.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Wei Jiafu told Xinhua recently that the company
has more than 100 bulk cargo vessels with a tonnage of more than
two million tons and a staff of 11,000.
</P>
<P>
Wei, captain of ocean-going ships for 16 years, had led several
other big shipping companies and took the present post two years
ago. He said that local shipping firms have to adopt modern
managerial methods and make decisions in a scientific manner to
compete on the international market.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, a Decision-Making Support System jointly
developed by his company and the Dalian Maritime University will
also be put into use as of today.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Approve Iraqi Food Distribution Plan Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan would approve Iraq's food and medicine distribution
plan next week, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said today.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the plan, which is originally expected by
Friday this week, is postponed because the annexes to the plan did
not come to the U.N. headquarters in New York from Baghdad until
Wednesday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The plan details how Iraq will distribute food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies among its people under the so-called
oil-for-food program, which began last December.
</P>
<P>
The program, which aims to relieve Iraqi people from the
suffering caused by the seven-year sanctions imposed by the U.N.,
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N Security Council is expected to consider whether to
raise the amount of oil that could be sold by Iraq after Annan
submits a report to it late in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- 1998 is expected to be "a year of
economic adjustments" for East Asia, where reforms and adjustments
aimed to combat a financial crisis have already started and will
be in full swing in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, people celebrate a new year with great joy and
best wishes. But that is not the case for some East Asians when
1998 approaches. They are embracing the new year with mixed
feelings, as the six-month-old crisis is still lingering and lot
of uncertainties are awaiting them with the deepening of painful
reforms and adjustments in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, reforms and adjustments are the only option for the
troubled East Asian nations to clean the mess in their houses.
</P>
<P>
Since a Thai currency crisis spread to other parts of East Asia
last July, the regional financial markets have been in a terrible
mess. Currencies and stocks in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Japan have fallen to their
record lows in years.
</P>
<P>
Facing the worst crisis in three decades, Thailand, Indonesia
and South Korea have turned to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for help. The IMF has put together international bailout
packages for them totaling over 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Admitting its misjudgment of the impact of the turmoil, the IMF
recently painted a gloomy picture for East Asian economies hit by
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In its interim World Economic Outlook last month, the IMF
predicted the Japanese economy will grow by only 1.1 percent in
1998 compared with 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
It slashed its growth estimate for South Korea by 3.5
percentage points to 2.5 percent, and reduced Indonesia's by 4.2
percentage points to 2 percent. Thailand, where the trouble began
last July, will see no economic expansion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although some economists described the IMF's forecast as too
pessimistic, growth is almost certain to be much slower in the
region in the year because most regional economies have entered a
period of adjustments.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, East Asian countries will restructure their
economies by reforming their fiscal systems, keeping monetary
policy tight and overhauling weak financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
All these move are aimed at eliminating the risks that have
caused the crisis and bringing about a quick and strong recovery,
economists said.

Iser Bem then closed the gap on his way to the top of a hill

<HEADLINE> U.S. Balloonist to Make Third Around World Try </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Adventurer Steve Fossett
plans to lift off from a sports stadium on Wednesday night in his
third try for a non-stop balloon trip around the world.
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Fossett will sail into the night air
above Busch Stadium in downtown St. Louis between 6 p.m. and 9
p.m. CST (2400 GMT to 0300 GMT Thursday). The trip would last
about 15 days if successful.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Fossett, a stock options broker, set a record
for time and distance in a balloon last January with a six-day,
16,000-kilometers trip from St. Louis to India. One of the factors
that topped his trip was fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
This time he is carrying 50 percent more fuel and his balloon
is 28 percent larger at 350,000 cubic feet (9,800 cu meters).
</P>
<P>
He will burn an ethane and propane fuel mixture to heat air
surrounding the helium encapsulated in the mylar-coated balloon

VIENNA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A men's World Cup Alpine skiing
giant slalom, previously scheduled to be held in the Austrian town
of Hinterstoder on January 6, has been moved to another venue,

<P>
CANBERRA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard has declared next
month's Constitutional Convention a "once-in-a-century
opportunity" to review the Constitution, boosting hopes the event
can lead to a wide-ranging reform.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Federal cabinet documents released Thursday confirm that
Harold Holt's government in 1967 sought constitutional power to
make laws for aborigines solely for their benefit, which cast
fresh doubt on Prime Minister John Howard's government's argument
that it has the power to legislate both for the benefit or
detriment of aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
The Canberra Times
</P>
<P>
-- Australia had reached the limit on what it could provide for
the war in Vietnam, the federal government told the United States
in 1967, according to government papers released under the 30-year
secrecy rule by Australian Archives.

<HEADLINE> US Index of Leading Indicators Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A key measure of future
economic activity rose for the fifth straight month in November,
indicating that the economy will continue expanding into the early
stage of the new year, the Conference Board said today.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based private research group said the Index of
Leading Indicators rose 0.1 percent to 104.6.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said six of the 10 components in the
leading index fell, adding a hint of caution to the report.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets paid little attention to the report in light
trading ahead of the New Year's holiday. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 7.72 to 7,908.25, trimming 1997's gain to
1,459.98 points. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which began
rising before the report, was up slightly as yields fell below 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic expansion is nearing the end of its seventh year,
making it the third-longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
In its report today, the Conference Board said big-ticket orders
to manufacturers, excluding defense contracts, were the biggest
contributor to November's rise in the leading index, followed by
growth in the money supply.
</P>
<P>
But stock prices, hurt in November by worries about the effect
of Asia's economic problems on American companies, and new orders
for consumer goods were among the index's six components that fell.
</P>
<P>
The leading index rose 0.1 percent in October and 0.3 percent in
September.

<HEADLINE> US Surplus in Services Trade Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. surplus in services
trade is headed toward 90 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 from 80
billion dollars in 1996, the Journal of Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
High-tech companies in the United States brought home 2.3
billion dollars in income from their direct investments in
services operations abroad in 1996, more than 13 times the 1990
level, the paper cited Commerce Department figures.
</P>
<P>
This was achieved when income from all U.S. foreign direct
investments grew 64 percent to 95.1 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
High-tech services produce more related U.S. exports than other
activities abroad, the paper quoted an American Electronics
Association source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Services trade includes trade in travel, telecommunications,
royalties and licensing fees, and banking, financial and computer
services.
</P>
<P>
The services trade surplus is believed to play an important
role in the trade balance of the United States when its trade
deficit stands high.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip shares on Wall

yet still fruitful year.
</P>
<P>

1,570.36 today, boosting 1997's gain to 279.33 points, or 21.6
percent.
</P>

All three measures, which have more than doubled since the
start of 1995, have now risen at least 20 percent for three
consecutive years, an unprecedented string.
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.91 to
511.19, up 30.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Advancing issues outpaced decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
NYSE, with 1,844 up, 1,112 down and 471 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 465.72 million shares as agains 498.87
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
No clear trend for the new year could be seen as most stocks
drifted in the last session of 1997.
</P>
<P>
There was limited reaction to today's economic news, which
included a report showing that a measure of future economic
activity unexpectedly rose in November, the fifth straight monthly
increase.

<HEADLINE> US Investors' Interest in Equities Grows: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investors are generally
optimistic about the 1998 stock market after increasing their
exposure to equities in 1997, a survey found.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two percent of investors surveyed said the stock market
will be higher at the end of 1998 than it was in November when the
survey was conducted.
</P>
<P>
The survey was done by OppenheimerFunds, Inc., one of U.S.
leading mutual fund companies, which released a report today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 551 investors surveyed, 55 percent said they have their
portfolios allocated in domestic stocks or stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three percent of investors said they increased the
percentage of their portfolios invested in domestic stocks or
stock mutual funds in the last six months when news about the
Asian financial turmoil has spread globally.
</P>
<P>
However, investors remain wary of investing overseas: 49
percent of them do not think it is important to include
international stocks and bonds in a portfolio while 85 percent of
investors believe that it is important to have a diversified
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
About three-fourths of the investors polled said they did not
plan to change the mix of their portfolios in the next six months.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Gives New Year Good Wish Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
gave this evening his New Year good wish message to the French
people, in which he stressed the need to fight crimes and
unemployment in France.
</P>
<P>
In his first public address to the nation since he began to
co-habit with the leftwing parliament majority in June, Chirac
also appealed to the French people for a rally in preparation for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-four months only separate us from the year 2000. Time
is speeding, changes multiplying, mentalities evolving, and
frontiers becoming blurred. We live in a time of uncertainty and
difficulty, but also rich of promises and possibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there exists too much violence in schools, streets
and in public transport, which has become one top worry of the
French people together with unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Each day, the limits are broken beyond which the society will
break up. It is today, I know, with unemployment, your primary
worry," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government would play its role in cracking
down crimes and punish those who break the law, which he said is
the primary guarantee of freedom.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all French citizens to take up their
responsibilities to protest the republic values of France and be
attached to the principle of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to the extreme-right National Front,
Chirac called on the French people to reject all the ideas which
endanger the unity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is never and will never be the addition of
communities existing one by the side of another. The public
balance sheet is never and will never be of particular interests,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called on the French people to better contribute to
the construction of the European Union by becoming more flexible
in their way of thinking and more creative.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a French ambition: free the force and the
energy of our people, create the conditions of richness and
activity so that all Frenchmen can profit from it by creating more
jobs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Hostage-Taker Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The 42-hour Texas hostage
standoff ended today when the knife-wielding man surrendered to
police after freeing his ex-girlfriend and their two young
daughters whom he took hostage near Dallas, local media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
James Riccardo Lipscomb, 38, released the hostages from a
duplex apartment in the north Dallas suburb of McKinney where he
had held them since Monday night over a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
After 42 hours of standoff with police, Lipscomb walked out
the back door of the McKinney apartment with his hands in the air,
kneeled down and was quickly arrested by heavily-armed police.
</P>
<P>
All the hostages, Denise Roach and the three children, aged 7,
9 and 12, were led away to safety.
</P>
<P>
The surrender came about two weeks after Lipscomb's younger
brother, James Monroe Lipscomb Jr., took 80 children and five
adults hostage at a day-care center in the nearby suburb of Plano.
</P>
<P>
That standoff was also triggered by a domestic dispute with an
estranged wife but ended peacefully after 30 hours.
