COACH SENDS LAKERS TO THE MOVIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ What does the story of a neo-Nazi skinhead
have to do with the Lakers' pursuit of an NBA championship?
</P>
<P>
   Only Lakers coach Phil Jackson knows for sure, and presumably,
his players have some idea now. Jackson employed one of his unique
teaching methods Thursday evening, splicing scenes from 1998's
``American History X'' into the team's usual film session.
</P>
<P>
   It was up to the players to decipher the lessons as they applied
to basketball, and to the Lakers' first-round playoff series
against the Sacramento Kings, which begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was basically just letting us know that we've got
to tighten it up, got to be a lot more focused, got to know what
we're dealing with and be ready to step up to the challenge,'' said
Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty good,'' said Shaquille O'Neal. ``It
made us shift our minds every now and then. The parts of the movies
that he threw in, they were giving us like subliminal messages. You
have to be smart to understand a guy like Phil.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie features Ed Norton as a reformed skinhead who, having
undergone a transformation in prison, tries to prevent his younger
brother from making the same mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lively distraction from basketball nonsense,'' Jackson said,
playing coy about the message he was trying to send.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say it has something to do with your past, and also
something to do with your future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson claimed he had a difficult time finding the right film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with the movies. I have to speak to some of the
producers and directors in Hollywood about the motivational choices
that I had,'' he quipped. ``Actually, it wasn't a bad group of
pictures to look from, `The Green Mile' and so forth. But the
ultimate result is I didn't find anything that really fit the bill
for all of our players. `The Matrix' is another one that I thought
had something to do with being `in the moment,' that kind of play
that we were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's some things I think that go into this that are
individual, and there are some things that are collective for the
group. And more than anything else, I never show the film clip more
than five minutes during the course (of the film session). We do
mostly basketball work and we skip around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a teaching method Jackson employed during his tenure with
the Chicago Bulls, and one he hopes to use again in the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've usually used three (movies) during the course of the
playoffs. Hopefully we go that long and we can use three movies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW START: The Lakers held their longest, hardest workout in
weeks on Friday, trying to recoup the precision that was missing in
losing the last two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that pleased,'' Jackson of the practice. ``We
couldn't keep the flow going, it was such a long practice. And
sometimes that happens. ... But guys stuck with it. Their energy
was good. ... Most of all, we have to recondition ourselves after
really backing off on our conditioning for the last week. So we
were pushing a little bit on that end of it, and I think we
accomplished what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAQ STATEMENT: O'Neal, addressing his Wednesday scuffle with
San Antonio's David Robinson for the first time, said the elbow he
put in Robinson's chest was not intended as a statement. It had
been suggested that O'Neal was sending a message after taking
several hard fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't saying anything,'' O'Neal said. ``I think our focus
is going to be on Sacramento. And if (the Spurs) are around in the
second round, then I'll answer those questions. I do things that I
want to do, not because I'm trying to retaliate or trying to hurt
somebody. I just do it because I want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Were the hard fouls from Robinson a message to O'Neal?
``Probably. Just something I have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: Bryant attended his media session with a massive
bag of ice taped to his sprained right wrist and admitted the
injury has affected his shooting ``a little bit.'' But Bryant
insisted it would not be a concern come game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sunday the adrenaline will be rushing a little too
much. I don't think I'll really think about it,'' he said. ``It
can't get any worse. The pain is pretty consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's only injury-related concern Friday was backup guard
Derek Fisher, who had to sit out part of practice because of
soreness from a bone spur in his right ankle. &QL;

POLICE ID VICTIMS LINKED TO SUSPECT IN SERIAL KILLINGS

<P>
   SPOKANE _ They were daughters, sisters and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   They included the wayward teen who strayed from a life of music
and good grades; the 39-year-old grandmother who volunteered her
time at two local hospitals; the check-out clerk at a local
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Each was tangled in a life of drugs or worked as a prostitute.
Investigators say they were all killed by the same man: Robert Lee
Yates Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, authorities officially released the names of a dozen
women they say were killed by Yates, an Army helicopter pilot and
father of five.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from Yates directly links him to nine of those
victims. Each had been shot and dumped in remote areas in Tacoma
and Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other evidence now being analyzed likely ties Yates
to at least three more victims, investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police are also trying to determine whether Yates killed as many
as six other women. Five were found dead in Spokane; another in
Kitsap County.
</P>
<P>
   However, because at least five of those women were killed before
Yates moved to Spokane in 1996, investigators say someone else
could be responsible for those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Yates, 47, was charged with killing
16-year-old Jennifer Joseph, of Spanaway.
</P>
<P>
   Yates remains in custody under suicide watch at the Spokane
County Jail in lieu of $1.5 million cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Fasy, the veteran public defender assigned Thursday to
represent Yates, said Friday he hasn't ruled asking that a trial be
moved out of Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer,'' Fasy said. ``Any capable attorney would
consider a change of venue in a case like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Yates is charged with one count of first-degree murder.
Steve Tucker, the county prosecutor, said he is not in a rush to
file the other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police released the names of the 12 women they suspect were
killed by Yates at a press conference near Yates' South Hill home.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement brought some sense of closure for Kathy Lloyd.
For two days, Lloyd has stood behind a crowd of reporters waiting
for investigators to release the names. She wondered if her
sister's name was among them.
</P>
<P>
   She got her answer shortly after 10 a.m.: Shawna McClenahan, a
former hospital worker found dumped in rural Spokane the day after
Christmas 1997, is among the nine tied to Yates through his DNA,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to hear her name,'' Lloyd said, ``I needed to
know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary detectives who have worked around the clock here for more
than a week looked forward to spending Easter Sunday with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which could take at least two years to
complete and cost millions of dollars, has slowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yates' arrest Tuesday, detectives have focused their
attention around the split-level beige house. They erected a mesh
wire fence and blue tarp around the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Yates lived in the East 49th Avenue home with his wife, Linda,
and four of their five children since March 1997. His wife, an
11-year-old-son, and four daughters, have been put up in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Another 22-year-old daughter did not live with the family.
</P>
<P>
   A county chaplan is keeping the children up to date on their
school work. officials have also provided the family with food and
clothing and are soliciting donations for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to treat the family with a lot of empathy and
sympathy,'' said Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, detectives for the first time began processing
evidence inside the home. They completed a first round of
sophisticated mapping on the home's interior with Total Station
devices, camera-like equipment that will create a 3-D map of the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also have painstakingly combed the tidy yard.
Investigators marked many ``areas of interest'' with little white
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said Friday they still looking for at least four more
cars Yates has owned or has been known to drive. They include a
1980 orange or red Mustang that Yates owned for a short time in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The list of automobiles already siezed by investigators includes
three Hondas, a Ford pickup truck, two vans, and a white Corvette
that broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Corvette, detectives found a and blood that
investigators linked to Joseph, the 16-year-old prostitute who was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Yates served 18 years in the military. He worked from 1995 to
1997 assembling elctronics components at a local business. Most
recently, he worked for $13 an hour as an overhead crane operator
at the Kaiser Aluminum smelter in Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Alger, a neighbor who lives across the street from him, said
Friday that Yates often played catch with his children and taught
them how to ride bicycles outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all appearances, he was a very, very normal fella,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alger said Yates sometimes worked on cars, too. He remembered
him tinkering on the white Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that flashy car that broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Carey told investigators that she saw Joseph in a car
that looked like a white Corvette a few days before Joseph's body
was found in August 1997. Joseph was in it with a white man in his
30s or 40s, she told them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began frequenting local Corvette owners clubs.
They obtained registrations from every Corvette owner in Washington
and Idaho, dumping hundreds of names into a computer database. They
put out alerts to police to watch out for white Corvettes. They
also alerted police to write down any suspicious stops they made in
areas known for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two Spokane police officers took note of those alerts. The month
after Joseph's killing, an officer stopped Yates in a white
Corvette a few blocks from where Joseph was last seen. The officer
wrote down the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, another police officer stopped Yates after he
picked up a known prostitute. The officer didn't cite him, but he,
too, wrote the incident down.
</P>
<P>
   Those two routine reports helped spring Yates name from the
database, investigators said. But it took time. The Spokane
Homicide Task Force didn't have the budget to pay for a computer
analyst, making it difficult to sift through the database.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in September last year, detectives began puting the
connections together. They called Yates in for questioning.

JUSTICE OFFICIALS HOLD OUT HOPE FOR ACCORD ON ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (ADDS grafs 4-8 with details of talks; DELETES original 4th graf;
ADDS attribution to 12th graf)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinging to what appeared to be a frail hope for a
last-minute settlement of the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez,
Justice Department officials said Friday night that unnamed
intermediaries were working on an agreement under which the boy's
Miami relatives would immediately turn over the child to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The department said in a statement that ``outside parties in
Miami are in the process of putting together a plan for a
cooperative resolution that would include the immediate transfer of
Elian to his father's care.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who the unnamed parties were _
although some officials identified them as Miami political leaders
_ or whether the proposed agreement would be acceptable to the
Miami relatives, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, or the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said an out- line of the plan had been sent
to lawyers for the Miami relatives and a lawyer for Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Friday night, they said, Attorney General
Janet Reno tele- phoned Gregory Craig, the father's lawyer, to
discuss the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said it was un- clear whether either side
would agree to the proposed arrangement. Under the terms of the
proposed deal, officials said, Elian and his father would live
together probably in the Washington, D.C., area, but not at the
home of the Cuban diplomat where the father has stayed since he
arrived in the United States two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a counteroffer, Elian's father rejected a proposal that the
relatives live with the father and son while the appeals court
decides whether the child can remain in the United States, but
proposed to allow the boy's Miami relatives to make scheduled
visits with the child.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the evening, Reno remained at her office, shuttling
in- formation between Elian's father at the office of his lawyers
and repre- sentatives of the relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A day that began with Justice Department officials dourly
resigned to using force to retrieve the child ended with the
unexpectedly buoyant prospect that unofficial efforts might succeed
where the government had failed.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father met earlier Friday with Attorney General Janet
Reno in what officials described as an emotional plea for his son,
but Reno emerged saying she could offer no specific timetable for
their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that throughout the day that Reno held
out the possibility, however remote, that the Miami relatives would
at last yield to the government's demands to relinquish the boy,
realizing that she was poised to use force to obtain custody of the
child.
</P>
<P>
   But people who have been follow- ing the case said that those
fragile hopes seemed to collapse after a private meeting between
the Justice Department community relations officials in Miami and
Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and his daughter,
Marisleysis, who has helped care for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, they said, department officials offered Elian's
Miami relatives a final chance to negotiate the boy's surrender to
authorities. But the relatives stood their ground, unrelenting in
their refusal to give up the boy unless his father came to Miami to
get him _ precisely the same conditions that led to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, Reno and Doris Meissner, the
immigration commissioner, met for about 15 minutes with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, the boy's father, who has asked that the government
fulfill its commitment to deliver Elian to him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez left the department looking grim as officials said the
meeting was an emotional session in which the father pleaded to be
reunited with his son, saying that he and his child had suffered
through the long custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, in a written statement, Reno said that she
had little optimism. ``I could not commit to a particular course of
action or timetable,'' she said. ``I was deeply moved by Mr.
Gonzalez's evident love for his son. I assured him I would continue
working toward the goal of reuniting him with his child.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Reno told reporters that she still hoped to
resolve the stand-off. ``I'm exploring every possibility I can to
see this resolved peacefully, promptly and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was ready to dispatch federal agents to take the
child, Reno replied, ``If I were going to do something like that, I
certainly wouldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   As the possibility of a peaceful solution ebbed away, Reno's
advisers seemed to have little advice left to give, relying on
outside parties to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Reno sat in her fifth-floor office at the Justice
Department agonizing about whether and when to send a team of
federal agents to retrieve the child from the home of his
great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' defiance of government threats to take him
forcibly energized the demonstrations in the neighborhood where
Elian has been staying since he was rescued from the Atlantic last
Thanksgiving after his mother and others drowned in an attempt to
flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez, several hundred
Cuban-Americans continued to bask in Wednesday's court victory but
remained concerned that the government might try to remove the boy
and reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is that they'll try to get the boy at night,''
said Carlos Hernandez, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might try to fool us. They might say one thing and do
another, so you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exiles, however, were determined to prevent efforts to
take the boy. Dozens of people, rosaries in hand or carrying wooden
crosses, prayed for divine intervention. Others chanted, ``Elian,
my friend, God is with you,'' in Spanish. Still others vowed to
give their lives should government agents appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought for this and we won't get up,'' said Reynaldo
Ramos, 57. ``We won't leave until this thing is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd periodically was buoyed by the appearance of the boy,
who would scramble into the yard and wave to admirers before
ducking back into the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian, you won't go! Elian, you won't go!'' the crowd chanted
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno remained reluctant throughout the day to give the
final authorization to begin the operation, immigration officers
and federal marshals readied a plan to sweep unannounced in the
Little Havana neighborhood after days of surveillance to gauge when
they were likely to encounter the least resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the operation could come at any time
over the weekend or early next week. The officials acknowledged
that any tactical maneuver would probably be complicated by the
increasingly vocal protesters who gathered Friday in the
neighborhood and said they would form a human chain to stop
authorities from removing the boy.
</P>
<P>
   As efforts to resolve the issue progressed, some Florida
political leaders sought more time for mediation. In a letter to
President Clinton and Reno, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican,
said that negotiations should be given another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said using force was ``unwise and unwarranted'' and that
``mediation not confrontation is what is in young Elian's best
interest at this critical point in time.''

POLICE ID VICTIMS LINKED TO SUSPECT IN SERIAL KILLINGS

   SPOKANE _ They were daughters, sisters and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   They included the wayward teen who strayed from a life of music
and good grades; the 39-year-old grandmother who volunteered her
time at two local hospitals; the check-out clerk at a local
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Each was tangled in a life of drugs or worked as a prostitute.
Investigators say they were all killed by the same man: Robert Lee
Yates Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, authorities officially released the names of a dozen
women they say were killed by Yates, an Army helicopter pilot and
father of five.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from Yates directly links him to nine of those
victims. Each had been shot and dumped in remote areas in Tacoma
and Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other evidence now being analyzed likely ties Yates
to at least three more victims, investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police are also trying to determine whether Yates killed as many
as six other women. Five were found dead in Spokane; another in
Kitsap County.
</P>
<P>
   However, because at least five of those women were killed before
Yates moved to Spokane in 1996, investigators say someone else
could be responsible for those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Yates, 47, was charged with killing
16-year-old Jennifer Joseph, of Spanaway.
</P>
<P>
   Yates remains in custody under suicide watch at the Spokane
County Jail in lieu of $1.5 million cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Fasy, the veteran public defender assigned Thursday to
represent Yates, said Friday he hasn't ruled asking that a trial be
moved out of Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer,'' Fasy said. ``Any capable attorney would
consider a change of venue in a case like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Yates is charged with one count of first-degree murder.
Steve Tucker, the county prosecutor, said he is not in a rush to
file the other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police released the names of the 12 women they suspect were
killed by Yates at a press conference near Yates' South Hill home.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement brought some sense of closure for Kathy Lloyd.
For two days, Lloyd has stood behind a crowd of reporters waiting
for investigators to release the names. She wondered if her
sister's name was among them.
</P>
<P>
   She got her answer shortly after 10 a.m.: Shawna McClenahan, a
former hospital worker found dumped in rural Spokane the day after
Christmas 1997, is among the nine tied to Yates through his DNA,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to hear her name,'' Lloyd said, ``I needed to
know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary detectives who have worked around the clock here for more
than a week looked forward to spending Easter Sunday with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which could take at least two years to
complete and cost millions of dollars, has slowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yates' arrest Tuesday, detectives have focused their
attention around the split-level beige house. They erected a mesh
wire fence and blue tarp around the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Yates lived in the East 49th Avenue home with his wife, Linda,
and four of their five children since March 1997. His wife, an
11-year-old-son, and four daughters, have been put up in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Another 22-year-old daughter did not live with the family.
</P>
<P>
   A county chaplan is keeping the children up to date on their
school work. officials have also provided the family with food and
clothing and are soliciting donations for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to treat the family with a lot of empathy and
sympathy,'' said Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, detectives for the first time began processing
evidence inside the home. They completed a first round of
sophisticated mapping on the home's interior with Total Station
devices, camera-like equipment that will create a 3-D map of the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also have painstakingly combed the tidy yard.
Investigators marked many ``areas of interest'' with little white
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said Friday they still looking for at least four more
cars Yates has owned or has been known to drive. They include a
1980 orange or red Mustang that Yates owned for a short time in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The list of automobiles already siezed by investigators includes
three Hondas, a Ford pickup truck, two vans, and a white Corvette
that broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Corvette, detectives found a and blood that
investigators linked to Joseph, the 16-year-old prostitute who was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Yates served 18 years in the military. He worked from 1995 to
1997 assembling elctronics components at a local business. Most
recently, he worked for $13 an hour as an overhead crane operator
at the Kaiser Aluminum smelter in Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Alger, a neighbor who lives across the street from him, said
Friday that Yates often played catch with his children and taught
them how to ride bicycles outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all appearances, he was a very, very normal fella,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alger said Yates sometimes worked on cars, too. He remembered
him tinkering on the white Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that flashy car that broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Carey told investigators that she saw Joseph in a car
that looked like a white Corvette a few days before Joseph's body
was found in August 1997. Joseph was in it with a white man in his
30s or 40s, she told them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began frequenting local Corvette owners clubs.
They obtained registrations from every Corvette owner in Washington
and Idaho, dumping hundreds of names into a computer database. They
put out alerts to police to watch out for white Corvettes. They
also alerted police to write down any suspicious stops they made in
areas known for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two Spokane police officers took note of those alerts. The month
after Joseph's killing, an officer stopped Yates in a white
Corvette a few blocks from where Joseph was last seen. The officer
wrote down the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, another police officer stopped Yates after he
picked up a known prostitute. The officer didn't cite him, but he,
too, wrote the incident down.
</P>
<P>
   Those two routine reports helped spring Yates name from the
database, investigators said. But it took time. The Spokane
Homicide Task Force didn't have the budget to pay for a computer
analyst, making it difficult to sift through the database.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in September last year, detectives began puting the
connections together. They called Yates in for questioning.

SECURITY FACES REVIEW AFTER A LAPTOP VANISHES
</HEADLINE>
  (This story is now an added starter to Page 1 of New York Times)  
 (ADDS note about inclusion on Page 1) 
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department is considering a
reorganization of its security system after a laptop computer
vanished from an intelligence office with highly sensitive files
about weapons proliferation, a senior administration official said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators have not yet determined that the laptop
was stolen, its theft would represent the highest possible breach
of classified material, officials said. The computer contained
files designated `code-level', a status beyond top secret.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright may recommend stripping
the Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research of its ability
to manage its own security and place it under the aegis of the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state is furious about this incident,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I've rarely
seen her as angry about anything as this case.'
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is leading an investigation into the disappearance of
the laptop, which was reported two months ago by the Office of
Intelligence and Research. The office, which is under the direction
of Assistant Secretary of State J. Stapleton Roy, a former
ambassador to China, is the department's main source of
intelligence data and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The incident stirred an outcry among some Republican lawmakers.
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, the chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, said it was the latest in ``a long string of
security failures'' at the State Department, including the recent
discovery of a eavesdropping device in a conference room that was
believed to be placed by Russian spies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to elaborate on the contents of the missing
material, except to confirm that it involved sources and methods
relating to weapons proliferation, including data gathered by
satellites and human and electronic sources. New details of what
may have been contained in the laptop were reported by The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Intelligence and Research has been under fire for
lax security for several years, including those under the direction
of Roy's predecessors. Department officials had recently considered
and rejected a proposal to transfer the bureau's security to the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which protects diplomats and foreign
dignitaries and fights terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department internal audit in December found that the
department had allowed contractors and maintenance staff members to
wander around the building without escorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, who plans to hold hearings into the recent breaches,
said the department lacked a ``professional environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign policy analysts attributed the security problems to
a culture that is somewhat resistant to onerous security measures
and to sweeping cutbacks in the department's overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when there are ever greater demands on the department
_ and need for more diplomatic missions in the wake of the breakup
of the Soviet bloc _ Congress has steered resources away from
diplomacy and into law enforcement and counterterrorism operations,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has ordered an internal review of the Department's
security procedures. David Carpenter, the assistant secretary for
diplomatic security, is leading a team of security specialists from
various federal agencies in that study. The results are expected
soon.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Albright said she was ``continuing to study the
possible need for structural changes to ensure that the mandate for
the best security is everywhere understood and everywhere
applied.''

HERSHISER GOES TO BULLPEN, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Orel Hershiser was signed to pitch out of the
bullpen, and now he's there. For how long, though, is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said lefty Carlos Perez will start
Sunday's series finale against Cincinnati, right-hander Darren
Dreifort will throw Monday in New York and, providing everything
goes well with bullpen sessions the next two days, Kevin Brown will
return Tuesday in his native Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown, on the disabled list with a broken right pinkie, can't
pitch Tuesday, Hershiser would make the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it kind of fits having Orel backing up Brownie,''
Johnson said. ``Then I don't have to impact five other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   How long the plan remains intact is a question, particularly
given Perez's fragile existence in the rotation and the waning
patience of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers set him up to succeed, which Perez acknowledges.
They held him back from starting against Houston earlier in the
week and will throw him against a Reds team that has left-handed
Ken Griffey Jr., Sean Casey and Eddie Taubensee in their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good idea not to use me against Houston
because they don't have enough lefties in the lineup,'' said Perez,
who is 1-1 with a 5.65 ERA. ``Cincinnati has a bunch of lefties.
That's why I don't complain anymore of `Why are they doing this?
Why are they doing that?' Whatever they do to me is not a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences of failure could be dire for Perez. He's
pitched adequately with a big lead in a win against San Francisco
and settled down to pitch moderately well in relief after Hershiser
hit four batters and allowed seven runs in 11/3 innings Wednesday
against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the time issue. With five years of major-league
service, a player must accept a minor-league assignment. Perez
reaches five years May 6.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson said he's also looking down the road at having
a lefty in the rotation against Arizona and St. Louis during a
grueling four-city road trip in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel (Perez) is getting enough work to where he can locate
better, change speeds better, pitch out front,'' Johnson said.
``And he did that after that first (outing in Montreal).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also wanted Dreifort to pitch against the Mets based on
past success. Dreifort held them to two hits (though he walked
eight) in five innings two weeks ago. Eric Gagne and Chan Ho Park
make up the rest of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I end up in the bullpen for awhile, I don't think it's a
surprise because that was the role I was kind of signed to,'' said
Hershiser, who's 1-1 with an 8.76 ERA. ``If I end up in the
rotation, that's not a surprise, either, because I've done that my
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want Brown to have his normal outing, and Johnson
said he doesn't want his ace pitching in New York, where he was
injured. Also, Brown's been successful against the Braves _ he's
4-2 with a 2.18 ERA in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brown said he's not ready to declare himself back in
the rotation until his bullpen sessions are complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) just wants back out there,'' Johnson said. ``You talk
to him long enough, and he says, `I don't want to mess up everybody
else, either.' But we still don't even know until (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   LARKIN INJURED, HAS SURGERY: Reds shortstop Barry Larkin had
surgery on the middle finger of his left hand after injuring it
while diving after Mark Grudzielanek's single in the second inning.
Larkin tore a ligament in the finger and is expected to miss 2-4
weeks. He was placed on the disabled list, and Gookie Dawkins was
expected to be added to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: The umpiring crew's equipment was lost on its
flight from Toronto to Cincinnati, delaying the start of the game
27 minutes. The Reds had to buy equipment for them from a local
sporting goods store. ... Left fielder Gary Sheffield's right ankle
still hasn't healed, though he continues to play. It swelled during
the flight from Los Angeles to Cincinnati and was still swollen
before the game with the Reds. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leaders of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, who were
on the verge of gaining approval to build a $500 million casino in
the Catskills, have turned their back on that plan and signed a
highly unusual agreement with the largest gambling company in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would turn over exclusive rights to build, develop and
manage any Mohawk casinos in New York state to the company, Park
Place Entertainment, the owner of three casinos in Atlantic City,
according to copies of the agreement given to The New York Times by
people who deal with the tribe. Those rights could be worth
billions of dollars, gambling industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the impoverished Mohawks would receive a $3 million
loan and a large percentage of the profits from any casino,
although some industry experts doubt that Park Place will ever
build a Mohawk gambling hall. That is one of the many unanswered
questions surrounding the deal. It is unclear, for example, whether
the agreement would stand up to federal scrutiny or a challenge by
the tribe's original casino partners. &UR;  &LR; The company says in the
agreement that it will begin building a ``gaming facil- ity''
within 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the agreement _ negotiated by Arthur M.
Goldberg, the chief executive of Park Place Entertainment, with the
help of former U. S. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato _ will almost
certainly delay the coming of any casino to the Catskills for
years. Some analysts question whether that was the intent.
</P>
<P>
   The Catskill Development Group, which had planned to donate 30
acres to the tribe for a casino in Monticello, N.Y., in return for
a share of the revenue, learned only Thursday night about the
secret agreement, which was signed by six tribal chiefs and
Goldberg on April 14. Robert Berman, a partner in the development
group, which said the tribe was being misled by what he said were
Goldberg's promises to build a casino in the Catskills within four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest rip-off of an Indian tribe since the
Dutch grabbed Manhattan for $24,'' Berman said. ``We hope that the
tribe will understand that Park Place is a wolf in sheep's clothing
whose true intention is to kill the casino in Monticello to protect
their interests in Atlantic City. The tribe is selling out its
future for a $3 million loan. But I still believe there's an
opportunity for the tribe to salvage this.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said he believes the tribe could renounce the Park Place
deal on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump and other Atlantic City casino operators _ but not
Goldberg _ have spent millions lobbying in Albany against the
Monticello casino, which they believe would cut into their profits
by attracting gamblers from New York City and northern New Jersey.
Analysts have said the Monticello casino would draw 9.3 million
visitors a year and generate more than half a billion dollars a
year in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Goldberg nor the company's general counsel, Clive
Cummis, returned telephone calls Friday requesting comment. Both
men were at the Mohawks' Akwesasne Reservation Friday on the
Canadian border in Hogansburg, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gus McDonald, the tribe's executive director, and the six chiefs
who signed the agreement also did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal clerk, Carol Herne, and a former Mohawk chief,
Barbara Lazore, both said they were appalled by the deal with Park
Place. The two women said they confronted Goldberg at a restaurant
on the reservation Friday, where he was meeting with the tribal
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow this project to go down the drain,'' Lazore
said. ``I don't believe they're here to help the Monticello
project. It'd be the No. 1 competition to Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   Casino gambling is unconstitutional in New York, but sovereign
Indian lands are an exception. Only 16 days ago, the federal
Interior Department approved a four-year-old proposal in which
Berman's group would get around the constitutional problem by
giving the federal government 30 acres next to the Monticello
Raceway in trust for the Mohawks. The Monticello casino plan is now
awaiting approval by Gov. George Pataki and, possibly, the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Berman's application was approved in Washington,
Mohawk tribal leaders were being wooed in secret by Goldberg and
his adviser, D'Amato, according to tribal executives, rival casino
operators and Catskill Development. The six tribal chiefs signed
the Park Place agreement without consulting the lawyers the tribe
had hired to work on gambling issues, according to two tribal
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to add a whole new dimension to an already complex
situation,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Pataki. ``We'll
need to review the document closely. It appears to have some
significant implications.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a longtime adviser to Goldberg, is also close to the
governor. The former senator did not return calls, but Wayne
Berman, D'Amato's partner, said their consulting company ceased
representing Park Place on April 14, the day the agreement was
signed with the Mohawks. Wayne Berman, who is no relation to Robert
Berman, declined to discuss D'Amato's work on behalf of Park Place.
An official in the Pataki administration said that D'Amato had
stepped down as Park Place's consultant to prevent his friendship
with the governor from putting Pataki in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Place deal with the Mohawks is unusual, experts said,
because Indian tribes routinely grant casino development rights for
specific locations, but experts say that no tribe has ever given
exclusive rights to as large a territory as New York state.
</P>
<P>
   In return for granting Park Place exclusive development rights,
tribal leaders received a $3 million loan from the casino company
``for use by the tribe in its discretion.'' The tribe presumably
would use the money to bolster its small money-losing casino in
Hogansburg, where the Mohawks recently ousted the existing operator
as part of a separate deal with Park Place. The Mohawks would also
get 70 percent of the profits from every casino, after Park Place
is reimbursed for any advances.
</P>
<P>
   The casino development agreement would not cover the Hogansburg
casino or a proposal that just surfaced last year for a Mohawk
casino in Green County.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, an analyst with Bear Stearns, said Goldberg was
playing a shrewd game of chess. On the one hand, he said, Goldberg
could be using the prospect of a first-class casino in the
Catskills to scare off other companies that are considering
building new casinos in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, does he ever want to get it built?'' Ader
said. ``With one-third of his profits coming from Atlantic City,
the expansion of gaming in New York could be detrimental to this
franchise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the Mohawks want new casinos to
provide the tribe with money and jobs. Unemployment on the Mohawks'
Akwesasne reservation ranges from 35 to 40 percent. But the
year-old casino on the reservation in Hogansburg loses about
$300,000 a month. This week, the tribe ousted the operator, Ivan
Kaufman, a Long Island businessman. The tribal leaders plan to
operate that casino themselves, under a separate consulting
agreement with Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this month, one tribal executive
expressed concern that Alpha Entertainment, a gambling company that
is working with Catskill Development, would not gain the approval
of the National Indian Gaming Commission, which oversees casino
management contracts signed by Indian tribes. Desperate to avoid
another Hogansburg catastrophe, the tribal leaders looked to the
largest casino operator in the world for salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simply buying out Alpha Entertainment and replacing
it, however, Goldberg sought to take over completely. But one
tribal adviser said that Goldberg's promise to build a casino for
the tribe in Sullivan County within four months was absurd. The
Interior Department approved a specific proposal at the Monticello
Raceway. Any new proposal would have to undergo environmental and
regulatory approval, which could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning whether Park Place's promises to the tribe could
ever be delivered, one Mohawk adviser said, ``The chiefs are so
obsessed with the on-reservation casino that they've lost sight of
the larger picture.''

TODD WEBB, 94, PERIPATETIC PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mich., N.M., Ariz.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Webb, a photographer who documented the everyday life and
architecture of New York, Paris and the American West, died April
15 at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. He was 94 and lived
in Auburn, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Solid and dignified, with a sharp focus and full tonal range,
Webb's works placed him squarely in the company of renowned
American regionalist photographers of the 1930s, '40s and '50s like
Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, Ansel Adams and Edward Weston during
his later landscape period. Quiet and unassuming, Webb was fond of
saying that the secret to taking a good picture was simply knowing
where to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Detroit, Webb spent his childhood there and in a Quaker
community in Ontario. At the onset of the Depression in 1929, he
moved to California, where he earned a meager living as a
prospector. He eventually returned to Detroit, where he took a job
with Chrysler Corp. and tried writing in his spare time. When a
friend invited him to travel to Panama in search of gold, Webb was
granted a leave of absence by his boss, who sent him on his way
with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s his fascination with the medium flourished as
he honed his skills at the Detroit Camera Club and under the
tutelage of Ansel Adams. After obtaining a job as a Navy
photographer during World War II, with the help of Adams, Webb
moved to New York with a friend, the photographer Harry Callahan.
He soon established himself as one of the most successful postwar
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his career, Webb traveled to Paris, where he
met his wife, Lucille, a New Yorker, and produced a vivid record of
the city that earned him comparisons to the French photographer
Eugene Atget. Later the Webbs settled in Santa Fe, N.M., at the
suggestion of their friend Georgia O'Keeffe, before moving on to
Provence in France, Bath in England, and finally Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, armed with his camera, a 40-pound rucksack and a
Guggenheim fellowship, Webb set out in the footsteps of the 1849
Gold Rush pioneers, traveling by foot, bicycle, motor scooter and
boat from New York to San Francisco. Over the course of five months
he compiled some 7,500 photographs, immortalizing the immigrant
trails, ghost towns and frontier buildings of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen the country as I never had before,'' he wrote in
The New York Times about his adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's photographs are displayed in 25 major museum collections,
including those of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the
National Gallery of Art in Washington. More than 1,400 of his
pictures are held by the Center for Creative Photography at the
University of Arizona in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife.

   Ray Vicker, an author and former foreign correspondent for The
Wall Street Journal, died on Wednesday at a nursing center in
Tucson. He was 82 and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   Vicker was the London bureau chief for The Journal from 1960 to
1975, covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He joined the
paper in 1950 and retired in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   His books, many drawn from the headline news of the day,
included ``Those Swiss Money Men'' (1973), ``Kingdom of Oil _ The
Middle East: Its People and Its Power'' (1974), ``Realms of Gold''
(1975), ``This Hungry World'' (1975), ``Dow Jones-Irwin Guide to
Retirement Planning'' (1985) and ``The Informed Investor'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   Born in Wisconsin, Vicker attended Wisconsin State University
and Los Angeles City College before serving in the United States
Merchant Marine. He attended Northwestern University in the late
1940's.
</P>

   His wife of 56 years, Margaret Ella Leach Vicker, is his only
immediate survivor.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BELLOW WRITES ON, WRESTLING WITH EDWARD SHILS'
GHOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (Eds: Word in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new novel from the Nobel laureate Saul Bellow generates
interest just about everywhere _ but nowhere as intensely as at the
University of Chicago and the surrounding neighborhood of Hyde
Park, where Bellow was a fixture for 30 years before decamping to
Boston University in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the living rooms and coffee shops of Hyde Park, novel readers
have always seemed less interested in Bellow's philosophical
opinions than in sleuthing out the evidence of the ex-wives,
faculty colleagues and former friends who are routinely caricatured
and kidnapped into his pages.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde Park is in a swivet this spring about Bellow's newest
novel, ``Ravelstein.'' The slender epic is roughly a novelized
version of the life of the neoconservative writer Allan Bloom, who
died in 1992. In this book Bellow outs Bloom, the author of the
influential best seller ``The Closing of the American Mind,'' and
suggests that he died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals are crying ``betrayal,'' even though they disliked
Bloom and would have been pleased to have his scalp while he was
alive. Conservatives are seething at the novelist for invading the
privacy of one of their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The media coverage of ``Ravelstein'' has focused on Bloom. But
more experienced Bellow-watchers have been drawn to a character in
this novel who is blatantly based on the sociologist Edward Shils,
a longtime colleague of Bellow at the University of Chicago's
vaunted Committee on Social Thought.
</P>
<P>
   Shils was a force at the university in general and the committee
in particular for 45 years, right up to his death in 1995 at the
age of 84. During my years of study at Chicago, some students
referred to him as ``Mr. Shils'' even talking among themselves at a
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Shils cut a distinctive figure on the street. He never left his
apartment without a suit jacket, tie, hat and one of his
distinctive walking sticks. He was bullishly built with a reddish
complexion, wisps of white hair and a blunt, peremptory manner. He
could be warmly solicitous and was immensely generous with time,
money and ideas. But he expressed displeasure in a terse,
aphoristic style that carried a devastating punch.
</P>
<P>
   When a contributor to Shils' academic journal rejected some
editing as a matter of ``taste,'' Shils shot back: ``Yes, it is
only a matter of taste _ good vs. bad taste.'' When his colleague
Allan Bloom made a splash with ``The Closing of the American
Mind,'' Shils said that this muddled, poorly argued tract would
better have been called ``The Closing of  &UR; An &LR;  American Mind.'' As
Joseph Epstein puts it, Edward Shils ``was death on intellectual
fraudulence.''
</P>
<P>
   Shils cast an enormous shadow over Bellow's life _ as mentor,
character model and editor _ and figures prominently in the best of
Bellow's novels, including ``Mr. Sammler's Planet'' in 1970. In it,
Bellow borrowed from him to create Artur Sammler, a watcher of the
world who notes everything and is surprised by nothing. Shils also
edited the typescript, in that green Dunhill ink for which he had
long been famous at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Shils is affectionately portrayed as Professor Durnwald in the
1975 novel ``Humboldt's Gift,'' in which Bellow describes him as
one of the most learned men in the world and writes: ``In crude
Chicago, Durnwald, whom I admired and even adored, was the only man
with whom I exchanged ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   This warm friendship had dissolved by the time ``Humboldt's
Gift'' reached the bookstores. People who knew both men say that
Shils had tired of being caricatured in the novels, that Bellow was
angered that the man he ``admired and adored'' did not take him
seriously as an intellectual _ and even that the two of them had
argued over a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity reaches lethal proportions in ``Ravelstein,''
where Bellow insinuates that the Shils character, Rakhmiel Kogon,
is a closeted homosexual, and describes him as having ``tyranny
baked into his face.'' Perhaps to explain the change of heart,
Bellow writes: ``The arts of disguise are so well developed that
you are sure to undercount the number of bastards you have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest we miss the reference, Bellow gives Rakhmiel Kogon the
Shilsian walking stick and his famous green ink.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary dead man would have no choice but to go quietly into
the next life. But Shils has never been ordinary. When Bellow's
biographer, James Atlas, publishes the writer's biography next
fall, the book will have been shaped to some degree by none other
than Edward Shils, who read a draft _ annotating it in that famous
green ink _ and disgorged on his death bed a 16,000-word editing
memorandum. In revising the book, Atlas told me recently, ``I sat
at the keyboard with this memo, communing with a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   We have known for half a century what Bellow thinks of Shils.
Come the biography, perhaps we can glimpse, at least after a
fashion, what Shils thinks of him.

EDITORIAL: CONNECTICUT'S CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 22:
</P>
<P>
   The cause of campaign reform has long commanded broad support in
Connecticut. Last week the Legislature passed an ambitious bill to
impose voluntary limits on campaign spending, require disclosure of
donors and provide public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would go a long way toward cleaning up the state's
politics, which were marred by a scandal involving a former state
treasurer last year. However, Gov. John Rowland has said he finds
the bill flawed and may not sign it. Rowland should sign, and if
necessary work to correct any problems that emerge as the measure
is put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, a Republican, has never made campaign reform a major
issue, and like many members of his party he is skeptical of the
idea of public financing of campaigns. But the traditional
Republican argument against using taxpayers' money for politics is
undercut by many polls showing widespread popular support. In any
case, the money for campaigns would come from a taxpayer checkoff
on tax forms, which is how federal funding of presidential
campaigns has worked for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut approach is creative. Statewide candidates would
receive significant subsidies, and legislative candidates would get
money only if their opponents exceeded spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The governor cites the fact that few Republicans supported the
measure when it was going through the Legislature, which is
controlled by Democrats. But among Connecticut Republicans,
campaign reform is a strong issue. Rep. Christopher Shays is a
champion in Congress, and Sen. John McCain won the Connecticut
primary by making reform a centerpiece of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that a bill on campaign reform gets through any
legislative body. Rowland should approve the measure, and if any of
the spending limits are unworkable, as he suggests, he can try to
change the law in the future. For now, he should honor the desire
of Connecticut citizens to give reform a chance.

SLUMPING RANGERS SUCCUMB TO TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One of the cardinal rules for a big-league
pitcher, right up with ``throw strikes'' and ``keep the ball
down,'' is ``retire the side in order the inning after your team
takes a lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark violated the rule last night, and he and the Rangers
paid dearly.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for the rules violation was a 10-5 loss to the
Minnesota Twins last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat ended a 13-game winning streak against the Twins
dating to Sept. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the monkey off our back,'' Twins manager Tom Kelly
said. ``We hadn't beaten them in 17 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It also extended the Rangers' losing streak to a season-worst
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we're not playing very well,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``We're not getting hits at crucial
times of the ballgame, we're not making pitches at crucial times,
we're not making defensive plays at crucial times, and the manager
isn't making the right decisions at crucial times.''
</P>
<P>
   The record will show Twins first baseman Ron Coomer clubbed the
Rangers into submission with two homers and seven runs batted in,
including a game-clinching three-run shot in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer might not have had a chance to be a hero, though, if
Clark had made the pitches in the crucial sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored two runs in the fifth to take a 5-3 lead,
which given their recent history against the Twins appeared to be
plenty.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark, who was 7-0 with a 2.62 earned-run average in his
career against Minnesota, walked Butch Huskey on four pitches to
lead off the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like a sin,'' Clark said. ``Your team goes ahead and
you walk the first guy on four pitches. I wanted to shoot myself. I
was trying to throw it right down the middle, and I couldn't throw
a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   He threw a strike to Midre Cummings, but he doubled. Clark threw
a wild pitch to allow Huskey to score, and Coomer then singled to
drive in Cummings with the tying run and knock Clark from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Munoz came in and gave up a single and a ground ball that
allowed Coomer to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you score two runs to take the lead, the last thing you
want to do is walk the leadoff guy,'' Oates said. ``Then boom,
boom, two base hits later, we're behind again.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed the whole complexion of the game.
</P>
<P>
   If Clark did the job in the sixth, Oates could play matchups
with his bullpen in the seventh, go to setup man Tim Crabtree in
the eighth and closer John Wetteland in the ninth. Instead, he had
to go to the bullpen early and use his relievers in positions he
doesn't like to.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz had to finish the sixth and start the seventh, and gave up
a run on two hits. Right-hander Francisco Cordero pitched two
scoreless innings to get the game to the ninth, but instead of
Wetteland in the game with a lead, lefty Mike Venafro was in with a
deficit. It grew when he served up Coomer's three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   The bad outings by Clark, Munoz and Venafro came at a bad time.
Justin Thompson is close to returning from his rehabilitation
assignment, and when he comes back Oates said it could impact the
entire pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't get too comfortable,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark lost for the first time after two victories, but his ERA
rose to 7.47. Thompson could take his spot in the rotation as early
as May 2.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Rangers continuing to lose, Munoz (16.87 ERA) and
Venafro (7.20 ERA) could feel some heat to keep their jobs if they
don't start performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our left-handers aren't getting too many people out right
now,'' Oates said.

BRETT HULL _ WHO ELSE _ SCORES THE WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars winger Brett Hull hadn't been talking lately. He
said he didn't have anything to say, felt he had been struggling a
bit, too.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days ago, though, he winked that sly wink he has and
said: ``I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, just when you think Hull is dead and buried, he comes
bouncing back, scoring the goals he loves to score _ Cup-clinching,
series-snatching, game-winning, and always dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's was the series-snatching variety, a wrist shot to
propel the Stars past the Oilers, 3-2, in Game 5 of first-round,
best-of-seven series. With a snap of his wrist, he sent the Oilers
back to Edmonton and the Stars to the second for the third
consecutive summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is just a mistake and a hell of a shot by
Hull,'' Oilers coach Kevin Lowe said. ``He has an uncanny ability
to do squat the whole game and come up with big goals late.''
</P>
<P>
   The puck slipped over Oilers goalie Tommy Salo's shoulder with
5:02 remaining in the game, not to mention Edmonton's season. The
play began when center Joe Nieuwendyk, who finished with two
assists, skated across the blue line. He left a drop pass for Hull,
who unleashed the wrist shot that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I am supposed to do,'' Hull said. ``That's my job.
I live to score goals. ... I just shot that one, to be honest with
you. It was a big one for everyone. The last thing we wanted to do
was go back to Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will play Colorado or San Jose, depending on who wins
the Sharks-Blues series. The Sharks lead 3-2 with Game 6 scheduled
for tomorrow in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of good teams right now, and we are one of
them,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``This is a confidence builder for us to
get out in five and get a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to fight and claw for every inch of it, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of the Oilers. That's the beauty of what Hull
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, we got Brett Hull,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``The difference is one shot by a player who can score goals.
He has scored some big goals for this organization, and he did it
again. That was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the game-winning goal came off the stick of Hull as time
dripped away in Period No. 3. But the Stars were in the game
because of the saves made by Stars goalie Ed Belfour up until that
point.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us celebrate our birthdays by blowing out candles on a
cake.
</P>
<P>
   On his 35th birthday, Belfour extinguished the Edmonton Oilers
instead. On the verge of elimination, the Oilers threw everything
they had _ wrist shots, slap shots, bouncing nubbers _ at him in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Belfour was done with the Oilers, all that was left
was the end-of-series handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 24 saves, including eight in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was huge tonight,'' Stars forward Kirk Muller said. ``It
was one of the best games he's had in the series. He made every big
save tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Edmonton, they refused to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had a 2-1 lead heading into the third period. Twenty
minutes was all that stood between them and the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers forward Jim Dowd ruined that one minute and seven seconds
into the period. He banked a shot in off Stars defenseman Derian
Hatcher's skate to tie the game at 2-all.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second Stars lead they erased.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took a 1-0 lead at 5:35 of the second period on a goal
by Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner, his first of the series.
Believe it or not, it was on the play. They finished the series
2-for-26 with a man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They actually had a five-on-three. But as Oilers winger Bill
Guerin scrambled out of the box, Mike Modano floated a pass down to
Nieuwendyk alongside the Stars' net. Nieuwendyk faked a shot and
instead hit Langenbrunner in the deep slot.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers winger Todd Marchant tied the game at 12:45 of the second
period when he tapped his own rebound past Belfour. It wasn't two
minutes later that Stars captain Derian Hatcher sent a wrist shot
flying past Salo for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it stayed until Dowd did his work.
</P>
<P>
   So back and forth they went, trading chances and trading panic.
Edmonton is, after all, the team that upset Dallas in the first
round in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty emotionally draining,'' Stars winger Brenden
Morrow said. ``And in a back and forth game like that, it comes
down the stretch. It would've been easier on us if we would've had
a couple-goal cushion. It was close right to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the spot Hull was signed for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everybody knows that's he's got the gun and he
can change a game,'' Muller said. ``Tonight's it's a tight game and
all of a sudden `Boom.' '' nn

CARDINAL MAHONY OFFERS EASTER COUNSEL TO L.A. DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Can the road to inner peace be found on the
gridlocked 101-405 interchange? Cardinal Roger Mahony raised this
provocative message Friday in his Easter message.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic head of the Los Angeles archdiocese _ the
nation's largest, located in the fatherland of America's freeways _
issued an Easter message highlighting where believers can ``remove
obstacles, lower barriers and eliminate roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   People need to consider how to resolve conflicts in their
families, with neighbors and at work. And on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the obstacles we encounter on our freeways _ not
the construction delays but those frayed nerves that often cause us
to lose our tempers and take it out on fellow motorists,'' Mahony
said. ``How do I allow Easter grace to bring me a deeper sense of
peacefulness and patience?''
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders joined the chorus of transportation officials
applauding Mahony's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things that can happen to us as individuals
is the loss of our temper,'' said Rabbi Harvey Fields of the
Wilshire Boulevard Temple. ``I often point out that Moses didn't
make it into the promised land because of his loss of temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Fields acknowledged with a laugh, Moses didn't
have to traverse the 405-101 interchange on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Fields said. ``I was at a couple of Seders this
week where people were late because they were stuck on the 405. I
sympathize with drivers. But we have to be patient with one another
when we are put in these kinds of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Capt. Greg Meyer, commanding officer of the
Valley Traffic Division, praised Mahony's driving message as being
long needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a continuing problem and I very much applaud the
cardinal's emphasis on the issue,'' Meyer said. ``It does cost
lives. It does cost injuries. And it does cost property damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is people get frustrated with the amount of
traffic, they get in a big hurry and then someone cuts them off.
They react in an immature fashion and get mad, and suddenly it's a
war zone out there. It's a crowded world out there and we all have
to make a little room for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Mahony's message was also about tolerance and
celebrating the ethnic diversity of the city and eliminating racial
division.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Mahony is overseeing construction of a new
cathedral near one of the nation's busiest freeways. Once
completed, patrons of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels
downtown will need all the patience they can muster to drive to it
on the Hollywood Freeway.

   BUSH-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) _ In an extraordinary retreat
from traditional Republican tenets, Gov. George W. Bush has in
recent weeks advocated an expansion of the federal role on programs
ranging from education to low-income housing to health care. And he
has made overtures to constituencies, like gays and gun-control
proponents, that have never been mainstays of his own party. Yet
what is most striking about Bush's repositioning in the nine weeks
since the South Carolina primary, when he presented himself as an
unflinching conservative, is that prominent fiscal and social
conservatives _ many of whom have been outspoken about past
nominees _ have been silent. Not one leading conservative

HERGES, ELSTER HELP DODGERS BEAT REDS, 9-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Matt Herges mistook the count and thought he had
walked, so he jogged down to first _ only to learn it was ball
three. He struck out on the next pitch and afterward wondered just
how embarrassing the blunder was to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Not with the Herges household in attendance to watch the
30-year-old pitcher win for the first time in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Herges' masterful streak continued with another unreal relief
effort, pitching two hitless innings before Kevin Elster broke open
the game with a ninth-inning grand slam as the Dodgers beat
Cincinnati 9-2 Friday at a cold, damp Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   After 300 appearances in minor-league games, all in the Dodgers'
organization, and another 23 with the Dodgers, Herges (1-0) finally
has a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to sit back and enjoy, but I can't,'' said Herges,
who's allowed three hits and no runs in 11 innings this season. ``I
still have a lot of options, I still could get sent down, so a lot
of things can happen. I am enjoying it, believe me, but I can't
rest on it. No way, because that's when the hits start coming, and
the runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the moment more memorable for Herges was the presence of
seven family members, including his brother, Toby, who has been a
source of inspiration. He is recovering from brain cancer surgery,
and the family made the trip from nearby Champagne, Ill., to watch
Matt and the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful for a lot of things,'' Herges said. ``One, I make
the roster. Two, I get in that opening-day game and (manager) Davey
(Johnson) keeps throwing me out there. I'm grateful, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges began the season as nothing more than an insurance policy
in case a few of the Dodgers' starters were rocked. His quick
bounce-back arm made him a natural for long relief and blowouts,
but his performance pushed him into more meaningful moments.
</P>
<P>
   So when starter Eric Gagne's pitch-count rose to 117 after four
innings, Herges was called upon with runners on first and third,
one out and the Dodgers leading 5-2. And on his second pitch,
switch-hitting Dmitri Young grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric doesn't have that pitch to get that ground ball, where
Herges does the sinker to get the ground ball,'' said catcher Todd
Hundley, who was a triple shy of the cycle. ``The last couple of
days I found some keys to my swing. I was kind of lost for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer was his third of the season and Mark
Grudzielanek and Adrian Beltre added two-run singles for the
Dodgers. Terry Adams pitched the final two innings for his second
save.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gagne didn't last long enough to earn the decision, he
did stem Cincinnati's momentum in the second inning by working out
of a mess. Reds starter Steve Parris (1-3) doubled with the bases
loaded to pull Cincinnati within 3-2 with none out.
</P>
<P>
   But Gagne struck out Pokey Reese and Mark Lewis, walked Ken
Griffey Jr. and struck out Sean Casey with the bases loaded to end
the inning. Gagne tied a career-high with eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a pretty tight game there for a little bit, and to
get (Gagne) through those tough innings, that's big,'' Hundley
said. ``Herges is throwing the ball harder, hiding the ball. His
ball has a lot more action on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges and Adams made the Dodgers' 5-2 lead stand until recently
recalled Reds reliever Norm Charlton went wild in the ninth. He
walked the bases loaded and Elster nailed the first pitch he saw
and drove it deep into the left-field seats for his third career
grand slam, and first since Aug. 5, 1996, when he did it against
the Chicago White Sox as a member of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get behind in the count (against Charlton)
because he's got such a nasty split-finger (pitch), so I was just
jumping on the first fastball I saw,'' Elster said. ``He got it up,
and fortunately I got a good piece of it.'' &QL;

JURY RULES DISNEY USED COERCION ON DYING EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  BURBANK, Calif. _ In another legal blow to the house of Mickey
Mouse, a federal jury ruled Friday that the Walt Disney Co. coerced
a dying executive into forfeiting his valuable company life
insurance policy, accrued vacation time, a cash bonus and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moral victory. This is the appropriate verdict,'' said
Larry Sackey, an attorney for the estate of the late Robert Jahn, a
senior vice president who worked for nine years at Disney Motion
Pictures &AMP; Television Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this corporation gets the message. It shouldn't conduct
business like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit claimed that Jahn _ a disoriented 54-year-old executive
lying in his hospital deathbed, his body ravaged by AIDS _ was
threatened with being exposed for taking kickbacks unless he signed
away millions of dollars in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He had no attorney by his side, and no loved ones to protect
him, the suit said. Three weeks later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson will decide later how much
Disney owes. The benefits alone total about $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn, who died in May 1994, reportedly left some of his money to
his father and a sister of his late male companion. Most of
whatever comes out of the lawsuit will go to charity, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Disney gets its way there won't be anything to
distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe they are going to get any money at all,''
said Disney lawyer John Quinn. ``The fact is that the jury found
that we relied on a promise that (Jahn) made (to give up his
benefits), and that's the end of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Jahn's lawyers disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it will impede the amount of damages we will
receive,'' Sackey said. He quickly added: ``This is not a case
about money. This is a case about making a point.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, witnesses called by Disney argued
that Jahn had agreed to waive the benefits before his death to
avoid being fired for taking kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted Jahn bilked the company out of $5.7 million by
allowing subcontractors to overbill for services. They charged he
illegally funneled more than $300,000 to his companion by forcing
one of the vendors to hire the man at an inflated salary.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn should have been fired, and ``would have been fired'' and
handed over to police if he had not been sick, Quinn told jurors
before the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was showing compassion, Quinn said. The company kept the
scandal quiet to save a dying man's reputation and allowed him to
stay on the payroll so he could receive medical benefits. In
exchange, Quinn contended, Jahn agreed to sign away his other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the jurors unanimously rejected Disney's case in favor of
the tragic story line told by the plaintiffs' lawyers _ the
gut-wrenching saga of an AIDS-stricken employee who was robbed by
the greedy company he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jahn's estate denied he ever took kickbacks. Jurors
agreed, after listening to witnesses who testified that Jahn worked
tirelessly to produce movie previews and television commercials for
the studio's movies, mostly family films.
</P>
<P>
   Disney attorneys pointed to a finding by the jury that the
company ``justifiably (relied) to its detriment on a promise by
Robert Jahn to give up his nonmedical benefits.'' Jury forewoman
Michele Antonatas said panelists were confused by the language
contained in the finding, which is nonbinding, but clarified that
she and the seven other jurors intended to deliver a verdict for
the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney had no right to deny Mr. Jahn those benefits,'' the
Long Beach accountant said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge once dismissed the lawsuit amid concerns about
the kickbacks. But a federal appeals court reinstated the suit in
January 1999. The court ruled that the circumstances of the
deathbed waiver _ including Jahn's frailty and the money Disney
stood to gain _ raised a possibility that Disney exerted excessive
pressure to get the deal done.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that there were no witnesses to the
waiver, that Jahn had not consulted his attorney, and perhaps most
important, that Disney knew its former employee was ``desperate to
avoid further disclosure of his alleged professional misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury should be allowed to decide whether the waiver was legal
and binding, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total victory for us,'' said Gregory Hafif, another
lawyer for Jahn's estate. ``Disney forced Mr. Jahn, who had only
weeks to live and was weakened by this terrible disease, to do
something he didn't want to do _ something he didn't have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney was on the losing end of another high-profile case last
spring when a court referee said the company breached its fiduciary
duty and owed former studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That case was highlighted by Chairman Michael Eisner's admission
that he might have aimed the statement ``I hate the little midget''
at Katzenberg, who said he was owed $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides settled without disclosing how much money Disney
paid to Katzenberg.

VIEWERS ABANDON HYPE, SENSATION OF TV NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Eds: L.A. Daily News Staff Writer Jason Kandel contributed to
this story  
 &HT;    
 &HT;     By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Coming up next! A story that we'll promote
endlessly without telling you what happened! Live at 11!
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds familiar, then you probably agree with the 28
percent of TV viewers who said in a new nationwide survey that
local television news promotions are misleading and downright
irritating.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found 45 percent believe local TV unduly
sensationalizes the news, and 10 percent now refuse to watch any
news shows _ twice as many as a decade ago. In some metropolitan
areas, the figure was as high as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense among a large portion of the audience that the
stations just don't respect their intelligence,'' said Scott
Tallal, whose marketing research firm, Insite Media Research of
Malibu, conducted the scientific phone survey of 402 people in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Television news directors and anchors said they have gotten the
poll's message and are working to tone down coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the appetite for what was acceptable has changed,''
said Jose Rios, news director of KTTV (Channel 11).
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer have a `Hard Copy' or `A Current Affair.'
There's a reason people got tired of it. I think local news
stations, many of whom do a fairly credible job, are looking to
continue doing that. And some of them who were involved in hype are
less so now.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bell, news director at KCBS (Channel 2), said the survey
points out questions he and his colleagues grapple with every
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ignore the viewers, they're going to ignore us,'' he
said. ``I don't think there is a station in town that wants this.
There's constant discussion in our newsroom: `Did we write the
story properly? Did we write the promotion properly?' This is
what's called journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope every newsroom in town does that. Are we human? Do we
make mistakes? Yes, we do. Things move fast in television. There's
a lot of pressure on TV to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, many people still watch local television news in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Nielsen ratings, for the February 2000 sweeps period,
shows the top station at 1 p.m., KNBC (Channel 4), got an 8.1
rating _ or about 405,000 homes. Each point represents 50,000 local
households.
</P>
<P>
   According to one expert, that number is down significantly from
the 1970s when he said the presentation of TV news was more
straightforward, honest and sober.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, it was common for a station to have a 12 or 14
Nielsen rating, said Joe Saltzman, who worked for CBS news and now
is associate dean of the University of Southern California's
Annenberg School for Communication.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that loss is due to more competition from more
newscasts, plus cable, satellite and the Internet, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the loss in viewership is a result of frustration
and irritation over promotions and sensational coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to choke them,'' said Saltzman. ``I've thrown things
at the TV set, I've been so angry.''
</P>
<P>
   When Saltzman worked in TV news, the promos at least explained
the story, he said. For example, they would say that ``The Dodgers
won tonight. We'll have details at 11,'' instead of ``The Dodgers
played tonight. We'll tell you what happened at 11.''
</P>
<P>
   He said today's style was an effort by station owners to win
over a younger, hipper audience _ one presumed to have a shorter
attention span _ rather than the older viewers who long were the
mainstay of TV news. But what happened, he said, is TV lost older
viewers without making up the loss with younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They alienated that audience and kicked it in the shins and
chased it away,'' Saltzman said. ``And you can't get it back now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, about half of today's viewers said they
don't care which station they watch, indicating a declining loyalty
to particular newscasts and anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irritating,'' said Bryce Neff, 75, a retired West Hills
resident. ``Some of the stuff sounds very important when they give
you a little bit _ then you're supposed to wait around for four
hours to hear the rest of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice has driven Neff, a retired attorney, to switch away
from viewing the major network stations and start watching Fox
affiliate KTTV, which he says is not nearly as annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Another study found in 1998 much more positive opinions about
local TV news.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation
suggests that the public relies on and trusts local television
news. Sixty-six percent of viewers deemed local television news to
be excellent or good, while only 8 percent gave it a grade of poor.
</P>
<P>
   Insite typically conducts confidential studies for television
news and entertainment companies, none in Los Angeles. Insite
conducted this study, at a cost of about $20,000, to draw attention
to an issue that affects all its clients, Tallal said. Insite's
clients were given the results privately in November.

STANFORD DODGES DISASTER, BEATS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's baseball team managed to beat the odds
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans loaded the bases three times without scoring a run
as they fell to No.4 Stanford 4-1 in a Pac-10 game in front of 825
at Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   USC (27-16, 8-6) stranded 10 runners total and had its most
dubious shortcoming in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Stanford (30-10, 10-4) holding a tenuous 2-1 lead, the
Trojans seemed done in the inning after Beau Craig grounded into a
double play, but they loaded the bases with two outs on a single,
an infield error and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bruksch, who relieved Jason Young, struck out USC's Bill
Peavey on a 3-2 pitch to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   After Craig Thompson hit a two-run home run in the ninth to pad
Stanford's lead, Bruksch earned his conference-leading ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have been doing that all season,'' Stanford coach
Mark Marquess said. ``Obviously we weren't real comfortable in that
situation, but we made some big pitches and we had a couple big
hits earlier in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford owed its early lead to former Camarillo High two-sport
star Joe Borchard, who singled and scored in the second inning and
hit a solo home run to lead off the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just two good pitches to hit,'' said Borchard,
splitting his spring time between baseball and football, where he
is also trying to become the Cardinal's starting quarterback. ``I
was able to stay on both of them long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard, who struck out in his final two at-bats, also hit a
home run in Thursday's loss to the Trojans. The junior
switch-hitter has 10 home runs and 42 RBI and was hitting .288
going into the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a little upset about his batting average, but he's
been doing a good job,'' Marquess said. ``He seems to be doing
better since football practice started, so maybe the football coach
deserves a little credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard's homer gave Stanford a 2-1 lead, and one run was all
the margin needed by Young. He survived a rocky first inning to
dazzle the Trojans and improve to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Trojans tagged Young for four runs in five
innings, but the junior right-hander kept USC off-balance Friday
with a piercing fastball and good movement on his breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about the way Jason pitched,'' Borchard
said. ``He got in some tough situations put he did exactly what we
needed him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans took a 1-0 lead when Craig's slow grounder got under
the glove of Stanford second baseman Chris O'Riordan. Justin Gemoll
followed with a single and Rob Garibaldi walked to load the bases,
but Young escaped by getting Anthony Lunetta to line out to short.
</P>
<P>
   Young wouldn't allow another hit until the eighth, but he did
load the bases in the fifth by plunking three Trojans with errant
pitches. With two outs, however, Craig tapped a grounder to first
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans made starting pitcher Mark Prior a tough-luck loser
again. Prior, who started the season 4-1, has not earned a victory
since March 3 and in winless in conference play.
</P>
<P>
   Prior pitched his best game in over a month. He scattered eight
hits and struck out 10, his second-best total of the season. Prior
allowed two earned runs in eight innings and left the game after
hitting Andy Topham to lead off the ninth with his 118th pitch.
</P>
<P>
   USC and Stanford conclude the three-game series today at 1 p.m.
PDT. &QL;

ANGELS PLAY LONG BALL TO BEAT TAMPA BAY, 9-6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Before Friday, the use of lumber by Mo
Vaughn and Tim Salmon didn't justify cutting down the trees it took
to make their bats.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn, Salmon and Troy Glaus made use of their wood in a
historic fashion Friday night, each hitting two home runs to power
the Angels to a 9-6 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at
Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   The six home runs tied a club record, and it was the 13th time
in major-league history _ and the seventh time in American League
history _ that three players on one team hit more than one homer in
a game. The Angels are the only team to do it twice _ Dave
Winfield, Dante Bichette and Brian Downing did it in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Salmon entered the game with one home run each all
season. But they went back-to-back in both the fourth and ninth
innings. The homers in the ninth off Roberto Hernandez broke a 6-6
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus hit his in the same innings, just one batter later. Garret
Anderson walked and struck out in his two at-bats separating Salmon
and Glaus, but Glaus hit the most impressive homer of all.
</P>
<P>
   His first homer in the fourth inning hit one of the four
catwalks that hang above the field. The ball hit the catwalk that
is 110 feet above the ground and never came down. The fans, Devil
Rays left fielder Greg Vaughn and the umpires stood in confusion
for a few moments before it was ruled a home run. It was estimated
at 470 feet, the longest home run in Tropicana Field history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never hit a home run that didn't actually go over the
fence,'' said Glaus, who leads the team with five homers. Asked
whether he's ever hit a ball harder or farther, he said, ''With a
wood bat, no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the saying, you hit a ball so hard it doesn't come
down,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``I guess we saw it
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the ninth, after Vaughn and Salmon went back-to-back for
a second time, Glaus waited his turn on deck with Anderson batting
and started thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Glaus said. ``I was standing on deck, and it's
not like I had a premonition, but after Fish (Salmon) hit his, I
said I gotta hit one now. It was a strange night. You don't see
that too often.''
</P>
<P>
   After Salmon hit his second homer, the normally stoic outfielder
had a little extra on his high-fives with teammates as he entered
the dugout. Such is the temperment of a player who had only one RBI
all season until a couple of days ago but has driven in five in the
past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just pumped up,'' Salmon said. ``I've never gone
back-to-back with a guy twice. Mo pumped me up with his home run
that gave us the lead. I haven't had a lot to get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said simply it's a matter of hitting pitches that are
meant to be hit, and he and Salmon will start hitting home runs
like they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting home runs is mainly about hitting mistakes and not
missing them,'' Vaughn said. ''Earlier in the season, guys were
missing mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Glaus' first homer, Vaughn said: ``He's got that type of
power. He's 6-foot-5, 230 pounds, he's got the leverage to show
that kind of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are strong, man, these guys are strong,'' Scioscia
said.
</P>
<P>
   After stellar outings in his previous two starts, Angels starter
Scott Schoeneweis couldn't make it out of the fourth inning Friday.
He was the third starter in a row _ joining Ken Hill and Kent
Bottenfield the previous two nights _ to get knocked out of the
game early.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis gave up six runs (five earned) and seven hits in 3
innings, but was saved by the bullpen. Al Levine (2 scoreless
innings), Mark Petkovsek (2 scoreless innings) and Troy Percival
(1-2-3 ninth, fifth save) kept the Devil Rays off the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek (1-1) got the victory, the first by an Angels reliever
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen stepped up big-time,'' Scioscia said. ``It was
great to see.'' &QL;

MADDON IS OK AFTER TRIP TO HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Bench coach Joe Maddon was released from
a hospital Friday in Tampa, Fla., after experiencing shortness of
breath and a tingling sensation in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Maddon had left SkyDome in Toronto before Thursday's game to get
checked out at a local hospital, felt better and returned for the
game. He flew with the team to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But after landing early Friday morning, Maddon, 46, felt ill
again and was taken to St. Anthony's Hospital in Tampa, where test
results were normal. He returned to Tropicana Field for the game
but did not suit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' Maddon said. ``I just didn't feel
right. I was light-headed. I knew something was wrong, but I can't
put my finger on it. I felt I had to see somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was fatigue, but I had a really strange
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Under doctor's orders, Maddon ate a big plate of spaghetti after
the game. Maddon had lost 20 pounds over the past year while on a
diet of eating proteins but no carbohydrates. He said the doctor
doesn't think the diet was the cause, but he was told to stop the
diet for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was totally on empty,'' Maddon said. ``I'm going
to eat a lot tonight and have a good breakfast tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS GREENER: It looks like real grass. It feels like real
grass. But it's not real grass.
</P>
<P>
   The turf at Tropicana Field, known as FieldTurf, is the latest
in synthetic turf technology. And according to players who have
played on it, it's just like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The turf has individual blades of ``grass'' made of a blend of
polyethylene and polypropylene. Those blades are planted in
artificial dirt, made up of ground-up crumbs of old tires, tennis
shoes and silica sand.
</P>
<P>
   The turf was first developed for golf use, for tee and chipping
boxes. Last year, the University of Nebraska installed it in their
football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is awesome,'' Scioscia said. ``I'm walking on it,
and I'm going, `Wow'. It's so far ahead of other artificial turf.
Hopefully it plays close to grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said the worst artificial turfs he played on were in
Montreal and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the worst surfaces I've ever seen in my life,'' he
said. ``Until the Steelers started to complain, they wouldn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   BACK SOON, BUT NOT TOO SOON: Gary DiSarcina is expected to be
activated from the disabled list Monday. But DiSarcina, who bruised
his left thumb April 8, will be worked back into the lineup slowly.
DiSarcina tried to come back from a broken left forearm last season
too quickly, and it hindered him all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he learned from last year, about time off and trying
to get back,'' Scioscia said. ``As hard as he's been working, he's
not going to do too much. I'll look at him as a bench guy that
hasn't had an at-bat in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been happy with the play of Benji Gil, who has
hit .263 (10 for 38) and made two errors in 12 games starting in
DiSarcina's place at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL ADJUSTING TO AL: Former Dodgers shortstop and manager
Bill Russell says he is happy in Tampa as the Devil Rays bench
coach, but he is adjusting to life in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like everybody else in the league,'' he said. ``We could
always use more pitching, especially with (Wilson) Alvarez and
(Juan) Guzman hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell spent some time with Scioscia and Angels coaches Mickey
Hatcher and Alfredo Griffin _ teammates of Russell's with the
Dodgers _ before Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD START: Pitcher Tim Belcher, recovering from offseason elbow
surgery, threw five scoreless innings in a rehab assignment game
Thursday for Single-A Lake Elsinore. Belcher gave up only one
single while striking out four and walking none.
</P>
<P>
   He'll probably make two more rehab starts before he's ready to
join the big-league club the first week in May. &QL;

   &LR;  BURBANK, Calif. _ In another legal blow to the house of Mickey
Mouse, a federal jury ruled Friday that the Walt Disney Co. coerced
a dying executive into forfeiting his valuable company life
insurance policy, accrued vacation time, a cash bonus and other
benefits.
</P>

   ``It's a moral victory. This is the appropriate verdict,'' said
Larry Sackey, an attorney for the estate of the late Robert Jahn, a
senior vice president who worked for nine years at Disney Motion
Pictures &AMP; Television Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this corporation gets the message. It shouldn't conduct
business like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit claimed that Jahn _ a disoriented 54-year-old executive
lying in his hospital deathbed, his body ravaged by AIDS _ was
threatened with being exposed for taking kickbacks unless he signed
away millions of dollars in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He had no attorney by his side, and no loved ones to protect
him, the suit said. Three weeks later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson will decide later how much
Disney owes. The benefits alone total about $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn, who died in May 1994, reportedly left some of his money to
his father and a sister of his late male companion. Most of
whatever comes out of the lawsuit will go to charity, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Disney gets its way there won't be anything to
distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe they are going to get any money at all,''
said Disney lawyer John Quinn. ``The fact is that the jury found
that we relied on a promise that (Jahn) made (to give up his
benefits), and that's the end of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Jahn's lawyers disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it will impede the amount of damages we will
receive,'' Sackey said. He quickly added: ``This is not a case
about money. This is a case about making a point.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, witnesses called by Disney argued
that Jahn had agreed to waive the benefits before his death to
avoid being fired for taking kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted Jahn bilked the company out of $5.7 million by
allowing subcontractors to overbill for services. They charged he
illegally funneled more than $300,000 to his companion by forcing
one of the vendors to hire the man at an inflated salary.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn should have been fired, and ``would have been fired'' and
handed over to police if he had not been sick, Quinn told jurors
before the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was showing compassion, Quinn said. The company kept the
scandal quiet to save a dying man's reputation and allowed him to
stay on the payroll so he could receive medical benefits. In
exchange, Quinn contended, Jahn agreed to sign away his other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the jurors unanimously rejected Disney's case in favor of
the tragic story line told by the plaintiffs' lawyers _ the
gut-wrenching saga of an AIDS-stricken employee who was robbed by
the greedy company he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jahn's estate denied he ever took kickbacks. Jurors
agreed, after listening to witnesses who testified that Jahn worked
tirelessly to produce movie previews and television commercials for
the studio's movies, mostly family films.
</P>
<P>
   Disney attorneys pointed to a finding by the jury that the
company ``justifiably (relied) to its detriment on a promise by
Robert Jahn to give up his nonmedical benefits.'' Jury forewoman
Michele Antonatas said panelists were confused by the language
contained in the finding, which is nonbinding, but clarified that
she and the seven other jurors intended to deliver a verdict for
the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney had no right to deny Mr. Jahn those benefits,'' the
Long Beach accountant said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge once dismissed the lawsuit amid concerns about
the kickbacks. But a federal appeals court reinstated the suit in
January 1999. The court ruled that the circumstances of the
deathbed waiver _ including Jahn's frailty and the money Disney
stood to gain _ raised a possibility that Disney exerted excessive
pressure to get the deal done.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that there were no witnesses to the
waiver, that Jahn had not consulted his attorney, and perhaps most
important, that Disney knew its former employee was ``desperate to
avoid further disclosure of his alleged professional misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury should be allowed to decide whether the waiver was legal
and binding, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total victory for us,'' said Gregory Hafif, another
lawyer for Jahn's estate. ``Disney forced Mr. Jahn, who had only
weeks to live and was weakened by this terrible disease, to do
something he didn't want to do _ something he didn't have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney was on the losing end of another high-profile case last
spring when a court referee said the company breached its fiduciary
duty and owed former studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That case was highlighted by Chairman Michael Eisner's admission
that he might have aimed the statement ``I hate the little midget''
at Katzenberg, who said he was owed $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides settled without disclosing how much money Disney
paid to Katzenberg.

CARDINAL MAHONY OFFERS EASTER COUNSEL TO L.A. DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Eds: Resending to correct slug. 
 
 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Can the road to inner peace be found on the
gridlocked 101-405 interchange? Cardinal Roger Mahony raised this
provocative message Friday in his Easter message.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic head of the Los Angeles archdiocese _ the
nation's largest, located in the fatherland of America's freeways _
issued an Easter message highlighting where believers can ``remove
obstacles, lower barriers and eliminate roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   People need to consider how to resolve conflicts in their
families, with neighbors and at work. And on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the obstacles we encounter on our freeways _ not
the construction delays but those frayed nerves that often cause us
to lose our tempers and take it out on fellow motorists,'' Mahony
said. ``How do I allow Easter grace to bring me a deeper sense of
peacefulness and patience?''
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders joined the chorus of transportation officials
applauding Mahony's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things that can happen to us as individuals
is the loss of our temper,'' said Rabbi Harvey Fields of the
Wilshire Boulevard Temple. ``I often point out that Moses didn't
make it into the promised land because of his loss of temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Fields acknowledged with a laugh, Moses didn't
have to traverse the 405-101 interchange on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Fields said. ``I was at a couple of Seders this
week where people were late because they were stuck on the 405. I
sympathize with drivers. But we have to be patient with one another
when we are put in these kinds of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Capt. Greg Meyer, commanding officer of the
Valley Traffic Division, praised Mahony's driving message as being
long needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a continuing problem and I very much applaud the
cardinal's emphasis on the issue,'' Meyer said. ``It does cost
lives. It does cost injuries. And it does cost property damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is people get frustrated with the amount of
traffic, they get in a big hurry and then someone cuts them off.
They react in an immature fashion and get mad, and suddenly it's a
war zone out there. It's a crowded world out there and we all have
to make a little room for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Mahony's message was also about tolerance and
celebrating the ethnic diversity of the city and eliminating racial
division.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Mahony is overseeing construction of a new
cathedral near one of the nation's busiest freeways. Once
completed, patrons of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels
downtown will need all the patience they can muster to drive to it
on the Hollywood Freeway.

ON THE LAKERS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's sizing-up-the-opposition edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers begin their playoff run Sunday against Sacramento,
and all of the alleged experts say the other 15 playoff teams have
as much chance of winning the title as Pussy of ``The Sopranos''
has of returning to next season's cast.
</P>
<P>
   Pussy became fish food in the season finale. The Lakers' season
finale was pretty dead, too, with back-to-back losses to Dallas and
San Antonio. But these were so-what games, and Phil Jackson coached
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out those last two games and a midseason nap _ six losses
in nine games _ and the Lakers went 64-7. They were 31-10 on the
road, and the team fulfilled every item on its offseason list of
things to do: Learn the Triangle Offense, play better defense and
stop the childish locker room behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of that, it's hard to envision any team capable of
winning a best-of-seven series against them. The first-round series
against Sacramento actually has more edge to it because the Kings
play without a brake and anything can happen in a short series.
</P>
<P>
   But truly, no one has the look of an upsetter.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Utah? I expect the Jazz to play hard in the first
round after last season's near miss, and Seattle isn't very good.
But all of the Rogaine in the world can't make Karl Malone and his
mates any younger. They go out in round two.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Portland? The Blazers were the hottest team in the
league until the Lakers demolished them in Portland on Feb. 29.
Jackson knows what goes on in Scott Pippen's head, so the Lakers
will likely negate him, and no one needs insight into the brain of
the new Mr. T, Rasheed Wallace (38 technical fouls).
</P>
<P>
   Others in the West? The NBA crown wobbled on the Spurs head this
season with some clubhouse bickering, and now Tim Duncan has a bad
knee. Phoenix isn't a threat without Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   The East? Top-seed Indiana was 20-21 on the road. Charlotte and
Philadelphia are intriguing, but they're unlikely to string
together three straight solid playoff series. And as much as NBC
wants to see a Lakers-Knicks final, the Knicks aren't going to
surprise anyone this season, least of all first-round foe Toronto,
which won three of four games against the Knicks in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami worries me. Alonzo Mourning appears to have matured, their
talent (when healthy; Tim Hardaway is questionable) is A list, and
it's dangerous to look past Pat Riley. But the Heat's likely
second-round opponent is their nemesis, New York. Even if they beat
the Knicks and Pacers to reach the finals, would they have anything
left for Shaquille O'Neal and the Justice League of America?
Probably not. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The first blush of the baseball season has the Dodgers looking
and acting like a better ball club than last year's underachievers.
But it isn't a good sign to see Arizona playing the best ball in
the N.L. without third baseman Matt Williams and closer Matt
Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   The D-Backs have as many bats as anyone in the league, but what
separates them is more pitching than any team outside Atlanta and a
No. 1 starter, Randy Johnson, who will keep them from any lengthy
slumps.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are still weak up the middle, and the stage is
crowded with wild card candidates. What the Dodgers need most is
consistency from Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park, because .500
seasons from your nos. 2 and 3 pitchers won't get you games in
October. ...
</P>
<P>
   --It wasn't surprising to see Bill Parcells trade the New York
Jets' best player. He's a great coach, but he's always fancied
himself as a personnel guy, too, and that may be his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Said Fox's John Madden on the trade: ``You get very few
superstars, and when you do get one, you don't let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson should have an electric impact on the Bucs, whose
defense and running attack was good enough to get in the NFC title
game. Don't forget, too, that the Bucs signed free agent offensive
linemen Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy, and drafted Georgia Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and Shaun King are similar in size and style. Head
coach Tony Dungy clearly has a plan that will take advantage of his
smaller but quicker quarterbacks. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Hamilton was just one of several deft draft day moves last
week. The three teams that helped themselves the most, besides
Tampa, were Baltimore, Indianapolis and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks took the best pro-style back in the draft in
Alabama's Shaun Alexander and the Colts drafted a ton of defensive
stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens somehow got Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis,
Florida wideout Terry Taylor, and Louisville quarterback Chris
Redman. All three should prosper in coach Brian Bilick's uptempo
attack. The Ravens fielded a good defense last year, and there now
is proof that Bilick was the key man in Minnesota's 1998 success.
...
</P>
<P>
   --Early NFL predictions, at no extra charge:
</P>
<P>
   NFC: Washington wins an improved East that should see the Giants
use Ron Dayne effectively and the young Eagles mature. Tampa Bay
dominates the Central while Minnesota regresses. St. Louis wins the
West by default. Wild cards: Green Bay, N.Y. Giants, Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   AFC: Indianapolis wins the East as controversy swirls around
Parcells in New York, Dan Marino-less Miami, two-headed Buffalo
(Rob Johnson-Doug Flutie) and Bill Belichick in New England.
Jacksonville wins the Central narrowly, and Seattle takes the West
in Mike Holmgren's second year: Wild cards: Tennessee, Baltimore,
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   --Five things I like about Arena Football: Only 25 seconds
between plays, a running clock, forward motion, quarterbacks may
not take a knee, and no punters.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I dislike about Arena Football: It's still a mutant,
cool rules or not. &QL;

JURY'S STILL OUT ON HOW GOOD THIS TEAM REALLY IS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's a well-known astronomical fact that few NHL teams
have more stars in their solar system than, well, your Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take an expensive telescope to see why the post-game
honors for the three stars of the game needed a little expanding
last night. Three just wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Eddie Belfour were judged to have
shone brightest, in that order, but anyone at Reunion Arena for the
Stars' series-clinching 3-2 victory over spunky Edmonton could have
just as easily made a case for Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is simple: When those four all come to play on
the same night, the Stars will be difficult to beat, no matter whom
they're playing.
</P>
<P>
   Classify last night's taut, nail-biter _ the Stars twice blew
one-goal leads before Hull slammed the game-winner home late in the
final period _ as the Stars' first real must-win game of the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Edmonton and that hell pit called Skyreach Centre
for Game 6 was something none of the Stars had the stomach for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players knew we had to close it out,'' coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``The damage an extended \Rfirst\S series does is something
you just can't recover from.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, coupled with the Blues' 5-3 win over San Jose to
keep that series alive (the Sharks lead 3-2), not only allows the
Stars to avoid the long and difficult trip back to the northern
plains of Alberta, it will give them a few days to rest and to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   That could be critical down the road in the Stanley Cup playoff
march, especially if it helps the Stars get defensive point man
Sergei Zubov and forward Jere Lehtinen back, as Hitchock suggested
it might after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars could actually open the next series skating ``our real
lineup,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps then we'll better be able to judge whether this year's
Stars team is as good as last year's Stanley Cup champs.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't figured that out yet, don't worry; you're in good
company. Not even Hitchcock, general manager Bob Gainey or Oilers'
coach Kevin Lowe can say for sure either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's team was special in the fact that it could adjust;
it played a different game,'' Hitchcock said. ``Last year's team
was methodical and forthright in the way it played.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is emotional, energetic. It has a higher upside and
makes more mistakes, but more energy and enthusiasm. It's the
youngness and newness, the general excitement of being in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a more physical team, Hitchcock said, which lends
itself to more emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're more physical there's more excitement and more
emotion,'' he said. ``At the end of the day, it's still a more
difficult team to judge until you get the two gunners in, until you
get the two big guys in _ Lehtinen and Zubov _ so I don't know
where it is, but I know right now it plays a more abrasive style
where last year's team played a more controlled game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's an emotional team, there might well be higher highs
and lower lows for this year's Stars. Trying to take a lead away
from the Stars in the playoffs a year ago was like trying to take a
bone away from a Doberman. Last night, however, the Stars showed
visible letups after taking 1-0 and 2-1 leads and coughed up both
before Hull's wrister beat Tommy Salo with 5:02 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hull's third goal of the postseason after he scored a
career low 24 during the regular season. Modano, as usual, was all
over the ice, Belfour stopped 24 of 26 shots and Nieuwendyk's line
pestered the Oilers all night long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some shifts in the second and third periods when we
were pretty much \Runder\S siege,'' Hitchcock conceded. ``\RThe
Oilers\S made some changes in the second half of the game that were
effective. Thank God we've got a guy like Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was one shot by a player who can score goals.
He has scored big goals for this organization and he did it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said it's impossible to get a real read on the Stars until
Zubov and Lehtinen are back on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably a little more relaxed because they've done it
before,'' the Oilers' coach said. ``The pressure is off. We'll just
have to see what happens with the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hitchcock likes is that he believes the Stars' best hockey
is still ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that's still on the rise,'' he said. ``It's
going to take this whole playoffs to determine what this team is
all about and where it's going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not maxed out. We're not playing at full potential.
We've got people who can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this playoff run is over, it's something they'll have to
do.

17 INNINGS JUST A DAY AT WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATHAN SANDERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a superhuman 17-inning, 254-pitch performance, most
pitchers would be waiting for an arm transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Green was waiting tables.
</P>
<P>
   A day removed from tying an NCAA Division II record for most
innings pitched in a game, the Crowley High School graduate worked
an 11-hour shift as a waiter at a] restaurant in Lawton, Okla., his
well-worn right arm still attached to his shoulder. It wasn't
resting in a sling or stuck in a large bucket of ice. It was
carrying plates of food.
</P>
<P>
   But Green, a senior at Cameron University in Lawton, doesn't
claim to be Superman. He's just Justin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just natural,''Green said. ``My arm has never hurt. I've
never missed a game because of arm problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That streak was certainly put to the test in the April 8
marathon against Abilene Christian, a game Green almost got knocked
out of early.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron trailed 9-2 when Green came to the dugout after the top
of the sixth inning. Aggies coach Ron Ihler told Green he was done.
But when Cameron scored five runs in the bottom half of the sixth,
Ihler decided to stick with Green rather than go to his unreliable
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up tying it in the next inning, and I just kept
going,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   And going. And going.
</P>
<P>
   The longer he pitched, the more over-anxious ACU's hitters
became, usually swinging at his first pitch. Only once after the
seventh inning did Green have to throw more than 11 pitches in an
inning. In two different innings, he threw only five. His
efficiency allowed Green to convince his coach to leave him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he was wearing down because he didn't have much
of a wind-up,'' ACU coach Britt Bonneau said. ``He would just step
and throw, and as the game went on he threw it slower and slower.
We kept trying to hit it out of the ballpark, and we kept popping
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonneau said his hitters were also frustrated because they knew
what was coming, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say of the 250 pitches he threw, 249 were sliders,''
Bonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on, ACU's hitters started taunting Green by
yelling, ``This is all they've got!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That fired me up,'' said Green, who has thrown 18 complete
games in the past three seasons. ``There was no way I wanted to be
pulled after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came proof that there is no justice in baseball. In the top
of the 17th, ACU scored the go-ahead run on a single up the middle
that Green said he should have flagged down. When the Aggies failed
to score in their half, Green was tagged with the 10-9 loss.
</P>
<P>
   His final line: 17 innings, 17 hits, 10 runs, five earned runs,
four walks and 13 strikeouts. With his performance he tied three
other pitchers for the Division II single-game record for innings
pitched. The most recent to do so was Ferris State's Rick Schurkamp
in 1972 _ six years before Green was born.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 6-8 with a 5.68 earned-run average this season, didn't
pitch again for six days. In his next start he lasted just 51/3
innings against Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville in a 13-4 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Was Green bothered by having thrown 254 pitches in his previous
start? Just the opposite, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took too long off,'' he said. nn

INTERNET HELPS BREAK COUNTRY'S PROFOUND SENSE OF ISOLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 23) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QOM, Iran _ ``You can find books you didn't know existed!''
exclaims Ayatollah Ali Kawrani, a conservative Muslim cleric draped
in a collarless white robe, as he extols the merits of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Kawrani has directed the Mostafa Islamic
Research Center, a religious institute that provides Internet
access to its students in Qom, a holy city about 90 miles south of
Tehran. On this particular afternoon, four bearded young men sit
hunched over computers downloading Koranic teachings and
philosophical works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speeds up the time it takes to learn,'' the mullah
continues. ``If we want to know about some Islamic teachings using
books, we need two years to study. With a computer, you need a
week!''
</P>
<P>
   Such praise may help explain why Iran's Islamic government has
not banned the Internet, even as it continues to enforce, albeit
sporadically, a prohibition on home satellite dishes, which also
provide easy access to unwanted influences such as pornography and
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be a gateway to entertainment and information
that the government would rather keep out. But its benefits as a
learning tool seem, at least so far, to be outweighing any concerns
that the mullahs might have.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anything else, the Internet has helped
Iranians break out of the profound sense of isolation they have
felt since the 1979 Islamic revolution, observers say. They point
out that the free flow of information makes any effort to keep
outside influences from seeping into the country more difficult and
allows the world to more easily find out what's happening inside
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be cut off completely,'' says Siamak Namazi, who
runs a political consulting business. ``Now I can read the latest
news. I can keep up with everything that's happening in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Iranian papers are now online,'' Namazi adds. ``The
outside world can see things that are happening in Iran in real
time. A kid in a basement can send out a message that (the
government) is going to kill so-and-so.''  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the absence of a ban, Internet cafes, which cater mostly to
students and other young people yearning for a link to the world
outside Iran, have sprung up across the country. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Tehran, the cafes are filled with young people. And Western
influences are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   At one cafe, users watch everything from ``Star Wars'' to the
``Lion King'' on CD. One long-haired 20-year-old, who says he is
``into industrial metal,'' surfs the Web in search of rock music
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth are able to find out about the youth outside Iran.
Then they do the same _ the same dress, the same music,'' one young
man enthuses as he surfs a Western television news site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get the news, the real news,'' he says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Like their counterparts elsewhere, Iranian businessmen have
tapped into the Web in an effort to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   One Persian carpet seller in Esfahan, an industrial city about
200 miles south of Tehran, says he has started to sell rugs to
foreigners over the Internet. Other businesses offer to deliver
Mother's Day flowers to Iranian women whose children live abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The government requires the proprietors of Internet cafes to
sign forms stating that customers will not surf ``objectionable''
sites. But business owners say that authorities rarely enforce the
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government institutions and even some Internet cafes curb
access to sites featuring pornography and violence by installing
firewalls. At one Internet cafe in Tehran, a search for Playboy
brought up a stern notice that the site was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has the Internet. You have satellites. You have
freedom. And now you have problems,'' says Mohammed Abedi, a
26-year-old clerical student in Qom, defending the use of
firewalls. ``We don't want to let these things in and have
problems, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cyber boom seems to be confined mainly to Tehran and
a few higher-learning centers elsewhere. Outside the capital,
Internet cafes exist, but owners say that few Iranians use them.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ghabadi, a 25-year-old cyber cafe owner in Esfahan,
installed a few computers in a corner of his Persian carpet store
as part of an effort to attract foreign buyers. Most of his
Internet customers, he says, are tourists who want to send e-mails
to friends.
</P>
<P>
   Cost and language are big barriers to Internet use for many
Iranians, people say. Surfing the Net at a cyber cafe for an hour
costs no more than $3 or $4. But the average Iranian takes home
less than $100 a month. And though some members of the older
generation grew up speaking English, the dominant language of the
Internet, many younger Iranians, particularly those outside Tehran,
don't speak it or are only now learning.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Internet at home requires buying a computer, a
luxury that few Iranians can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers say, Internet use, particularly among the
young, is steadily rising. Those who surf say that most users know
how to get around firewalls by clicking on links from permitted
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are thirsty for information from outside'' Iran,
says Irag Riahi, the owner of an Internet cafe. ``The government,
they cannot stop us. No one can stop the mind of the people.''

TEHRAN, Iran: from that moment.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clerics' Revolutionary Courts can summon anyone for
``un-Islamic activities'' and hold secret trials without benefit of
appeal. And the mullahs' Council of Guardians can disqualify any
candidate from seeking elective office. In the months leading to
February's elections, the council barred hundreds of people, mostly
secular democrats, from running for Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Changeez Pahlavan, a graying political scientist and writer who
was banned from teaching at Tehran University because of his
leftist views, describes the political system as ``a very closed
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secular people are not allowed to participate,'' he says. Now,
``the secular forces are thinking they might reach a change
indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Ali Reza Nouri. A clean-shaven, bespectacled physician in
his mid-30s, Nouri was working at a Tehran medical clinic when
supporters of his jailed brother, a former government minister,
asked him to run for Parliament, because they knew he shared his
brother's reformist ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri's elder brother, Abdullah, a cleric, had been imprisoned
for ``insulting the sanctities of Islam'' after advocating the
right of the people to choose their government. His supporters were
looking for a replacement whose views were unknown to the Council
of Guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri slipped into the race and easily won a parliamentary seat;
largely, many believe, because of his brother's name. Like Nouri,
some of the other victors in the election had been urged to run in
place of recognized reformists who had been disqualified by the
Council of Guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Their candidacies, says Jaliehpour, the editor of Economic News,
were part of a strategy by leftist politicians to circumvent the
power of the religious body and fill Parliament with members who
would likely push for sweeping reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri admits that he shares some of his brother's reformist
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parliament should be the only place to pass laws and the only
decision-maker in this country,'' he says, taking a not-so-veiled
swipe at the Council of Guardians. ``We should not be under the
influence of any other institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious body, however, still wields immense power. Since
the February elections, the council has disqualified several
reformist winners and replaced them with conservative runners-up,
sparking riots in two villages.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists point to other signs of a conservative backlash. They
suspect that Islamic hard-liners were to blame for the recent
slayings of three leftist intellectuals. Last week, the elite
Revolutionary Guards issued a statement threatening to crush any
attempt to undermine the Islamic system, and the outgoing
Parliament passed a bill placing some curbs on newfound press
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such developments, Peyman predicts that the incoming
Parliament, which convenes May 28, will overturn the new law and
liberalize rules governing the press even more. ``Closing down the
press and arresting journalists doesn't stop anybody anymore,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Both Peyman and Jaliehpour stress that change must come
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political affairs should be discussed in the framework of
political institutions,'' Jaliehpour says. ``If it goes to the
streets, the conservatives have the military and police in their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't face them,'' he says. ``We would lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, thousands of students rioted at Tehran University in
protest of a Revolutionary Court decision to ban a reformist
newspaper, fanning fears of greater civil strife.
</P>
<P>
   For five days, students and police clashed in the worst bout of
violence in Iran since the revolution. By the time the unrest died
down, five young men had been killed and hundreds had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The violence shattered any illusion that Iran's spirited youth
might have harbored about the clerical establishment giving up
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many young people say they want to see the power of the
mullahs diminish. They want Khatami's reforms to succeed. But they
don't want another revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Students don't want to face off with the police again, says
22-year-old Nushin Yari from a ski lodge north of Tehran. ``They
are armed,'' she says, ``and we are young.''
</P>
<P>
   The riots in July also shocked the country's entrenched
religious establishment. The political credentials of most students
at Tehran University were regarded as impeccable, because the
institution gives admissions preference to the offspring of loyal
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   These children of revolutionaries did more than riot. They also
taunted the supreme leader _ revered by Iran's Shiite Muslims as
holy and infallible _ with such slogans as ``Down with the
religious dictator!''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were considered loyal, and even they can't tolerate the
present system,'' says Pahlavan, the political scientist. ``Mr.
Khatami will face a big dilemma if he is not able to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, asserts Ghorbanzadeh, the 21-year-old Iranian
film star, his movie ``Siavash'' would never have been made.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of a young musician who can't relate to his father's
Islamic revolutionary ideals, the film, he says, challenges beliefs
held sacred in Iran since the shah fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that the film's portrayal of the generation gap
between Iran's middle-age revolutionaries and their children
implied disrespect for the hundreds of thousands of ``martyrs'' who
died defending the lofty ideals of the Islamic republic during the
1980-1988 war with Iraq, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of negative feedback,'' Ghorbanzadeh admits.
``The conservatives reacted and told us this film made the morals
police look bad. They wrote things in the newspapers. One of the
martyr's mothers complained about the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film had no trouble getting made. The controversial
script glided past government censors. Once finished, the $50,000
production became a big commercial success, earning more than
$265,000 in Tehran alone, a small fortune in a country where
monthly salaries rarely exceed $100.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians cite the atmosphere of freedom that allowed
``Siavash'' to be produced as Khatami's greatest achievement.
Reformist newspapers keep challenging the conservatives' hold on
power, they note, and Iran's acclaimed film industry is
flourishing. Movie directors and playwrights silenced since the
revolution are tackling controversial themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of changes,'' says Mohammed Bahrami, a
theater critic in Tehran who has been covering the industry for 16
years. ``The Iranian writers who were barred are coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Albourz Mountains on the northern edge of Tehran,
hundreds of people glide down glistening white slopes on skis and
toboggans.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun sinks below the horizon, a group of young people
blasts a mix of Western pop music and rhythmic Iranian tunes from
the tape deck of a car parked along the road. The women take off
their veils and dance in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Here, perhaps more than anywhere else, the effects of Iran's new
openness can be felt. Nowadays, the morals police rarely venture to
these mountains to enforce the mullahs' rules, people say. Men and
women mingle on the slopes during the day and in the evening throw
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these young people are among Khatami's staunchest
supporters. They are also his harshest critics. The new atmosphere
ushered in by the reformist president, they say, is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected more,'' says Bita Khachnegar, 24, as she sits in
the ski lodge with friends. ``But Khatami is limited.''
</P>
<P>
   These Iranians were reared by the generation that fought for the
revolution. Now, they say, they are left with its legacy: a rigid,
religious government; a bloated bureaucracy; a stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   Few seem convinced that the new Parliament will manage to forge
new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of mullahs at the top, so there won't be any
change,'' says a 21-year-old law student who gives his name only as
Ruzbekiah. ``There won't be any democracy. They are just doing this
so we can let off steam.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time they think the reformists have gained ground, many of
these young people say, something happens to remind them that
conservative forces remain very much in power.
</P>
<P>
   In a Tehran cafe frequented by artists and writers, Alex Lazar,
17, lifts his cotton jersey to show a back covered with bluish-red
welts. The day before, he says, he was lashed by the morals police
for being caught with his girlfriend. The girl, he says, also was
whipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now do you think there is freedom here?'' asks Mahdi Safari, a
19-year-old sitting next to Lazar.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Albourz Mountains, a popular Iranian tune blares
from the cassette player of the car stopped on the side of the
road. Young women shimmy and twirl as snowflakes fall on their
unveiled hair. Young men clap to the music. People in passing cars
stop to watch, and some join in.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the politics of the city below, an impromptu party
begins.
</P>
<P>
   These young people say they want more personal choice. They want
the morals police to dissolve. They want an end to so many
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young,'' shouts one 19-year-old woman, as she dances in
the snow. ``I want to live.''

REFORMS GIVE IRAN A TASTE OF FREEDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 23) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Seconds after Iranian actor Ali Ghorbanzadeh
takes a seat in the bleachers of a domed sports arena here, a
chorus of high-pitched squeals erupts from the women's section of
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the disapproving glares from bearded mullahs around
them, the teen-age girls whistle and clap. They wave black-clad
arms in the air. The more daring venture past uniformed guards to
the men's section to ask the teen heartthrob for his autograph,
shyly thrusting pen and paper into the young man's face.
</P>
<P>
   The episode lasts only moments. But it illustrates the social
changes that have swept across Iran since political reformers, led
by President Mohammed Khatami, burst onto the national scene three
years ago with promises of greater personal freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The press is freer than before. Films and plays once censored
are getting permission to be shown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is not unusual to see young men and women hanging out
in the same cafes or skiing down the same slopes, activities still
forbidden or discouraged by the stern religious rulers who have
governed this country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Nowadays,
however, the authorities known as the ``morals police'' enforce the
rules less stringently.
</P>
<P>
   As the reformers slowly gain influence, some of their supporters
hope that even greater change is on the way. They dream of a
gradual transformation from a conservative theocracy controlled by
the mullahs to a democracy that better reflects the will of the
people. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Little by little, step by step,'' says Hamidreza Jaliehpour,
a feisty 41-year-old editor whose publication, Economic News, is a
reincarnation of two earlier newspapers shut down by the government
for ``insulting Islam.'' ``The important thing is that a civil
movement is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though the reformers enjoy widespread support, many
remain skeptical of their ability to bring significant change soon
to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami's 1997 election, reformers have been locked in a
political dance with the conservatives to determine the direction
of the country, moving in a pattern of two steps forward, one step
back. It is still unclear which side will ultimately prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the February elections that gave the
reformists a majority in Parliament, for instance, the morals
police launched a crackdown on young people flouting the rules for
segregation of men and women in the affluent suburbs of northern
Tehran and the snow-capped Albourz Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In March, unidentified gunmen wounded Said Hajjarian, a
prominent strategist for the reformists, in a bungled assassination
attempt that many suspect was carried out by Islamic hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, Mohammed Reza Khatami, the president's reformist
brother and a top vote-getter in the parliamentary elections, was
arrested on charges of libel in his capacity as head of the liberal
daily newspaper Mosharekat.
</P>
<P>
   Developments such as these deeply unsettle many Iranians, who
fear that they portend political violence. At the same time, such
incidents strengthen the resolve of those people, particularly the
young, who are rallying behind Khatami's reformers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the country's 65 million people are
under the age of 25. Many of them say they are fed up with the
unbending theocratic system that controls their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of being ruled by religious extremists,''
says Bahar Jalali, a 21-year-old student whose blue, ankle-length
dress stands out in the sea of black that defines the women's
section of the Tehran sports stadium where the young actor appeared
during a reformist rally.
</P>
<P>
   As Jalali watches young women crowd around Ghorbanzadeh, a smile
spreads across her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be free to choose their way to live,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami assumed the presidency, Iranians have twice
endorsed his agenda for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they elected hundreds of reformers to local councils
in the country's first post-revolution municipal elections. In
February, they voted to pack the nation's Parliament with people in
favor of change.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department responded in March by lifting a ban on
the import of Iranian rugs, pistachio nuts and caviar. &UR;  &LR; Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said that the United States wanted a
``new relationship with Iran.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But Iran's conservatives have not been entirely sidelined, as
the libel charge lodged against the president's brother
illustrates. Complainants in the case include the police, the state
broadcasting company and the Council of Guardians _
conservative-dominated bodies angered by his newspaper's coverage
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the struggle between Iran's liberals and conservatives is
hardly new.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been playing out since the early days of the
revolution, which ousted the U.S.-backed Mohammed Reza Shah
Pahlavi, when 400 college students stormed the U.S. Embassy, took
Americans hostage and helped shape Iran's politics for the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by radical mullahs, the students humiliated the
United States by dragging out the hostage crisis for 444 days. They
also caused the provisional Iranian government, set up in the wake
of the revolution and led by secular politicians opposed to the
Embassy takeover, to resign in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   With the advocates of a secular government out of the way, the
religious clerics, led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
began setting up the Islamic theocracy that governs Iran today.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest legacy was to create parallel religious
institutions that rival each branch of government. Thus, the 12-man
Council of Guardians oversees Parliament; the Revolutionary Courts
watch over other courts; and the supreme leader, currently
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wields powers that supersede those of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The mullahs also instated their extremist brand of Islamic law.
They made the head-to-toe gown called the ``hijab'' mandatory for
women and lowered the age of female maturity _ and thus of possible
marriage _ from 15 to 9. Adultery was made punishable by death for
women, even though men found guilty of the crime were usually
whipped. Alcohol was outlawed. Men and women were strictly
segregated.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone caught flouting the rules risked being executed,
jailed or lashed.
</P>
<P>
   In the two crucial years that followed the revolution, many of
the leftist intellectuals who had advocated the creation of a
secular democracy were imprisoned, exiled or killed.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the remaining secularists waited in the wings,
effectively shut out of public life. Only now are their
once-silenced voices beginning to rise up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were jailed in our homes,'' Habibollah Peyman, an
ebony-haired intellectual who now works as a dentist, recalls from
his north Tehran office. ``Always our followers were arrested,
excluded from jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mullahs, these religious people, think they should guide
the people because they are connected to God,'' Peyman continues,
punctuating his words. ``It's a theory they have made. It's not in
the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we will use this new opening to come outside and speak to
the people,'' he says. ``We will tell them that God has invited the
people to think for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Peyman, who lifts bushy eyebrows for emphasis as he speaks,
doesn't think Iran will create a political system that separates
religion and state any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   A philosopher who specializes in the history of Islam in Iran,
Peyman says that most reformers recently elected to Parliament are
liberal-minded clerics who want to revamp the existing Islamic form
of government _ not secularists who want to do away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Khatami, who in 1982 resigned as minister of
culture after being accused of ``liberalism,'' has always spoken
about democratic reform within an Islamic context. ``We must try to
show freedom is compatible with Islam,'' Khatami, a mullah who
claims descent from the prophet Mohammed, said in a May 1999
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, converting the Islamic system to a secular democracy
would require eliminating something called the ``velayat i-faqih.''
The term, which means ``guardian of the religious jurist,'' has
come to signify the absolute rule of the mullahs and the dual power
structure that allows them to shadow the various branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, conservative clerics have an advantage at all
levels. As an elected president, for instance, Khatami can push for
reform, but Supreme Leader Khamenei, who is appointed for life, has
the final say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person in charge of the Islamic government does not make
mistakes,'' Khamenei, the supreme leader, said in January. ``And if
he does, he will not be the supreme leader from that moment.''

ELIAN HAS BECOME RELIGIOUS CAUSE TO CATHOLICS 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Carrying crucifixes and Bibles, Cuban-Americans gathered
in Little Havana on Good Friday to pray for a little boy many of
them believe to be touched by God.
</P>
<P>
   The most loyal Miami backers of Elian Gonzalez have always
claimed his rescue at sea last November was an act of divine
salvation. But with the approach of Easter weekend, the religious
fervor of the protest movement spilled over in prayer and
exhortations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle, that's the only way to describe it,'' said
Melida Vairo, an Argentine woman who wept as she prayed for Elian
in Little Havana on Friday. ``You have to love this child who was
saved by God.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 6, spent most of the day in the home of his Miami
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez. Father Francisco Santana, a Catholic
priest, spent part of the day with the family, where they prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Church representatives say the prayer will continue
throughout the weekend, though it was not clear whether the family
will be able to go to church on Easter because of the swarm of
protesters and media surrounding the home.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, women dressed in black joined hands in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Even local Spanish-language radio gave way from the usual
anti-communist vitriol to more talk of the Bible during Holy Week.
Many callers compared Elian to Moses, who was set adrift in the
river by a mother who gave him up to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they believe Elian was buoyed at sea by dolphins sent
by God.
</P>
<P>
   Still others talk of Our Lady of Charity of Cobre, the virgin
Mother Mary who is the patron saint of Cuba because she is believed
to have saved a little Cuban boy lost at sea nearly 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the Lady of Charity were in abundance Friday _ on the
front door of the Gonzalez home, on a mural next door, and on large
banners carried by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic leaders are not ready to officially declare Elian's
salvation a miracle, which is an involved process. But they clearly
believe the boy was saved by an act of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not expert in the subject of miracles,'' said Monsignor
Agustin A. Roman, the auxiliary bishop of Miami. ``But for a boy to
maintain himself floating on the sea for two days seems quite
extraordinary to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``An hour, maybe. But two days holding himself afloat? It
doesn't seem possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has remained unusually quiet on the question of
Elian's fate. A top cardinal, Francis Cardinal Arinze, who toured
Miami this week, made no declaration on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami Catholics, many of them Cuban exiles, have emerged as
increasingly important supporters of the cause of keeping Elian in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Father Santana visits the family almost daily to offer guidance
and prayer. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry
University, originally supported returning Elian to Cuba, but now
sits on the side of those who wish to keep him here. Monsignor
Roman has written articles for the Spanish-language press
supporting Elian, including one in which he asked God not to let
``this symbol of freedom be transformed into an instrument of
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   A poster widely distributed by local Catholics shows a photo of
the boy under a Spanish phrase that says: ``Elian met Jesus. Others
deny him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Holy Week, supporters at one large vigil formed a
large cross to show the religious backing of their belief.
</P>
<P>
   With Easter approaching, the protesters spoke ever more about
miracles and charity. But they still found ways to rail against
President Fidel Castro and his atheistic communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That boy was saved because he sat on that inner tube and
prayed, just as his mother taught him to do,'' said Armond
Betancourt, a Cuban-American from Milwaukee who carried a cross
outside Elian's house. ``Usually, children in Cuba are not taught
to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Symbols of the crucifixion, the resurrection and even dolphins
were in abundance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But few icons have become as important as the Lady of Charity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Catholic tradition, three Cuban boys ventured out
onto the Bay of Nipe in northwestern Cuba in about 1612, looking
for islands of salt to cure their meat. A storm came up and swamped
their boat.
</P>
<P>
   Two boys, who were Indians, apparently perished. Only the third,
the 10-year-old descendent of African slaves, survived to tell how
he was saved by the vision he saw on the water of the Virgin Mary
with the Baby Jesus. The vision apparently spoke to the boy,
saying: ``I am the Virgin of Charity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church declared the Virgin of Charity as the patron
saint of Cuba in 1916, according to Monsignor Roman.
</P>
<P>
   The image remains particularly important to Miami Catholics. The
church where both Monsignor Roman and Father Santana are based has
a large tile mosaic on its facade showing the three Cuban boys at
sea, with waves washing over their boat.

<P>
   Not so long ago, it seems, nations were able to hide their
armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy civilians,
while militaries could pry into most corners of the globe from spy
satellites, knowing they could control who could take a peek.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Taking pictures from space is undergoing a revolution,
and it is making some governments feel naked.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies in a growing number of countries are launching
an increasingly sophisticated fleet of reconnaissance satellites,
and governments are finding it harder and harder to restrict what
snapshots are distributed to anyone willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A recent case involves Area 51, a secret military installation
in a secluded valley northwest of Las Vegas that is thought to be
used to test advanced aircraft. For decades, the U.S. government
kept it off limits to cameras. Known officially as Groom Lake, it
was veiled in high security, mysterious lights and, UFO buffs
claim, test flights of captured alien spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, private sleuths won a quiet battle for openness at
Area 51 _ at least on what can be seen from the sky _ as commercial
rivals sold space photos of it. In the fast developing field of
private photography from orbit, the episode suggests a new frailty
for any efforts at state censorship.
</P>
<P>
   When civilian reconnaissance craft were first launched into
space in 1972, there was a vast technological gap between them and
their older but more powerful cousins, the military spy satellites.
All the civilian photos of small objects in those days were fuzzy.
But over the decades, they have become increasingly sharp. At
first, the spacecraft were able to show identifiable objects no
smaller than 100 meters ( 300 feet). Then that number fell to 30,
10, 5, 2 and now 1 meter, or 3 feet. At that resolution, cars,
roads, buildings, tanks, ships, jets and missiles can be
distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one company, Space Imaging, in Thornton, Colo., has
put a one-meter craft into orbit. But other companies in the United
States, Russia, Japan, Israel and South Korea are planning to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Already, analysts say, commercial spy craft are so numerous and
competitive as to undercut governmental efforts to curb what they
disseminate. Russia can bar the operators of a Russian satellite
from selling pictures of Chechnya, but it has no power over an
American company. Likewise, any U.S. efforts to control spying on
Area 51 were rendered moot last week when a Russian company put its
imagery of the base on the market. Some snoop, the experts say,
will always be willing to sell closeups of sensitive zones that
some other nation wants off limits, encouraging a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't last,'' Ann M. Florini, a space reconnaissance expert
at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, said of state censorship.
``It's hard to imagine any foreign-policy situations where all the
actors are going to get together and agree, `Yes, that imagery is
not going to be disseminated.'''
</P>
<P>
   In military terms, of course, it's been decades since any nation
could count on real security from the prying eyes of foes. Missile
testing, bomb development and large-scale military operations have
long been detected _ or forced to try to hide from spy satellites
by dint of camouflage and subterfuge. Even so, it hasn't usually
been to the spyer's advantage to make its discoveries public, since
a cardinal rule of espionage is to keep your discoveries to
yourself. And that, in a way, made the game all the more secretive
and manageable.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial companies don't play by those rules. What is new
is the prospect that any country's secrets will come unpredictably
under public display in ways that could embarrass governments, tip
their hands in war and debate, or show sensitive installations to
terrorists or just plain mischief-makers. Imagine if the FBI's and
KGB's eavesdropping gear suddenly fell into the hands of voyeurs,
and you get a hint of the queasiness now felt in high places.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, even after cameras started zooming, states could
exert some control over civil reconnaissance from space. In 1995,
India lofted a craft that took 5-meter images. It photographed the
world, but blocked photos of its own military bases. And in 1996,
after the Clinton administration approved the taking of one-meter
photos, American supporters of Israel won a law limiting the
sharpness of images of Israel to the best obtainable by any foreign
company. Today, that means two-meter sharpness, which a Russian
company sells.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the investigative use of space imagery has
been strongly encouraged by the Public Eye program of the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington
that promotes arms control and has bought satellite photos in a
systematic effort to fight military censors. In January, it
revealed a North Korean missile base, and in March a Pakistani
nuclear reactor and missile site.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest target is Area 51, and it played a big role in the
release of the new imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Public Eye ordered Area 51 photos from Space Imaging last winter
_ to no avail, leaving it wondering whether there had been what
experts call ``shutter control,'' a right that U.S. officials
assert to at times restrict U.S.-owned civil spy cameras, or
self-censorship by Space Imaging, which is owned mainly by Lockheed
Martin, a military contractor, and whose largest customer is the
Pentagon. The company denied there had been either.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam broke Monday when a rival American company, Aerial
Images, based in Raleigh, N.C., released Russian two-meter photos
of the secretive base.

IRANIAN WOMEN USE CREATIVITY TO EXERCISE FREEDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 23) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ With the adroitness of a seasoned flier, Azar
Farahani hoists a heavy pack on her back and snaps a helmet on her
head. Slowly, she spreads a pink and yellow wind sail on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to run against the wind, feel the giant sail fill with
air, then glide down the barren mountain toward the high-rises of
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy task in a black head scarf and ankle-length
cloak.
</P>
<P>
   But Farahani has devised a clever way to paraglide in the
cumbersome costume that all Iranian women must wear according to a
``fatwa,'' or edict, of the country's religious rulers.
</P>
<P>
   She has cut holes on both sides of her gown for the straps of
the wind sail's harness. Under her long black outfit, called a
``hijab,'' Farahani has pulled on a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``See!'' says the muscular 34-year-old, breaking into a
mischievous smile as she pulls a strap of the harness through one
of the holes and fastens the binding around her left thigh. ``I tie
this around my leg, and it holds the harness in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I showed them this, we convinced them we could fly with
the `hijab,''' Farahani adds, referring to government officials in
charge of women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   Like Farahani, many women in Iran are testing the limits of
their country's strict Islamic system and finding ways to loosen
the restraints.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1979 Islamic revolution, women were sidelined from
politics, barred from sitting as judges in courts of law and forced
to obtain their husbands' permission before leaving the country.
They covered themselves in mournful black and diligently hid every
wisp of hair. They were discouraged from wearing makeup and
strictly segregated from men.
</P>
<P>
   With the surprise 1997 election of President Mohammed Khatami, a
reformist openly opposed by Iran's religious Old Guard, the
restrictions imposed on women began to ease amid a new atmosphere
of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many women dare to allow their veils to fall back slightly
to show some of their hair. Some wear lipstick and paint their
nails, then rush to wipe their lips and put on gloves if the
authorities known as the ``morals police'' arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that on the slopes north of Tehran where people go to
ski and to paraglide, authorities often turn a blind eye to the
absence of the ``hijab,'' as long as women cover their hair and
wear jackets that reach their knees. Some simply tuck their hair
inside knitted ski caps.
</P>
<P>
   The new climate of openness, many women say, has encouraged
government officials to accommodate their requests for small new
freedoms. Particularly in the ministry of culture, a stronghold of
Khatami supporters, they say they are finding receptive ears.
</P>
<P>
   When Farahani showed ministry officials last spring that she
could paraglide while wearing the ``hijab,'' for instance, she and
a few dozen other female fliers got permission to form the Tehran
Flying Women's Committee. Already, the group has 40 members.
</P>
<P>
   Malihe Saidi, one of Iran's best-known singers, used a similar
strategy to get her music back on the market. Barred from
performing for years because of a religious edict that prohibits
women from singing in public, Saidi last year discovered the
existence of another ``fatwa'' that worked in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   Women can sing in public, the edict said, as long as they are
part of a choir. Saidi, who teaches music at a girl's school in
Tehran, showed the ruling to the cultural minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, OK, I could sell my tapes in the market,'' Saidi
recalls. On the recording, her strong voice is clearly audible
above the background voices of the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, too, have taken steps to aid women.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing Parliament, for instance, enacted a law that
increased the minimum amount of money that a man must pay his wife
for living expenses. Lawmakers also passed legislation allowing
divorced mothers to retain custody of young children a few years
before giving them up to their former husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Massoumeh Ebtekar, a woman who serves as one of Iran's vice
presidents as well as minister for the environment, points to the
measures as proof that the country is moving in the right
direction. ``A lot of practical steps have been taken to improve
the condition and the status of women,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian women overwhelmingly supported Khatami's bid for the
presidency, and their vote was key to his upset victory. He showed
his gratitude by appointing two female ministers to his Cabinet, a
move that, many say, helped encourage other women to enter
politics. In municipal elections last year, more than 300 women won
seats on local and regional councils.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Iranian women say that they have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Merengeez Karr, an attorney who was barred from practicing law
for five years after the revolution and now concentrates on family
and criminal cases, remains pessimistic about women's ability to
change a system that, she says, fundamentally discriminates against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our constitution doesn't allow secular reformers to run in
elections. Only the religious can run,'' she says from behind a
desk cluttered with child custody and divorce cases. ``And
religious people don't believe in equality between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman, Karr notes, still cannot initiate divorce, except if
she can prove that her husband consistently beats her, abuses drugs
or commits a short list of other offenses. Under the custody laws
softened by Parliament, divorced women can keep their children only
until their sons turn 2 and their daughters become 7.
</P>
<P>
   A wife inherits one-eighth of her husband's cash estate and
cannot inherit his land, Karr says. Women can serve as judicial
assistants, but not judges. The legal age for female marriage is 9.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Karr, the previous Parliament passed legislation
that set women's rights back. One such measure prohibited
newspapers from publishing articles about female rights, if,
according to the law's vague wording, the report would create
conflict between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's rights are very complicated and involved with religion
here,'' Karr says. ``Even the reformers don't want to take on
traditional clerics on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many Iranian women say that the mandate to wear the
``hijab'' in some ways became liberating in the early days of the
revolution. Conservative Muslim families who otherwise might have
kept their daughters at home felt comfortable allowing them to work
and to study in the head-to-toe gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk on the street, and no one can touch me,'' says
Zahara Gambari-Nejat, a 20-year-old draped in an especially
concealing version of the ``hijab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other countries, they don't cover, but they can't walk down
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, university enrollment of women soared.
Today, more than 50 percent of the students attending college in
Iran are female.
</P>
<P>
   Covered by the ``hijab'' and segregated from men, women were
allowed to play sports. Female rowing teams, weight lifters and
basketball stars emerged. Hundreds of women became coaches and
referees. Since the revolution, Iran has hosted two all-female
Olympics for women from Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, liberal women such as Karr, whose own dark brown curls are
dutifully tucked under a loose scarf, see the mandatory ``hijab''
as a symbol of the restrictions placed on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all dressed in black,'' she says. ``Even color is
considered political in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But up in the mountains north of Tehran, Neda Jahashani, a
25-year-old wearing a bright yellow ski suit and a flowered green
head scarf, says the morals police don't always enforce the rules
these days. Once, she recalls, a policeman took a picture of her
and her boyfriend standing in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out with him,'' Jahashani boasts. ``We go dancing. We go
to parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Khatami was elected, I could walk like this'' in the
mountains, she says, pointing to her yellow clothes. But back in
the city, Jahashani adds, she wears a long black ``hijab'' over her
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a table in the ski lounge, Bita Khachegar, a
24-year-old female bodybuilder wearing mascara and silver-painted
nails, says she would be too afraid to go out with a guy her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not brave enough to walk in the street with my brother
unless I have documents with me proving he is my brother,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may walk with a boy in a busy place, and nothing will
happen. But you may walk with a boy on your little street and be
arrested. You don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ambiguity, say some women, creates a sense of unease,
because it keeps them guessing at what is prohibited and what is
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it gives them the chance to discover new
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   On a barren slope north of Tehran, Farahani and a few other
female fliers prepare to paraglide down the mountain. On this
particular morning, however, there is not enough wind to lift them.
Their sails billow, then crumple back down to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, as raindrops start to fall, Farahani packs up her gear
and heads toward the car. Such momentary setbacks won't stop her,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now that paragliding has been approved, she is trying to
persuade government officials to allow women to sky-dive.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, Farahani says with a smile, she'll be back
to fly on a sunnier day.

Area 51 were rendered moot last week when a Russian company put its
imagery of the base on the market. Some snoop, the experts say,
will always be willing to sell closeups of sensitive zones that
some other nation wants off limits, encouraging a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't last,'' Ann M. Florini, a space reconnaissance expert
at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, said of state censorship.
``It's hard to imagine any foreign-policy situations where all the
actors are going to get together and agree, `Yes, that imagery is
not going to be disseminated.'''
</P>
<P>
   In military terms, of course, it's been decades since any nation
could count on real security from the prying eyes of foes. Missile
testing, bomb development and large-scale military operations have
long been detected _ or forced to try to hide from spy satellites
by dint of camouflage and subterfuge. Even so, it hasn't usually
been to the spyer's advantage to make its discoveries public, since
a cardinal rule of espionage is to keep your discoveries to
yourself. And that, in a way, made the game all the more secretive
and manageable.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial companies don't play by those rules. What is new
is the prospect that any country's secrets will come unpredictably
under public display in ways that could embarrass governments, tip
their hands in war and debate, or show sensitive installations to
terrorists or just plain mischief-makers. Imagine if the FBI's and
KGB's eavesdropping gear suddenly fell into the hands of voyeurs,
and you get a hint of the queasiness now felt in high places.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, even after cameras started zooming, states could
exert some control over civil reconnaissance from space. In 1995,
India lofted a craft that took 5-meter images. It photographed the
world, but blocked photos of its own military bases. And in 1996,
after the Clinton administration approved the taking of one-meter
photos, American supporters of Israel won a law limiting the
sharpness of images of Israel to the best obtainable by any foreign
company. Today, that means two-meter sharpness, which a Russian
company sells.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the investigative use of space imagery has
been strongly encouraged by the Public Eye program of the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington
that promotes arms control and has bought satellite photos in a
systematic effort to fight military censors. In January, it
revealed a North Korean missile base, and in March a Pakistani
nuclear reactor and missile site.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest target is Area 51, and it played a big role in the
release of the new imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Public Eye ordered Area 51 photos from Space Imaging last winter
_ to no avail, leaving it wondering whether there had been what
experts call ``shutter control,'' a right that U.S. officials
assert to at times restrict U.S.-owned civil spy cameras, or
self-censorship by Space Imaging, which is owned mainly by Lockheed
Martin, a military contractor, and whose largest customer is the
Pentagon. The company denied there had been either.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam broke Monday when a rival American company, Aerial
Images, based in Raleigh, N.C., released Russian two-meter photos
of the secretive base.

   McCain Flies a Flag of Contrition
</P>
<P>
   Now it can be told: Sen. John McCain always thought the
Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina Statehouse
should come down.
</P>
<P>
   He had hemmed and hawed about it during the South Carolina
primary, refusing to go out on a limb any further than his
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who would say only
that the flag's fate should remain in the hands of the people of
South Carolina. But at a luncheon Wednesday in Columbia, the
senator made his feelings plainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the
South Carolina primary,'' he said. ``I broke my promise to always
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's confession was seen by some as a betrayal. ``I'm
ashamed that he lied to the people of South Carolina,'' said Jake
Knotts, a state lawmaker and former McCain supporter. Yet the
revelation reminded others of McCain's enduring impact on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues even wondered if the former candidate wasn't
still running for something. On Comedy Central's ``Daily Show,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., speculated, in all seriousness, that
``McCain may be subconsciously running for vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   On the national political stage, the Confederate flag may be a
peripheral prop. But at least it is an issue on which Bush has
staked out a position different from that of Vice President Al
Gore, who has declared that the flag should go. Bush, after all,
has come out with a series of planks that might not be out of place
in the Democratic Party platform. His latest: a $1.7 billion
proposal to encourage developers to build and repair housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   That plan follows other Bush proposals to expand health care
services to the needy ($4.3 billion); give tax credits to
low-income families to buy health insurance ($41.6 billion) and
improve teacher training and childhood literacy ($7.9 billion).
</P>
<P>
   As Bush was offering new plans for spending money, Gore was
going to old friends to raise it. He appeared with President
Clinton at a Beverly Hills event that took in $2.8 million for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Solving a Royal Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Examining all that remained of the boy who died in France's
Temple prison in 1795 _ a dried heart _ scientists ended one of the
nation's most enduring historical debates. The boy, the scientists
said, was indeed Louis XVII, the 10-year-old uncrowned king of
France, and not an impostor placed there so the young dauphin could
escape into exile.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, historians have argued over whether the
son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette might have escaped from
prison after his parents were guillotined during the French
Revolution. The dispute spawned hundreds of pretenders to the
throne, one of whom was convincing enough to get the government of
Netherlands to bury him under a tombstone indicating that he was
the true heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists comparing DNA from the boy's heart with DNA from
locks of Marie Antoinette's hair said there could be no mistake.
The boy, who had endured two years virtually alone in a prison cell
without windows, barely fed or attended to, was the queen's son.
When he died, he had come a long way from the whirl of lace, sweets
and doting servants depicted in his official portraits. He was
riddled with disease, encrusted with sores and bloated with tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists in human genetics who performed the tests,
Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the University of Louvain in Belgium and
Bernd Brinkmann of the University of Muenster in Germany, said the
DNA fragments they had been able to obtain from the heart were not
perfect, but enough for a conclusive match.
</P>
<P>
   The heart survived through a fluke. One of the doctors
performing the autopsy on the boy stole the heart as a souvenir,
wrapping it in a handkerchief and stuffing it in his pocket.
Eventually, it was returned to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The Bourbon family is now asking for a proper burial for the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   World Trade Officials Vow Effort to Fight Aids
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 million poor people in developing nations are infected
with the AIDS virus, and the number is rising so quickly that the
disease has become a leading impediment to economic development in
Africa and South Asia. That's the way the World Bank sees it. After
a spring strategy session in Washington, world finance ministers
endorsed a World Bank plan to spend ``unlimited money'' to finance
programs to prevent the spread of AIDS and treat its victims in
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the plan was announced while thousands of
protesters tried to block access to the meetings, claiming that the
bank has done too little to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Report on Theft From Jews
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of Jewish assets in wartime France was so extensive
that all Jews, whether the richest bankers or the poorest tailors,
were touched by it. This was among the conclusions reached by the
Matteoli Commission, which began the first major study on the
subject three years ago. The study found that the theft of assets
was far greater than previously assumed. But it also found that
efforts to return the property or to reimburse Jews were extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bad News on Fiber
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, many doctors and most of the public have
believed that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer. But now two
studies involving thousands of people randomly assigned to eat
either high-fiber diets or their normal diets failed to find that
the high-fiber diets protected against polyps, which are tiny lumps
in the colon that precede many colon cancers.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts say there is still hope for the high-fiber
hypothesis _ maybe the diet needs to be started earlier or maybe it
only acts after cancers are well established _ others say it is
time to put the idea to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Gay Union Bill
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's legislature reached the verge of creating the closest
thing in America to gay marriage _ but left the final step until
this week, and no one is saying its over until its over. The state
Senate, in a 19-11 vote, passed a bill creating marriage-like civil
unions, but its bill was slightly different from the one passed
last month in the House. That means the House takes up the question
again in a session Tuesday. Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign
the bill.

   New Drug for `Superbugs'

   Amid increasing concern over ``superbugs'' that can outsmart
even the most powerful germ-fighting medicines, the Food and Drug
Administration approved a new antibiotic, Zyvox, that doctors say
could save thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, manufactured by Pharmacia of Peapack, N.J., is the
first in an entirely new family of antibiotics, and is effective
against germs that can cause lethal bloodstream infections and
pneumonia.

   Weapon Sales to Taiwan

   The Clinton administration deferred the sale of four Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan that were intended to counter the Chinese
build-up of ballistic missiles. The White House also decided to
hold back on the sale of submarines and P-3 Orion anti-submarine
aircraft. Instead, the Taiwanese will buy three kinds of updated
missiles and were promised a naval study to find ways of improving
their outmoded navy.
</P>

Beijing, which has said the sale of the destroyers would be
unacceptable, and at the same time meet some of the defense needs

   Bid to Condemn China Fails

<P>
   The State Department failed in its intense lobbying campaign to

53-member commission voted not to consider the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a special trip to
Geneva last month to address the commission. But the Chinese
government also lobbied hard, and prevailed in part because
countries friendly to the United States in South America and Asia
abstained from voting.

   Arrest in Web Attack
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old Montreal high-school student with the online
nickname Mafiaboy was arrested by Canadian law enforcement
officials for his role in a series of computer attacks on some of
the biggest Internet sites in February.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who was accused of attacking Cable News Network's
Web site, is the first to face charges stemming from the crippling
of Web sites of Yahoo, eBay and Etrade among others. The youth was
not charged in the other attacks, which hindered access to the
sites and exposed weaknesses in the emerging field of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A Heart of Stone
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists reported that they had found a dinosaur heart
the size of a grapefruit, encased in stone and fossilized.
Examining its internal structure, the scientists were surprised to
discover an advanced heart that was more like that of a bird or
mammal than any known reptile.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that at least some dinosaurs had higher
metabolisms than other reptiles and probably were warm-blooded, a
discovery that could profoundly change theories of dinosaur
physiology and their place in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   2 Death Penalty Rulings
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch what we do, not what we say,'' may have been the Supreme
Court's message in a pair of death penalty cases interpreting a new
federal law that placed strict limits on federal courts' ability to
hear appeals from state inmates. By a 5-4 vote, the court read the
1996 law to mean that federal judges must defer to state court
rulings that, even though wrong, are nonetheless not
``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, this standard would appear to eviscerate
federal court power to issue writs of habeas corpus. But the court
then went on to set aside the two death sentences, effectively
demonstrating that federal courts do retain authority and that the
justices expect them to use it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In early February, on assignment to seek out diamond
smugglers, I traveled straight from the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, to a place in central Africa where the borders
of three nations _ Congo, Angola and Zambia _ fuse in a triangle of
poverty and strife. It was a trip in every sense of the word,
across the chasm separating the truly rich and the achingly poor.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid memories of that journey returned as I watched footage of
last weekend's demonstrations in Washington against the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank _ a rich-vs.-rich
argument over the rich-poor divide, between protesters from the
wealthiest nation on Earth and well-heeled officials over the
destiny of the world's poor, who were not, of course, present.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, I was rubbing shoulders with dot-com billionaires,
oil industry barons and sleek investment bankers, in an Alpine
village set among the pristine snow fields. The elect of the World
Economic Forum seemed almost to glow in contentment, suffused by
the huge prosperity of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The next minute, on the Angola-Zambia border, I found myself
among the poorest of the poor, in a setting where the meaning of
the word economy had been distilled to the essentials of survival.
</P>
<P>
   In Davos, the talk had been of a global economic revolution,
with technology and knowledge as its standard-bearers. In Zambia,
north of a town called Mwinilunga, the talk was of whether the few
dollars in school fees levied by the state would be better used
buying food for the family.
</P>
<P>
   I had lived in Zambia in the mid-1970s, at the height of the war
between nationalist guerrillas from Zimbabwe and what was then the
white minority regime in Rhodesia. Hardship was visible then, too,
in the endless lines of women with babies strapped to their backs,
patiently waiting for corn or salt or sugar. But Zambians were told
that sacrifice was necessary, the price the nation paid for serving
as a base for the guerrillas in their struggle for majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century later, the appeals to a higher cause were
gone. Not globalization, but economic regionalization had arrived
with the ending of apartheid in South Africa. The beneficiaries
were a small urban elite, who carried cell phones and shopped at
stores transplanted from the malls of Johannesburg and Cape Town.
Anglo American Corp., the huge mining transnational based in
Johannesburg and London, was negotiating to buy back at fire-sale
prices the same copper mines it had lost to nationalization at
Zambia's independence from Britain in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gleaming Shoprite supermarkets and the Steers
restaurants, in the urban shanties or in the countryside, was the
rest of the nation. The economy, victimized by years of
mismanagement and burdened by debt, was paralyzed, dependent on the
copper mines that earned badly-needed hard currency for state
coffers. The mines lost $150 million a year for the operators.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1970s, each Zambian's share of the national
wealth was tallied by the World Bank at a lowly $630; by the late
1990s it had fallen to $380. The currency, the Kwacha, had fallen
to something like one two-thousandth of its value in the 1970s, and
85 percent of the 8.2 million population lived on less than $1 a
day. AIDS infected 1.6 million people _ 20 percent of the
population _ killing the adults and creating a lost generation:
More than half the population is now under the age of 15, children
living in extended families with a dwindling number of wage
earners.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, of course, misery is just a
fact, rarely dramatic enough to draw the bright lights of a
visiting TV crew. In Zambia, for example, the economy had stagnated
long before globalization simply passed it by. Far to the northwest
of Lusaka, the Zambian capital, children of grade-school age tilled
dry fields instead of attending class. In the lee of the copper
mine dumps, which once symbolized Zambia's wealth, the highways
were so badly potholed that it was hard to see any asphalt surface.
Eleven-year-olds along the roadside sold stunted tomatoes at 15
cents a bunch from crudely woven baskets, earning pennies from
infrequent motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The global wealth imbalance between north and south is nothing
new. Indeed, in Africa, a pattern of dependency was established in
the colonial 19th century. Then as now, it was a leap in northern
technology _ the industrial revolution then, the Internet
revolution now _ that caused the gulf to widen. Then, as now, the
developed world set the rules. But if the new game of globalization
demands the free flow of money and trade, the question is whether
the parts of Africa I visited even have the chips to play.
</P>
<P>
   As the pace of change in the developed world _ embodied by the
Davos set _ has rocketed, buoyed by globalized trade and currency
flows, by soaring stock valuations and the stunning wealth created
by America's record growth, much of Africa has, at best, stood
still. And investment, the grease on which the global economy
glides, has largely dried up in the face of the continent's chronic
instability.

   LONDON _ In early February, on assignment to seek out diamond
smugglers, I traveled straight from the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, to a place in central Africa where the borders
of three nations _ Congo, Angola and Zambia _ fuse in a triangle of
poverty and strife. It was a trip in every sense of the word,
across the chasm separating the truly rich and the achingly poor.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid memories of that journey returned as I watched footage of
last weekend's demonstrations in Washington against the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank _ a rich-vs.-rich
argument over the rich-poor divide, between protesters from the
wealthiest nation on Earth and well-heeled officials over the
destiny of the world's poor, who were not, of course, present.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, I was rubbing shoulders with dot-com billionaires,
oil industry barons and sleek investment bankers, in an Alpine
village set among the pristine snow fields. The elect of the World

   In the south of Zambia spindly men, silhouetted against the
fierce light of the Zambezi valley, held up their wares for sale _
a tortoise in one hand, a chunk of crystalline rock the color of
amethyst in the other _ hoping to earn a few dollars. Others held
wads of Zambian currency, fluttering in their hands like small
birds, offering an illegal exchange for Zimbabwe dollars. Even
Zimbabwe, with its intractable economic woes, had more to offer
these desperate men than their own country.
</P>
<P>
   In Davos, according to one survey, 50 percent of business
leaders thought the Internet-driven New Economy would help close
the gap between rich and poor, and 38 percent thought it would not.
Those figures seemed surreal in places like Jimbe on the
Zambia-Angola border, 50 miles of dirt track from the nearest
telephone or electric power. When conversation in Switzerland
turned to ``the market,'' the word denoted global tides of
trillions of dollars flowing through the wired world. At Jimbe,
``the market'' meant a twice-weekly sale of scrawny chickens and
plump pineapples, which had been suspended since Angola launched a
bombing attack a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The question, in a place like Jimbe, is not so much whether
globalization would help the poor in these parts of the developing
world, as whether it extended here at all. Globalization, after
all, unites those with the training and resources to leap onto a
speeding technological bandwagon. But what of those condemned,
often by their own leaders' greed and incompetence as much as by
anything else, to the roadside?
</P>
<P>
   I T was literally on the roadside, north of Mwinilunga, for
instance, that I met Gerry Majoni, a 23-year-old student. He was
walking 40 miles to visit an uncle, from whom he hoped to borrow
about $8 in school fees and collect a new school uniform so that he
could fulfill his dream of an education. He was walking because
there were no buses and few bush taxis that he could afford. Even a
bicycle was a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate vicinity, the only connection to the developed
world's riches was a square thatched hut that had been painted with
a large, black Nike logo, an expression of impossible yearning for
a distant world _ in Davos, say, or Washington _ where $100
sneakers are the norm. Outside the hut stood a young woman holding
a baby. She wore no shoes at all.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The prospects seemed bright when the
Internet was recently introduced in a remote part of the
mountainous Cotopoxi region in Ecuador. Under the guidance of aid
workers, Quichua-speaking peasants planned to gather crop
information and sell their crafts over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, it was discovered that some of the men were using
the computer to visit pornographic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed, the women began to question how the men were treating
them, and a debate ensued over the common practice of beating
women. Although use of the Internet was later curtailed, its
introduction unexpectedly generated discussion on a once taboo
topic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes created by the Internet in rich industrialized
nations are well known, affecting everything from how people date
to how they work. But less is known about the impact on societies
with limited contact with the rest of the world. As such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: The way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the world
is likely to be altered forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadorean peasants were a case in point. ``The impact was
huge, but as it almost always is when the Internet makes it to such
a community, quite surprising,'' said Amalia Souza, a Brazilian
technology expert familiar with the project who has been an adviser
on programs that bring the Internet to poor communities in more
than 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago the women of the impoverished Wapishana
and Macushi tribes of Guyana were introduced to the Internet in a
project sponsored by Bill Humphries, who headed Guyana Telephone &AMP;
Telegragh at the time and was optimistic about technology's
money-making potential. The tribal power structures were shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The women began making money by marketing their intricate
hand-woven hammocks over the Web at $1,000 each. Feeling
threatened, the traditional regional leadership took control of the
organization, alienating and finally driving out the young woman
who ran the Web site. The weaving group fell into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events should be a case study for students of economics
and social work,'' wrote Indera Ramlall, who is Guyanese, in a
letter to a newspaper in the capital city of Georgetown. ``Economic
advancement is not just about technology and markets; more
fundamentally, it is about human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Progress was the great hope of the Kennedy
administration in the early 1960s. Its aim was to thwart communism
with U.S. aid to Central America, bridging the gap between poor and
rich societies by building roads, factories and bridges. But aid to
El Salvador tore the social fabric, contributed to the oppression
of the poor, increased the holdings of the land-owning classes and
helped fuel civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in developing countries these days, inspiration
is increasingly drawn from Bill Gates. Some of the outwardly
successful development projects, like the Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh, are trying to deal with the unforeseen impact on the
people they are trying to help. The Grameen Bank provides small
amounts of credit to more than two million poor people, mainly
women, enabling them to invest in raising livestock or
entrepreneurial ventures like buying rickshaws. But critics say the
focus on women, who are considered more reliable borrowers than
men, has caused considerable tension between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistributing income from men to women, sharing out the
misery of a shrinking cake, is not going to solve the people's
problems,'' said Para Teare, a London-based social scientist who
has studied such micro-lending programs, in a critique of the
Grameen Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as technology starts to blur the distinction between
industrialized countries and developing ones, social transition, if
not transformation, has become an issue in some of the world's most
remote regions. A recent issue of Cultural Survival, a magazine
that covers indigenous people and ethnic minorities, described
projects to bring the Web to communities as varied as the
reindeer-herding Sami of Scandinavia and northern Russian, the
aboriginal peoples of the Northwest Territories in Canada, the
ethnic minorities of Burma and native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts represent a departure from the idea that
introducing new technologies to indigenous peoples will bring about
negative results. Such thinking, which dates back to Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, the 18th-century philosopher who lured Europe into
idealizing the simple lifestyle of the noble savage, appears to be
coming undone in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not realistic to think that as the world gets smaller
there should be enclaves untouched by Western technology,'' said
Robert Whelan, a writer on indigenous affairs at the Institute of
Economic Affairs in London. ``But it is realistic to realize that
traditional cultures can be very oppressive, especially for women
and wildlife, and that technology can help change this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the double-edged nature of technology's impact
is beneficial. For the Grameen Bank, credit is considered a weapon
for alleviating poverty and oppressive policies affecting women.
Yet some societies are better equipped than others to deal with an
onslaught of technological change. The American Amish, who are
known for their rigid views about technology, have banned the car
and computer but not the pocket calculator. A few Amish also use
the Internet, albeit quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are not so sure about placing too much value on
technology's liberating potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you introduce the Internet to people whose most urgent
need is to get enough food to eat each day,'' said Karin
Delgadillo, a coordinator at ChasquiNet, which provides technology
assistance to remote communities in Quito, Ecuador, ``you see there
are other priorities that need to be taken care of first.''

   Some people think the double-edged nature of technology's impact
is beneficial. For the Grameen Bank, credit is considered a weapon
for alleviating poverty and oppressive policies affecting women.
Yet some societies are better equipped than others to deal with an
onslaught of technological change. The American Amish, who are
known for their rigid views about technology, have banned the car
and computer but not the pocket calculator. A few Amish also use
the Internet, albeit quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are not so sure about placing too much value on
technology's liberating potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you introduce the Internet to people whose most urgent
need is to get enough food to eat each day,'' said Karin
Delgadillo, a coordinator at ChasquiNet, which provides technology
assistance to remote communities in Quito, Ecuador, ``you see there
are other priorities that need to be taken care of first.''

   WASHINGTON _ At the top of Iran's list of historical grievances
against the United States is the coup engineered by the CIA in 1953
to oust Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstate Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi.
</P>
<P>
   During the revolution in 1979 and the seizure of the U.S.
Embassy that soon followed, militant Iranians often cited the coup
as proof of the United States' evil designs in Iran. Over the
years, the coup has fueled a conspiracy-theory view, widely held
among ordinary Iranians, that external powers, particularly the
United States, are behind every misfortune to befall Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So one might have expected that the surfacing of a secret
official CIA report that lays out the U.S. plot in all its detail
would have been the talk of Iranian political and journalistic
circles last week.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a moment for historical reflection in Iran. Iranians
are too busy fighting a brutal, open-ended political war in real
time to worry much about a short, if equally brutal, war 47 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today's war is waged on several fronts _ the courts, the press,
television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the bazaar, the streets.
And last week the fighting was particularly intense, having heated
up after reformist candidates swept to victory in the first round
of Parliamentary elections in February. The stakes are high _ the
nature of the Islamic Republic itself _ and the outcome is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The story mesmerizing the Iranian media last week was not out of
Washington but out of Berlin; its subject was the disruption by
opponents of the Islamic Republic of a conference there on Iranian
politics. The protesters heckled the speakers, all of them
reformers. One woman protested with a hip-rotating dance. Another
stripped to her bra and panties.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers expressed embarrassment and disgust. But the
protest was videotaped and much of the footage was aired on Iran's
state-controlled television, in an effort to discredit the reform
movement.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, 140 members of the outgoing Parliament
had signed a letter to the nation's leading conservative cleric,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, branding the conference participants
``traitors'' and calling on the judiciary (which Khamenei controls
as Iran's Supreme Leader) to punish them. Ayatollah Abolghasem
Khazali, who is never unrestrained in his language, said the
participants deserved to die. ``They insult Islamic sanctities,''
he was quoted in the reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz as saying.
``They attend a conference to say nonsense. Kill them wherever you
find them. This is God's unchangeable position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin incident was not the only example of a political
bloodletting since the parliamentary elections. Recently the
Expediency Council, an oversight body headed by former President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, ruled that the new Parliament will
have no authority to investigate any institutions controlled by
Khamenei. That would deprive Parliament of the power to look into
abuses in the judiciary, radio and television, the intelligence and
security apparatus and the giant state-supported foundations that
control huge swaths of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, Khamenei delivered an extraordinary sermon in
which he acknowledged a need for reform in all of Iran's major
institutions. But he also denounced the promotion of ``U.S.-style
reform'' as inauthentic and un-Islamic, further emboldening
conservatives who often act in his name. The Merchants' Association
of the Tehran bazaar, for example, called for the bazaar to close
last Thursday as a show of support. But Thursday is the best
shopping day of the week. In bold defiance _ and a sign of how
fluid and unpredictable politics have become in Iran _ merchants
opened their doors anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is even talk of a coup, but it has nothing to do with
1953. Last Sunday, the Revolutionary Guards issued an official
threat against the reformists. ``If necessary, our enemies, be they
small or large, will feel the reverberating impact of the hammer of
the Islamic revolution on their skulls,'' the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   While all this has been going on, a council responsible for
vetting candidates and overseeing elections has invalidated the
first-round election victories of a number of reformist candidates
and a run-off election has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   To silence an increasingly emboldened press, the outgoing
conservative Parliament also passed a law last week that severely
restricts the activities of the press. And a high-profile,
high-stakes trial of 13 Jews and several Muslims on charges of
spying for Israel remains in the background, having been put off
until next month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the remarkable thing about this moment is that all of
this evidence of a conservative backlash has failed to quiet the
reformists. One pro-reform group, the Islamic Revolution
Mujaheddini Organization, responded to the Revolutionary Guards
communique by calling its goal ``a childish dream.'' In a letter
released to the newspapers, the group said that ``The power mafia
is seeking to justify an anti-reform coup with the goal of imposing
dictatorship under the cover of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism is even coming from the far provinces. After the
state-run television announced the invalidation of the election of
the candidate from the town of Oshnaviyeh in West Azerbaijan
province, the local governor, Ali Mostafavi, called the move unjust
and unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson for the United States in all this. U.S.
policy-makers have clearly been hoping for months now that modest
concessions to Iran, like a lightening of sanctions, may encourage
a dialogue _ and that a change in the U.S. attitude toward Iran's
history can only help. Last month, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced the easing of sanctions on non-oil
exports from Iran, she called the ``democratic winds'' in Iran ``so
refreshing'' and acknowledged U.S. errors in past dealings with
Iran, including the CIA-led coup in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still waiting for the Iranians to respond to that
speech with concrete gestures. The problem is that the political
winds now blowing in Iran are more like a hurricane. And until they
subside, there is little chance of meaningful movement toward the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will arrive in New York for
United Nations-related business this week, but he has been turning
down invitations to speak. In such a wild and uncertain atmosphere,
what could he possibly say?

<P>
   In this time of dizzying volatility on Wall Street, no company's
fortunes have seesawed quite so dramatically as those of
PipeDream.com, since its (imaginary) initial public offering in
January.
</P>
<P>
   PipeDream's stock zoomed from an initial price of $2 a share to
468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder and chief
executive, Ethan Proctor, the youngest dot-com billionaire on
record. During the recent sell-off in technology stocks, however,
PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how the fledgling company was weathering the storm,
we arranged to meet Proctor at the Silicon Valley Video Arcade in
Mountain View, Calif., where the 17-year-old visionary was leading
his senior managers in a team-building exercise involving the
obliteration of slime creatures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times: Mr. Proctor, what has been your greatest
challenge in starting this company?
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Proctor: Homework.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Homework?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Well, yeah. I've got this English teacher? And she's
making us read Beowulf? It's sort of hard to develop international
marketing strategies when you know you're getting quizzed on the
genealogy of Hrothgar and Unferth right after lunch period.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: So it's been a struggle?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Absolutely. If it weren't for The Geekmeister here (chief
financial officer Thomas Benson Jr.), we'd never have been able to
get granular on our business plan in time for the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Mr. Benson, is it true that you and Mr. Proctor
started PipeDream in the basement of your mother's ranch house in
suburban San Jose?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Benson: Totally.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Where is corporate headquarters now?
</P>
<P>
   T.B.: In the garage, behind the broken sofa-bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: It must have been a thrill to engineer one of the
most successful IPOs in Nasdaq history. How do you explain your
company's initial success?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Obviously the market understood that PipeDream's unique
position _ straddling the B2B and e-commerce sectors _ would allow
us to really pancake the value chain, injecting old economy
revenue-growth models at new economy valuations. Plus, a lot of
people seemed to like the name.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Nonetheless, PipeDream is an untested company run by
young, inexperienced executives, without even the remotest
expectation of a profit. What do you say to people who claim that
prices of companies like PipeDream were ripe for a correction?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: All I can say is they sound like my mom (vice president
for commissary operations Helen Proctor). We gave her the chance to
load up on stock options at the very beginning, but she did a total
self-toast. Told me that the only thing she wanted in exchange for
her services was that I clean up my room.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: And what does she say now?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: She stopped being mad at me when I bought her a
controlling interest in Mary Kay Cosmetics for her birthday. But
now, after the correction, she keeps going ``I told you so, I told
you so.'' I hate that.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: But doesn't she have a point? Given the drop in your
market capitalization, won't you have trouble raising the money you
need to achieve your growth targets?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: OK, the VCs have sort of stopped returning my phone calls.
But my management team and I are exploring alternative funding
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Paper routes. And Dad's raising my allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Some of your critics have complained that PipeDream
seems to lack focus. What is PipeDream's mission in the
marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Well, like, we represent a new, you know, paradigm, geared
to the rapidly-changing realities of the 21st-century virtual
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: But what kind of product or service do you provide?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: ``Product'' and ``service'' are totally last millennium
concepts. PipeDream is the future, and so whatever the future turns
out to be, PipeDream's going to be right there. What more do
investors need to know?

<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
patients can enjoy a live midday classical music concert between
chemotherapy treatments. In Newport Beach, Calif., Dr. George
Brennan, a dermatologist, sells his skin-care creams out of his
office. At a hospital on New York's Long Island, nurses are
learning how to massage premature babies, a skill they will pass on
to new parents.
</P>
<P>
   Today Americans have new expectations about their health care
system. They want the very latest in medical technology to cure
their diseases, just as they hunger for the latest sports utility
vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they are also seeking
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also looking to medicine to improve their looks, often in an
environment where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can
all be done under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   And the health care industry is responding to consumer demand.
Not only are doctors offering more aesthetic procedures, but
hospitals are also adding complementary services _ departments that
enhance traditional care, hospital administrators say, but do not
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Services like massage therapy for a cancer patient or anti-aging
creams for a dermatology client give doctors and hospitals a
competitive edge. Patients pay for much of this care, especially
aesthetic procedures, in full and in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives realize that they need to borrow a page from
the hotel industry to attract patients. It is not enough to be set
up on the beach when all your competitors are there, too _ extras
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that in the consumers' mind, the notion of
what is health care has broadened considerably in the last
decade,'' said Dr. George Tyson, an administrator at University
Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook, N.Y., which offers
infant massage among the services in its complementary medicine
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a health care system that above and beyond illness
improves their quality of life,'' Tyson said. ``At the same time,
this industry is looking for new sources of revenue and has the
capacity to meet this demand. So it seems to be the ideal match.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have ample evidence that Americans are looking outside
of traditional medicine in their pursuit of good health. Americans
spent $27.2 billion on alternative, nontraditional care in 1998. A
recent study published in the American Cancer Society's journal
found that 37 percent of prostate cancer patients turned to
vitamins, massage therapy, herbal remedies and relaxation therapy
as part of their treatment; other studies have gleaned similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   Many health care experts say that part of what drives patients'
interest in this area is their desire to play some role in their
own care. ``Patients these days are not passive recipients of
care,'' said Barrie R. Cassileth, who runs the complementary center
at Sloan Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Care in cancer medicine can be very scattered,'' Cassileth
said. ``Patients usually have several physicians, and it is very
difficult to interact with all those individuals and have a sense
of wholeness. People want connections and to better understand what
is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Americans now treat health care much like any
other consumed good _ they comparison shop, check the Internet for
new information about their illness and quiz doctors about
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providers have to work hard to favorably differentiate
themselves,'' said Tyson. ``But because the quality of care is not
measured in any precise way, another strategy is to offer services
that the public is looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson points to cancer as one example. ``With cancer, a
considerable number of patients are looking for cutting-edge
conventional care combined with a kinder, gentler form of
medicine,'' he said. ``This can be used to differentiate your
cancer care center from the one across town.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the members of the American Academy of
Medical Acupuncture have hospital privileges; five years ago that
number was closer to 5 percent, said James Dowden, executive
administrator for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Richard C. Niemtzow is the military's first acupuncturist.
He runs a pilot program at the Naval Medical Center San Diego to
treat pain and nausea in the center's pain clinic and breast health
center.
</P>
<P>
   The John S. Marten Center for Complementary Medicine and Pain
Management started nine years ago at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Indianapolis after its benefactor, who was dying of prostate
cancer, proclaimed he wanted a center for pain that did not depend
on narcotics. The program, which is expanding, includes
acupuncture, herbal medicine and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wesley Wong, who is the medical director of the medical
specialities service line at St. Vincent's Hospital, said the
complementary services are hugely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We book up four weeks in advance,'' he said.

<P>
   In this time of dizzying volatility on Wall Street, no company's
fortunes have seesawed quite so dramatically as those of
PipeDream.com, since its (imaginary) initial public offering in
January.
</P>
<P>
   PipeDream's stock zoomed from an initial price of $2 a share to
468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder and chief
executive, Ethan Proctor, the youngest dot-com billionaire on
record. During the recent sell-off in technology stocks, however,
PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how the fledgling company was weathering the storm,
we arranged to meet Proctor at the Silicon Valley Video Arcade in
Mountain View, Calif., where the 17-year-old visionary was leading
his senior managers in a team-building exercise involving the
obliteration of slime creatures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times: Mr. Proctor, what has been your greatest
challenge in starting this company?
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Proctor: Homework.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Homework?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Well, yeah. I've got this English teacher? And she's
making us read Beowulf? It's sort of hard to develop international
marketing strategies when you know you're getting quizzed on the
genealogy of Hrothgar and Unferth right after lunch period.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: So it's been a struggle?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Absolutely. If it weren't for The Geekmeister here (chief
financial officer Thomas Benson Jr.), we'd never have been able to
get granular on our business plan in time for the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Mr. Benson, is it true that you and Mr. Proctor
started PipeDream in the basement of your mother's ranch house in
suburban San Jose?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Benson: Totally.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Where is corporate headquarters now?
</P>
<P>
   T.B.: In the garage, behind the broken sofa-bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: It must have been a thrill to engineer one of the
most successful IPOs in Nasdaq history. How do you explain your
company's initial success?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Obviously the market understood that PipeDream's unique
position _ straddling the B2B and e-commerce sectors _ would allow
us to really pancake the value chain, injecting old economy
revenue-growth models at new economy valuations. Plus, a lot of
people seemed to like the name.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Nonetheless, PipeDream is an untested company run by
young, inexperienced executives, without even the remotest
expectation of a profit. What do you say to people who claim that
prices of companies like PipeDream were ripe for a correction?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: All I can say is they sound like my mom (vice president
for commissary operations Helen Proctor). We gave her the chance to
load up on stock options at the very beginning, but she did a total
self-toast. Told me that the only thing she wanted in exchange for
her services was that I clean up my room.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: And what does she say now?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: She stopped being mad at me when I bought her a
controlling interest in Mary Kay Cosmetics for her birthday. But
now, after the correction, she keeps going ``I told you so, I told
you so.'' I hate that.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: But doesn't she have a point? Given the drop in your
market capitalization, won't you have trouble raising the money you
need to achieve your growth targets?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: OK, the VCs have sort of stopped returning my phone calls.
But my management team and I are exploring alternative funding
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Paper routes. And Dad's raising my allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: Some of your critics have complained that PipeDream
seems to lack focus. What is PipeDream's mission in the
marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: Well, like, we represent a new, you know, paradigm, geared
to the rapidly-changing realities of the 21st-century virtual
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Times: But what kind of product or service do you provide?
</P>
<P>
   E.P.: ``Product'' and ``service'' are totally last millennium
concepts. PipeDream is the future, and so whatever the future turns
out to be, PipeDream's going to be right there. What more do
investors need to know?

NEW CASH COWS: A LA CARTE AT THE HOSPITAL

<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
patients can enjoy a live midday classical music concert between
chemotherapy treatments. In Newport Beach, Calif., Dr. George
Brennan, a dermatologist, sells his skin-care creams out of his
office. At a hospital on New York's Long Island, nurses are
learning how to massage premature babies, a skill they will pass on
to new parents.
</P>
<P>
   Today Americans have new expectations about their health care
system. They want the very latest in medical technology to cure
their diseases, just as they hunger for the latest sports utility
vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they are also seeking
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also looking to medicine to improve their looks, often in an
environment where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can
all be done under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   And the health care industry is responding to consumer demand.
Not only are doctors offering more aesthetic procedures, but
hospitals are also adding complementary services _ departments that
enhance traditional care, hospital administrators say, but do not
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Services like massage therapy for a cancer patient or anti-aging
creams for a dermatology client give doctors and hospitals a
competitive edge. Patients pay for much of this care, especially
aesthetic procedures, in full and in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives realize that they need to borrow a page from
the hotel industry to attract patients. It is not enough to be set
up on the beach when all your competitors are there, too _ extras
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that in the consumers' mind, the notion of
what is health care has broadened considerably in the last
decade,'' said Dr. George Tyson, an administrator at University
Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook, N.Y., which offers
infant massage among the services in its complementary medicine
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a health care system that above and beyond illness
improves their quality of life,'' Tyson said. ``At the same time,
this industry is looking for new sources of revenue and has the
capacity to meet this demand. So it seems to be the ideal match.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have ample evidence that Americans are looking outside
of traditional medicine in their pursuit of good health. Americans
spent $27.2 billion on alternative, nontraditional care in 1998. A
recent study published in the American Cancer Society's journal
found that 37 percent of prostate cancer patients turned to
vitamins, massage therapy, herbal remedies and relaxation therapy
as part of their treatment; other studies have gleaned similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   Many health care experts say that part of what drives patients'
interest in this area is their desire to play some role in their
own care. ``Patients these days are not passive recipients of
care,'' said Barrie R. Cassileth, who runs the complementary center
at Sloan Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Care in cancer medicine can be very scattered,'' Cassileth
said. ``Patients usually have several physicians, and it is very
difficult to interact with all those individuals and have a sense
of wholeness. People want connections and to better understand what
is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Americans now treat health care much like any
other consumed good _ they comparison shop, check the Internet for
new information about their illness and quiz doctors about
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providers have to work hard to favorably differentiate
themselves,'' said Tyson. ``But because the quality of care is not
measured in any precise way, another strategy is to offer services
that the public is looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson points to cancer as one example. ``With cancer, a
considerable number of patients are looking for cutting-edge
conventional care combined with a kinder, gentler form of
medicine,'' he said. ``This can be used to differentiate your
cancer care center from the one across town.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the members of the American Academy of
Medical Acupuncture have hospital privileges; five years ago that
number was closer to 5 percent, said James Dowden, executive
administrator for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Richard C. Niemtzow is the military's first acupuncturist.
He runs a pilot program at the Naval Medical Center San Diego to
treat pain and nausea in the center's pain clinic and breast health
center.
</P>
<P>
   The John S. Marten Center for Complementary Medicine and Pain
Management started nine years ago at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Indianapolis after its benefactor, who was dying of prostate
cancer, proclaimed he wanted a center for pain that did not depend
on narcotics. The program, which is expanding, includes
acupuncture, herbal medicine and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wesley Wong, who is the medical director of the medical
specialities service line at St. Vincent's Hospital, said the
complementary services are hugely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We book up four weeks in advance,'' he said.

<P>
   Our memory of Vietnam, like any other, is shaped in part by what
we allow ourselves to say, and that has changed over the years, as
have my generation and the country that sent many of us to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   When I went there in 1969, and when I returned home a year and
12 days later, Vietnam was a subject my friends and I avoided
talking about. For those who had not gone, there was something
embarrassing about talking to someone who had, after all the
energies they had all expended on damning the war and anyone who
was part of it, and on eluding the draft. And for my part, I had no
interest in defending a war that all the guys in my unit hated just
as much, only in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   We were not grunts, the sweat-soaked kids in jungle fatigues so
familiar now from movies and that bronze sculpture of three
servicemen next to the Vietnam memorial in Washington. Drafted out
of graduate school, I was trained in artillery fire direction
control, assigned to the 23rd Artillery Group in II Field Force,
and, in the enigmatic wisdom of the Army, set to work as a
personnel clerk, first in Long Binh, the huge base not far from
Saigon, then in Phu Loi, on the highway to Cambodia. Many of the
guys in the headquarters were also older, drafted from college and
graduate school, but we counted days like everybody else, wore
peace symbols, pulled guard duty and proclaimed that 'Nam was ``No.
10'' _ bad.
</P>
<P>
   But our 'Nam was not the Vietnam back home: These were entirely
different concepts that shared only the name of a lovely and badly
scarred country in Southeast Asia, whose delicate-looking people,
history and customs very few of us _ ``in country'' or ``in the
world'' _ ever bothered to learn about. Over there we lived in a
world of our own, a sweaty, sometimes dangerous place where we wore
loose jungle fatigues, slept in hootches, wrote long letters home,
longed for R&AMP;R and counted days to DEROS (``date of estimated
return from overseas'') and the Freedom Bird that would take us
home. It was a place with a GI culture and language all its own,
where grunts humped the paddies to waste Charlie or get blown away,
where angry brothers fragged white officers, where Vietnamese
squatting by the roadside sold No. 1 (best) grass in deftly
resealed Marlboro packs and there were always several choppers
slapping through the rancid black plumes from burning latrine cans.
</P>
<P>
   We were young, we bonded, we changed. And we returned home to
the other Vietnam, the domestic battlefield of hard-hats and
peaceniks, the Vietnam that one side proclaimed the front line
against godless communism, and the other a symbol of all the greed
and immorality of a perfidious Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I came back, the protests waned, but we still avoided
talking about the war. Some veterans felt alienated among peers
who, they felt, looked on them with condescension, as sad guys who
had been fooled into fighting an immoral war. Most of us simply
didn't know what to say, both those who had been there or those who
had not, especially after the Americans abandoned Vietnam in that
excruciating display of shame, panic and betrayal. There was the
beginning of a literature, most notably Michael Herr's brilliant
``Dispatches,'' David Rabe's off-Broadway staging of ``The Basic
Training of Pavlo Hummel,'' Ronald Glasser's ``365 Days.'' But they
were glimpses of 'Nam, not a reckoning. That began in earnest only
with the Vietnam memorial in 1982, possibly the most honest shrine
ever raised to the fallen soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that developed in the
1980s was far different from any Vietnam, or any grunt, I had
known. Movies like ``Apocalypse Now,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' or
``Platoon'' created a swampy, fiery hell peopled by psychopaths
(``I love the smell of napalm in the morning''). They complemented
emerging images in the media of the ``Vietnam vet'' as a troubled
and neglected victim _ a scraggly and deranged outcast with a
rumpled boony hat, a legless victim converted to pacifism, a
returning POW scarred by unspeakable horrors. There were all these,
to be sure, and others: For some veterans, the emotional conflict
between the abiding loyalties of shared danger and the shame of a
failed and unpopular war coalesced into an impassioned crusade to
account for all missing GIs. For military officers, Vietnam became
a nightmarish memory of body bags, humiliation and division, until
any mission that carried even the remotest hint of ``another
Vietnam'' encountered instinctive resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the conflicting and bizarre images, at least we
could talk about it now. Writers like Tim O'Brien (``The Things
They Carried''), Neil Sheehan (``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul
Vann and America in Vietnam'') and many others began to look more
deeply into the war and the men who made and fought it. We also
began to talk about it among ourselves and with our children, for
whom the '60s and Vietnam already had the pallor of history and
myth. The recriminations could still surface, but as we grew older
we could look on old passions with forbearance, even nostalgia.
With time, the Vietnam vet became a respectable, even slightly
romantic figure, and politicians like Sens. John F. Kerry, Bob
Kerrey and John McCain, who had served in Vietnam, acquired a moral
edge over those, like Bill Clinton, who had not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In moments of honesty, we began admitting to one another that
our actions all those years ago were not always as noble as we
liked to think they were.
</P>
<P>
   At the 25th reunion of my class at Harvard in 1992, a panel
discussion titled ``The Choices We Made,'' turned into a stunning
exercise in brutal candor, almost confession. Hundreds of us sat
spellbound hour after hour as one classmate after another explored
why he or she had opposed the war, or participated in it. Only
after the custodians threatened to turn off the lights and lock us
in did the meeting break up. One man acknowledged, to my silent
empathy, that he went only because he would never be able to face
his father if he didn't. My family were immigrants, I might have
added, and my father would have taken my dodging the draft as rank
ingratitude. The speaker tried to tell about a friend who was blown
away before his eyes, but could not, leaving us all in a long and
terrible silence. A woman then acknowledged that she became active
against the war also, and only, out of deference to her parents.
Then: ``Actually, they were Communist Party members.'' Then,
quietly, ``So was I.'' Another classmate told of never building a
life after years of protests and jails, and of finally landing work
as a train conductor. When one former member of the Students for a
Democratic Society _ the radical SDS _ launched into an aggressive
recital of old charges, he was universally jeered into silence. We
had tacitly agreed that day that only conscience could judge the
choices we had made.
</P>
<P>
   The old controversies still surface sometimes. But by and large,
the war is fading from the public consciousness. There is no
communist threat any more, and a wholly new Army has been built, in
which only a handful of senior officers served in Vietnam. In the
rare movie that uses Vietnam, like ``Rules of Engagement,'` the war
is little more than a handy cliche. For today's children, I
sometimes think with amazement, Vietnam is almost as remote as
World War I was for us _ only lacking the glow that national memory
reserves for victories.

   It became the most remembered photograph of the fall of Saigon,
capturing the last chaotic days of the Vietnam War, and most people
believed that it showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof
of the U.S. Embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture
caption usually says.
</P>
<P>
   But as with much about the Vietnam War, the caption is wrong.
The building is an apartment complex. The people fleeing are
Vietnamese. The last helicopter left about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. Americans, whether
conservative or liberal, often imposed their own ideas on that
troubling war, and that seems to be what happened with the picture,
said Hubert Van Es, a United Press International photographer who
took it 25 years ago, on April 29, 1975, from the roof of a hotel
half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the correct caption on it,'' said Van Es, who now lives
in Hong Kong, ``but people back in the United States just took it
for granted that it must be the embassy, because that was where
they believed the evacuation took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture was of an apartment building for the employees of
the U.S. Agency for International Development, its top floor
reserved for the CIA's deputy chief of station. The address was 22
Gia Long St., about a half mile from the embassy. Fox Butterfield
lived around the corner as one of the last two correspondents of
The New York Times remaining in Vietnam, and he left later that
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days, as the embassy hastily prepared for the last
stage of evacuation, 22 Gia Long was chosen as one of about a dozen
possible gathering places for Americans. The secret signal for the
start of the evacuation was a radio broadcast saying the
temperature in Saigon was ``105 degrees and rising,'' followed by
the first 30 seconds of ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham A. Martin, had
delayed the final evacuation in the vain hope that President Gerald
Ford and Congress would rescue the collapsing South Vietnamese
army. Martin assumed that the U.S. Air Force could use Ton Son Nhut
air base to lift out the last few thousand Americans. But the
rapidly advancing North Vietnamese army wrecked that idea, shelling
the base on the morning of April 29 and shooting down some South
Vietnamese air force planes trying to take off, their wreckage
littering the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station chief, Thomas Polgar, had a problem. The night
before, he had telephoned a group of senior South Vietnamese
politicians, generals and police officers who had helped the
agency, telling them to gather at his house with their families for
evacuation. Among them was Tran Van Don, deputy prime minister and
defense minister, and a general who was chief of military
communications intelligence. But by late morning, the area was no
longer secure, recalled Polgar, who is now 78.
</P>
<P>
   Then Polgar had an inspiration. The elevator shaft on the roof
of the apartment building at 22 Gia Long St. might support a
landing in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Polgar brought in a CIA employee, O.B. Harnage, to direct the
Vietnamese officials and their families to Gia Long Street and have
them flown out by Air America, an airline owned by the CIA for its
operations in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   When Harnage landed on the roof in a silver Huey helicopter,
some people were panicking. Some junior officers and policemen had
been allowed in on condition that they use their weapons to keep a
crowd milling in the street outside from storming the building.
</P>
<P>
   Stationing himself next to a ladder leading onto the roof,
Harnage tried to help the Vietnamese families up. But the first man
who appeared, Harnage recalled, was a Korean who was hysterical and
Harnage punched him out of the way to maintain order. The Huey, the
workhorse of the American effort in Vietnam, normally carried about
eight passengers, but Harnage jammed in as many as 15 Vietnamese,
and jumped on the helicopter's skid, standing in the open doorway
as it flew to Tan Son Nhut on the edge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Harnage, who was later awarded a CIA medal, made four or five of
these flights to the air base, where larger Navy or Air Force
helicopters ferried the families to ships waiting in the South
China Sea. At a time when America abandoned many Vietnamese allies
and South Vietnam's military and political leaders abandoned their
own country, it was a heroic act.
</P>
<P>
   But one mystery remains. Is it indeed Harnage in the photograph?
He believes it is. The picture, which he saw a week later in a
Manila, Philippines, newspaper, shows a man in a white shirt and
dark pants, which Harnage was wearing that day. His wife also saw
the photograph. ``She said she recognized me from my backside,''
said Harnage, who is now 75. He recalled her saying she knew him
``because I was always leaving'' to go somewhere on another
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they were the ones in the picture. Polgar said he's
unsure who it is. ``But if Harnage says he is the man in that
picture, I'll take his word for it,'' he said.

 UNDATED: had not.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In moments of honesty, we began admitting to one another that
our actions all those years ago were not always as noble as we
liked to think they were.
</P>
<P>
   At the 25th reunion of my class at Harvard in 1992, a panel
discussion titled ``The Choices We Made,'' turned into a stunning
exercise in brutal candor, almost confession. Hundreds of us sat
spellbound hour after hour as one classmate after another explored
why he or she had opposed the war, or participated in it. Only
after the custodians threatened to turn off the lights and lock us
in did the meeting break up. One man acknowledged, to my silent
empathy, that he went only because he would never be able to face
his father if he didn't. My family were immigrants, I might have
added, and my father would have taken my dodging the draft as rank
ingratitude. The speaker tried to tell about a friend who was blown
away before his eyes, but could not, leaving us all in a long and
terrible silence. A woman then acknowledged that she became active
against the war also, and only, out of deference to her parents.
Then: ``Actually, they were Communist Party members.'' Then,
quietly, ``So was I.'' Another classmate told of never building a
life after years of protests and jails, and of finally landing work
as a train conductor. When one former member of the Students for a
Democratic Society _ the radical SDS _ launched into an aggressive
recital of old charges, he was universally jeered into silence. We
had tacitly agreed that day that only conscience could judge the
choices we had made.
</P>
<P>
   The old controversies still surface sometimes. But by and large,
the war is fading from the public consciousness. There is no
communist threat any more, and a wholly new Army has been built, in
which only a handful of senior officers served in Vietnam. In the
rare movie that uses Vietnam, like ``Rules of Engagement,'` the war
is little more than a handy cliche. For today's children, I
sometimes think with amazement, Vietnam is almost as remote as
World War I was for us _ only lacking the glow that national memory
reserves for victories.

<P>
   It became the most remembered photograph of the fall of Saigon,
capturing the last chaotic days of the Vietnam War, and most people
believed that it showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof
of the U.S. Embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture
caption usually says.
</P>
<P>
   But as with much about the Vietnam War, the caption is wrong.
The building is an apartment complex. The people fleeing are
Vietnamese. The last helicopter left about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. Americans, whether
conservative or liberal, often imposed their own ideas on that
troubling war, and that seems to be what happened with the picture,
said Hubert Van Es, a United Press International photographer who

<P>
   Not so long ago, it seems, nations were able to hide their
armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy civilians,
while militaries could pry into most corners of the globe from spy
satellites, knowing they could control who could take a peek.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Taking pictures from space is undergoing a revolution,
and it is making some governments feel naked.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies in a growing number of countries are launching
an increasingly sophisticated fleet of reconnaissance satellites,
and governments are finding it harder and harder to restrict what
snapshots are distributed to anyone willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A recent case involves Area 51, a secret military installation
in a secluded valley northwest of Las Vegas that is thought to be
used to test advanced aircraft. For decades, the U.S. government
kept it off limits to cameras. Known officially as Groom Lake, it
was veiled in high security, mysterious lights and, UFO buffs
claim, test flights of captured alien spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, private sleuths won a quiet battle for openness at
Area 51 _ at least on what can be seen from the sky _ as commercial
rivals sold space photos of it. In the fast developing field of
private photography from orbit, the episode suggests a new frailty
for any efforts at state censorship.
</P>
<P>
   When civilian reconnaissance craft were first launched into
space in 1972, there was a vast technological gap between them and
their older but more powerful cousins, the military spy satellites.
All the civilian photos of small objects in those days were fuzzy.
But over the decades, they have become increasingly sharp. At
first, the spacecraft were able to show identifiable objects no
smaller than 100 meters ( 300 feet). Then that number fell to 30,
10, 5, 2 and now 1 meter, or 3 feet. At that resolution, cars,
roads, buildings, tanks, ships, jets and missiles can be
distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one company, Space Imaging, in Thornton, Colo., has
put a one-meter craft into orbit. But other companies in the United
States, Russia, Japan, Israel and South Korea are planning to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Already, analysts say, commercial spy craft are so numerous and
competitive as to undercut governmental efforts to curb what they
disseminate. Russia can bar the operators of a Russian satellite
from selling pictures of Chechnya, but it has no power over an
American company. Likewise, any U.S. efforts to control spying on
Area 51 were rendered moot last week when a Russian company put its
imagery of the base on the market. Some snoop, the experts say,
will always be willing to sell closeups of sensitive zones that
some other nation wants off limits, encouraging a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't last,'' Ann M. Florini, a space reconnaissance expert
at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, said of state censorship.
``It's hard to imagine any foreign-policy situations where all the
actors are going to get together and agree, `Yes, that imagery is
not going to be disseminated.'''
</P>
<P>
   In military terms, of course, it's been decades since any nation
could count on real security from the prying eyes of foes. Missile
testing, bomb development and large-scale military operations have
long been detected _ or forced to try to hide from spy satellites
by dint of camouflage and subterfuge. Even so, it hasn't usually
been to the spyer's advantage to make its discoveries public, since
a cardinal rule of espionage is to keep your discoveries to
yourself. And that, in a way, made the game all the more secretive
and manageable.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial companies don't play by those rules. What is new
is the prospect that any country's secrets will come unpredictably
under public display in ways that could embarrass governments, tip
their hands in war and debate, or show sensitive installations to
terrorists or just plain mischief-makers. Imagine if the FBI's and
KGB's eavesdropping gear suddenly fell into the hands of voyeurs,
and you get a hint of the queasiness now felt in high places.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, even after cameras started zooming, states could
exert some control over civil reconnaissance from space. In 1995,
India lofted a craft that took 5-meter images. It photographed the
world, but blocked photos of its own military bases. And in 1996,
after the Clinton administration approved the taking of one-meter
photos, American supporters of Israel won a law limiting the
sharpness of images of Israel to the best obtainable by any foreign
company. Today, that means two-meter sharpness, which a Russian
company sells.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the investigative use of space imagery has
been strongly encouraged by the Public Eye program of the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington
that promotes arms control and has bought satellite photos in a
systematic effort to fight military censors. In January, it
revealed a North Korean missile base, and in March a Pakistani
nuclear reactor and missile site.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest target is Area 51, and it played a big role in the
release of the new imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Public Eye ordered Area 51 photos from Space Imaging last winter
_ to no avail, leaving it wondering whether there had been what
experts call ``shutter control,'' a right that U.S. officials
assert to at times restrict U.S.-owned civil spy cameras, or
self-censorship by Space Imaging, which is owned mainly by Lockheed
Martin, a military contractor, and whose largest customer is the
Pentagon. The company denied there had been either.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam broke Monday when a rival American company, Aerial
Images, based in Raleigh, N.C., released Russian two-meter photos
of the secretive base.

<P>
   If the Elian Gonzalez case illustrates anything, other than the
peculiarly overheated state of Cuban-U.S. relations, it is that
courts run on adult time, with unhappy consequences for the
children they are trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a federal appellate court ruled that Elian
Gonzalez must remain in this country while his political asylum
request is aired, Attorney General Janet Reno said the boy had been
formally assigned to a ``kind of never-never land.''
</P>
<P>
   That is familiar territory for scores of American children whose
destinies remain uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as
their custody and child welfare cases wind through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Look at this particular Cuban 6-year-old boy. He has suffered
the trauma of losing his mother, who drowned while attempting to
flee Cuba last November by boat. He has been transplanted to a new
place and surrounded by new people, one of whom, Elian's cousin
Marisleysis, has reportedly become a surrogate mother. He is not
attending school, where children his age are learning critical
lessons in how to socialize with peers.
</P>
<P>
   And he has now been forcibly taken from his Miami relatives and
delivered to his father. A court must still rule on the issue of
political asylum _ if Elian can leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The latest court postponement of Elian's fate only underscored
what experts see as the tension between two notions of time. There
is the deliberate, adult pace of the law, in which a day or a week
or a month may not seem terribly significant. And then there is the
highly compressed time of child development, in which bonds can be
made, or poisoned, in the same span of time.
</P>
<P>
   There are rules of civil society, which demand that the courts
allow all the parties in a case to be heard. There is also the
child's sense of time, as psychiatrists are fond of saying, in
which waiting in uncertainty can leave a child feeling insecure and
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the judicial system handles custody and child welfare
cases would shock child developmental experts as being almost
designed to insure that children will be ill-served by the
process,'' said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at New York
University. ``Ordinarily, we are taught, `Don't rush through
decisions that are perceived to be at the expense of getting it
right.' Paradoxically, the failure to rush may ensure we can't get
it right. That's the rock and the hard place of law and custody
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling last Wednesday, the three-judge panel of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta did not render a verdict
on the issue of custody. But in stern language, the judges seemed
to scold the government for its handling of the boy's asylum
request. The Justice Department had asserted that only the boy's
father, and not his Miami relatives, was legally entitled to speak
or him, since a child could not comprehend the complexities of an
asylum claim. The judges, however, said that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service may not have properly considered ``the
child's separate and independent interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the record,'' they wrote, ``plaintiff, although a
young child, has expressed a wish that he not be returned to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   But to what extent can a 6-year-old's opinion be considered in a
legal matter? Should children his age have a say in custody
disputes, let alone matters of political asylum?
</P>
<P>
   In child custody cases in New York City, children, usually at
age 11 or 12, are asked where they would like to live, said Joseph
M. Lauria, the administrative judge of the city's Family Court. But
children are also told by the judge and their own law guardian _
the advocate appointed to represent the child in court _ that the
decision is not theirs to make.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gonzalez case, it may be therapeutic for the boy to
express his feelings, but his opinions should not be accorded the
same weight as, say, a 14-year-old's, said Dr. Albert Solnit,
professor emeritus of psychology at Yale and the outgoing mental
health commissioner of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of making
decisions that require an adult capacity, cognitively, emotionally
and socially,'' Solnit said. ``You would not expect a 6-year-old
child to be able to understand what is entailed in such a decision
_ how to trust his memory, how to deal with the severe trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Elian waits in the United States while the courts hear
his case. Waiting, in fact, is the hallmark of the process. In New
York City's Family Court, children and their caretakers may wait
all day to see a judge. At that point, if, say, one attorney has
been unable to reach another, the case is adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Lauria said it was common for a contested custody case to take
eight months to a year in Family Court. It can take up to a year
just to conclude whether a child had been abused or neglected, and
equally long to determine whether a drug-addicted parent is fit to
raise a child. There is increasing pressure on the city's Family
Court to speed up, but judges and lawyers concede that the very
character of American jurisprudence _ not to mention badly
overburdened courts _ makes it virtually impossible for cases to
move at a pace that suits a child's psychological need for swift
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal system has a sense of thoughtful due process in
which all avenues should be explored,'' said Donald J. Cohen, a
child psychiatrist and director of the Yale Child Study Center.
``This can go on for years, this process for looking for a perfect
solution, while children lives don't stand still. A child's
custodial situation is treated in some ways as battles between
stockholders in a company, where lawyers on both sides argue in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   One need not have a degree in psychology to realize that for a
child, especially a young one, being unable to answer the basic
question, ``Who will take care of me?'' can leave him feeling
frightened and helpless. Psychiatrists say these feelings may lead
to adolescent depression and delinquent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiting game for a child is a painful one,'' said Michael
G. Kalogerakis, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the New York
University School of Medicine. ``If we are counseling healthy
parents about healthy children and the issue of time is on the
table, we would always say, `Don't postpone. Don't delay. Don't
keep a kid hanging.' ''

</P>
<P>
   ROME-PILGRIMS (Rome) _ Only a handful of the estimated 500,000
Roman Catholics who flocked to Rome to celebrate Holy Week came on
foot. But beneath a shiny veneer of modern comfort and efficiency _
Internet-ready visitors' centers, air-conditioned Jubilee buses,
microchip-equipped pilgrim cards that automatically book church
services, tours and restaurants, chemical toilets and electric
votive candles _ the Holy Year 2000 is laced with the kind of
humble piety and awe that drew the first Jubilee pilgrims here in
1300. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   DUTCH-WORKER-SHORTAGE (Amsterdam, Netherlands) _ Recruiting the
elderly _ men and women who want to occupy their days, battle
loneliness or top up their pensions _ has become a Dutch growth
industry. While unemployment hovers around 10 percent in other
parts of Europe, the Dutch have the opposite problem: With only 2.7
percent jobless, the country is seriously short of workers. By
Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   ANDES-UNREST (Undated) _ Guerrillas and the cocaine trade batter
Colombia. A strongman rides roughshod over a discredited Congress
and courts in Venezuela. Ecuador reels from an economic crisis and
a coup. Bolivia has just emerged from a state of siege. And Peru
awaits an election between an autocrat accused of trying to steal
the presidency and a political firebrand. Suddenly it seems as if
all the Andes are in tumult. By Larry Rohter with Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA-WAR (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) _ There are few issues as
sensitive in Ethiopia and none as obvious: The nation is waging a
hugely expensive war, estimated to cost at least $500,000 a day in
salaries alone, while 8 million of its people struggle through the
worst food shortage here in nearly 20 years. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-LANGUAGE (Dili, East Timor) _ What will be the spoken
language of East Timor? It is a hotly emotional issue, one that
goes to the heart of the self-definition of the world's newest
nation. Will it be the language of the international marketplace,
English? Will it be the dominant local language, Tetun, with its
broad usage but limited vocabulary? Will it be the historical
colonial language, Portuguese, the sentimental favorite of the
older generation? Or will it be Indonesian, the common language of
the young and the educated? By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-POLICY-POLL (Undated) _ The more Americans know about
the world, the more likely they are to favor diplomacy over
punitive sanctions in dealing with troublesome foreign countries, a
poll has found. Embargoes, they say, not only isolate the nations
at which they are aimed but also hurt American business. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ENTREPRENEURS (Tokyo) _ Changes in the relationship
between employer and employee, the liberalization of the financial
markets and the explosion of new business models in the
freewheeling arenas of the Internet and information technology are
spawning a whole new breed of entrepreneurs who care little for the
conventions that have dominated Japan Inc. for decades. By
Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND-CORRUPTION (Dublin, Ireland) _ After nearly three years
of relatively fruitless investigations into property development
fraud, one of Ireland's longstanding tribunals broke new ground
last week when a lobbyist admitted paying local politicians the
equivalent of $136,000 to win approval for a supermarket
development. The admission by Frank Dunlop, a lobbyist and former
press officer with the Irish government, is likely to cast a
harsher spotlight on the corruption of Ireland's politics. By Brian

of their stocks hit record or near-record lows, then spike back
upward, it is hard to find any Internet executive who does not
profess a belief that the market will, and should, shake loose some
dot-com losers in the months ahead. But so far, such a prospect
hardly seems to have sapped the air of confidence that still
pervades many companies here. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

   NUCLEAR-MOUNTAIN (Amargosa Valley, Nev.) _ To the Western
Shoshone Indians, Yucca Mountain, slated to become the home for all
eternity to 77,000 tons of highly lethal nuclear waste from across

 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rancorous national debate over gun control, both sides
assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped the
modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it.
</P>
<P>
   This heritage is widely assumed but rarely examined, even in
history books. ``The prevalence of firearms and the high value
placed on the quick draw made a sure shot the test of manliness,''
wrote Daniel J. Boorstin in ``The Americans: The Democratic
Experience.'' ``From earliest colonial times, the needs of the
wilderness and the threat of Indians had put firearms in the
American household. The right to bear arms had been hallowed in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book due this fall, another historian challenges
what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun ownership in the
frontier era was far from universal. In ``Arming America: The
Origins of a National Gun Culture'' (Knopf), Michael A. Bellesiles
(pronounced buh-LEEL) contends that only a relative few private
citizens actually owned firearms between 1765 and 1850. Fewer still
owned guns that worked, he says, and only an elite, typically
professional hunters and sportsmen, could reliably aim and fire a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no more than 10 percent of the total American population
owned guns at any time before 1850, according to a variety of
records cited by Bellesiles, an associate professor of history at
Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a federal report in 1803 found that fewer than a
quarter of white adult males owned guns. This census of militias _
emergency forces composed of citizens rather than professional
soldiers _ covered all 17 states and three territories. It
suggested that there were enough firearms for one in 20 Americans.
(By contrast, most estimates today, including the FBI's, suggest
that there are enough firearms for the entire population.)
</P>
<P>
   Average Americans in the pre-Civil War period considered guns,
especially rifles, an expensive luxury that cost a month's wages or
more. Members of Congress, in a lament that would last from the
Revolutionary War to the 1850s, continually deplored citizen
militias' indifference to acquiring, maintaining and using
firearms. What armed America, Bellesiles argues, was the Civil War
of 1861-65, the bloodiest conflict of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles' research fills a vacuum, according to William
Hosley, a former curator of the Samuel Colt gun collection in
Hartford, Conn., and the author of ``Colt: The Making of an
American Legend'' (University of Massachusetts, 1996). The problem
with scholarship on gun ownership, Hosley said, is that ``there is
very little of it, and I've been looking for it for the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more known about silver teapots than there is about
guns,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bellesiles declined to speculate how his
findings affect the current debate over gun control. But Joshua
Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, which favors gun control, says Bellesiles' book may
change the terms of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it at face value that rifles and handguns were
omnipresent from colonial times onwards,'' he said. ``But if
America's gun culture is a recent development, then gun deaths
today, as the NRA argues, are not the price we pay for our heritage
_ because there is no such heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles has his critics. The National Rifle Association, the
strongest opponent of gun control, declined to comment on the book
but has criticized an earlier academic article on which his new
book is based as an attack on the right to bear arms.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rancorous national debate over gun control, both sides
assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped the
modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it.
</P>
<P>
   This heritage is widely assumed but rarely examined, even in
history books. ``The prevalence of firearms and the high value
placed on the quick draw made a sure shot the test of manliness,''
wrote Daniel J. Boorstin in ``The Americans: The Democratic
Experience.'' ``From earliest colonial times, the needs of the
wilderness and the threat of Indians had put firearms in the
American household. The right to bear arms had been hallowed in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book due this fall, another historian challenges
what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun ownership in the
frontier era was far from universal. In ``Arming America: The
Origins of a National Gun Culture'' (Knopf), Michael A. Bellesiles
(pronounced buh-LEEL) contends that only a relative few private
citizens actually owned firearms between 1765 and 1850. Fewer still
owned guns that worked, he says, and only an elite, typically
professional hunters and sportsmen, could reliably aim and fire a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no more than 10 percent of the total American population
owned guns at any time before 1850, according to a variety of
records cited by Bellesiles, an associate professor of history at
Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a federal report in 1803 found that fewer than a
quarter of white adult males owned guns. This census of militias _
emergency forces composed of citizens rather than professional
soldiers _ covered all 17 states and three territories. It
suggested that there were enough firearms for one in 20 Americans.
(By contrast, most estimates today, including the FBI's, suggest
that there are enough firearms for the entire population.)
</P>
<P>
   Average Americans in the pre-Civil War period considered guns,
especially rifles, an expensive luxury that cost a month's wages or
more. Members of Congress, in a lament that would last from the
Revolutionary War to the 1850s, continually deplored citizen
militias' indifference to acquiring, maintaining and using
firearms. What armed America, Bellesiles argues, was the Civil War
of 1861-65, the bloodiest conflict of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles' research fills a vacuum, according to William
Hosley, a former curator of the Samuel Colt gun collection in
Hartford, Conn., and the author of ``Colt: The Making of an
American Legend'' (University of Massachusetts, 1996). The problem
with scholarship on gun ownership, Hosley said, is that ``there is
very little of it, and I've been looking for it for the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more known about silver teapots than there is about
guns,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bellesiles declined to speculate how his
findings affect the current debate over gun control. But Joshua
Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center in
Washington, which favors gun control, says Bellesiles' book may
change the terms of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it at face value that rifles and handguns were
omnipresent from colonial times onwards,'' he said. ``But if
America's gun culture is a recent development, then gun deaths
today, as the NRA argues, are not the price we pay for our heritage
_ because there is no such heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles has his critics. The National Rifle Association, the
strongest opponent of gun control, declined to comment on the book
but has criticized an earlier academic article on which his new
book is based as an attack on the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kottrol, a professor of law and history at George
Washington University who sympathizes with the NRA, asks, ``How
would the westward expansion of the United States, into Indian
territory, have been possible if the population was lightly
armed?''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bellesiles' research doesn't square with other
contemporary narratives, such as travelers' diaries, newspaper
accounts and autobiographies, critics say. Clayton Cramer, a writer
who sympathizes with the NRA, said numerous 19th century accounts
mention an American gun culture.
</P>
<P>
   He cites, for example, Philip Gosse, an English naturalist
traveling in Alabama in the 1830s, who wrote, ``The long rifle is
familiar to every hand; skill in the use of it is the highest
accomplishment which a southern gentleman glories in; even the
children acquire an astonishing expertness in handling this deadly
weapon at a very early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University
in Tallahassee and the author of ``The Great American Gun Debate''
(Pacific Research Institute, 1997), said Bellesiles had
overinterpreted his evidence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, he could say at least 10 percent of the population
had guns but we have no real way of knowing how much higher that
could go,'' Kleck said, mainly because pre-Civil War record keeping
was so poor. Even in 1968, when recordkeeping of all kinds had
presumably improved, a federal commission had difficulty measuring
gun production because records were scant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kleck said, fathers in frontier America who handed
down their guns to their sons would do so when their children were
young. ``Gun use occurred in adolescence or young manhood so men
would not wait until they were near death to hand on their guns,''
he said. Probate records, Bellesiles' principal evidence, ``would
not reflect that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellesiles did not set out to dismantle an American myth but
fell on the subject by chance. He based many of his conclusions on
a 10-year study of more than 11,000 probate records. Unlike
published wills, which sometimes reflected imagined notions of a
property holder's estate, probate records were inventories of
actual property after a death, from land to broken cups, used to
settle debts in what was known as ``the final reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing thousands of such records while researching a
paper on frontier law in 18th-century America, Bellesiles said he
had an epiphany in a Vermont courthouse in 1989. ``Where,'' he
asked himself, ``were the guns?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kleck's criticism, Bellesiles said, the probate records
he examined appear to record every bequest and gift of value,
including those made during the life of the deceased. These gifts
were subtracted from an heir's portion of the estate, unless there
was a specific instruction to the contrary. ``I am curious to see
Kleck's historical analysis in detail,'' Bellesiles said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellesiles' argument does not rest solely on probate
records. The rifles and muskets of the period rusted quickly and so
required careful maintenance, he said. In a typical report to
Congress, the secretary of war complained in 1838 that ``when
mustered, a majority of (the militia) are armed with walking canes,
fowling pieces, or unserviceable muskets.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, scattered records of gunsmiths seem to indicate little
demand for their wares, Bellesiles said. For example, the family
business of Eltweed Pomeroy of Windsor, Conn., the first known
gunsmith in Colonial America, produced no more than two dozen guns
a year between 1630 and 1849, he said. Other gunsmiths of the time
_ like Hugh Orr of Bridgewater, Mass., and William Henry of
Lancaster, Pa. _ stayed in business by branching out into other
kinds of ironworks like axes and scythes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bellesiles said, ``As a historian, I would be the
last one to say that mine was the final word.''

   Have you checked out the Rome MP3 player with the form factor of
an audiotape that you can play in the tape deck of your car? No?
</P>
<P>
   When are you upgrading to the Palm VII?
</P>
<P>
   Did you know the new Nokia can also be used as a lipstick
mirror?
</P>
<P>
   Wait, you haven't customized your cell phone ring yet? You can't
be serious.
</P>
<P>
   Geekspeak and gadget fetishism used to be limited to geeks and
gadget fetishists. Not anymore. In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. For so-called knowledge workers, cell phones
are required and it helps to flaunt a personal digital assistant _
preferably in the same unit.
</P>
<P>
   To the less obsessed, it's beginning to get tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all they talk about,'' said Joia Speciale, an independent
filmmaker, about several of her male friends. ``They get into that
whole boy toys thing about comparing. I just think there are so
many things they could be doing better with their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speciale, who owns a cell phone and a Palm 3E, says she does
benefit, however. ``In a way it's good because when I want
something I don't have to do all the shopping,'' she said. ``They
just tell me what to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is futile, and surrender can seem kind of nice.
</P>
<P>
   Take Arthur Molella, who pulled out his new Palm 5X while
waiting in line at an airport the other day and immediately
received the knowing look of a tribal brother from a British
passenger in front of him wielding a Palm VII. Soon they were
happily chatting about how often they back up files and the
benefits of CD-ROM burners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the closest I've ever come to having a magic wand,''
said Molella, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's Center
for the Study of Invention and Innovation, who added that he had
resisted buying an electronic organizer like the Palm Pilot until
recently. ``You have a sense when you hold one of these devices
that you're grasping some distillation of human knowledge that
represents centuries of evolution _ and here it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the companion of the British passenger, Molella noticed,
was not so enthusiastic. In fact she looked like she was feeling
left out and a bit annoyed. It's a look gadget-wielders might see
more often if they weren't caught in an electronic trance.
</P>
<P>
   As digital devices become more pervasive and more personal, the
etiquette of how and when to use them _ or to babble endlessly
about their features _ is still evolving.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, is it OK to talk into the air, as crowds of
people seem to be doing when they talk into the newly popular
headsets for cellular phones?
</P>
<P>
   ``People freak out,'' said Seth Goldstein, who spearheads
investments in mobile digital devices for FlatIron Partners, a
venture capital firm. ``But it depends on the context. Doing your
e-mail just because you can whether you're in a conference room or
at a dinner doesn't mean it's appropriate. But if two people take
out their Pilots and are beaming information to each other at a
dinner, that's more acceptable to me because it's social.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Goldstein can sneak a peek at the e-mail messages
bleeping in on his wireless pager during dinner with his wife,
``There are unwritten rules,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Early adopters, as the consumer electronics industry refers to
people who are willing to pay far more than a given electronic
device will eventually cost in order to have it first, have always
been a bit obnoxious. From the first proud few to replace slide
rules with calculators to CB radio hobbyists to the audiophiles who
paid thousands of dollars for the first CD players, gadget freaks
have often seemed to exist in a jargon-filled matrix of their own,
oblivious to the mundane demands of civil society.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of belonging to an elite group who see things more
clearly with the aid of electronic circuits hasn't changed. But the
size of the group has, and so has the size of the gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4 million personal organizers like the Palm Pilot were
sold in 1999, according to IDC, a research and consulting firm,
with sales expected to climb to 6.3 million this year. Dozens of
companies have announced plans to flood the world with ``hand-held
devices'' including various mutations of cell phones, MP3 music
players, digital cameras, e-mail pagers, Web browsers and
geopositioning systems. Last week, Microsoft unveiled the newest
version of its Windows CE software in an attempt to dislodge the
Palm Pilot as the leading hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   Today's technology aficionados are not the boys with the thick
lenses _ they wear Armani frames. And their devices aren't at home
in the garage or the rec room _ they are with them at all times,
clipped, dangling or tucked away on their bodies. For those who
don't care whether your hard drive is bigger than theirs, that
means the relentless tech talk is hard to escape. It's there in
restaurants, on trains, on the street, although the people using it
often seem not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this new personal technology telling
you that the real world doesn't count and what's important is this
magic that I have in my pocket and my fingertip command,'' said
Thomas Hine, a historian of popular culture who was recently forced
to listen to a fellow train passenger warn eight people by cell
phone that he would be an hour late. ``So, you peons, you don't
matter, you're bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the technology that enables users to so easily slip out
of touch with their physical surroundings also serves as a bridge
between strangers _ and family. When emotions run high, or
conversation is strained, ``feeds and speeds'' are a good fallback.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse it doesn't have any politics or anything
that could remotely turn anyone off,'' said Bob Parks, who edits
the ``Fetish'' section of Wired magazine. ``When I go home to talk
to my dad we have kind of a stilted dialogue sometimes, but
whenever the conversation turns to gadgets we can talk for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It works particularly well while on the road, Parks added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sitting next to someone who would never talk to you
and whip out a digital camera and say `I have a two-million pixel
Cannon and instead of the Type 2 flashcard I dropped in an IBM
Microdrive and the great thing about it is it's got USB,' and the
person will say, `Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. And perhaps geekspeak as small talk will eventually run
its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a newbie phenomenon,'' said Paul Saffo, director of
the Institute for the Future. ``If you're really cool you don't
show your stuff off. Me, I'd never be flashing gizmos in polite
society.''

phone that he would be an hour late. ``So, you peons, you don't
matter, you're bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the technology that enables users to so easily slip out
of touch with their physical surroundings also serves as a bridge
between strangers _ and family. When emotions run high, or
conversation is strained, ``feeds and speeds'' are a good fallback.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse it doesn't have any politics or anything
that could remotely turn anyone off,'' said Bob Parks, who edits
the ``Fetish'' section of Wired magazine. ``When I go home to talk
to my dad we have kind of a stilted dialogue sometimes, but
whenever the conversation turns to gadgets we can talk for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It works particularly well while on the road, Parks added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sitting next to someone who would never talk to you
and whip out a digital camera and say `I have a two-million pixel
Cannon and instead of the Type 2 flashcard I dropped in an IBM
Microdrive and the great thing about it is it's got USB,' and the
person will say, `Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. And perhaps geekspeak as small talk will eventually run
its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a newbie phenomenon,'' said Paul Saffo, director of
the Institute for the Future. ``If you're really cool you don't
show your stuff off. Me, I'd never be flashing gizmos in polite
society.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 23, moved Friday and Saturday.

</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SNOBS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. Cell phones are required for professionals
from a certain class background, and it helps to flaunt a personal
digital assistant _ preferably one with data-beaming capabilities.
``Early adopters'' have always been a bit obnoxious. From the first
proud few to replace slide rules with calculators to CB radio
hobbyists to the audiophiles who paid thousands of dollars for the
first CD players, gadget freaks have often seemed to exist in a
jargon-filled matrix of their own, oblivious to the mundanities of
civil society. By Amy Harmon. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-PERKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have new
expectations from their health care system. They want the latest in
medical technology, just as they hunger for the latest sports
utility vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they also seek
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also want medicine to improve their looks, often in an environment
where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can all be done
under one roof. And the health care industry is responding to
consumer demand. It is offering more aesthetic procedures and
complementary services. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Elian Gonzalez case illustrates
that courts run on adult time while children suffer the
consequences. For many American children, their destinies remain
uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as their custody and
child welfare cases wind through the courts. Experts see tension
between two competing notions of time: the deliberate, adult pace
of the law, in which a day, or a week or a month may be seen as not
significant, and the the highly compressed time of child
development, in which bonds can be made, or poisoned, in the same
space of time. By Somni Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Both sides in the gun control
debate assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped
the modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it. But in a new book due this fall, a historian
challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun
ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   PIPEDREAM.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this time of dizzying
volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed
quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, whose (imaginary)
initial public offering in January zoomed from an initial price of
$2 a share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its
founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Proctor, 17, the
youngest dot-com billionaire on record. During the recent sell-off
in technology stocks, however, PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4. An
interview with Proctor. By Gary Krist.
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nations were once able to
hide their armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy
civilians, while militaries could pry into most corners of the
globe from spy satellites, secure in the knowledge that they could
control who got to take a peek. No more. Taking pictures from space
is undergoing a revolution, and it is making some governments feel
naked. Private companies are launching increasingly sophisticated
reconnaissance satellites, and governments are finding it harder to
restrict what snapshots they distribute to anyone willing to pay
the price. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-PHOTO-REVIEW (Undated) _ It became the most remembered
photograph of the fall of Saigon, and most people believed that it
showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the U.S.
embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption
usually says. But as with much about the Vietnam War, the caption
is wrong. The building is a nearby apartment complex. The people
fleeing are Vietnamese. The last flight out of Saigon was hours
away. In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-POLITICS (Washington) _ Iran is in the midst of a brutal,
open-ended political war being waged on several fronts - the
courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the
bazaar, the streets. The current round of fighting heated up after
reformists candidates swept to victory in the first round of
parliamentary elections in February. And the stakes are high -
nothing less than the nature of the Islamic Republic itself. By
Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-THIRDWORLD-REVIEW (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ The changes
created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well
known, affecting everything from the way people date to the way
they work. But less is known about impact on communities with
limited contact with the rest of the world. As examples of such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: The way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the
outside world is likely to be altered forever. By Simon Romero.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW (London) A correspondent describes the
contrasts he observed after leaving the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland, and then heading to Africa: rubbing shoulders with
dot-com billionaires, oil industry barons and sleek investment
bankers, in an Alpine village set among among the pristine snow
fields, and then, on the Angola-Zambia border, mingling with the
poorest of the poor, where the meaning of the word economy had been
distilled to the barefoot essentials of survival. By Alan Cowell.

COMMENTARY: HOW TO BE A HACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, the outrage! The Web site maintained by Mobilization for
Global Justice, the umbrella organization for last week's
Washington protests, gave precisely one example of the economic
evil the World Bank does.
</P>
<P>
   I looked into that story, and found that it doesn't quite have
the claimed moral. Actually, the bank _ not always a lovable
organization, to say the least _ in this particular case comes out
smelling like a rose. But clearly, to say this in last Wednesday's
column was terribly unfair. If a story confirms what the protesters
believe, it is a telling example; but if it doesn't, explaining the
truth of the case is a cheap shot.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, as a number of readers have informed me, everyone
knows that I am a hired tool of global capitalism. This charge
upset me greatly. In fact, I asked my masters for a raise, to 35
pieces of silver, to compensate for my hurt feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe this is a good occasion to talk about political bias
in economic analysis. It is a real issue. But the corruption is
more subtle _ and also more evenly spread across the political
spectrum _ than my hate mailers seem to realize.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, academic research in economics is by and large
carried out without strong political bias. I'm not saying that what
you read in the journals is always right (don't get me started), or
that the researchers themselves are noble characters: Successful
economists, like successful academics in any field, are usually
ambitious men and women with large egos. But the structure of
rewards in a field in which top departments are constantly jostling
for prestige favors cleverness and originality, not political
correctness of any stripe.
</P>
<P>
   While hired guns do not flourish at Harvard or the University of
Chicago, in Washington they roam in packs.
</P>
<P>
   Portrait of a hired gun: He or she is usually a mediocre
economist _ someone whose work, if it didn't have an ideological
edge, might have been published but wouldn't have had many readers.
He has, however, found a receptive audience for work that does have
an ideological edge. In particular, he has learned that pretty good
jobs in think tanks, or on the staffs of magazines with a distinct
political agenda, are available for people who know enough
economics to produce plausible-sounding arguments on behalf of the
party line. Ask him whether he is a political hack and he will deny
it; he probably does not admit it to himself _ but somehow
everything he says or writes serves the interests of his backers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these hired guns work on behalf of right-wing causes:
it's a funny thing, but organizations that promote the interests of
rich people seem to be better financed than those that don't.
Still, the left  &QC; has enough resources to front a quorum of its own
hacks. And anyway, love of money is only the root of some evil.
Love of the limelight, love of the feeling of being part of a
Movement, even love of the idea of oneself as a bold rebel against
the Evil Empire can be equally corrupting of one's intellectual
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell the hacks from the serious analysts? One answer
is to do a little homework. Hack jobs often involve surprisingly
raw, transparent misrepresentations of fact: in these days of
search engines and online databases you don't need a staff of
research assistants to catch 'em with their hands in the cookie
jar. But there is another telltale clue: if a person, or especially
an organization, always sings the same tune, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Real experts, you see, tend to have views that are not entirely
one-sided. For example, Columbia's Jagdish Bhagwati, a staunch
free-trader, is also very critical of unrestricted flows of
short-term capital. Right or not, this mixed stance reflects an
honest mind at work. You might think that hacks would at least try
to simulate an open mind _ that simply for the sake of appearances
the Heritage Foundation would try to find some tax it supports, or
the Economic Policy Institute find some trade liberalization it
favors. But it almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, honest men can disagree, and they can also make
mistakes. But it's still a good idea to tune out supposed experts
whose minds are made up in advance. Or at least that's what they
told me to say.

COMMENTARY: SPITE OR ART? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We anticipated a New York Senate race perfumed with
romantic vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Suffering political wife, estranged from Self-Centered
husband, sashays to center stage and crows: ``Check this out, babe!
I rule now.''
</P>
<P>
   But who knew that our spunky heroine would be Donna Hanover?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's wife has announced she will do a star turn
off-Broadway in ``The Vagina Monologues,'' a feminist meditation
featuring just the kind of graphic sexuality that Rudy Giuliani has
been trying to stamp out for years.
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine how all the mayor's conservative,
small-town donors from out of state _ the folks he has been
inflaming with letters about the fem-lib elitist Hillary supporting
``so-called `art' that seems deliberately calculated to offend
religious people'' and ``disgusting...pornography'' _ will react to
the news of the Missus' racy new job: ``Hey, Martha, get a load of
this...''
</P>
<P>
   Given Rudy's crusades against the Brooklyn Museum's
``Sensation'' exhibition and X-rated businesses, Donna's decision
to appear in a sexually provocative play certainly looks like a
thumb in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The play is based on interviews with women, from 6 to 75,
exploring their feelings about their most intimate anatomy. The
playwright poses fanciful questions, like ``If your vagina could
talk, what would it say, in two words?'' and ``If your vagina got
dressed, what would it wear? Leather jacket ...tutu...tattoo?'' The
play also looks at painful issues like mass rape and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   For Hanover, 50, who has had small parts in ``The People vs.
Larry Flynt,'' a sympathetic movie about the pornographer, and soap
operas (she also has a show on the Food Network), this was a chance
for a plum role. The play has attracted a raft of celebrities,
including Whoopi Goldberg reading a lament called ``My Angry
Vagina,'' and Calista Flockhart and Winona Ryder performing a
segment on rape in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Eve Ensler, the author and sometime star of ``The Vagina
Monologues,'' is a friend of Hillary Clinton's, and was an honorary
member of her Senate exploratory committee. Yet Hillary has not
dared to attend ``The Vagina Monologues'' in New York for fear Rudy
would crucify her. Now that his wife is going to star, those
associated with the play hope that Mrs. Clinton will catch the show
_ without any comment from the Gracie Mansion peanut gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on New York 1 last October, Ensler radiated
antipathy to the mayor, accusing him of ``racism'' and
``polarization.'' ``What Giuliani has been doing to the city in
terms of shutting us down, shutting it down and cleaning it up,
wiping out the diversity, and wiping out what is powerful and
unusual about New York has been a real crime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover may not have known how close Ensler was to Mrs. Clinton
when she agreed to do the part, but she certainly knew the
playwright's mindset.
</P>
<P>
   The Giulianis' marital deal is as mysterious as the Clintons'.
Hanover no longer goes to most public events or appears in her
husband's campaign ads. She dropped her married name a few years
ago, and he stopped wearing his wedding ring a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thought it would be Mrs. Clinton who would spice up
this Senate race with a delicious serving of connubial payback. But
she is running as an extension of her husband rather than a
repudiation.
</P>
<P>
   She seems more dependent on Bill Clinton than ever. She relies
on his political advice. She has tapped his bank of campaign
contributors and advisers. She has welcomed his help defending her
against what he calls ``the right-wing venom machine'' allied with
Rudy Giuliani. She has vowed ``to spend the rest of my life with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Machiavellian types suspect Donna's theatrical surprise is
all part of Hillary's plan _ working brilliantly so far _ to
gaslight Rudy by getting under the control freak's skin and making
him feel as if he has Lost Control of the Agenda. Did the first
lady's friends help her out by offering the wife of the
sanctimonious mayor the role of a lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   Poor Rudy. He is getting squeezed between two women starring in
paeans to female empowerment _ one on the stage and the other on
the stump.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to drive a mayor crazy?

L.A. COUNTY BOARD MAY FACE CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - With support from conservative forces, a powerful
Eastside Democratic legislator has shaken that impregnable bastion
of Los Angeles County government, the Board of Supervisors, with
the threat of imposing term limits on supervisors and slashing
their personal budgets as part of board expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Richard Polanco's proposal to put the
issue on the November ballot by legislative action and without the
support of the supervisors triggered a mad scramble at the county
Hall of Administration, where supervisors once elected are
virtually guaranteed lifetime positions.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco _ widely expected to seek a City Council seat next year
_ on Friday added 12-year term limits to his bill expanding the
board from five to nine members and holding the board's $15.3
million-a-year budget for staff and expenses, effectively cutting
nearly in half the $3 million a year each supervisor now gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot increase the size of government without increasing
the costs,'' Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich fumed. ``It's like
cotton candy. It's all fluff with no substance.
</P>
<P>
   He said Polanco's bill is an attempt ``to get a job for himself
by expanding government in Los Angeles County. ... He's
term-limited and this is his one opportunity to keep his political
life alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Polanco plan got a warm reception from political leaders
in outlying areas that often feel underserved by the supervisors,
who each represent some 2 million constituents, a number that would
be cut nearly in half by expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And taxpayer watchdogs also looked favorably at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association, said the association may not object to an expanded
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is each of the supervisors represents
an inordinately high number of constituents,'' Coupal said. ``If
this proposal would enhance constituent services without costing
taxpayers more money, we may not object. I think term limits would
be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Board of Supervisors, which has resisted term limits and
cuts in its budgets, the Polanco expansion could be the most
serious threat yet to its power as it comes from a powerful and
ambitious state senator and answers the key concerns of voters, who
have rejected board expansion three times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the supervisors lined up in opposition to the measure
while their staffs grappled with the prospect of many of their jobs
being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mabie, a spokesman for Polanco, said the senator believes
the November election is the right time to put the measure on the
ballot because the supervisors' districts will be redrawn after the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would divvy up the pie into nine pieces,'' he said. ``You
wouldn't have an increase in bureaucratic costs. The term limits
amendment would increase its likelihood of passing at the statewide
level.''
</P>
<P>
   County officials said they are skeptical that expansion can be
achieved without increasing costs. Four additional offices would
require an expensive office renovation, they said, and reducing
staffs would hamper the ability to monitor county departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supervisor Knabe believes the measure doesn't put more deputy
sheriffs on the street, reduce caseloads for probation officers or
improve services to children,'' said John Wallace, a spokesman for
Supervisor Don Knabe. ``All it does is expand government.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Supervisors Gloria Molina and Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke said those two supervisors have supported board
expansion. But neither could be reached Friday for an opinion on
the term limits amendment. Supervisor Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ballot measure say it would give the San
Fernando Valley two seats, create opportunities for greater
minority representation and make board members more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   The total proposed 2000-2001 budget of the Board of Supervisors,
personal staffs and the Executive Office is $34.6 million. The
salaries of the highest paid of the supervisors' 130-plus workers _
their chiefs of staff _ range from $101,798 to $120,711 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not exactly chopped-liver salaries,'' said Fernando
Oaxaca, chair of the Latino Republican Coalition and a proponent of
board expansion. ``Some of their senior staff members make more
than state senators and Assembly people.''
</P>
<P>
   Oaxaca said the supervisors could cut their budgets by reducing
travel costs and cutting back on their use of county automobiles,
helicopters and field offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field offices are a self-perpetuating process. They have
field offices that help them market themselves in terms of
re-election. If they have less money to spend, they will have to
cut back there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Close, an attorney and president of the Sherman Oaks
Homeowners Association, and chairman of Valley Voters Organized
Toward Empowerment, said he believes expanding the Board of
Supervisors would make the supervisors less responsive to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the professionally paid lobbyists will be able to afford
to spend time lobbying nine supervisors vs. the current five,''
Close said. ``It would make our job more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Board of Supervisors is doing a good job and this
measure is not being promoted for good government. It's being
promoted so some term-limited politicians can find jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Clayton, director of equal employment opportunity for the
Los Angeles County Chicano Employees Association, challenged his
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be better service to the community, more
opportunities for people to run for office, because the districts
will be 44 percent smaller, and we will overcome the current
situation where there is not one supervisor who lives in the San
Fernando, Antelope or San Gabriel valleys,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, who is co-authoring the
bill, said the measure would provide more representation to the
cities in the San Fernando, Antelope and San Gabriel valleys
because those cities would make up a larger percentage of their
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would allow them to have greater clout and lobbying
ability when it came to their interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mabie said Polanco had hoped the county supervisors would have
decided earlier this year to put the measure on the county's ballot
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors voted last August to direct the county counsel
to write language for the ballot to head off an attempt by state
legislators to place the issue on a statewide ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But the supervisors haven't taken any action on the draft since
it was released last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer them to handle this locally,'' Mabie said. ``But the
ball is in their court.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Diaz, chair of the Los Angeles City County Latino
Redistricting Coalition, said the supervisors have made attempts to
stall the measure because it threatens their power.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been called the five kings,'' he said. ``Now they are
three kings and two queens. You have to imagine the power they
have. The county population is larger than 42 other states. And
each supervisor's district is three times larger than a
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about real power. With term limits, they could
lose power in 12 years.''

NEW TESTIMONY GIVES PUSH TO IRISH CORRUPTION INQUIRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN LAVERY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ After nearly three years of relatively
fruitless investigations into property development fraud, one of
Ireland's longstanding tribunals broke new ground last week when a
lobbyist admitted paying local politicians the equivalent of
$136,000 to win approval for a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by Frank Dunlop, a lobbyist and former press
officer with the Irish government, is likely to cast a harsher
spotlight on political corruption in Ireland before the country
became known as the ``Celtic tiger'' for its roaring economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, investigations into the corruption of the 1980s and
early 1990s have moved slowly. But on Tuesday, Dunlop sat in a
Dublin courtroom and wrote out a list of 15 county council members
to whom he said he had paid a total of $136,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dunlop said, he was employed by Owen O'Callaghan, a
property developer who sought a rezoning decision in 1991. The
shopping mall developed by O'Callaghan opened in west Dublin in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dunlop testified, the developer has refrained from any
public comment. O'Callaghan is to testify before the tribunal at an
unspecified later date.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlop said he handed plastic bags holding as much as $48,000 to
county council members at their homes, in their offices and even in
the bar at Ireland's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the rights of future witnesses, Justice Feargus M.
Flood sealed the handwritten list in an envelope and locked it in
his safe. But it is likely that the names will become public at
some point after the tribunal resumes its work on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 42 members of Dublin's county council in 1991, three who
voted for the rezoning decision now sit in Parliament and three
others who voted for it still hold county council seats. It is not
clear whether any of those six are among the 15 who Dunlop says
took payments.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1997 by the Irish government to investigate
rumored corruption involving zoning and property developments, the
tribunal before which Dunlop appeared has uncovered numerous
illegal payments to politicians in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption had been widely rumored. Local reporters write
now that they knew of reports of bribery at the time, but kept
silent because of harsh libel laws, which Irish journalists are now
campaigning to change.
</P>
<P>
   However, long strings of denials and counteraccusations obscure
the dates and amounts of money changing hands. During the three
years of courtroom questioning by the tribunal, one witness has
died, and another witness' legal team has been replaced twice.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlop was the first whistle-blower to testify before any of
Ireland's recent current corruption tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's two largest political parties were quick to distance
themselves from his revelations, announcing harsh penalties for any
party members taking bribes. A cross-party initiative to restrict
how businesses can support politicians has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dunlop testified that John Bruton, leader of the
opposition party Fine Gael, knew that a party member had asked the
lobbyist for $303,000 to secure a vote in favor of the shopping
center. Bruton vehemently denies this, but is likely to be called
to testify in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal investigators succeeded in bringing Dunlop before the
court by tracing money to an illegal bank account he held in
Dublin. Dunlop has said that the account, registered in the name of
a fictitious offshore company with nonexistent directors, was used
to hold bribe money from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The bribes were made under the guise of campaign support for an
upcoming election, but even the most common payments of $2,400 were
considerably more than necessary for a county council campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a tribunal investigating the affairs of Charles J.
Haughey, the 74-year-old former prime minister, uncovered details
of widespread financial mismanagement in the late 1980s. While in
office, Haughey spent $19,000 of government money on monogrammed
French shirts, and cannot account for approximately $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations turned many Irish against their once-popular
prime minister. At the October funeral of his predecessor, Jack
Lynch, Haughey was booed and taunted. Earlier this month, Haughey
agreed to pay $1.21 million in back taxes on undeclared gifts from
a supermarket mogul.
</P>
<P>
   The current prime minister, Bertie Ahern, may also come under
criticism. The tribunal investigating Haughey has revealed that
Ahern made it routine practice to sign blank checks for government
accounts when he was responsible for finances as a minister in
Haughey's cabinet.

<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ There are few issues as sensitive in
Ethiopia but none as obvious: The nation is waging a hugely
expensive war, estimated to cost at least $500,000 a day in
salaries alone, while 8 million of its people struggle through the
worst food shortage here in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   No one is charging that the war against neighboring Eritrea is
causing the famine. The prime culprit is three years of poor rains
in a nation that cannot feed itself in the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question, experts say, that war has diverted
attention and resources, complicating the solutions and providing a
point of soreness that has distracted both Ethiopian officials and
rich outside nations that would help alleviate the hunger.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompts difficult questions: What are the obligations of
outside nations to help, if Ethiopia is spending its own money
fighting Eritrea? Do outside nations actually keep the conflict
going, by agreeing to feed the hungry as Ethiopia continues to
fight? Or is any link between food and politics merely
self-righteousness from rich outsiders, when Ethiopia has made at
least an effort to feed its people and has worked hard to prevent
famine in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the West has put these questions on hold,
deciding on unconditional help to head off what could become the
worst famine here since hundreds of thousands died in Ethiopia in
the mid-1980s. In the last two months, at least 200 people have
died of hunger in the arid southeast of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a general consensus that humanitarian assistance should
not be affected by conflicts,'' said Karl Harbo, the European
Union's delegate to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Another Western diplomat said: ``We have problems with the
Ethio-Eritrean issue. But that's not going to affect our helping
hungry people.''
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders _ and some of those affected by the drought _
the issue is simple: Any nation with so many hungry people cannot
afford to fight. ``They should not be spending so much money on the
war when people are hungry,'' said Abdi Rahman, an unemployed man
in the southeastern town of Gode, where the food shortages have
been the worst.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, some say, they cannot afford to fight a war like
this one. The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea _ quiet now but
fought in fierce bursts since May 1998 _ can be summed up in two
ways: a large number of dead over relatively small outright stakes.
Experts estimate that a minimum of 20,000 soldiers have been
killed, and perhaps double that number or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest war on the planet, bar none,'' said one
Western diplomat in the capital, Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   The overt reason for the war is a strip of land with no
particular value along the border of the two nations, which split
amicably in 1991 after rebels from both Ethiopia and what was then
the Eritrean region of Ethiopia defeated the regime of Mengistu
Haile Mariam. Both sides claim the region as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the border dispute is a boiling pot of unsettled issues,
including personality clashes between the leaders of the two
nations, economic tensions and the fact that many in Ethiopia never
wanted Eritrea on its own (partly because Ethiopia is landlocked
without it, a difficulty now as aid groups contemplate how to get
food in).
</P>
<P>
   To the prime minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, considered one
of the brightest leaders in Africa, the war is completely separate
from the drought.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly said that Eritrea invaded Ethiopian territory
and contends that this war is an issue of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view of Ethiopians is that you do not wait until you have
a full tummy to protect your sovereignty,'' he told reporters in
Addis Ababa this month. ``We do not believe that sovereignty is a
luxury for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's defenders point out that Ethiopia has made great
strides in recent years to reform agriculture, increasing harvests
substantially. It has also put in place an early warning system
against famine and established an emergency food reserve which had
reached more than 315,000 tons of grain last year. Since then, as
Meles notes, the reserve has dwindled to about 50,000 tons as the
United Nations, the United States and the European Union borrowed
food to feed people in Ethiopia last year _ and have not yet paid
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government bought some 100,000 tons of grain in
the first three months of this year to head off famine _ a decided
change from the Mengistu regime, which had used famine as a weapon,
burning crops and blocking relief supplies in the mid-1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no doubt that Ethiopia is spending a mammoth
amount on the war. One diplomat estimates that salaries alone for
350,000 soldiers cost between $14 million and $20 million a month.
That does not count perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars spent
on ammunition and arms, including Russian tanks, at least eight
fighter planes and an unknown number of support aircraft purchased
only this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war with Eritrea is taking away their attention, and to a
certain extent, taking away resources,'' said Tim Waites, regional
food security coordinator for the Horn of Africa for Oxfam, the
international charity group.
</P>
<P>
   And the war has created other problems: Ethiopia will not allow
relief supplies to enter through Eritrea's two ports, Massawa and
Assab, though the United Nations would like it. Ethiopia says it
fears that Eritrea will seize shipments, as it did in 1998, when it
confiscated some 70,000 tons of goods bound for Ethiopia, including
45,000 tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with so much military might on the front, Ethiopia has not
spared many soldiers to help make the Ogaden region, around Gode,
safe from bandits and rebels fighting the government. The United
Nations considers the region so unsafe that foreign staff is not
permitted to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the entire aid operation will become complicated _ if
not impossible _ if the fighting erupts again.
</P>
<P>
   Few outside politicians and aid officials have been willing to
speak out publicly about the link between the war and the famine.
An exception is Claire Short, the British minister responsible for
overseas development, who said recently: ``I do not believe that
anyone in the U.K. believes we should be providing long-term
assistance to a country which is increasing its spending on arms,
year on year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Europeans, in fact, suspended much of their aid
for long-term development because of the war. The United States has
not, although American officials say they have been working hard
behind the scenes to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers say much of the talk of ending the war has
evaporated with the food shortage _ in part because outside nations
do not want to be blamed for any problems that hamper the relief
operation. Some aid groups and others say a vital opportunity is
being missed.
</P>
<P>
   The choice, some experts say, is not to threaten to pull out if
Ethiopia does not make a much stronger effort to end the war.
Rather, they say, the outside world should be clear that it is
helping feed the hungry as a way to end the war, at the same time
offering a peace package that would include more money for
long-term development and relief from Ethiopia's crippling foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
   That is not happening, said one Western researcher in Addis
Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pretense of: `We're negotiating over your peace
and we're going to call in these debts,''' the researcher said.
``Part of it is, that is too complicated. Part of it is that it
isn't a priority. It's kind of a nuisance conflict.''

AMERICANS OF TWO MINDS ON SANCTIONS, POLL FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more Americans know about the world, the more likely they
are to favor diplomacy over punitive sanctions in dealing with
troublesome foreign countries, a poll has found. Embargoes, they
say, not only isolate the nations at which they are aimed but also
hurt American business.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans lack information about a country, or when their
leaders do not adequately publicize and explain their policy
thinking, many fall back on long-established stereotypes of ``bad''
and ``good'' nations, the poll found. Judgments about how to deal
with those nations are then made on those images.
</P>
<P>
   The survey _ by First International Resources, a business
consulting group, and the polling organization Penn, Schoen &AMP;
Berland _ was done in two parts for the sake of comparison. A
national sample of 995 average voters was made first, and then 176
knowledgeable ``elites'' working in government, academic life and
research institutes were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The full poll results are expected to be made public next week.
The survey, based on interviews from Feb. 28 to March 21, focused
primarily on attitudes toward economic sanctions on Iran, but when
respondents were asked to name ``good'' and ``bad'' countries, the
findings suggest that the attitudes apply to sanctions policy
toward other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents in the general public knew very little about Iran
and were often almost completely unaware of the recent political
changes there, including gains by moderates in parliamentary
elections. Only 15 percent of them had heard about advances by
Iranians who advocate reform; only 2 percent knew of the 1997
election of a more moderate Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami.
Among more knowledgeable people, 58 percent had heard about the
shifts toward moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups, however, were still instinctively unfavorable to
Iran, based on its reputation for support of terrorism and Islamic
militancy. Only Iraq outranked it on the enemies' list among the
general population. But the elite respondents were far more likely
to say that Iran had changed _ they ranked Serbia, Libya and Iraq
as worse cases _ and that Iranian moderates should be helped. These
more knowledgeable people also said that sanctions got in the way
of dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the general public and the elites believe it is extremely
important to keep channels of communication open with countries
like Iran,'' the poll concluded, ``and that penalizing or isolating
rogue countries is not the way to get them to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have been a major policy tool of the Clinton
administration, whether imposed by the United States alone or
through the United Nations. Other nations, including U.S. allies in
Europe, have been critical of long-running embargoes and other
sanctions, saying that they rarely hurt dictators but can harm
ordinary people. They also get in the way of international
business, or create tensions when the United States tries to force
other nations to adhere to its own trade and investment
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a U.S. embargo on Iran was eased to allow for
importing certain goods like caviar, pistachios and Persian carpets
_ a move of which six of 10 poll respondents in the general public
were unaware. Sports exchanges that have taken place drew universal
support in the poll, and 77 percent of average voters and 90
percent of the elite respondents said sanctions should be lifted if
Iran responded favorably to an initial easing of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, a small but widening movement is questioning the
long-term value of inflexible embargoes. There are concerns that in
Iraq, for example, a decade of sanctions may be strengthening the
hand of Saddam Hussein while causing unacceptable hardships to the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, was in Iraq last week to assess the
cumulative effects of the comprehensive sanctions imposed in 1990
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He is expected to announce the
results of his trip at a news conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll found that while Americans continued to think that
sanctions should remain a tool of foreign policy and that big
business would from time to time have to make sacrifices because of
embargoes, respondents in both groups preferred sanctions to be
imposed through international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed concern about the use of sanctions if
American jobs were at risk, and when presented with facts about
American losses, were more likely to want sanctions lifted, or at
least eased.

AT EXTRA-SPECIAL TIME, JUBILATION IN JAMMED ROME
</HEADLINE>
  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ After walking 4,350 miles to Rome wearing a brown
traveler's cape and Tyrolean hat, and with a shell, the traditional
pilgrim's symbol, hanging from his neck, Walter Weigand, 53, stared
in disbelief at the huge crowd of less road-weary pilgrims milling
around him on St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not pilgrims,'' he said indignantly as he clutched a
staff trimmed with olive branches. ``They get off a bus then walk
300 feet to the church. That's just tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weigand, who quit his job as a waiter in Berlin last
September to undertake a medieval-style pilgrimage to honor the
church's Jubilee year, stopping at shrines from Santiago de
Compostela in Spain to the Vatican, was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the estimated 500,000 Roman Catholics who have
flocked to Rome to celebrate Holy Week, which began on Palm Sunday
and ends at Easter, came on foot. But beneath a shiny veneer of
modern comfort and efficiency _ Internet-ready visitors' centers,
air-conditioned Jubilee buses, microchip-equipped pilgrim cards
that automatically book church services, tours and restaurants,
chemical toilets and electric votive candles _ the Holy Year 2000
is laced with the kind of humble piety and awe that drew the first
Jubilee pilgrims here in 1300.
</P>
<P>
   Faith, and an almost giddy determination, drove 51 pilgrims from
Brazil to race straight from the airport to St. Peter's on Thursday
evening so they would not miss the Mass in which Pope John Paul II
washed and kissed the feet of 12 priests, a ritual he does every
Holy Thursday to recall Christ washing the feet of his apostles.
</P>
<P>
   Faith made a group of 32 pilgrims from Moldova _ 20 Eastern
Orthodox and 12 Catholic believers who traveled by bus for two days
and two nights _ skip dinner so they could pray outside the
Colosseum while the pope carried the cross during the Good Friday
re-enactment of Christ's passion.
</P>
<P>
   And faith got Gerri Ann Slaton of Tampa, Fla., up early on
Friday to walk on her knees up a flight of cold, damp stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, I said to myself, `I'm not going to climb
that,' but God told me, `Yes, you are.' And I did,'' Slaton, 62,
said, still slightly out of breath from climbing the Scala Santa, a
holy staircase that believers say was fashioned from the floors
that Jesus trod on while being interrogated by Pontius Pilot in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   She and 40 other Catholics from Tampa and Jacksonville were on a
pilgrimage to Rome and Medjugorje, a shrine in Bosnia where
believers say apparitions of the Virgin still occur. ``Rome is a
little fast-paced, but oh my, to kneel on the steps that Christ
walked on,'' she said, her eyes welling up. ``You know, I never
thought I would get to Rome, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed in 700 years. ``Medieval pilgrims used to
come to Rome for spiritual and medical care,'' said Herbert L.
Kessler, a professor of art history at Johns Hopkins University who
just finished a book on the first Jubilee in 1300. ``The popes
built pilgrims' hospitals like San Giovanni that are still working
today. They still come for spiritual reasons. Piety cannot be
overlooked _ these are believers, not tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope Boniface VIII summoned pilgrims to Rome in 1300 when the
Crusades failed and travel to the Holy Land became too dangerous.
Jubilee is a Catholic term derived from the Hebrew word yobel, a
law handed down by Moses requiring that slaves be freed and debts
forgiven every 50 years. (Since 1475, Jubilees have been scheduled
every 25 years, improving each pope's chance of presiding over a
Holy Year.)
</P>
<P>
   Pope Boniface lured pilgrims accustomed to traveling to shrines
like Santiago de Compostela in Spain, where the pilgrims of the
Canterbury Tales were headed, to Rome by offering an indulgence, a
remittance on punishment for sins. (Legend has it that Martin
Luther, whose disapproval of the selling of indulgences led to the
16th-century Reformation, first balked at what he viewed as impious
superstition while climbing the Scala Santa.)
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, John Paul II has broadened the paths to an
indulgence. They can be earned in any of Rome's main basilicas (and
even the chapel at the Rome airport) as well as cathedrals and
churches around the world throughout the Jubilee Year.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic tradition, 2,000 years of Christian history, and
the lure of this pope are expected to bring as many as 20 million
Catholics to Rome and other holy sites in Italy throughout the
year, the largest Jubilee ever held by the Vatican. Easter, the day
on which tradition says that Christ was resurrected, is one of the
holiest days on the Roman Catholic calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The city's efforts to accommodate _ and streamline _ the traffic
of religious visitors from all over the world has prompted less
reverent comments from hoteliers, souvenir sellers, shopkeepers and
tour operators. They complain bitterly that a city ban on tour
buses in the center of Rome has driven many ordinary tourists, and
even some pilgrims, to cancel reservations and stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who want to go from St. Peter's to other basilicas or
the Colosseum this year must board special blue Jubilee shuttle
buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot get a group of 40 elderly people onto one of the
buses,'' Ira Levin, 65, owner of Italia Esoterica, a tour agency,
complained. ``It's logistically impossible. It's created a whole
hullabaloo in the tourist industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that, however, is not really new. Dante, who wrote the
Divine Comedy shortly after the 1300 Jubilee, mentioned Holy Year
organizational zeal in his ``Inferno'' by likening the system for
streamlining some sinners in hell to Romans' efforts to organize
pedestrian traffic. There were some breakdowns, however. In 1450,
masses of pilgrims leaving a papal blessing mobbed the only bridge
over the Tiber and 200 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year mishaps have been minor. Lost wallets, stolen
passports, and the occasional lost pilgrim have been reported to
Jubilee volunteers and visitors' centers. Pilgrims mainly seem
startled by Rome's chaotic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Burgess, 64, of Tampa marveled at the sight of so many
priests and nuns on the street, and the nonchalance with which they
were treated by Roman drivers. ``I saw a car almost run over Bishop
Foley,'' she said, referring to Archbishop John Foley, an American
Vatican official. ``My gosh, he had to jump out of the way,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lodging has been plentiful _ for most. Jubilee government funds
were used to refurbish hotels all over the city, and the Vatican
converted schools and convents into pilgrims' hostels, with rooms
costing as little as $25 a night. The Florida group, benefiting
from a package tour rate, stayed at the posh Hotel Columbus next to
St. Peter's. The Moldovans were assigned rooms at a Dominican
convent just inside the city limits. Like other poor pilgrims, they
were given free lunch boxes by a special papal charity.
</P>
<P>
   But employees at a Jubilee visitors' center near the Vatican
said they noticed that little planning had been made for lodging
poor pilgrims who show up without reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get a lot of them, but solitary pilgrims turn up, and
we can't send them to a homeless shelter, and they can't afford a
hotel,'' Christian Benedati, 28, said. ``I called one convent on my
list for a young German pilgrim, and they wouldn't take him. They
said he wasn't Italian, he wasn't a priest, and he couldn't pay.''
He added, ``I think he ended up sleeping on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims, however, do not complain. ``Rome feels like a
festival,'' said Vitaly Tsurcanou, 46, a textbook editor from
Kishinev, Moldova, elated as he stood outside St. Peter's. ``It's a
city, but it smells of country flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   An Eastern Orthodox believer who said he found his faith reading
Mikhail Bulgakov's novel ``The Master and Margarita,'' came to
Rome, he said, because it was holy to all Christians. ``This is a
such a blessing to be here. It's something I thought I would only
do in my dreams.''

<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Frans Tuijntjes, a former NATO test
pilot, has flown in the Arizona desert, across much of Europe and
over the African bush. But these days he is selling men's clothing
and loving it.
</P>
<P>
   The former pilot, who has just turned 69, was bored in
retirement. So when he heard of 65(PLUS), a new employment agency
designed for the elderly, it seemed just the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold airplanes, so I figured I could sell a suit,'' he
said, returning from his part-time job at a local Marks &AMP; Spencer
store. ``It's fun because I meet all sorts of people and I can
practice my languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting the elderly _ men and women who want to occupy their
days, to battle loneliness or to top up their pensions _ has become
a Dutch growth industry. While unemployment hovers around 10
percent in other parts of Europe, the Dutch now have the opposite
problem: With only 2.7 percent jobless, the country is seriously
short of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies describe older employees as unusually motivated,
experienced and loyal. Demand is such that this year the 65(PLUS)
chain is expanding into 10 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, the indulgent Dutch welfare state was
subsidizing inactivity. It encouraged the middle-aged to take early
retirement or disability pay in order to make room for the
unemployed young. Many people opted out, with almost full pay.
</P>
<P>
   But harsh cutbacks and investment incentives have turned the
tables. The economy grew quickly in the past five years, reaching
4.3 percent in 1999. Companies complain that the tight labor market
is now hampering growth, because they can no longer fill vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage has prompted a national debate on some
sensitive questions: How many more immigrants should be let into a
small country that is already one of the world's most densely
populated? Can the government force people to retrain? How much
should it raise retirement age?
</P>
<P>
   Last month the government formally summoned the elderly to
return to work, saying it needed their experience. It sweetened the
call with a package of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Jos Veenhuis did not need such prodding. He got his job through
65(PLUS) and now spends two or three days a week as a guard at the
Rembrandt House museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets me out of the house, and it's fun when people ask
questions,'' said Veenhuis, 70, who retired at age 59 as personnel
chief at Amsterdam's main railway station.
</P>
<P>
   He has boned up on topics such as Rembrandt's stormy life and
the restoration of art works. And he enjoys going home at night
with a few stories. ``Americans ask things like `What wax do you
use?' because some restored paintings look so bright and shiny,''
he said. (No wax.) ``The Dutch want to know if the furniture in the
house really belonged to the Master.'' (It didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   Veenhuis has used the extra income for vacations with his wife
in Greece and Spain. ``And I've become a real Rembrandt fan,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 65(PLUS) agencies, jobs being offered tend to be
part-time, which is what older people usually look for, said
Annemarie Egels, a branch manager in The Hague. Most of her
applicants are men, because, she said, after a long career they
seem to feel more frustrated or isolated in retirement than women,
who in that generation often stayed at home.
</P>
<P>
   Egels said there are more requests for receptionists, cashiers,
personnel managers and accountants than she can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The range is even wider at 55(PLUS), an agency for
over-55-year-olds in Rotterdam, which in the past 18 months has
seen demand soar for health-care workers, teachers and librarians.
``Companies tell us they find the older people not only more
experienced but also more polite, more patient and punctual,'' said
Christie de Groot, the agency director.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters say there is also a need for former executives, who
may be called in to help start or reorganize companies, since
younger workers are often very specialized.
</P>
<P>
   Egels recalled one recent project that involved merging several
libraries for the blind and creating a common database. ``We found
a retired publisher, lawyer, real estate agent and mathematics
teacher,'' she recalled. ``They did the job in a year and they've
all been friends ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling in the retired has other benefits. Employers can pay
them 20 percent to 25 percent less because they no longer need to
contribute to social security or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But additional earnings can push the pensioner into a higher tax
bracket. ``Of course my income taxes have gone up a bit,'' said
Bert Pel, 66, who used to head a federation of importers and now
does part-time bookkeeping for the Red Cross. ``It's worth it,'' he
said. ``I'm making new friends and I keep up with the new computer
systems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Computers are one problem area. The elderly have little or no
experience in information technology, yet demand for even basic
computer skills is such that employment agencies are providing
training. Even 65(PLUS) thinks the investment is worthwhile. For
its clients it pays half the cost of the computer training course.
The client or the employer pays the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Because jobs are often short-term or part-time, no reliable
statistics are available showing how many retired people are now
working. Agencies like 65(PLUS) and 55(PLUS) handle hundreds of
applicants each month. But it is clear that the retired who have
gone back to work are just a small portion of the 2 million people
who are 65 or older in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   And this underscores another fundamental issue. Europe's overall
population is older than that of any other continent, and the
Netherlands is among the countries where every year a smaller
percentage of people are working and a larger percentage are
collecting pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuijntjes, the former test pilot, said three days per week at
the Marks &AMP; Spencer store were enough pressure. ``I'm already by
far the oldest employee there,'' he said with a chuckle. ``Of
course I'll keep going as long as I don't make a fool of myself.''

   WASHINGTON _ Under the banner of clean energy, Earth Day
participants Saturday celebrated in the nation's capital and at
thousands of events around the globe in an extravaganza of
entertainment, advocacy and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and supporters participated in events in 183
countries for the 30th Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people gathered peacefully at the Mall in
Washington, less than a week after hundreds of demonstrators were
arrested here, protesting the global activities of international
lending agencies. Among other things, those protesters had objected
to the environmental policies of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's rallies were organized by the Seattle-based Earth Day
Network, whose chairman, Denis Hayes, was the national coordinator
for the 1970 event. The teach-ins and rallies of that original
Earth Day, more informal and less global, helped inaugurate the
modern environmental movement in the United States and was the
spark for two landmark environmental laws signed by President
Richard M. Nixon, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address Saturday, President Clinton announced two
new but relatively modest initiatives to combat global warming and
celebrate Earth Day. Clinton said he was going to require federal
agencies to reduce by 20 percent over five years the amount of
gasoline their vehicle fleets consume. This would save 45 million
gallons of oil a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced a program to allow federal workers to set
aside up to $65 tax-free every month to pay for public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's celebration in Washington, called EarthFair 2000, was
not politically diverse. But the rally's loosely organized format
made for some interesting contrasts But the rally's loosely
organized format made for some interesting contrasts. The actor
Leonardo Di Caprio led the festivities. DiCaprio, 25, was scheduled
to be a host on an Earth Day special on the ABC television network
Saturday night. But Saturday's rallies also featured speakers who
back a campaign seeking to raise the environmental conscience of
some prominent corporations, like Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC
and will distribute a movie starring DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, ecopledge.com, asks corporations to change
environmental practices, or face possible boycotts.

   MIAMI _ Before dawn Saturday , armed U.S. immigration agents
smashed their way into the Little Havana home of Elian Gonzalez's
Miami relatives, took the sobbing 6-year-old boy from a bedroom
closet and flew him to a reunion with his father outside
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators wept in rage and coughed from pepper spray and
tear gas, the agents wrapped the child in a blanket and carried him
to an airport to fly him to Washington. The action touched off a
fury in the streets outside the Miami home where Cuban exiles have
kept a vigil over the small boy since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening? What's happening?'' Elian said in Spanish as
he was taken away. ``Help me. Help me.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents, wearing shirts with the words ``INS FEDERAL AGENT''
in bold yellow letters, ended a bitter standoff between Miami's
exile community and a federal government that finally ended
fruitless negotiations with the child's defiant great-uncle and a
community that saw Elian as a symbol of freedom and a precious
victory, now perhaps lost, over Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, how could you have performed only half a miracle,'' said
a frantic, weeping Marisleysis Gonzalez, a 21-year-old cousin who
had been the boy's closest companion since he was rescued at sea on
Thanksgiving on a failed crossing from Cuba in which his mother
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department said Saturday morning that Elian was
taken safely from the home at about 5:10 a.m. and was flown to
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., where his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, waited.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, the father was seen carrying Elian from a
car at the base, though it was not clear where they would be
staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are together,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, one Justice Department spokesman said, was subdued and
calm on the flight from Miami, as federal agents gently explained
what was happening to him.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno told reporters Saturday morning that
she tried until the final moment of the standoff to find some other
way that father and son could be reunited, but no agreement could
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also defended the decision to use force, and armed agents,
saying there were reports that people in the crowd or the
neighborhood had weapons.
</P>
<P>
   She had no other choice, she said, but to order the raid on the
home of Lazaro Gonzalez. ``Elian is safe, and no one is seriously
hurt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean Elian is on his way back to Cuba. Under an
order by a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, Elian's father cannot take Elian home before a
decision in a May 11 hearing on Elian's application, filed by his
relatives, for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But at the two-bedroom house in Little Havana, where Elian has
lived under the constant watch of television cameras and eyes of
demonstrators who have turned him into an almost saint-like
presence as well as a prize in the 41-year-old Cold War with
Castro, people wailed, sank to the ground, and cursed the U.S.
government for what it had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're animals,'' screeched Marisleysis Gonzalez to the
swelling crowd Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While exiles here have kept vigil in anticipation of such a raid
for months, the timing _ the morning after Good Friday and the day
before Easter in a heavily Roman Catholic community _ and the
violent, sudden nature of it left them in as much disbelief as
rage.
</P>
<P>
   A Friday night crowd of demonstrators had slowly dwindled
overnight from hundreds to about 50 people, some sleeping behind
police barricales, when three white, unmarked vans sped down the
dark street and stopped in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here! They're here!'' demonstrators shouted.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 Immigration and Naturalization Service agents leaped
from the vans, tore through a chain link gate, broke through the
front door and, with brandished automatic weapons, stormed through
the tiny house in search of Elian. The Justice Department said that
eight immigration agents actually went into the house to retrieve
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Camejo, a cousin of Lazaro Gonzalez, was in the house with
the family watching television as they agents burst in. ``They held
Marisleysis down and told her not to move in Spanish,'' said
Camejo. The agents shouted at the others not to move or interfere,
as Marisleysis pleaded: ``Don't take the boy. Don't take the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was hiding in a closet in the arms of Donato Dalrymple,
one of the two fishermen who saved Elian from the sea off the
Florida coast and has been constant presence at the house.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in helmet and body armor, holding an automatic rifle,
pulled the boy from Dalrymple's arms. The agent, said Dalrymple,
pointed the rifle at him as Elian cried ``No! No!. No!''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photograph, sent around the world, showed
the gun close to Elian's face, but Reno said the barrel was never
pointed at the boy, and the agent's finger was not on the trigger,
and the photograph bears out that description.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was handed to a female agent who cradled him in her arms
and, with help from another agent, raced out into the din and
confusion of the street outside and quickly into the side doors of
a van.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's eyes were wide, wide open, he cried and he seemed
terrified as all around him people screamed and cursed and fought
against a line of federal agents who formed a wall with shields and
automatic weapons as a cloud of tear gas and pepper spray wafted
down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come with me!'' Elian cried to Marisleysis Gonzalez, said
Camejo.
</P>
<P>
   A few protesters tried to form a human chain to block the front
of the house and keep the agents from taking the boy. Ramon Saul
Sanchez, an exile in Miami who has become the leader in the
demonstration, said he was struck by an agent's gun butt. He bled
from an ear as a young man held him upright.
</P>
<P>
   The family had thought negotiations would continue, said family
members and their lawyers, but Reno said that it was obvious that
the family was not going to budge. President Bill Clinton said
Saturday morning that ``the law has been upheld. When all efforts
failed, there was no alternative but to enforce the the decision by
the INS and federal court that Juan Miguel Gonzalez have custody of
his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. ``I
am very pleased with the way she handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, people compared the raid to communist Cuba and
swore that the U.S. government would regret its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected the federal government to come in like they
did, like thieves in the night,'' said Carlos Brito, a demonstrator
who has been outside the house almost every night for months.
``I've always been proud of being an American but this morning I
wish I were a citizen of any other country. I've always defended
this country, but to take this boy in the middle of the night?
Today, the federal government has betrayed me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rosa de la Cruz, 58, said she was knocked to the ground by an
armed man, near a gardenia bush in front of the house. ``I was
praying,'' said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno was lying the whole time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house, in the minutes after the raid, three young
men held each other and sobbed. One woman sat in a ditch and held
her face in her hands as tears ran down her arms. People rushed
back and forth yelling, but not sure who to vent their anger on. An
American flag was flown upside down in disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, protests gradually swelled as groups all over Miami
burned tires in intersections and snarled traffic by standing or
marching in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Police made several arrests as of noon, but earlier in the
morning as the raid was being conducted, they had no presence at
all. Miami police had stood watch at the house for months, but as
the federal agents moved in, there seemed to be no police presence
at all. Only several minutes later, after the federal agents had
left, did Miami police move in.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said he had not been told about the
raid, but that was not a surprise. Carollo has made it clear that
he sides with the exile community in this fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call at 5:18,'' he said, after the raid was over.
</P>
<P>
   The exile community in Miami, Carollo said, is ``destroyed,
emotionally destroyed.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their self-imposed deadline was 5 a.m. Saturday,
and as the minutes ticked away before federal law-enforcement
officials had to decide whether to seize Elian Gonzalez at
gunpoint, Attorney General Janet Reno was on the phone to the boy's
Miami relatives, appealing to them one last time to end the
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are running out of time,'' an aide to the attorney general
recalled that Reno said, describing her voice as emphatic but laced
with emotion and fatigue after all-night negotiations. ``You've got
to decide now,'' Reno said. ``That's all the time you have.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, as Reno held the phone in her office at the Justice
Department, a team of eight agents, some of them armed and wearing
body armor and jumpsuits, swarmed into the house of Elian's great
uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It was just the kind of raid, armed and
confrontational and carried out under darkness, that the officials
had called their worst alternative for weeks. The image of an armed
federal agent flushing the boy from a closet was displayed on
television Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Within three minutes the agents were gone, taking the child to a
waiting minivan, ending a five-month-long custody battle that had
haunted Reno, who had tried, and repeatedly failed, to conclude the
case without the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning after the raid, President Clinton said Reno
made the right decision and that he supported her. ``The law has
been upheld,'' he said, ``and that was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She made the decision,'' Clinton said. ``She managed this. But
I fully support what she did. I think she did the right thing, and
I'm very pleased with the way she handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials, who had scheduled the
operation for Saturday, had said that they had to begin the
operation no later than 6 a.m., when traffic lights in the area
would change from flashing amber to the normal red and green and
when crowds were expected to gather. Operational commanders had
informed Reno that the order to go ahead had to be given no later
than 5 a.m. in order to carry it out Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which agents had rehearsed for nearly two weeks,
hinged on their ability to carry out a lightning raid, with little
warning to local authorities, who federal authorities feared were
sympathetic to Cuban-Americans in Miami and might compromise
operational security.
</P>
<P>
   The agents arrived in force, some wearing jumpsuits and carrying
automatic weapons. The weaponry, officials said, was needed to
ensure the safety of Elian and the agents. Moreover, the officials
said Reno had received unconfirmed reports that there might be
weapons in the house and authorities were concerned about the
possibility of violence from small numbers of political extremists
believed to be among the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, Reno said that she had received
information that there might be guns ``perhaps in the crowd,
perhaps in the house'' and said that agents were armed as
justifiable precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been told on occasion that people would have weapons
to prevent it from happening,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Elian's Miami relatives left the government no
alternative but to take the child by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I informed the parties that time had run out,'' she said after
an all-night session of negotiations that ended with the boy's
seizure before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   She expressed frustration over the actions of the relatives in
the long standoff. ``Every time we thought we had achieved what we
wanted, it wasn't enough,'' Reno said. ``It was just one step after
another in which they moved the goalpost.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken by a photographer for the Associated Press in
the house during the assault operation showed one of the fishermen
who rescued Elian at sea five months ago backed into a closet,
holding startled-looking boy, as a helmeted agent in assault gear
held them at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the photo, Reno said the gun ``was pointed to the
side'' and the agent's ``finger was not on the trigger.'' Reno did
not say whether any weapons had been found in the house and
officials said later they were unaware that any firearms or other
weapons had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours ticked down to minutes, Reno held out hope for a
settlement as civic leaders in Miami tried to broker a last-ditch
deal. From her corner office at the Justice Department, Reno
relayed proposals and counteroffers between lawyers for Elian's
father and the Miami relatives, keeping hope alive for a negotiated
outcome, aides to Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides grouped in ante room outside Reno's office worked through
the night, at times frantically consulting with colleagues on the
phone to interpret the offers and counteroffers, at times waiting,
sitting on the floor eating pizza as they waited through the long
predawn hours.
</P>
<P>
   The first proposals from the relatives were so vague, the aides
said, that Reno demanded more specifics before she took the
proposal to Gregory Craig, a lawyer for Elian's father. ``The
attorney general said she wasn't going to take an offer that did
not contain the components that we knew would be required,'' an
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks continued, Justice Department officials said, they
began to doubt that the lawyers in Miami were getting cooperation
from the family, who seemed to remain unwilling to surrender the
child unconditionally to this father.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded to come up with a more concrete proposal, the relatives'
lawyer suggested that Elian be moved to a group home in a neutral
location in which father and son would live with the Miami
relatives while a federal appeals decides whether the child should
remain in the United States, according to the accounts of aides to
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Craig rejected the idea, officials said, countering with the
same demand that Elian be turned over immediately to his father,
but agreeing to move to a residence where the relatives would be
able to visit the child.
</P>
<P>
   The indirect discussion, carried out by telephone and fax
between Washington and Miami, bogged down and collapsed. Reno
polled her aides on whether time had finally come for the
law-enforcement action, officials said. Eric H. Holder Jr., the
deputy attorney general, said that Reno's advisers were unanimous
in urging her to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   After two telephone conversations Friday night between Reno and
Clinton, she advised the president of the status of the final
efforts to break the impasse, but did not focus on the timing or
specifics of the use of force to retrieve the child.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 2:45 a.m. the White House chief of staff, John Podesta,
telephoned Clinton in the White House residence. Aides said that
Clinton said he would support the tactical operation if the
negotiations seemed fruitless. Podesta woke the president at 5 a.m.
to advise him that the talks were at a stalemate and that Reno had
ordered the agents to seize the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, as officials watched the pre-dawn
assault on the house, Holder said he felt sadness. ``Many of us are
parents of children that age,'' Holder said. ``It was not an easy
thing to see a boy of that age carried out like that.''

ANGRY DEMONSTRATORS QUICKLY GATHER OUTSIDE THE GONZALEZ HOUSE IN
MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In minutes, it seemed, the street in front of the home
where Elian Gonzalez had been sleeping awoke to a loud and raucous
protest, as neighbors spilled from their homes and Cuban-Americans
summoned by cell phone rushed to the scene. Their little boy was
gone _ taken by federal agents who stormed the house at 5:15 a.m._
and they were not going to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Impassioned, anguished and angry, hundreds soon gathered in
front of the tiny white house on Northwest Second Street to direct
their anger toward Attorney General Janet Reno and President
Clinton. The strident anti-Castro Cubans charged that the two had
conspired with none other than Fidel Castro to remove the boy and
reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they would take him; I thought Clinton and
Reno would respect the laws of the United States,'' said Saul Mari,
62, who, like many here, believes that handing Elian to his father
is akin to handing him over to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lover of liberty,'' Mari said, ``and I thought this
country was a lover of liberty, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, their anger was overwhelming. One young man burned a
small American flag. Others equated the operation to the
government's disastrous raid on the compound in Waco, Texas, which
had been ordered by Reno. Several people held up crosses, one with
a baby doll nailed to the wood, red paint smeared across its body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible that this happened,'' Jesus Jorge, 53,
muttered, shaking his head. ``Clinton and Reno will pay for this in
front of God's justice. This is unpardonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some took their anger out on reporters, shouting them down. A
photographer for The Washington Post was hit in the arm by a man,
who was then pulled away by his companions.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd broke into spontaneous chants, shouting ``criminals''
and ``assassins,'' referring to the government force that swept
into the home where Elian had been staying since he was found
floating off South Florida on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators called for mass protests and hunger strikes, and
by midmorning hundreds of protesters hoisting the Cuban banner had
spilled onto nearby streets. Some overturned garbage cans and
newspaper boxes. By late morning, several protesters had been
arrested for trying to block traffic on the wide thoroughfares
nearby. Motorists, meanwhile, clogged up several routes nearby. At
least one vehicle was overturned and set on fire. Hundreds of
police officers, meanwhile, tried to contain spontaneous marches.
</P>
<P>
   Many other people, meanwhile, simply gathered at ground zero in
the months-long saga: the plain house where Elian had stayed with
his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. Crowding up to the fence, they
shouted support to Elian's relatives and listened as Marisleysis
Gonzalez, Lazaro's daughter, and others recounted how agents had
smashed their way in and snatched the child.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Valdez, 64, said that as soon as he heard screaming and
shouting outside his house, he ran outside. Like others, he said he
has stood vigil outside the home for weeks, to show solidarity with
fellow exiles and protect the boy in the event of a government
operation to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live a block away, so when it happened, I jumped out of bed
and ran out to the street,'' he said. ``I'm just so frustrated, as
you can imagine. I feel it here in my heart. I feel it right here.
It's so personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mendez, 45, a real estate agent who lives nearby, said he
did not think the government would act the day before Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we expected this,'' Mendez said, standing with
his arms crossed as he looked at a crowd massed in front of the
Gonzalez home. ``People didn't think this could happen on Holy
Week. If they did something, we at least thought they would wait
until at least next week.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the Cuban exiles, it was just too much. At least two
elderly Cuban-Americans were rushed from the scene by paramedics
after experiencing shortness of breath. Many simply held hands,
praying and crying silently and asking why. Why after Wednesday's
victory, when a federal appeals court extended an order to keep
Elian in the United States? Why in the middle of the holiest of
Roman Catholic holidays? Why when the boy had stressed that he
wanted to remain?
</P>
<P>
   Marta Galvez, a 62-year-old grandmother who for days has prayed
outside the home, said she knew the government could, without
warning, storm the house. When the agents arrived, she said, she
even tried to run to the house, in a vain effort to stop them.
Still, she said as the sun started to come up Saturday, she could
hardly deal with the anguish she was feeling at losing a boy she
and others in Little Havana had come to regard as a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so hurt, in so much pain,'' said Galvez, a housewife
who fled Cuba in 1970. ``My heart is broken, to have this happen in
a country that says it's free. The boy was at peace, not a
kidnapping victim, and he wanted to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayra Ramos, 47, said she could not believe Elian was gone. To
her and many others, his arrival in Florida was a divine act. Meant
to be. He was never to leave. Not this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in something spiritual about Elian,'' she said,
softly crying. ``He didn't survive so many days on the ocean
without the help of God. So it hurts so much to see him gone.
Anyone who has lived in the inferno in Cuba cannot imagine going
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tears and the shouts, there were also pleas for calm.
Several of those who had gathered in front of the house took pains
to emphasize to reporters that theirs is a peaceful community,
respectful of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crowd was seething.
</P>
<P>
   With sweat coming off his face, Eddie Gonzalez, 40, angrily
recounted, his voice fevered and loud, how he tried to block the
agents Saturday morning but was pushed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   All he could do, he said, was yell, ``You are a dirty woman, you
are a dirty woman,'' to the agent who carried a crying Elian from
the house.

   AMARGOSA VALLEY, Nev. _ If the desert were a city, the ground
near the Yucca Mountain ridge would be the lonely part of town
where you hope the car doesn't break down. Less than 30 minutes on
a winding, pitted road from Interstate 95, the Yucca flats are a
different world, scorched and scarred. From here, trucks racing
through the hard dirt off the highway, deafening at close range,
sound like buzzing bees, and dusky brown rabbits browsing around
the spotty brush look like kings of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For members of the Western Shoshone Nation, a desire to protect
the jack rabbits and the scrub brush, stubborn survivors of a
thousand nuclear blasts, only partly explains why they believe this
pockmarked landscape should be spared from becoming the dumping
ground for the world's most dangerous poison.
</P>
<P>
   To the Western Shoshone, Yucca Mountain itself, slated to become
the home for all eternity to 77,000 tons of highly lethal nuclear
waste from across the United States, is sacred. The land, 100 miles
northwest of Las Vegas by the Nevada Test Site _ the proving ground
for the atomic bomb _ is part of what was once a vast territory the
Western Shoshones roamed, and still claim as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really say we `own' the land, because we have always
been taught to respect Mother Earth as a living thing,'' said
Raymond Yowell, chief of the Western Shoshone National Council, the
traditional governing body of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally,'' Yowell said, ``our people would travel
through here, camp, forage for pine nuts, maybe hunt deer and
rabbits. We took only what we needed, always thankfully. We
consider ourselves the land's caretakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yowell led the fourth annual spring gathering earlier this month
at Yucca Mountain. The social gathering was also a strategy session
for Western Shoshones and other Indians to discuss ways to stop the
government from making the mountain a nuclear dump.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, scientists have debated whether Yucca
Mountain is the best place to bury the deadly radioactive waste. A
5.4-mile, U-shaped tunnel was bored into the side of the mountain
at a cost of $80 million to allow access for tests. If it wins
congressional approval, the Energy Department will construct a
honeycomb of 35 miles of additional tunnels to house the waste.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 men, women and children were camped out at the base of
the mountain ridge. They danced before dinner and greeted the sun
at dawn. In between, they talked about the dangers of spent
plutonium and uranium byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   The Shoshones, who live mostly on reservations in Nevada,
California and Idaho, say they never ceded their land to the United
States. The only agreement ever signed between the nations, they
say, is the 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley. The peace treaty allowed
the safe passage of nontribal members through lands occupied by the
Western Shoshones.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the Indian Lands Claim Commission was established
to compensate Indians for lands ceded to the United States. The
commission decided that Western Shoshone land had been taken by the
United States on July 1, 1872, through ``gradual encroachment,''
and offered an award of 15 cents per acre for 24 million acres.
This territory included land that now contains a major percentage
of the United States' gold-mining operations.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Western Shoshones have refused the settlement
for their territory, Yowell said, and have fought, unsuccessfully,
for a ruling that would give them clear title of the land. The
fight has gone to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1985 accepted
the Indian Lands Claim Commission's settlement of the land issue.
Gayle Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said that
``although the DOE recognizes the sensitivity of the issue, it must
abide by the rulings of the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shoshones say they are opposed to the transportation of the
nation's nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain _ from 80 sites in 43
states _ not only to protect the land, but also because such a
transport is inherently dangerous. ``That transport would put 50
million people in contact with the most toxic poison,'' said Corbin
Harney, a Western Shoshone spiritual leader who leads an
organization, the Shundahai Network, dedicated to making the nation
nuclear-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should keep the waste where they made it,'' said
Harney. ``Why move it on trucks, risking accidents and airborne
particles?''

CUBAN FATHER AND SON BACK TOGETHER AFTER MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moments after 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez was taken
from a bedroom closet and the arms of a Cuban-American fisherman, a
female voice cooed into his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem very scary,'' the woman, a U.S. immigration
agent, told him in Spanish. ``It will soon be better.''
</P>
<P>
   With that modest promise amid a burst of terror, Elian Gonzalez
began a wild ride Saturday morning that reunited him with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who had pressed for his son's return
for nearly five months.
</P>
<P>
   That was the version of Elian's transfer to the reunion
described in sober tones at a news conference by Attorney General
Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 9:20 a.m. Saturday, the boy was in the arms of his
father at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. Camera crews
in helicopters flying over the secure military base showed Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, a ticket-taker from a Cuban tourist resort,
carrying his son into a building at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, a Miami native, had anguished over the reunion, which was
bitterly opposed by the boy's Miami relatives and many
Cuban-Americans. Reno called for giving father and son privacy to
become reacquainted. They were to stay for a time at Andrews Air
Force Base and then move to an undisclosed location in the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us give him and his father the space, the calm, the moral
support they need to reconnect and reaffirm their bond between
father and son,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white T-shirt and shorts and swaddled in a white
blanket, the bewildered-looking boy, the subject of the world's
most notorious custody battle, was loaded into a van after a
spectacular predawn raid on the Miami home of Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Agents whisked Elian to nearby Watson Island, where they boarded
a helicopter to Homestead Air Force Base in southern Miami-Dade
County.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor examined him there and made certain the boy had not
been injured in the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very emotional case for everyone involved,''
Reno said at the news conference. ``The most important thing is
that Elian is safe and that no one was seriously hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing an extraordinary voyage for a boy who was shipwrecked
off Florida, Elian was then put on a U.S. Marshals Service plane
for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard, the unidentified female immigration agent comforted
Elian, the officials said. She was joined by a psychiatrist, a
flight surgeon and the Immigration and Naturalization Service agent
who had led the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   The officials described Elian as subdued but calm on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our reports so far are that the child has been very
calm, has not been anxious, has not been thrashing, has not been
crying,'' Meissner said. ``And the basic feedback that we have from
a series of people now, who have been directly with him, is that he
is a real terrific, tough kid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elian had already been showered with gifts by Cuban exiles, who
held him up as a symbol of their suffering and divided families. He
was offered a few more items on the flight _ some Play-Doh, a toy
airplane, a map and a watch _ an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Few details had been ignored. Psychologists had recommended the
Play-Doh as the ``best thing that you can do for a child who might
be experiencing stress,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez was rushed to Andrews in a convoy of vans
to await Elian's arrival. The father had been staying at the
residence in Bethesda, Md., of Cuba's top diplomat in the United
States. The residence, like his uncle's Little Havana home, had
been besieged by camera crews and onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   After so much intense media scrutiny, Meissner said the pair
were being protected by federal authorities in an undisclosed
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need more space,'' Meissner said. ``And they need more
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, plainly relieved by the secure transfer of Elian, said the
boy needed ``to have quiet time and private time, and to be with
his father.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ Jackie Erickson, the customer retention
manager for drugstore.com, an online pharmacy, has no problem with
the notion that a shakeout is looming in the Internet industry.
``Pretty soon,'' she said, ``the market will separate the men from
the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   John Keister, the president and co-founder of Go2Net in Seattle,
a network of Web sites, said a stock-market shakeout would be ``a
very healthy thing'' for the industry. ``Not everyone should be a
winner here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after a turbulent week in which a dozen major Internet
companies here watched the value of their stocks hit record or
near-record lows, and then spike back upward, it is hard to find
any Internet executive who does not profess a belief that the
market will, and should, shake loose some dot-com losers in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, such a prospect hardly seems to have sapped the air
of confidence that still pervades many companies here. They all
seem to have a ready answer for why it will happen to the other
guy, but not to them.
</P>
<P>
   For many in an industry and of a generation that have so often
appeared headed along a relentless path to greater prosperity, the
recent gyrations in the stock market represent an across-the-board
brush with vulnerability, and many people in the Internet field
hold stock options that are certainly worth much less today than
they were a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   However humbling the dips may have been, employees of many of
those companies are likely to say that none of the recent market
actions have altered their basic strategies, and the mantras of the
industry emerge in interviews: ``It's a marathon, not a sprint.''
``Keep focused on the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the 29-year-old Erickson put it: ``You don't worry about
the stock market. You can't. You worry about the numbers you can
control.''
</P>
<P>
   In her case, that means devising strategies to keep the business
of first-time customers who might have been enticed to come in the
electronic door with a promotional offer. Her best days at
drugstore.com, she said, have had nothing to do with where the
price of the company's stock wound up, but with sales figures
showing a lot of repeat business.
</P>
<P>
   Judith McGarry, the company's vice president for strategic
partnerships, said: ``What gets us really jazzed here, or what gets
us depressed, is how we do with our customers. And they vote with
their clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   With drugstore.com having recently announced that it had
completed a sale to its one-millionth customer, optimism is much on
display at the online pharmacy's headquarters, scattered among a
few buildings in an office park here, on the eastern shore of Lake
Washington just across from Seattle. (About half of the company's
675 employees are here, and many of the rest are at a distribution
center in Philadelphia.)
</P>
<P>
   Nobody claims that the markets were particularly rational when
they briefly drove the value of the company to $70 a share when it
went public last July, thus assigning a market capitalization of
more than $2 billion to a company that, at the time, had reported a
$30.4 million loss on sales of $4.2 million so far that year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, and with much more fervor, drugstore.com
employees clearly believe that it also does not make sense for the
markets to have driven the stock all the way down to about $6 a
week ago. This was just after the company announced, among other
indications of fast growth, that it had a million customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the downward turn came after an agreement with Amazon.com,
the leading online retailer, that made drugstore.com the company's
pharmaceutical provider, the first instance of Amazon's featuring
such a partner permanently on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Mike Morelli, the beauty buyer for drugstore.com,
explains it, ``All I can say is that I truly believe now is a great
time to buy stock in the company,'' which is what he will do this
week. It closed for last week at $8 1/16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The faith of employees here comes despite the flutterings of
nervousness among investors in high-tech companies, some signs that
the luster of working for a dot-com is fading for some young
college and business-school graduates, and even a recent report by
Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass., suggesting that most
dot-com enterprises could be driven out of business over the next
few years amid a wave of consolidation in the Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the same company has predicted that Internet spending by
consumers could increase to over $180 billion in the next five
years, up from $20 billion last year. And drugstore.com employees
offer passionate explanations for why their particular segment of
the market is ripe for online expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, who came to the company last summer after graduating
from Northwestern University's business school, said she settled on
drugstore.com in part because she had a feel for the business (her
father and grandfather are pharmacists), and in part because she
believes that typical drugstore items are particularly well suited
to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what you're getting if you order Crest toothpaste _
you don't need to go look at it in a store,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With other things, like buying a car, you want to feel it,
touch it, smell it, talk to the person who wants to sell it to
you,'' Erickson continued, citing an item that she thought might be
more difficult to sell directly over the Internet, and then adding
another: ``I think it will be a while before we buy diamonds on the
Internet. I mean, for $10,000 or whatever it's going to be, you
want to see it, touch it, try it on, not just have it show up in
the mail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Martha Richter, 29, who gave her title as manager for ``all
things Amazon,'' said she was drawn to drugstore.com because of the
energy and the pace she felt there when she came for an interview
last year, after a less than successful spell with a start-up
cable-television enterprise in Kentucky. (``We started, but we
didn't up,'' she explained cheerfully.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest legal department I've ever worked with,''
Richter said. ``At other places you want to get something done and
it's like, oh, God, it's bottled up in legal. Here, it's like legal
wants an answer right now so that we can get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   While almost everyone here predicts that the company will do
well in the long haul and that its stock price will ultimately
reflect that success, even what one employee described as a
``worst-case scenario'' is not viewed as a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an incredible opportunity to learn here,''
Morelli said. ``You've got people at a pretty young age getting to
plan strategy and make these momentous decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's president and chief executive, Peter Neupert, a
former Microsoft vice president, said that most employees had taken
the recent plunge in the stock price in stride, and that among its
silver linings was that it might get investors to take a harder
look at the difficulties of e-commerce, and reward those who wound
up doing it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot harder than it looks,'' said the 44-year-old chief
executive whose board of directors includes Melinda French Gates,
the wife of Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder; Jeff Bezos of
Amazon.com, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks. ``Putting the
technical infrastructure in place, getting and keeping the
customers, tracking all the merchandise _ it's not a trivial
exercise,'' he said. ``And I know how hard we're all working.''

HAVANA LOOKS CALM BUT GLEEFUL AFTER `RESCUE' OF ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ They are calling it the rescue of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a police operation, Elian Gonzalez was rescued from
his kidnappers in Miami,'' was how the excited commentator on Cuban
state radio described it 90 minutes after the raid, an unusually
swift delivery of news.
</P>
<P>
   But as this city awoke to the news that U.S. agents had taken
Elian from the Miami home where he has stayed with relatives
opposed to President Fidel Castro, the streets appeared calm and
normal. The government here had broadcast warnings not to celebrate
because ``that could negatively affect the outcome of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday morning, the government issued a statement
saying: ``The fight for Elian Gonzalez has not ended. But the
reunion with his father is a favorable step.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban radio reported jubilation in the neighborhood of Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, who has spent two weeks in the
United States seeking the return of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban radio carried a telephone interview from Cardenas, the
seaside city two hours east of Havana that is Elian's hometown,
with a man the station identified as Juan Miguel's father, Juan
Gonzalez. He said Juan Miguel woke him around 6 a.m. to tell him
that Elian had been taken from the Miami home and was on his way to
a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous happiness here _ a great deal of emotion
we are feeling here,'' Juan Gonzalez said. He said Juan Miguel told
him he was ``very happy and a little nervous'' about his first
encounter with Elian after five months.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor said people gathered in the streets to share the news
but were now ``calmly waiting for what is going to happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no spontaneous celebrations in Havana. Such displays
are rare in a country that has no law guaranteeing freedom of
assembly. But markets, bus stops, parks and other gathering places,
nevertheless, were abuzz with the news though many wondered just
when Elian would return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took him out!'' a friend passing on a bike called to
Abdul Hernandez, as he waved back from his perch on a park bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, my friend, this news makes us very happy,'' Hernandez
said turning to a visitor. ``After how many months? Five. The
United States is the most powerful country in the world, and they
could not do this sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor other residents seem fazed by the forceful manner
in which Elian was removed, a source of boiling anger in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There even seemed a bit of glee, as Cuba's two television
stations, which are state-run, broadcast CNN footage of Marisleysis
and Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's cousin and great-uncle in Miami,
weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw the face of betrayal and defeat of Lazaro
Gonzalez,'' said the commentator sitting in front of a large poster
of Elian's face behind a fence, with the caption: ``Return our
boy!''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban television by midmorning began broadcasting footage of the
raid, the demonstrations in Miami, Attorney General Janet Reno's
news conference translated in to Spanish, and by late morning, the
news that the boy and father had been reunited.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have said Elian will not be paraded, and will
live with classmates, relatives and doctors in a government-owned
Havana house for at least a few months as a transition.

   DILI, East Timor _ There is not much question about the language
of commerce here as East Timor begins to define itself as a nation.
The muddy central market is alive with the cries of moneychangers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollar America! Dollar America! America, America, America,
America!''
</P>
<P>
   What is much less clear, however, and far more hotly emotional,
is the question of the actual spoken language of East Timor, a
question that goes to the heart of the self-definition of the
world's newest nation.
</P>
<P>
   Will it _ like the dollar _ be the language of the international
marketplace, English? Will it be the dominant local language,
Tetun, with its broad usage but limited vocabulary? Will it be the
historical colonial language, Portuguese, the sentimental favorite
of the older generation? Or will it be Indonesian, the common
language of the young and the educated?
</P>
<P>
   East Timor has not been on its own as a modern nation, its
history overlaid by more than 400 years of Portuguese colonialism
followed by 24 years of Indonesian occupation that ended last year.
</P>
<P>
   What will it keep from the past and what will it angrily
discard? What is Timorese and what is an unwelcome import by
foreign interlopers? What does it mean, as the nation emerges from
its shared trauma, to be Timorese?
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the answers lie in the choice of a national
language.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation is physically ruined and emotionally
traumatized, its people hungry and mostly jobless, it is the
question of language that sets off the angriest debates, hinting at
social divisions that lie not far below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Rough statistics show the breakdown. About 60 percent of the
population speaks Tetun (which is sometimes called Tetum). As many
as 90 percent of people under 35 speak Indonesian, as do 40 percent
of those over 35. But just 10 percent speak Portuguese, almost all
of them in the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   After Indonesia's invasion in 1975, the clandestine East
Timorese leadership decided that the language of a future
independent nation would be Portuguese. After a generation of
struggle, these same leaders _ now middle-aged men _ have formally
announced that this will be the national language, in honor of
their country's past and of their own independence struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But their announcement has only spurred further debate, for it
would make linguistic outsiders of the great majority of East
Timorese, pushing them to the sidelines of national reconstruction.
Those most affected would be the people most vital to building a
nation, young people with education and skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 24 years they forced us to learn Indonesian,'' said Helder
Luis Pires, 25, a university student, speaking in Indonesian. ``Now
the political leaders want to force us to speak Portuguese. If they
continue to do that there will be a big conflict between the young
and old generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Lopes, 22, another student, agreed. ``Europe is awfully
far away,'' he said. ``And take a look at Europe. Even there,
almost nobody speaks Portuguese. Who are we going to talk to?''
</P>
<P>
   To promote its language, Portugal has sent a contingent of
language teachers to offer courses here, but this only makes some
of the young people angrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to work, not to study language,'' said Ivete
de Oliveira, 25, a pro-independence activist who, like 20,000 other
Timorese over the past 24 years, studied in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We object,'' she said, speaking in English. ``They don't
respect us and they don't respect our education. In the future who
will handle the country? The future is in the hands of the youth.
But they are from the '75 generation and they don't think about us.
Using Portuguese means they will control the government and there
will be no place for us.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It was not the Indonesian language that traumatized
us. Maybe the Indonesians did, but not their language. Their
language has made us more rich, and in the future we will have
close relations with Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   If Portuguese does become the national language, an entire
nation will need to convert itself linguistically, starting with
schoolchildren who will be taught in a language most of their
parents do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the rules, the court system will for the time being
operate in Indonesian. All the nation's lawyers were trained in
Indonesia, and until a new legal code is written, a modified form
of Indonesian law will apply.
</P>
<P>
   If the new Timorese government is determined to rid all vestiges
of the Indonesian occupation and teach everybody a new common
language, some people argue, then why not go all the way and learn
the world's international language, English?
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramos Horta, a longtime independence propagandist, has an
answer: ``English is a commodity, not a culture.''

NEWS PHOTOGRAPH IN GONZALEZ CASE SPARKS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early television coverage of the Elian Gonzalez situation relied
heavily on a photograph by The Associated Press that quickly became
a focal point in the debate over whether the Justice Department had
used excessive force when it removed the boy from the Miami home of
his relatives early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph showed a federal agent in green riot gear and
goggles carrying a machine gun and facing off against a
frightened-looking man who was holding Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Donato Dalrymple, one of the fisherman who rescued the
child in the Atlantic Ocean on Nov. 25, appears to be cowering in
the doorway of a closet in the Miami home of the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno
was asked to address the photograph, which was being shown on ABC,
CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox News Channel and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the beauties of television is that it shows exactly
what the facts are,'' Reno said. ``And as I understand it, if you
look at it carefully, it shows that the gun was pointed to the
side, and that the finger was not on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the early hours of the television coverage at least one
network, CNN, seemed to have cropped the photograph so that
Dalrymple was not visible, making it look as if the federal agent
was facing only Elian. Later, the full photograph was shown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for CNN said there ``was no editorial decision''
to crop Dalrymple out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph was taken by Alan Diaz, a free-lance photographer
for The AP. Diaz said he had been standing in the yard of the house
next to the Gonzalez home when the federal agents arrived. He said
he jumped over a chain-link fence and ran into the house, where he
was guided into the bedroom where the boy was being held.

AT EXTRA-SPECIAL TIME, JUBILATION IN JAMMED ROME
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS spelling of ``Pilate'' in 8th graf) 
By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ After walking 4,350 miles to Rome wearing a brown
traveler's cape and Tyrolean hat, and with a shell, the traditional
pilgrim's symbol, hanging from his neck, Walter Weigand, 53, stared
in disbelief at the huge crowd of less road-weary pilgrims milling
around him on St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not pilgrims,'' he said indignantly as he clutched a
staff trimmed with olive branches. ``They get off a bus then walk
300 feet to the church. That's just tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weigand, who quit his job as a waiter in Berlin last
September to undertake a medieval-style pilgrimage to honor the
church's Jubilee year, stopping at shrines from Santiago de
Compostela in Spain to the Vatican, was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the estimated 500,000 Roman Catholics who have
flocked to Rome to celebrate Holy Week, which began on Palm Sunday
and ends at Easter, came on foot. But beneath a shiny veneer of
modern comfort and efficiency _ Internet-ready visitors' centers,
air-conditioned Jubilee buses, microchip-equipped pilgrim cards
that automatically book church services, tours and restaurants,
chemical toilets and electric votive candles _ the Holy Year 2000
is laced with the kind of humble piety and awe that drew the first
Jubilee pilgrims here in 1300.
</P>
<P>
   Faith, and an almost giddy determination, drove 51 pilgrims from
Brazil to race straight from the airport to St. Peter's on Thursday
evening so they would not miss the Mass in which Pope John Paul II
washed and kissed the feet of 12 priests, a ritual he does every
Holy Thursday to recall Christ washing the feet of his apostles.
</P>
<P>
   Faith made a group of 32 pilgrims from Moldova _ 20 Eastern
Orthodox and 12 Catholic believers who traveled by bus for two days
and two nights _ skip dinner so they could pray outside the
Colosseum while the pope carried the cross during the Good Friday
re-enactment of Christ's passion.
</P>
<P>
   And faith got Gerri Ann Slaton of Tampa, Fla., up early on
Friday to walk on her knees up a flight of cold, damp stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, I said to myself, `I'm not going to climb
that,' but God told me, `Yes, you are.' And I did,'' Slaton, 62,
said, still slightly out of breath from climbing the Scala Santa, a
holy staircase that believers say was fashioned from the floors
that Jesus trod on while being interrogated by Pontius Pilate in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   She and 40 other Catholics from Tampa and Jacksonville were on a
pilgrimage to Rome and Medjugorje, a shrine in Bosnia where
believers say apparitions of the Virgin still occur. ``Rome is a
little fast-paced, but oh my, to kneel on the steps that Christ
walked on,'' she said, her eyes welling up. ``You know, I never
thought I would get to Rome, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed in 700 years. ``Medieval pilgrims used to
come to Rome for spiritual and medical care,'' said Herbert L.
Kessler, a professor of art history at Johns Hopkins University who
just finished a book on the first Jubilee in 1300. ``The popes
built pilgrims' hospitals like San Giovanni that are still working
today. They still come for spiritual reasons. Piety cannot be
overlooked _ these are believers, not tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope Boniface VIII summoned pilgrims to Rome in 1300 when the
Crusades failed and travel to the Holy Land became too dangerous.
Jubilee is a Catholic term derived from the Hebrew word yobel, a
law handed down by Moses requiring that slaves be freed and debts
forgiven every 50 years. (Since 1475, Jubilees have been scheduled
every 25 years, improving each pope's chance of presiding over a
Holy Year.)
</P>
<P>
   Pope Boniface lured pilgrims accustomed to traveling to shrines
like Santiago de Compostela in Spain, where the pilgrims of the
Canterbury Tales were headed, to Rome by offering an indulgence, a
remittance on punishment for sins. (Legend has it that Martin
Luther, whose disapproval of the selling of indulgences led to the
16th-century Reformation, first balked at what he viewed as impious
superstition while climbing the Scala Santa.)
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, John Paul II has broadened the paths to an
indulgence. They can be earned in any of Rome's main basilicas (and
even the chapel at the Rome airport) as well as cathedrals and
churches around the world throughout the Jubilee Year.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic tradition, 2,000 years of Christian history, and
the lure of this pope are expected to bring as many as 20 million
Catholics to Rome and other holy sites in Italy throughout the
year, the largest Jubilee ever held by the Vatican. Easter, the day
on which tradition says that Christ was resurrected, is one of the
holiest days on the Roman Catholic calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The city's efforts to accommodate _ and streamline _ the traffic
of religious visitors from all over the world has prompted less
reverent comments from hoteliers, souvenir sellers, shopkeepers and
tour operators. They complain bitterly that a city ban on tour
buses in the center of Rome has driven many ordinary tourists, and
even some pilgrims, to cancel reservations and stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who want to go from St. Peter's to other basilicas or
the Colosseum this year must board special blue Jubilee shuttle
buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot get a group of 40 elderly people onto one of the
buses,'' Ira Levin, 65, owner of Italia Esoterica, a tour agency,
complained. ``It's logistically impossible. It's created a whole
hullabaloo in the tourist industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that, however, is not really new. Dante, who wrote the
Divine Comedy shortly after the 1300 Jubilee, mentioned Holy Year
organizational zeal in his ``Inferno'' by likening the system for
streamlining some sinners in hell to Romans' efforts to organize
pedestrian traffic. There were some breakdowns, however. In 1450,
masses of pilgrims leaving a papal blessing mobbed the only bridge
over the Tiber and 200 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year mishaps have been minor. Lost wallets, stolen
passports, and the occasional lost pilgrim have been reported to
Jubilee volunteers and visitors' centers. Pilgrims mainly seem
startled by Rome's chaotic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Burgess, 64, of Tampa marveled at the sight of so many
priests and nuns on the street, and the nonchalance with which they
were treated by Roman drivers. ``I saw a car almost run over Bishop
Foley,'' she said, referring to Archbishop John Foley, an American
Vatican official. ``My gosh, he had to jump out of the way,'' she
recalled.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Lodging has been plentiful _ for most. Jubilee government funds
were used to refurbish hotels all over the city, and the Vatican
converted schools and convents into pilgrims' hostels, with rooms
costing as little as $25 a night. The Florida group, benefiting
from a package tour rate, stayed at the posh Hotel Columbus next to
St. Peter's. The Moldovans were assigned rooms at a Dominican
convent just inside the city limits. Like other poor pilgrims, they
were given free lunch boxes by a special papal charity.
</P>
<P>
   But employees at a Jubilee visitors' center near the Vatican
said they noticed that little planning had been made for lodging
poor pilgrims who show up without reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get a lot of them, but solitary pilgrims turn up, and
we can't send them to a homeless shelter, and they can't afford a
hotel,'' Christian Benedati, 28, said. ``I called one convent on my
list for a young German pilgrim, and they wouldn't take him. They
said he wasn't Italian, he wasn't a priest, and he couldn't pay.''
He added, ``I think he ended up sleeping on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims, however, do not complain. ``Rome feels like a
festival,'' said Vitaly Tsurcanou, 46, a textbook editor from
Kishinev, Moldova, elated as he stood outside St. Peter's. ``It's a
city, but it smells of country flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   An Eastern Orthodox believer who said he found his faith reading
Mikhail Bulgakov's novel ``The Master and Margarita,'' came to
Rome, he said, because it was holy to all Christians. ``This is a
such a blessing to be here. It's something I thought I would only
do in my dreams.''

<P>
   Guerrillas and the cocaine trade batter Colombia. A strongman
rides roughshod over a discredited Congress and courts in
Venezuela. Ecuador reels from an economic crisis and a coup.
Bolivia has just emerged from a state of siege. And Peru awaits an
election between an autocrat accused of trying to steal the
presidency and a political firebrand.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it seems as if all the Andes are in tumult. Recent
events have exposed fractures in each society, some old and some
new, and one Wall Street firm has gone so far as to warn its
clients that the region is becoming ``the Balkans of Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil is no stranger to the region, which has had more than
its share of dictators, guerrilla movements and economic crises.
But the current discontent is being generated less by conflict over
the type of government countries should have than the quality.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy has been ascendant in the region for a decade, but the
longing for more representative and responsive governance is
greater now among the region's 100 million people than ever before,
experts say. That aspiration increasingly bumps up against
governments that have been unable to provide an equitable sharing
of power and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing these countries have in common,'' said Michael
Shifter of the Washington-based research group Inter-American
Dialogue, ``is deterioration and decay in the quality and
performance of institutions, in their inability to produce the
results that people demand and will respect.''
</P>
<P>
   While cautioning against ``the trap of talking about an Andean
virus,'' Shifter warned, ``There is something going on that is not
supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   These problems are most visible in Peru and Venezuela. After
years of ineffectual governance, both countries _ first Peru with
Alberto Fujimori in 1990 and then Venezuela with Hugo Chavez in
1998 _ elected political outsiders who promised sweeping democratic
changes.
</P>
<P>
   But in each case the line between overhauling the institutions
of democracy and usurping them altogether became quickly blurred by
men who have shown authoritarian tendencies. The challenge now _
particularly with each country facing elections in coming weeks _
is to reassert where that border is. That may mean voting the men
out of power and vigorously protesting any attempt at fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation in Ecuador, where the government has been
headed toward a total collapse, may be even more acute. It has had
five presidents from various parties over the last four years and
not one has been able to deliver the political and economic
stability that citizens crave. Now, as a desperation measure, the
government has adopted the dollar as Ecuador's currency.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Jamil Mahuad was overthrown in an uprising
jointly organized by disgruntled colonels and Indian leaders, who
for generations have felt excluded from the political and economic
life of their country but have had little opportunity to change
their circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The military coup was the first to succeed in Latin America in
more than a decade. Though it ended with the army installing a
civilian leader _ the country's vice president, Gustavo Noboa _ the
action sent a strong signal through the region that soldiers may
yet be tempted to short-circuit democratic governments they
consider corrupt or ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Ecuador, in all five Andean countries, long-simmering
feelings of political and economic exclusion have begun to boil
over in populations that are at the same time susceptible to
charismatic political figures who offer a bold new path, one that
sometimes tempts citizens with undemocratic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutional vacuum is the real problem,'' said Eduardo
Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at
Florida International University in Miami. ``The lack of
leadership, the inability of parties to throw up new candidates,
and the absence of formal linkages to the population is really
striking and very, very worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Each country has sought its own kind of savior. When Peruvians
first looked to Fujimori a decade ago, he was elected in a break
from the traditional political parties, which had failed to control
debilitating terrorism and hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Peruvians are considering Alejandro Toledo, a business
school professor who is offering a surprisingly strong challenge to
Fujimori, forcing a runoff election that must take place by June.
Toledo has promised to resuscitate democratic institutions, like
the Congress and judiciary, smothered under Fujimori's heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Bolivia, Gen. Hugo Banzer, who was the country's dictator in
the 1970s, was voted into power in 1997 pledging to fight
corruption, eradicate coca production and modernize the state. His
return clearly demonstrated how democratic aspirations still mingle
with the lingering desire for a firm hand.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same can be said of Chavez in Venezuela, a cashiered
army colonel who last year assumed the very office he tried to gain
in a coup seven years earlier. While he now promises a ``peaceful
social revolution,'' a number of signs suggest that he intends to
concentrate power in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   While Chavez's attacks on Venezuela's constitution, Congress and
courts have resonated overwhelmingly with Venezuelans, his attempts
to forge an all-powerful presidency have not. Instead, they are
generating growing suspicion of an equally grave threat to the
country's democracy and have led to the unexpected emergence of a
rival in the presidential vote set for May 28, from a former
comrade in arms and fellow coup plotter, Francisco Arias Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Now Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, seems to be trying to
take advantage of the same discontent. Faced with twin plagues of
Marxist guerrillas and drug trafficking, he is proposing a summer
referendum to dissolve the Congress, seen by most Colombians as
corrupt and inefficient, and replace it with what he pitches as a
streamlined and more responsive body.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana, whose own popularity has been slipping, may be too
late to capitalize on such sentiment. The apparent front-runner in
the presidential election, now two years off, is Noemi Sanin,
leader of a non-party movement called Colombia Yes, who is sounding
many of the themes that have proved so appealing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colombia the state is not operating,'' Sanin, a former
foreign minister, told the newsmagazine Semana. ``We do not want to
participate in the sterile fights and embraces between which the
traditional parties alternate while they carve up bureaucratic
spoils and the national budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in each country points to a regional crisis that
is first and foremost political, where the urgent need for more
effective government converges with the desire that those
governments be democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking recent example was in Peru. ``What I saw was a
rejection of the imposition of a regime that said, `We'll do what
we want,''' Enrique Zileri Gibson, editor of Caretas, Peru's
leading magazine, said of the protesters who took to the streets
after Fujimori was accused of trying to steal a presidential
election two weeks ago and chanted, ``Democracy yes,
authoritarianism no!''
</P>
<P>
   But the region's severe economic and social problems cannot be
ignored. The smaller Andean countries are so hard-pressed that
Bolivia's attempt to levy a 20 percent increase in water rates this
month provoked a response so violent that Banzer dusted off his old
autocratic tools and declared a state of siege. High unemployment
rates have worsened and expanded the already huge informal sector
of these economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest growth sector of society, but no one is
speaking for them,'' Gamarra said. ``The problem is that because
they are so tenuously tied to the system, with no unemployment
insurance, health care or social security, they will vote for
whoever promises a wonderful reform.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, that excluded economic class coincides with
the Indian and mestizo, or mixed race, population, and those people
of indigenous descent are becoming more dissatisfied and assertive,
especially as they move from village to city.
</P>
<P>
   The coup in Ecuador was the clearest indication of this
discontent. Another is the rise of Toledo and even, to some extent,
Chavez. Both have strongly Indian features and a mestizo appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of this new type of leader is striking in a region
where politicians have traditionally tended to be upper class,
lighter skinned and of purer Spanish descent, and where many
questions born in colonialism and surrounding ethnic identity,
language and culture have remain unresolved for 500 years.

   DIGITAL-SIGNATURES _ WASHINGTON _ Whether done with the flourish

electronic commerce will never reach its full potential unless
people can complete a contract by using a computer to ``sign'' and
send legally binding documents. To speed the development of
e-commerce, Congress is now in the final stages of writing
legislation that would give consumers and business owners the
ability to close deals using ``digital signatures.'' (Geewax, Cox

science of using electronic sensors and computer programs to detect

charismatic opposition candidate. Should Fox win, our neighbor next
door would have the first president from a different party in seven
decades. The rivalry is razor sharp. Fox, running strong against

   CoxNet FOCUS 0422: PAST IN PERIL _ As the oldest archaeological
site in the world, Pompeii provides an unsettling glimpse of what
can happen when the past is unearthed with no plan for the future.
Since the ruins were discovered in 1748, more than two-thirds of
the 163 acres within the city's walls have been unearthed. Block by
block, Italian, French, British and American archaeologists have
peeled away the 30-foot-deep layer of volcanic ash. Today, more
than 1,500 of Pompeii's buildings and 215,000 square feet of
frescoed walls, resplendent with everything from a Venus in a
seashell to portraits of the city's rich and famous, stand exposed.
To the sun. To the rain. To fast-growing vines. And to 2 million
visitors whose fascination with the ruins is hastening their
destruction. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   DIGITAL-SIGNATURES _ WASHINGTON _ Whether done with the flourish
of a quill spelling out ``John Hancock,'' or with a simple pencil
scratching out an ``X,'' Americans have long used their signatures
to seal a deal. But in the age of the Internet, business owners say
electronic commerce will never reach its full potential unless
people can complete a contract by using a computer to ``sign'' and
send legally binding documents. To speed the development of
e-commerce, Congress is now in the final stages of writing
legislation that would give consumers and business owners the
ability to close deals using ``digital signatures.'' (Geewax, Cox

 &HT;    `Once and Again' far from sappy, close to brilliant
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A few weeks ago, I was on the phone with
a publicist for HBO. After we chatted at length about ``The
Sopranos,'' we turned our attention to other TV shows we like and
don't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you watch `Once and Again'?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, it's too sappy,'' the publicist said. ``I saw the first
two episodes and stopped watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I told her that was a mistake. A big one, in fact.
Not only is ``Once and Again,'' whose season finale airs Monday,
far from sappy, it remains TV's best new drama. Calm down, ``West
Wing'' fans. NBC's political drama comes in a close second.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is definitely convinced it has a gem of a program. The
network picked up ``Once and Again'' for next season. While not a
runaway hit, the series averages a respectable 11 million viewers
each week. It also averages a 5.5 rating among adults 18-49, making
it the top-rated new drama in that key demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Although I disagreed with the publicist, I understood her
argument. If not handled properly, ``Once and Again'' could've
turned into a mushy lovefest. After all, the first few episodes
only dealt with Rick (a boyishly handsome Billy Campbell) and Lily
(a downright delectable Sela Ward) going at each other like two
love-starved teens. But that storyline would've turned stale fast.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the show's forward-thinking producers
(``thirtysomething's'' Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick) didn't
turn ``Once and Again'' into ``The Rick &AMP; Lily Show.'' The writers
also fleshed out the show's co-stars, turning them into
three-dimensional human beings we can relate to. In fact, in many
episodes, Campbell and Ward are more like supporting players on
their own show.
</P>
<P>
   If the publicist had kept watching ``Once and Again,'' she
would've learned, for instance, that Eli (Shane West) has problems
reading. Grace (an outstanding Julia Whelan) has a crush on a black
classmate. Karen (Susanna Thompson) struggles to have fun with her
much younger boyfriend. Judy's (Marin Hinkle) having an affair with
a married man (``West Wing's'' Steven Weber). Lily and Jake
(Jeffrey Nordling) continue to battle severe financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   She also missed watching a heartbroken Grace sob uncontrollably
after learning of her dad's affair. Best of all, she didn't see the
gut-wrenching episode in which Lily's overprotective dad (Paul
Mazursky) died of a stroke. That still remains the season's finest
television hour.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't sappy stories. Far from it. Even jaded TV critics
understand that. What ``Once and Again'' does so consistently well
is give us a realistic peek inside an American family. We see their
joys. Sorrows. Triumphs. Heartaches.
</P>
<P>
   And we love to see their stories ... once and again.

 &HT;    What fueled Wallace's fire?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With his jutting chin and cocky strut, George
Wallace always looked like a bantam rooster scratching for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was standing in a schoolhouse door symbolically
blocking integration or taunting hippie demonstrators who were
taunting him, Wallace defied the politics of convention.
</P>
<P>
   The former boxer with the combative political style came to
symbolize racial hatred in the '60s and '70s, but his life and
career were never that simple _ a point proved with remarkable
skill and insight in ``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire.''
Artfully blending archival footage with revelatory interviews, the
film turns Wallace's strange journey into a fascinating cautionary
tale about power and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who watch PBS's two-part presentation of this
award-winning documentary may be surprised to learn that Wallace
started his career as a liberal judge in Alabama, championing the
poor regardless of color. But after he was defeated in a run for
governor by a hate-spewing segregationist, Wallace quickly ditched
progressive politics. When he was inaugurated as governor in 1963,
he sent forth the chilling battle cry,'' ... segregation now,
segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole film is about the consequences of using any means
for political ends,'' says filmmaker Paul Stekler, head of the
production unit at the University of Texas radio-television-film
department. ``Wallace was willing to say almost anything to win,
and that affected who he was as human being, as well as politics
and the political process. There's a lot to learn from his
success.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's good that education-minded PBS is affording the film
that was such a hit at the Sundance Film Festival a larger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing it at film festivals, but we could play every
festival and not reach a fraction of the audience on PBS,'' Stekler
says. ``If a lot of people don't see it, why do it?''
</P>
<P>
   The question that wafts through the three-hour film, which
Stekler and his producing partner Daniel McCabe worked on for 2 1/2
years, is haunting: Was Wallace a decent man corrupted by his lust
for power or an evil racist from the get-go? Viewers will have to
weigh the evidence from witness accounts on both sides of the
question
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Wallace's core beliefs, it's almost impossible not
to be disgusted by the governor's willingness to fan the flames of
racism for his own gain. But it's equally impossible not to feel
some compassion for him in his later years, crippled by an
assassination attempt and seeking forgiveness from the same black
leaders who had been attacked with fire hoses and police dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe millions of Americans didn't buy Wallace's repentance, but
many black people did. The point is poignantly made in the film by
civil rights leader John Lewis' recollection of a phone
conversation during which Wallace tearfully apologized. Lewis is
convinced the mea culpa came from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, as narrator Randy Quaid puts it, the rest of us are
left to wonder if Wallace was ``cramming for death'' or sincere in
his quest for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Among those interviewed by Stekler and McCabe are reporters who
covered Wallace as an Alabama politician and as a national crusader
for ``states rights''; political henchmen, such as Seymore Trammel;
Wallace's children, Peggy and George, Jr.; his second wife
Cornelia; civil rights lawyer J.L. Chestnut; and former Nixon
speechwriter and presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising statements in the film comes from
Buchanan, who declares that if Wallace had not been handicapped
when he ran for president in '76, Jimmy Carter wouldn't have been
elected. Buchanan also says, without hesitation, ``In many ways,
the man was right.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is so powerful in image and words that it almost
doesn't need decoration, but original music by Mason Daring and
Duke Levine adds a haunting quality to the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settin' the Woods on Fire'' is a drama of Shakespearean
proportions that is all the more powerful because it is truth
rather than fiction.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Growth hormone taps fountain of youth, doctor
says
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You are not getting older. You are,
however, diseased.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jordan K. Davis says so.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. He thinks he can help. All Davis requires is that
you open your mind and wallet to the notion that you can live much
longer if only medicine would tackle aging with the same clinical
veracity it now reserves for cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Davis is working on it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Davis founded the American Anti-Aging Foundation,
the money-raising and research umbrella over his Integrative
Medicine Institutes of Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks boosting your human growth hormone _ by injection, if
necessary _ will help you live longer with better vision, less hair
loss and the sexual prowess of a much younger you.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is now a proponent of research into unproved
anti-aging theories, Davis has long been a respected member of the
mainstream medical community here. He is a retired neurosurgeon
still listed on the staff of Boca Raton Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He said doctors focus on treating acute conditions at the
expense of prevention, adding that he knows why:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was an active surgeon, people came to me with a brain
tumor and I took it out,'' he said. ``Most physicians don't have
time for prevention. They're too busy.''
</P>
<P>
   In all his years of delicate brain surgeries, Davis might have
never struck a nerve so raw as the one he unearthed with the
foundation's first-ever public event, a free seminar in March at
Boca Raton Community Hospital entitled ``Anti-aging 2000: Healthy
Longevity Can Be Yours.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people clamored for a seat in the educational
theater. The crowd spilled out of the auditorium and into a break
room where events were televised via closed circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the presenters: Dr. Boyd Haley, chair of the department of
chemistry at the University of Kentucky, and Dr. Terry Grossman, a
former assistant clinical professor at the University of Colorado
School of Medicine and author of ``The Baby Boomers' Guide to
Living Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience came as much out of frustration with their old
doctors as respect for new ones in the growing field of
``anti-aging,'' a term applied to therapies including nutritional
supplements and hormone replacement.
</P>
<P>
   THE POWER OF HEALING
</P>
<P>
   Allan Wasserman is a practicing veterinarian. He and his wife,
Kandi, are avid believers in the power of vitamins and supplements.
That is why they came to hear Davis speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago my wife had breast cancer and they only gave
her five years to live,'' Wasserman said, adding that his
68-year-old wife combs books and the Internet for the latest home
remedies. ``I don't care if it's mysticism or what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For many in the audience that night, the most intriguing aspect
of the new science is the prospect of a better life through
replenished human growth hormone, or hGH.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of hGH as an anti-aging miracle is 10 years old. It began
as a whisper published July 5, 1990, in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rudman, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, wrote
healthy men given hGH in his study gained 8.8 percent muscle mass
and lost 14 percent of their fat. He suggested that his subjects
also improved their eyesight, hair growth, sex drive, skin
elasticity, mood and sleep. Industry officials say treatment costs
about $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone is produced in the pituitary gland and
responsible for a wide range of youthful attributes. First
available only from human cadavers, hGH was scarce and used to
treat children with severe pituitary gland dysfunction. It was
first synthesized in 1985, leading researchers to begin looking for
other uses.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, hGH levels drop off dramatically by the age of
30. Proponents of anti-aging medicine say that is a major reason we
grow old.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the leading proponent of this hGH therapy, American
Academy of Anti-Aging, boasts 8,400 members and produces a Web site
(www.worldhealth.net) that claims 200,000 hits every month.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he has two patients receiving injections of hGH and
many others who take dietary supplements designed to enhance hGH
levels without injections.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old doctor said he is tired of waiting for the
sluggish response of most of the medical profession. And he is
unfazed by criticism from colleagues who suggest, as Hippocrates
did more than 2,000 years ago, that first a physician must do no
harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't care,'' he said of such rebukes. ``This is a whole new
paradigm of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one noted bioethicist cautions that new paradigms
should be approached carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Goodman, the director of the University of Miami's
bioethics program, noted because hGH makes things grow, there is
reason to believe pre-existing cancer cells would also flourish
under such therapy. Also, high levels of hGH have caused over-grown
internal organs and the cave-man like appearance noted in steroid
misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disclosure is critical. Life-extension science is about 20
minutes old. Look how long we have been studying cancer and we
still don't have all those answers,'' Goodman said. ``There needs
to be an accurate disclosure of the risks involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Roos, director of the aging center at the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Miami and head of geriatric medicine at
the University of Miami, finds agreement with both colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe eventually hormone therapy will help us grow young
again,'' Roos said.
</P>
<P>
   He is also sympathetic to Davis' argument that the medical
establishment prefers to treat acute conditions rather than prevent
them.
</P>
<P>
   But Roos agrees with Goodman, too, saying that time for
widespread hormone treatment is not yet at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is not there,'' he said. ``The precise hormone
prescription is a very big challenge and it will take a very long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis wants that work to begin now. And he plans to use an
unusual key to unlock the mystery of aging:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to address aging as a disease,'' he said. ``It is a
complex disease, of course, involving all of the systems of the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman and Roos bristled at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is aging but an increase in the probability that we will
die?'' asked Roos. ``And why do we age? Because we are human.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman puts it this way: ``It's an interesting philosophical
question. Cancer is a disease. Is male pattern baldness a disease?
Is being short a disease?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me if everybody gets it _ and everybody in the
history of time has gotten old _ then it's not a disease.''

 &HT;    Hunting for Easter egg ancestors
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Meet the Bumens: Albert and Alice and
their children, Alvin and Allie. They're a regular, happy family _
nothing exceptional or extraordinary about them.
</P>
<P>
   They live on Hennypenny Lane in a cozy home that Albert fondly
refers to as ``The Nest.'' Each morning, after a hearty breakfast
of bacon and toast, Alice sends the kids off to school _ with an
admonition not to run and to make sure their shoelaces are tied _
and Albert to his job as an executive for Elmer's Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings, after dinner is eaten and the dishes are
done, the family enjoys gathering in the back yard. Alvin and Allie
roll down the hill, Albert and Alice work in the garden and the
whole family laughs and tells jokes. These are excellent times for
the Bumen family.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's one thing the Bumens love, it's genealogy. They
love to examine their roots, explain where they came from. It's
exhilarating to discover an exotic ancestor, and though the
research can be exhausting at times, it's exciting, too.
</P>
<P>
   ALICE TELLS A BIT OF HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   Why, just the other day Alice was exploring the Internet and she
found out the family is related to royalty _ Easter Egg. This is
what she learned:
</P>
<P>
   Before eighth-century English historian Venerable Bede reported
the origins of Easter _ named for Eostre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess
of spring _ as a mixture of pagan celebrations of spring, the
Hebrew Passover and Christian observance of Jesus Christ's death
and resurrection, many cultures were using eggs to symbolize the
spring holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Roman, Gaul, Chinese, Egyptian and Persian cultures looked at
the egg as a symbol of the universe. Some cultures believed the
world began with an egg: A great egg broke in half to form the
earth with the yolk for the sun. Eggs were colored, painted,
adorned and exchanged as gifts, and were shown great reverence as
symbols of fertility. To pagans, eggs represented the rebirth of
the earth each spring and were believed to have special powers.
Eggs were buried in the foundations of buildings to ward off evil,
French brides stepped on an egg before crossing the threshold of
their new homes and pregnant Roman women carried an egg in their
clothes to foretell the sex of their unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of Christianity, the spring observances of
different cultures blended into Christian observance and Christian
symbolism. The egg came to represent not nature's rebirth, but the
rebirth of man, likening it to the tomb from which Christ rose.
</P>
<P>
   Historians debate when people first began decorating eggs for
Easter, though legends abound. An old Polish legend says that the
Virgin Mary gave eggs to the soldiers at the foot of Christ's
cross, weeping as she begged them to be less cruel. Her tears fell
on the eggs and dotted them with spots of bright color. Another
Polish legend says Mary Magdalene went to the sepulchre where
Christ's body was laid to anoint the body. She took with her a
basket of eggs for a meal, and when she got to the sepulchre and
uncovered the eggs she discovered the shells were tinted with
brilliant rainbow colors.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating eggs for Easter was a popular custom in England
during the Middle Ages. For the year 1290, the household accounts
of Edward I report an expenditure of 18 pence for 450 eggs to be
colored and gold-leafed for Easter gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Peter Carl Faberge made the decorating of eggs an art,
and was famous for crafting eggs of platinum, gold and enamel and
decorating them with jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many who celebrate Easter dye eggs and hide them for
children to find.
</P>
<P>

Easter Symbols'' by Edna Barth)
</P>
<P>
   ALLIE BREAKS DOWN FACTS ABOUT EGGS
</P>
<P>
   Alice was exuberant when she learned this fascinating piece of
family history. When Albert and the kids got home, she met them at
the door and explained the story to them. They could barely express
their joy.
</P>
<P>
   Then Allie stepped forward with some interesting news of her
own: ``Today in social studies we talked about our extended
family!'' she exclaimed. ``I was so excited!'' This is what she
learned:
</P>
<P>
   _ A hen requires 24 to 26 hours to produce an egg. Thirty
minutes later, she starts all over again.
</P>
<P>
   _ The egg shell may have as many as 17,000 tiny pores over its
surface. Through them, the egg can absorb flavors and odors.
Storing them in their cartons helps keep them fresh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eggs age more in one day at room temperature than in one week
in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 240 million laying hens produce approximately 5.5
billion dozen eggs per year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ The high point for per capita egg consumption _ a measure of
total U.S. egg production divided by the total population _ was in
1945 with 402 eggs per person per year. Per capita egg consumption
has declined since then, with a low point of 235.7 in 1995 due to
the death of many laying hens as a result of extreme weather in the
Midwest. In 1999 the per capita consumption was 254.7 and was
forecast to be 256.4 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The top 10 egg-producing states are: Ohio, Iowa, California,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Minnesota, Georgia, Nebraska and
Florida. The top five egg-producing states represent approximately
50 percent of all U.S. layers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the United States there are 58 egg-producing companies with
1 million plus layers and 10 companies with more than 5 million
layers. There are approximately 318 egg-producing companies with
flocks of 75,000 hens or more. These 318 companies represent about
97 percent of all layers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ During the first eight months of 1999, U.S. table egg exports
totaled 24.9 million dozen and these exports earned a value of
$17.17 million. Top markets for U.S. shell eggs include Hong Kong
and Canada. Hong Kong imported more than 10.5 million dozen eggs
during the first eight months of 1999 with a value of $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ White-shelled eggs are produced by hens with white feathers
and ear lobes. Brown-shelled eggs are produced by hens with red
feathers and ear lobes.
</P>
<P>
   _ To tell if an egg is raw or hard-cooked, spin it. If the egg
spins easily, it is hard-cooked, but if it wobbles, it is raw.
</P>
<P>
   _ If an egg is accidentally dropped on the floor, sprinkle it
heavily with salt for easy cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   _ During the spring (vernal) equinox, it is said that an egg
will stand on its small end. Although some people have reported
success, it is not known whether such results were due to the
equinox or to the peculiarities of that particular egg.
</P>
<P>
   _ Egg yolks are one of the few foods that naturally contain
vitamin D.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yolk color depends on the diet of the hen. Naturally
yellow-orange substances, such as marigold petals, may be added to
light-colored feeds to enhance colors. Artificial color additives
are not permitted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Occasionally, a hen will produce double-yolked eggs throughout
her egg-laying career. It is rare, but not unusual, for a young hen
to produce an egg with no yolk at all.

<P>
   ALVIN'S TEACHER TAKES EGG-STRA TIME FOR Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   The Bumens oohed and aahed over this information, and felt
strangely close to all their second cousins in Ohio. It must have
been an interesting day at school for the Bumen children, because
Alvin told his family, when Allie was done sharing what she'd
learned, that in health education class the teacher had spent the
entire hour answering questions students had about what was going
on inside them. This is what he learned:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes blood spots?
</P>
<P>
   A: Small spots of blood, sometimes called meat spots, are
occasionally found in egg yolk. They do not indicate a fertile egg,
but are caused by the rupture of a blood vessel on the yolk surface
during the egg's formation. Most eggs with blood spots are removed
during the grading process, but a few may escape detection. As the
egg ages, water moves from the albumen into the yolk, diluting the
blood spot, so a visible blood spot indicates a fresh egg that is
suitable for consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do some hard-cooked eggs have a greenish ring around the
yolk?
</P>
<P>
   A: The greenish ring, which is harmless, is due to an iron and
sulfur compound that forms when eggs are overcooked or not cooled
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a difference between brown- and white-shelled eggs?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, because shell color is determined by the breed of hen and
is not related to quality, nutrients, flavor or cooking
characteristics. Since brown-egg layers are larger birds and need
more food, brown eggs usually are more expensive than white.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long will eggs keep?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fresh eggs can be kept refrigerated in their carton for at
least four to five weeks beyond the packing date. Hard-cooked eggs
can be kept in the refrigerator for up to one week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the best way to store eggs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Store eggs in their carton because eggs can absorb
refrigerator odors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are some hard-cooked eggs difficult to peel?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fresh eggs may be difficult to peel. Those that have been
stored for a week to 10 days before cooking will usually peel more
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the stringy white pieces in egg whites?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ropelike strands of egg white, called Chalazae, are not
imperfections or beginning embryos, but a natural, edible part of
the egg. They keep the yolk centered in the thick white.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is an egg white sometimes cloudy or has a yellow or
greenish cast?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cloudiness of raw white is due to the presence of carbon
dioxide that has not had time to escape through the shell and is an
indication of a very fresh egg. A slight yellow or greenish cast in
raw white may indicate the presence of riboflavin.

   ALBERT RELAYS YUMMY RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   Alvin finished and his family was impressed. Then Albert decided
it was time to share what he'd learned from a book he'd been
reading on the funeral rituals of their ancestors. Looking serious,
he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Deli mustard,'' said Sylvia Schafer, a deli clerk at Westside
Delicatessen &AMP; Lounge. ``That's what we use here. It really perks
up the filling (of devilled eggs) instead of just plain mayo.''
</P>
<P>
   With the preponderance of left-over hard-boiled eggs after
Easter, most people wonder what to do with them. And then they make
devilled eggs. It's the American way. Unfortunately, you get those
people who just scoop out the yolk, mix it with mayonnaise and plop
it back in the egg halves. There's a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said adding deli mustard to the yolk mix gives it ``a
little sharpness, a little pizazz.'' She also suggested adding
finely diced celery or onion to the mixture, then topping the
completed eggs with paprika, a small celery leaf or a sliced black
olive, ``something to give it a little color,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Engle of Big Leo's Catering favors keeping the devilled
eggs simple: ``A little bit of Miracle Whip, a little bit of
mustard, a little bit of vinegar,'' she explained. ``Cut the eggs
in half, get the yolk out, mash down the yolks, mix everything in
until you have a real good consistency and spoon it back into the
egg.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of each ingredient, as well as the type of vinegar
and mustard, depends on individual tastes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For unique devilled eggs, Marylou Lawson of Cowboy &AMP; the Rose
Catering LLC adds ranch dressing. ``It totally changes the whole
flavor of them,'' she said. She adds a little Miracle Whip, a
little mustard and the ranch dressing instead of vinegar, and the
devilled eggs are distinctive and creamy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also suggested using ranch dressing in egg salad instead of
vinegar. And for another way to use up those left-over Easter eggs,
she suggested slicing the eggs and putting them underneath the top
layer in lasagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the lasagne taste really, really good and it's
something different,'' she said. ``And it's a good way to use those
eggs up. It's like zucchini _ sometimes you've got to disguise
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Grand Mesa Eggs, producer of 13 million dozen eggs
per year, suggested the following recipes, each made with six eggs
and prepared in the normal devilled egg way:
</P>
<P>
   For Midwest Medley devilled eggs, add 1/3 cup minced carrots, 2
tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon minced fresh mushrooms, 1
tablespoon horseradish mustard, 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1/8
teaspoon salt.
</P>
<P>
   For Dairy Delight devilled eggs, add half of a 10-ounce package
of frozen spinach _ thawed, drained and pressed, 1/4 cup low-fat
cottage cheese, 2 tablespoons minced onion, 1 1/3 tablespoons milk,
1 1/4 teaspoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon crushed basil leaves, 1/4
teaspoon salt.
</P>
<P>
   To make Lively Latin devilled eggs, add 2 tablespoons undrained
canned chopped green chiles, 2 tablespoons drained canned whole
kernel corn, 2 tablespoons minced green onions with tops, 2
tablespoons shredded Monterey Jack cheese, 2 tablespoons taco
sauce, 1/8 teaspoon salt.
</P>
<P>
   For Orchard Fresh devilled eggs, add 2 tablespoons plain low-fat
yogurt, 1 tablespoon minced unpeeled red apple, 1 tablespoon minced
celery, 1 tablespoon finely chopped pecans, 1 tablespoon honey, 1
teaspoon lime juice, dashes of curry powder and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Also, to hard-cook an egg, the American Egg Board advises: Place
eggs single layer in a saucepan and add enough tap water to come at
least one inch above eggs. Cover the pan and quickly bring to a
boil. Turn off the heat and, if necessary, remove the pan from the
burner to prevent further boiling. Let the eggs stand, covered, in
the hot water for 15 to 17 minutes for large eggs. Adjust time up
or down by about three minutes for each size larger or smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The family thanked Albert for sharing this valuable information
on a topic that can be unappealing. They had a moment of silence in
honor of those who had gone before, then smiled at each other and
agreed that it's an exciting time to be an egg.

 &HT;    Gospel Music Week's sights and sounds
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ One of the main points of Gospel Music Week
is music. Retailers and media can see and hear music in the
morning, music in the evening, music at suppertime _ and into the
wee hours of the morning. Nobody can take it all in, but the
following stand out as trends and highlights:
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOW THE LEADER
</P>
<P>
   If mainstream music does it, Christian music won't be too far
behind. This year's most obvious trend are Backstreet Boys and
Britney Spears wannabes. The five-member Plus One seems to be
getting the biggest push among the guys, though the Jake trio from
Canada was working the media, too. Then there's Squirt, the oldest
member of which is 15. Aurora, Shine and Zoe Girl were some of the
female groups, but the best of the bunch may be VEnna, a U.K./U.S.
duo put together by Worldwide Message Tribe founder Mark Pennells.
</P>
<P>
   TOUCHDOWN!
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual venue for a late-night concert was the
exclusive Stadium Club at the Tennessee Titans' home field,
Adelphia Coliseum. Michael W. Smith's Rocketown Records threw a
``Night at Rocketown'' party there with Chris Rice, Ginny Owens,
Wayne Kirkpatrick, Watermark and Smitty himself, who announced his
plans to record that instrumental album he's been wanting to do for
years.
</P>
<P>
   GET READY
</P>
<P>
   You'll be hearing these names more in the year ahead: Rachel
Lampa, a teen who is being touted as the next best thing; Salvador,
a Latino group from Austin, Texas, that is an appealing mix of
Burlap to Cashmere and, of all things, Blood Sweat and Tears; Tree,
a South African trio with a terrific pop sound; Kendall Payne,
whose worthy ``Jordan's Sister'' debut was released by Capitol last
year but is now receiving a push from Sparrow; and 1NC (One Nation
Crew), Kirk Franklin's new group. This one, made up of black, white
and Latino men and women between ages 20 and 26, may be the best
thing Franklin's done yet.
</P>
<P>
   BLOWN AWAY
</P>
<P>
   Hands down the best performance of the week was by
Cincinnati-born Nicole C. Mullen. During the Word and Myrrh Radio
and Retailer Dinner at the Wildhorse Saloon, she sang ``Redeemer''
from her new self-titled release. Before the first verse was over,
people were dabbing at their eyes and hands were raised heavenward.
Prediction: This song is an early front-runner to be song of the
year at the 2001 Doves. Mullen, by the way, will be in Middletown
June 17 with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSBOY EXTRA
</P>
<P>
   Phil Joel, bass player for the Newsboys, has a solo project
called ``Watching Over You'' coming out in late June on Peter
Furler's Inpop label. He previewed it Thursday. It sounds a little
softer than the Newsboys but is definitely worth a listen.
</P>
<P>
   LOUD FOR THE LORD
</P>
<P>
   Worship music continues to explode in the gospel industry.
Sparrow hosted an ``Extreme Worship'' late-night show that included
Form and the Parachute Band. Both are from New Zealand but have
diverse styles. Form lets it rip with raucous abandon, while the
Parachute Band leans more toward a blend of hip-hop, R&AMP;B and dance
music.
</P>
<P>
   UPCOMING ROAR
</P>
<P>
   The most eclectic group of artists on a release this year is
likely to be those gathered for the Squint's ``Roaring Lambs,'' ``a
celebration of artists who have reached out to a world that needs
salt and light,'' as urged by the late author Bob Briner. Duets
pair artist of the year Steven Curtis Chapman and best songwriter
Smith; Ashley Cleveland and dc Talk's Michael Tait; and Ladysmith
Mambazo and Charlie Peacock. Also included are Burlap to Cashmere,
Delirious?, Over the Rhine, Sixpence None the Richer, Jars of Clay
and, the biggest surprise, a reunion of PFR. ``Roaring Lambs'' is
set for release late in May.

   WACO, Texas _ Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages
around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, ``Who do people
say I am?''
</P>
<P>
   They replied, ``Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah;
and still others, one of the prophets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about you?'' he asked. ``Who do you say I am?''
</P>
<P>
   Peter answered, ``You are the Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark 8:27-29 NIV
</P>
<P>
   If Jesus asked that question to his followers today, who would
they say he is? For some, spurred by new research and philosophical
debate, Jesus is no longer seen as the only way to salvation, but
instead as one of several spiritual leaders who point to eternal
life. Jesus, they say, is a teacher whose message of compassion
includes tolerance for other religions _ even those that do not
consider him the Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, there has been this enormous grass-roots
appetite for a different way of looking at Jesus,'' said Marcus
Borg, an author and professor of religion and culture at Oregon
State University and a scholar specializing in the study of Jesus.
``There's a passage in Hebrews that says Jesus is the same
yesterday, today and tomorrow. I think that's true, but the way we
think about Jesus is constantly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Christians believe the interpretation of Jesus'
teachings should not change over time.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ben Disney, senior minister at Central United Methodist
Church in Waco, said that as historians and theologians strip off
the layers of time to uncover the historical Jesus, they should not
strip away fundamental Christian tenets, namely, that belief in
Jesus as the son of God is the only path to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a litmus test of faith. Do we think of Jesus as a
good, moral, ethical teacher, or do we say he was the son of God
who died and was resurrected? Ultimately, we make our decisions
based on fundamental beliefs that are non-negotiable,'' Disney
said. ``It seems like in spirituality today, there is a
cafeteria-style approach. But at times, we ought not to apologize
for who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   PERCEPTIONS CHANGE WITH WORLD
</P>
<P>
   Never before has Jesus been so scrutinized, historically and
philosophically, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, seven books about Jesus have been
bestsellers, including Borg's ``Meeting Jesus Again for the First
Time.'' All three major American news magazines _ U.S. News and
World Report, Time and Newsweek _ have dealt with Jesus'
significance in the past five years. And in the next six weeks,
both CBS and ABC will air television programs about the life of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the discussion is the way Jesus is being
``humanized'' as his followers try to make his teachings fit
today's world, Borg said. This effort is part of people's natural
tendency to try to relate to someone they admire, said Garrett
Cook, associate professor of anthropology at Baylor University.
</P>
<P>
   For some, this means picturing Jesus, who has traditionally been
depicted by Christians as an Anglo man, in a more socially
acceptable way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the church, like every other institution, is
having to respond to culture change,'' Cook said. ``In America, we
have an increasing sense of being a multicultural society in ethnic
representation, in gender representations and in religious
representations.''
</P>
<P>
   Those changes are reflected in the way people see and understand
Jesus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DO YOU SEE HIM?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visual example of this is in the results of the
National Catholic Reporter magazine's Jesus 2000 contest. Last
year, the magazine asked people to depict how they thought the
Jesus of 2000 looks. More than 1,600 depictions were submitted, and
the winner was a painting of an African-American Jesus with some
feminine qualities and a look of sadness in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start to understand the debate about who Jesus
is is to examine him as a historical figure, Borg said. The more
people know about Jesus in a historical context, the better they
can understand what his words should mean today.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, theologians have looked at the New Testament
writings, but new writings discovered in recent years should also
be examined, Borg said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with focusing solely on the New Testament gospels is
that they may not be the earliest recordings of Jesus' teachings.
Some theologians believe there is a missing link between the Jewish
world that Jesus lived in and the way he was later interpreted by
the early Christian church.
</P>
<P>
   GOSPEL OF Q
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, an earlier gospel, the Sayings Gospel of Thomas, was
discovered. It referred to a book of Jesus' sayings written before
the four New Testament gospels. However, no complete version of
that book, The Gospel of Q, has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Borg said most scholars see the gospels as containing layers of
material. So by getting to the earliest gospels, they peel off the
layers into the earliest sources of who Jesus might have been. But
a deeper understanding of the historical figure of Jesus is only
part of the movement to redefine Jesus' teachings, Borg said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those searching for a new way of looking at Jesus are
doing so because they do not interpret the Bible as the literal
word of God, said Borg, who defines himself as a Christian. They
also think Jesus' teachings are not as relevant today as they were
in his time and culture, and they are struggling with the issue of
religious pluralism in Western culture today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   INQUISITIVE YOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Cox, a religion professor at Harvard University, said
young people in particular are searching for a new way to define
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who for two decades taught a course on Jesus and who spoke
in 1996 at a seminar called ``Jesus at 2000,'' said this younger
group of Christians has been exposed to more religions than people
in previous generations, and they are reluctant to accept that
there is only one ``true'' way to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bring the world's major faiths together, Pope
John Paul II took a historic journey to the Middle East last month
to visit holy sites of Christians, Jews and Muslims. The Pope
called for reconciliation and tolerance among the world's
religions, but, Borg said, he believes that if Jesus were on earth
today, he would have gone a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jesus would affirm religious pluralism, not out of
political correctness, but I think central to his teaching was the
immediacy of access to God,'' Borg said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus was a Jewish mystic who had frequent spiritual
experiences, Borg said. Most religions emphasize ways in which
followers can have spiritual experiences, and Jesus would recognize
those other ways as valid, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Borg said he gets hundreds of letters each year from Christians
who say they view Jesus as just one of a few valid spiritual
leaders. Thinking of Jesus in nonexclusive terms makes more sense
to them in today's world, and they feel they can be better
Christians if their hearts agree with their minds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   FOR SOME, NO CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Disney, however, said the interpretation of Jesus' teachings
should not change just because the culture is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus talks about justice, love and mercy and how to deal with
people,'' Disney said. ``Those don't change, maybe the
circumstances change, but ultimately the teachings don't change.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the long-term implications for Christianity if the
quest to redefine Jesus continues?
</P>
<P>
   Cook said he thinks that a more tolerant, multicultural
representation of Jesus will help the Christian church proselytize
in regions of the world that would not relate to traditional
depictions of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said the church should not feel threatened by
individuals' attempts to re-examine Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it will be a wake-up call to the church that people
are constantly seeking spirituality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think discussions are healthy and that the church should
never be afraid of people searching for spirituality,'' Disney
said. ``The church ought to rejoice in that. A community of faith
can help people understand, but we have to make sure we understand
that we don't own Jesus _ never have, never will.''

 &HT;    `O' is for obvious
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Oprah's new magazine _ she's calling it O: The
Oprah Magazine _ is just what you'd expect from the queen of almost
everything. It's big, glossy, full of makeup ads and feel-good
quotes from people ranging from Eleanor Roosevelt to Marianne
Williamson to the four fine folks featured on special ``Oprah to Go
_ Portable Inspiration'' cards to tear out and do with what you
will.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch, offering Maya Angelou for take-out, but better yet,
the table of contents is right up front, where they used to be and
where they still belong. We raced right past it. The advertisements
come next, and they come in a glut. But that's to be expected _
even O has bills to pay, and everyone wants to be around Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   The May/June ($2.95) issue is O's debut: It's mission statement
is to create a magazine to celebrate women's lives. It's all about
personal growth, the kind of growth that runs the gamut from
fashion to food to home decorating to health. Oprah has tapped her
deep well of experts, hiring on Bob Greene to write about health
and fitness; Suze Orman on money (and emotions, naturally); Gary
Zukav on soul-ish issues; Phil McGraw on relationship advice.
</P>
<P>
   There's a special book section (surprised?) that highlights a
``simple yet so powerful'' book called ``The Four Agreements'' by
Don Miguel Ruiz (to save you time, here they are: 1) Be impeccable
with your word; 2) Don't take anything personally; 3) Don't make
assumptions; and 4) Always do your best.) Ruiz, of course,
illuminates each agreement in his book, and in the magazine Oprah
lets us in on how the second agreement changed her life. (How can
one life be changed so many times?)
</P>
<P>
   There are pages with probing questions and room in which to
write answers and a regular feature (she promises!) on Oprah's
favorite things, which this time includes $170 sunglasses by Fendi
and $110 pajamas _ hey, she sometimes wears them all day.
</P>
<P>
   We get excerpts from Jewel's diary (No thanks. We've read her
poetry), first in a series of features where people ``of note''
will open their journals. Another regular is ``Who Knew?'',
featuring Tina Turner this time, who ``reveals'' a ``secret love''
of horror movies and scary books. Yet another regular feature is an
inspirational photograph which, unfortunately, looks like an ad for
an empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff to know: Pastel hosiery is in this spring; spandex becomes
weakened if it's tossed in the dryer; calcium and raspberry-leaf
tea can ease cramps; Bob Greene (health expert) advises women to
stop smoking (where'd he get that idea?); Oprah's chef is named Art
Smith and his sweet-potato salad is out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are five nice bookmarks to tear out and tie a
tassel to. Oprah gives advice on how to use said bookmarks: ``Use
them to hold your place in a new novel,'' she suggests. OK _ Martha
Stewart she's not.
</P>
<P>
   A million copies of O hit the stands Wednesday. The first two
issues will stay out for two months each; in September, the
magazine will go monthly. Personal growth must be one bottomless
pit of story possibilities.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Starting this week, music fans across Japan will be
stepping up to a gadget that resembles a souped up, stand-alone
automated teller, plugging in a blank minidisk, dropping in some
coins and, 30 to 40 seconds later, walking away with their favorite
recordings. And they will not be limited to just a few selections;
thanks to a super-fast, high-capacity digital connection to a
central computer, thousands upon thousands of popular songs will be
potentially available at the touch of a few buttons.
</P>
<P>
   No more long waits. No more illicit downloading of MP3 files.
Just music fast, simple and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a Music POD, and while it may seem like just another
plaything for Japanese teen-agers, it is in fact a powerful
representation of the tectonic shifts taking place in the economy
here.
</P>
<P>
   What the Music POD embodies is the entrepreneurial vision of a
30-year-old college dropout and the business skills of a
40-something former salary man, founders of a young company called
V-Sync. They are the sorts of men who five years ago would have
toiled anonymously inside a major corporation, climbing the ladder
of seniority and keeping their dreams tightly locked up in their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   But today changes in the relationship between employer and
employee, the liberalization of the financial markets and the
explosion of new business models in the freewheeling arenas of the
Internet and information technology are spawning a whole new breed
of entrepreneurs who care little for the conventions that have
dominated Japan Inc. for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a gear turning the wheels of a big
company,'' said Katsuma Fujii, V-Sync's chairman and the younger of
its co-founders. ``It's difficult for a lowly gear to get his
bosses to listen to, let alone accept, his out-of-this-world ideas
in a traditional Japanese corporation. I want to do what I want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of start-ups that can be counted is still low
in comparison with the United States, venture capitalists say they
began detecting a significant increase in activity last year that
is continuing today despite the weak economy. The number of initial
public offerings was up for the first time last year since the peak
in 1995, and the percentage of those companies that were less than
10 years old was the highest it had ever been, according to Jafco,
Japan's largest venture capital company.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, of course, has always been a nation with many small
businesses, despite its image as the land of corporate leviathans
manned by regiments of salary men. And what gets forgotten is that
some of those leviathans _ Honda, Kyocera and Sony, to name a few _
were spawned by visionary entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic structure that evolved after World War II, with
its heavy emphasis on government-directed bank lending, its
punitive tax structure, its ban on stock options and its lack of
pension portability, stifled the entrepreneurial spirit here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would call the upside didn't exist under that
system,'' said Karl K. Fooks, managing director in charge of
deploying venture capital for J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, where it has
recently announced investments in three start-ups. ``The banks
forced you to pledge your entire family as collateral, and the tax
man took most of your profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, until the last year or so, when many of those
disincentives started eroding, entrepreneurs tended to be shackled
to the big kaisha, or corporations, which provided them with a
steady stream of orders, helped them establish a line of credit
with a bank and squeezed their profits in hard times. They were,
effectively, the minor outlying satellites of the business clusters
called keiretsu, and their fortunes very much depended on the
kaisha's patronage.
</P>
<P>
   So Japan's best and brightest made the rational choice to join
the big companies, where salaries were small but benefits like
cars, housing allowances and school tuition were generous and
untaxed. The further one climbed up the ladder, the better the
benefits became, making lifetime loyalty far more attractive than
striking out on one's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to say the Japanese are risk averse,'' Fooks said.
``That simply isn't true. There was just no reward for taking
entrepreneurial risk in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is now changing. For one thing, many big companies are
slowly realizing the benefits of competitive procurement practices
and the costs of providing life support to so many small partners.
Corporations are also struggling to pare their work forces, largely
by drastically cutting hiring of new employees. Unemployment hit
another high in March, and a record share of college graduates this
year will be unable to find established jobs, a trend that is
encouraging more and more people to start businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the big companies that still dominate the economy are
adopting compensation programs based on performance and abolishing
remuneration determined by seniority, fast diluting the attractions
of lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the financial markets here is also helping
entrepreneurs, as new stock markets emerge designed to foster young
businesses and a flood of venture capital provides money that once
was parceled out almost exclusively by big banks largely interested
in corporate customers and real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even go to a bank when I started my company because I
was pretty sure about the answer _ no,'' said Moto Kuroi,
co-founder of Neuromagic, a Web design and strategic consulting
firm. ``I started the company with money from my friends and
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, V-Sync and Neuromagic have a few beneficial ties to
big business. Sharp, Sumitomo Trust, Marubeni and other established
Japanese companies have invested in V-Sync. Similarly, Neuromagic
relies on Dentsu, the giant Japanese advertising agency, for some
of its orders.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is if either of these two companies were to lose
those backers, they would scarcely miss a beat. When Internet
Initiatives Japan, which specializes in connecting corporate
customers to the Internet, wanted to raise money here two years
ago, it was stymied. It finally went public last summer _ on the
Nasdaq market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, two new stock exchanges have been set up
specifically to foster fledgling enterprises _ Mothers, which made
its debut late last year, and Nasdaq Japan, which will open this
summer. Meanwhile, the pool of venture capital here is swelling.
Even the government is eager to develop entrepreneurs, earmarking
10.3 billion yen, or about $97 million, for new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry so much about finding money,'' said Kuroi, who
almost sold Neuromagic recently but decided he would rather remain
independent. ``I worry about getting the right people to back us.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge for venture capitalists is that the large
majority of money available to finance new businesses arrived only
recently, so many of the entrepreneurs here have figured out ways
to build their operations without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one year ago, too little money was chasing too few
deals,'' said Mitsumasa Murase, chairman and president of Jafco,
the venture capital company. ``Now, we have too much money chasing
too few deals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true now that barriers to taking young
companies public have been eased, making private capital less
crucial in nursing them. ``Previously, if you invested in early
stage companies, it would take 30 years to cash out and make money
on them,'' Murase said. ``Now, companies are going public at
lightning speed, 1 1/2 or two years after they are founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, V-Sync began making plans to offer shares to the
public on the Mothers exchange. ``We are rather like a telecom
company, so we need money to build a fiber optic infrastructure,''
said Takaya Ibe, V-Sync's president and co-founder. ``That requires
a huge amount of money, and we feel the stock market is the best
place to go for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ibe is even more remarkable than his whiz-kid
partner, Fujii. To start with, after graduating from college, Ibe
went to work for Hoechst, the big German chemical company, rather
than a Japanese kaisha, a far rarer occurrence then than now.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually left for a company specializing in semiconductor
robotics, his second break from the traditional Japanese career
pattern that chains employees to companies for life. From there, he
went to Bandai, where he was part of a team that developed a
variety of popular gadgets using computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   But what most interested Ibe was developing circuitry to create
three-dimensional computer games. At that time, about 15 years ago,
Bandai was reaping the benefits of its simple, two-dimensional
Super Mario games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to the board that if we could introduce 3-D, the
prospect for games would be great,'' he said. ``But they told me,
`This two-dimensional Mario is beautiful and fun. Why should we
create something new? What do we need 3-D for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, he stayed at Bandai a few more years but then
struck out and founded his own company. On one project, he met
Fujii.
</P>
<P>
   The young Fujii was then working for a company that was a
subcontractor to Bandai. ``Even though I invented some smash hit
products,'' he said, ``the profit always went to Bandai. That's why
I decided to start my own company and asked Ibe to be my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibe had not forgotten his dreams, either. ``I kept remembering
the whole 3-D thing with Bandai and how Playstation and Nintendo
had proven I was right,'' he said. ``I did not want to repeat that
mistake and miss out on an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and Fujii pooled their money and went into business in
hopes of exploiting the emerging network technologies already
taking off in the United States. They were lucky when they received
a research grant from Okayama Prefecture. They won a bid to supply
information kiosks in train stations, beating out corporate titans
like NEC and Fujitsu. And the giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
turned to V-Sync when Mitsubishi Electric failed to deliver an
information terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of people like Fujii has been in recognizing that
subterranean Japan is a veritable spaghetti bowl of underutilized
fiber optic cable and finding ways of putting it to use. Indeed,
V-Sync's dreams go far beyond music; any kind of digital
information _ books, movies, software, games _ can be downloaded
through the POD.
</P>
<P>
   That understanding of the power resident in telecommunications
networks is what distinguishes many of the new entrepreneurs from
their predecessors and the big kaisha. They have largely had to
educate themselves, which has given them a self-confidence that is
rare in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroi, the Neuromagic founder, was a philosophy major studying
at the International Christian University in Tokyo _ ``I wanted to
go to Hitotsubashi University,'' he said, ``but I wasn't a good
enough student'' _ when he discovered the potential of networked
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, there was no commercial Internet, everything was
operating at a speed of 2,400 baud, you couldn't send images or
pictures of any kind, only text,'' he said. ``I knew the technology
would change, but my friends said what I was talking about was
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying out a couple of different jobs, Kuroi met several
employees of Apple Computer. ``Those guys didn't think like
Japanese, and being around them helped me to realize I don't need a
protector.''
</P>
<P>
   So he started Neuromagic with a friend who left IBM Japan. They
are still the sole owners of the company, which now has 20
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Neuromagic, a pioneer in Japan's young Internet production
industry, has worked on more than 100 Web sites, including sites
for Sony Music Entertainment and Citibank Japan. It helped Gap plan
its new store in Tokyo's trendy Harajuku neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuroi is not sanguine. Web site design companies are
springing up all over, and he is well aware that his U.S.
counterparts are often operating outfits with 25 times the staff
that Neuromagic has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more competitive, offer customers more services
and ideas,'' Kuroi said. ``That will take money.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents initially objected to Neuromagic, asking Kuroi to
explain why they had wasted money sending him to college. ``My
father wanted me to work for Hitachi, Toshiba, Matsushita,'' Kuroi
said. ``That was his direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kuroi, who is 37, has now convinced his father that he made
the right choice. ``We are different from our parents'
generation,'' he said. ``We have different DNA.''

   On Jan. 7, 1982, in a laboratory at Columbia University, a
little-known science professor, Laszlo Z. Bito, finished a
nine-month experiment on the eyes of cats. In his handwritten data,
carefully charted in gray hardcover notebooks, lay the origins of
what every pharmaceutical company longs for: a blockbuster drug.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is Xalatan, a best-selling eyedrop for glaucoma. With
$507 million in sales last year _ and the potential for billions
more, most of it pure profit _ the 4-year-old medicine is the
equivalent of liquid gold for its manufacturer, Pharmacia Corp. The
eyedrop earned Columbia University about $20 million in royalties
last year, and it has made a millionaire of Bito as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other, unseen, partners in the creation of
Xalatan: the American taxpayers, who backed Bito's work with $4
million from the National Institutes of Health. The taxpayers have
reaped no financial return on their investment; their reward,
government officials say, is the eyedrop itself.
</P>
<P>
   Xalatan costs patients $45 to $50 for a tiny bottle that lasts
six weeks. That price _ about $1 a day for a drug that staves off
blindness _ may not seem excessive. But the key ingredient in that
daily dose costs Pharmacia only pennies to make, and Americans, who
live in the only industrialized nation that lacks government
restraints on drug prices, pay more than twice what European
patients pay for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Xalatan out of reach for patients like Albert Russell,
a retired optician and part-time blues singer from Prince George's
County, Md. Russell, whose glaucoma has left him nearly blind,
lives on an $832-a-month Social Security check. He is among the
one-third of elderly Americans who lack prescription-drug coverage,
and when he talks about Xalatan, he uses the word ``outrageous'' to
describe its price.
</P>
<P>
   To officials at Pharmacia, the price is fair. ``We are bringing
forth innovation,'' said Dr. Anders Harfstrand, the company's vice
president for ophthalmology, ``and innovation always brings a
premium.''
</P>
<P>
   In this election year, the cost of prescription medicines is at
the center of the political debate. With the biomedical revolution
yielding a flood of new therapies, drugs are now the
fastest-growing component of the United States'
trillion-dollar-a-year medical bill.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress contemplates expanding Medicare to include
prescription-drug coverage, and some states move to bring drug
prices more in line with those in foreign countries, the industry
is struggling to fend off federal regulation that might limit its
ability to set prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the fight is Harfstrand's contention that the
price of medication is justified by the extreme risk of failure and
high cost of drug discovery _ an average of $500 million per drug,
by the industry's estimate. It is an argument that the
pharmaceutical industry, one of the world's most lucrative and
secretive businesses, has relied on for over 40 years. But it has
rarely been put under a microscope, because the industry will not
divulge the costs of researching and developing a particular drug.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on the subject, The New York Times examined
Xalatan, from its genesis in Bito's laboratory to its arrival in
the medicine cabinets of patients in 57 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia declined to disclose specific financial information
about the making of the drug. But through interviews with key
participants and an analysis of publicly available documents, the
examination found, among other things, that Pharmacia spent no more
than $150,000 to buy the rights to Bito's invention from Columbia.
Though it later spent tens of millions of its own money to develop
the drug, the company acknowledges that Bito, with the taxpayers'
support, provided it an ``uncut diamond'' that later became
Xalatan.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's reliance on taxpayer-supported research _
characterized as ``a subsidy'' by the very same economists whose
work the industry relies on _ is commonplace, the examination also
found. So commonplace, in fact, that one industry expert is now
raising questions about the companies' arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Dr. Nelson Levy, a former head of research and
development at Abbott Laboratories, who now works as a consultant
for industry and the federal government on drug development,
bluntly challenged the industry's oft-repeated cost of developing a
drug. ``That it costs $500 million to develop a drug,'' Levy said
in a recent interview, ``is a lot of bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the examination found, federal officials have abandoned
or ignored policies that could have led to lower prices for
medicines developed with taxpayer dollars. That is partly because
the government has lost track of what drugs are invented with its
money, and partly, officials say, because the industry resisted
government efforts to get involved in pricing.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Bernadine Healy, a former director of the National
Institutes of Health, said in a recent interview, ``We sold away
government research so cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Going Against the Standard
</P>
<P>
   Like many scientific discoveries, the invention of Xalatan began
with a hunch. It was the mid-1970s, and Bito, a hard-driving
researcher who bucked the eye-research establishment with his
unconventional ideas about glaucoma treatment, had been named an
assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Budapest, Hungary, he was conscripted into a
forced-labor coal-mining camp at 18. In 1956, the year the
communists quashed a rebellion in his homeland, he escaped,
eventually fleeing for the United States. His passion was writing,
but he abandoned it for a career in science, particularly the study
of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Bito was interested in a family of chemicals produced by the
body, prostaglandins, and how they might affect the eye,
particularly the fluid, known as aqueous humor, that nourishes the
cornea and the lens. In glaucoma, the aqueous humor does not drain
quickly enough, causing an increase in intraocular pressure _
pressure inside the eye. This pressure can damage the optic nerve,
causing vision loss and ultimately blindness.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million Americans have glaucoma, and every year
120,000 Americans go blind from the disease. The elderly,
African-Americans, and people with family histories of the disease
are at greatest risk. Glaucoma is often called ``the sneak thief of
sight.'' Often, by the time the patient notices vision loss,
glaucoma can only be halted, not reversed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Bito began his research, ophthalmologists had already
concluded that prostaglandins raised intraocular pressure, and were
therefore dangerous. But Bito, along with a student at Columbia
Medical School, Carl Camras, suspected otherwise; they thought that
if prostaglandins were given in extremely small doses, they could
actually reduce the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, after a series of studies on the eyes of rabbits, they
published a paper showing just that. ``It was blasphemy,'' Camras
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bito continued the work with monkeys, cats, and even himself,
squirting the chemical in his own eye to gauge how much redness and
irritation it caused. The studies were paid for by the National Eye
Institute, a branch of the health institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the cat experiment's conclusion in 1982,
administrators at Columbia University had steered Bito to a patent
lawyer; in May of that year, he applied for a patent.
</P>
<P>
   It felt strange, he said, but it signified the changing culture
of the ivory tower. As a professor, Bito was accustomed to
publishing his work in journals and talking about it at scientific
meetings. Patenting, to him, represented secrecy, the culture of
industry, not academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was looked down on,'' Bito said. ``It was too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Law Behind the Companies
</P>
<P>
   Commerce, however, was exactly what Congress had in mind when,
in late 1980, it passed legislation that directed federally
financed researchers like Bito to patent their inventions, or risk
losing control of them to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan had just won election on a platform to make
America strong again. Japan's electronic industry was outcompeting
the United States in its own back yard. Determined not to lose,
Congress passed Public Law 96-517, known as the Bayh-Dole Act after
Sens. Birch Bayh of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The law was designed to push federally financed research from
the university laboratory into the marketplace. Scientists who made
discoveries using taxpayer money were required to file invention
reports with the government. Universities were directed to license
patented inventions to companies that would commercialize them.
</P>
<P>
   The law was originally passed to aid small businesses, but later
it was modified so that even big companies like Pharmacia could
benefit. If a company did not develop a product quickly enough, the
government could revoke the company's license and hand the job over
to a competitor. It could also take control of an invention to
alleviate ``health or safety needs,'' the law said.
</P>
<P>
   Once an invention is on the market, the law grants the
government the right to buy it without paying customary royalties.
At the same time, say patent experts in the Clinton administration
and at the National Science Foundation, other laws enable federal
agencies to put taxpayer-financed inventions out to competitive
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government, which buys Xalatan, could give
companies other than Pharmacia the opportunity to manufacture the
eyedrop and sell it at a lower price _ but only to the government.
</P>
<P>
   So, these experts say, the Bayh-Dole law, in conjunction with
other provisions, could result in lower drug prices for the
Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of
Health, two major purchasers of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 20 years since the Bayh-Dole bill became law, the
government has not taken advantage of these provisions, say
officials at the health institutes. One reason, said Dr. Wendy
Baldwin, a deputy director at the agency, is that the government
already buys drugs cheaply by purchasing them in bulk. But even if
federal officials wanted to use the Bayh-Dole Act to get medicines
at still lower prices, they could not because they do not keep
track of products, including drugs, that are invented with taxpayer
money.
</P>
<P>
   That failure has drawn criticism from the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, which last year
conducted a review of the government's invention reporting system.
``Inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent,'' the accounting office
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a preliminary report by the inspector general's
office of the Department of Health and Human Services found that as
many as 22 percent of discoveries financed by the health institutes
were not reported by universities, as is required.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 inventions developed with government money were
reported to the health institutes last year, but Baldwin and other
agency officials said in interviews that they had no idea which, if
any, companies had licensed those inventions, or how they were
being used.
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of what consumers pay for drugs, the health
institutes have concluded they should stay out of it. When Healy
was director of the agency in the early 1990s, she insisted that
companies interested in developing drugs that had been invented by
government scientists sign contracts agreeing to ``reasonable
pricing'' for those medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The companies balked at the reasonable-pricing clause. ``I was
persona non grata for it,'' said Healy, who now heads the American
Red Cross. The provision was dropped in 1995 by Dr. Harold Varmus,
her successor; at the time, he said the policy was discouraging
collaboration by driving industry away.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Baldwin, the official designated by the NIH to
answer questions for this article, taxpayers may not get lower drug
prices. Still, she said: ``The current policies are actually
bringing drugs to market. It's a huge advance, a wonderful
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Going Abroad for Help
</P>
<P>
   If the federal government leaves it to companies to decide how
much consumers pay for taxpayer-backed inventions, universities are
even less concerned about the prices. The Bayh-Dole Act has meant a
windfall in revenues from licensing and royalties for them, none
more than Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Columbia earned $96 million in licensing fees and
royalties under the Bayh-Dole law, ranking it first among
universities in royalties from inventions, said Jack Granowitz, who
runs Columbia's program to commercialize university inventions.
Roughly $20 million of that money was from Xalatan; one-fifth goes
to Bito and the university keeps the rest.
</P>
<P>
   When Bito first filed his patent application in 1982, no drug
company in the United States would touch it; most glaucoma experts
remembered well the studies showing that prostaglandins could only
hurt people with the disease. Bito recalled: ``They said, `It's
crazy. You can't put prostaglandins in the eye.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Bito approached another Hungarian eye researcher who knew
people at Pharmacia, at the time one of Sweden's largest drug
companies. (The company, now of Peapack, N.J., has since undergone
two mergers, one with Upjohn in 1995, and another this year, with
Monsanto.) Within a year, Bito said, Pharmacia had bought exclusive
rights to his idea, paying Columbia between $100,000 and $150,000.
The government received no fees; the law did not require it.
</P>
<P>
   For Pharmacia, which was already marketing a cataract therapy
developed by Bito's Hungarian friend, it was a nice fit. It was
also a way for the company to hedge the risky bets it made on drug
development.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's own studies show that drug research is riskiest
in the early stages, when a company has no way to tell if a given
compound is a blockbuster or a dud. The companies often build on
basic scientific findings that emerge from taxpayer-financed
studies, underwriting the applied science themselves. But in some
cases, as with Xalatan, those studies actually produce a practical
discovery that can be licensed, allowing companies to step in when
profits seem more assured.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely how many medicines result from such
licensing arrangements, but they are not unusual. For example,
Trusopt, a glaucoma eyedrop by Merck, was taken to the market in
similar fashion, after researchers at the University of Florida,
with backing from the National Eye Institute, discovered how to
convert a related drug from pill to drop form. As Dr. Carl Kupfer,
the institute's director, said, ``A pharmaceutical company wouldn't
take over the drug unless the animal testing looked very
feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pharmacia was hardly getting a finished product. ``An
uncut diamond'' is how Harfstrand described Bito's work. Using the
natural prostaglandins Bito had identified, Pharmacia had the task
of developing a synthetic molecule that could be given safely to
people.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tall order. As Bito well knew from squirting the
chemicals into his own eyes, the prostaglandins caused redness and
irritation. One of Sweden's leading eye experts, Dr. Anders Bill,
remembered informing the company that Bito's idea was ``next to
ridiculous,'' and giving it only a 5 percent chance of success. The
drug industry's trade association says for every 250 compounds that
emerge from a laboratory to enter this kind of preclinical testing,
only one makes it to market.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, two years into Pharmacia's contract with Columbia, the
company's research was progressing slowly. Bito persuaded Granowitz
to write a letter to the company reminding it that, under the
Bayh-Dole law, the government could step in and take control of the
invention. The next year, Pharmacia hired a new manager for the
project, a Swedish pharmacologist, Johan Stjernschantz.
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, Stjernschantz had found what Pharmacia was looking for:
a family of chemical cousins to Bito's prostaglandins that also
lowered pressure but without the troubling irritation. From this
family, Stjernschantz said, he selected latanaprost, the key
ingredient for the compound that would later take the trade name
Xalatan.
</P>
<P>
   The uncut diamond was now a sparkling gem.
</P>
<P>
   Government's Silent Role
</P>
<P>
   How much was Bito's government-supported work worth to
Pharmacia? Only company officials know, and they won't say.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of secrecy is typical, making it difficult for
outsiders to examine drug-pricing issues. Nonetheless, experts
characterize work like Bito's as an extremely valuable subsidy for
a business that is already receiving government help in other
areas, such as tax credits for research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, the former Abbott Laboratories executive, says preclinical
research could account for as much as 20 percent to 25 percent of a
company's research and development budget for a particular drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIH-supported research represents a subsidy to pharmaceutical
development,'' said Dr. Louis Lasagna, an expert in drug
development at Tufts University whose studies are widely cited by
the industry. ``But you need a midwife, the companies, to bring it
to market.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``subsidy,'' not surprisingly, rankles drug-industry
officials, who say that other businesses, including the
medical-device industry, also benefit from public science.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is clear that the government plays an important, and an
increasing, role in drug development, both through inventions like
Bito's and through more basic scientific research on which the
companies can build. A 1995 study by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology found that of the 14 new drugs the industry identified
as the most medically significant in the preceding 25 years, 11 had
their roots in studies paid for by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general pattern is that industry is building enormously
heavily on basic research supported by NIH,'' said Dr. Francis
Narin, president of CHI Research, a consulting firm that has
analyzed patents as a way of measuring the role public science
plays in industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 study commissioned by the National Science Foundation,
CHI looked at the most significant scientific research papers cited
in medicine patents. It found that half the cited studies were paid
for with United States public funds, primarily from government and
academia; only 17 percent were paid for by industry. (The rest came
from public and private foreign sources.)
</P>
<P>
   And in a study with the National Eye Institute, published in
1996, CHI found that 41 percent of patented eye-care technology was
linked to research financed by the health institutes, including
Bito's studies, which have been cited in 15 patents, including
Xalatan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is very typical,'' Narin said of Bito's work.
``If you find any good advanced biomedical patent, and you look at
its science references, most of them are going to be public,''
meaning from publicly financed research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The industry's estimate for the average cost of developing a
drug _ $500 million _ is drawn from a study that was published in
1991 by Lasagna and Dr. Joseph DiMasi, an economist at Tufts, and
has been adjusted to reflect inflation and the additional testing
that drug companies have begun doing to obtain FDA approval for
their medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of the $500 million represents the
actual cost of developing a particular medicine, DiMasi said. The
rest of the cost is attributed to lost opportunities: years spent
going down scientific ``dry holes'' and research money that could
have generated interest had it been invested instead.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, the drug-development expert, says the Bayh-Dole law has
altered that equation. In the past, Levy said, ``academia was
coming up with concepts, not molecules'' for drug development.
Today, university scientists are more commercially oriented; many
are spinning off their own biotech companies to develop their
ideas. That, in turn, has enabled companies like Pharmacia to shift
resources away from in-house research and development and toward
outside collaborations, a strategy known as ``external
innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Pharmacia shut down Stjernschantz's prostaglandin
lab after Xalatan went on the market in 1996, instead giving
Stjernschantz a grant to continue his research at a nearby
university.
</P>
<P>
   And last year Pharmacia spent $650 million to buy Sugen, a
biotech concern in San Francisco that is collaborating with the
National Cancer Institute on clinical trials of its two leading
drugs. The company's co-founder, Dr. Joseph Schlessinger, is a New
York University scientist whose initial financing included a
nine-year grant from the cancer institute, NIH records show.
</P>
<P>
   So the pharmaceutical companies have become more efficient, in
part because university researchers are more efficient. As Levy put
it, the companies are ''not having to dig as many dry holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawback in Development
</P>
<P>
   Once Stjernschantz had identified the latanaprost molecule,
Pharmacia needed a place to produce it in large amounts for testing
in people. It takes 110 raw materials, 32 separate chemical
reactions and three months to make a batch of latanaprost, and few
companies had the technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that did was the Chinoin Pharmaceutical and Chemical
Works, in Bito's hometown, Budapest. The 88-year-old company, owned
until recently by the Hungarian communist government, sits hard by
the railroad tracks in a drab corner of the city, a vast array of
100 low-slung buildings connected by a maze of steel pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Bito knew Chinoin's chemists well. He introduced them to
officials at Pharmacia, and after some testy east-west
negotiations, clinical trials were under way by the early 1990s in
three countries, with Chinoin producing the key ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Camras, the young medical student who worked with Bito at
Columbia, was brought in to run the U.S. arm of the final study; by
this time he had become an ophthalmologist, with an academic
appointment at the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Human testing is typically the most expensive part of the drug
development process. Clinical trials usually consist of three
phases; the first study tests safety and looks for the proper dose;
if the drug is safe, it moves to the second phase to test
effectiveness in a limited number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest clinical trial is the last one, the large Phase 3
study to prove the drug is safe and effective, proof that is
necessary for the Food and Drug Administration approval. Depending
on the drug and the amount of medical care involved, experts say
the cost of a Phase 3 trial can range from $10,000 to $20,000 per
patient.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase 3 study of Xalatan was relatively small, focusing on
just 829 people. The company will not say what it spent on that
study, or any other. But Stjernschantz, the project manager, said
the total costs for all trials was significantly less than $30
million, an estimate that, a Columbia researcher said, Pharmacia
provided to the university before the testing had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The trials gave the company precisely what it was looking for:
proof that Xalatan, given once a day, lowered intraocular pressure
as much as the gold standard of glaucoma treatment, timolol.
</P>
<P>
   But the studies turned up a worrisome, and unique, side effect:
Xalatan caused 7.2 percent of patients' eyes to darken, changing
from blue or green to brown. The company nearly pulled the plug on
the project. ``That was a very terrible crisis,'' Stjernschantz
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the pigmentation issue led to less-than-wholehearted
backing from the FDA, which approved the drug on June 6, 1996, with
a caveat: Xalatan, it said, should be used only as backup therapy
when all other drugs have failed, and not as a ``first-line''
treatment. It was a setback, but hardly a fatal one.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Xalatan is approved for sale around the world, from the
United States to Japan, Australia and all across Europe. The key
ingredient is still being manufactured at Chinoin in Budapest,
although the Hungarian company has since become a subsidiary of
Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical giant.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinoin-Pharmacia partnership has been a profitable one.
Chinoin is making a 50 percent return on its prostaglandin
investment, company officials said. And Pharmacia pays Chinoin
slightly more than $5 million a year for the manufacturing of
latanaprost, said Tibor Szabo, who directs the prostaglandin
business unit at Chinoin.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to roughly one one-hundredth of Xalatan's $507
million in annual sales last year. Or to put it another way, the
cost of making the key ingredient is just 1 percent of the revenue
Xalatan generates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Basing Price on Buyers
</P>
<P>
   Among Bito, the National Institutes of Health and Pharmacia, 20
years and many millions of dollars were spent getting Xalatan to a
point where it could be sold to the public. But those costs bear
little relationship to the price of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the price based on what the company spends to make and
sell Xalatan, which includes not only the $5 million paid to
Chinoin but also the cost of diluting, bottling and shipping the
drug, the royalties paid to Columbia, and other costs, such as
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, there can be scores of prices for the same drug, as
Xalatan shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where there are no government
restrictions, the basic price set by the company is determined by
what the market will bear, taking into consideration the
competition, the drug's side effects, and the patient population.
</P>
<P>
   Xalatan is the first and only prostaglandin-based glaucoma drug,
which gives it a competitive edge. It is taken only once a day;
other drops must be taken more often. And aside from the eye
pigmentation, it has fewer side effects. In the United States, the
company sells the drug for about $36 a bottle wholesale, making it
far more expensive than the cheapest generic, but roughly in line
with other brand-name glaucoma medications, according to industry
data and experts.
</P>
<P>
   That price changes from customer to customer. Large health
maintenance organizations, as well as the government, can often
wring discounts out of manufacturers, while people with no
prescription-drug coverage must pay the full price. The Department
of Veterans Affairs, for instance, pays $25 a bottle for Xalatan,
about half what uninsured patients like Russell pay. And there are
even different prices within the government; smaller federal
agencies pay $29 a bottle for Xalatan.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, price controls make for a different story.
</P>
<P>
   In Bito's home country, Hungary, where the government pays for
approved medications, Pharmacia receives a negotiated price of
$17.50 a bottle for Xalatan, said Katalin Szutrely, who runs
Pharmacia's Hungarian branch. Because the drug is so costly, she
said, obtaining government approval to market it was difficult. One
selling point was Bito himself. ``We were proud of him being the
inventor,'' she said, ``and we used his name.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the drug is reaching a lot of patients in
Hungary. A panel of Hungarian eye doctors recommended Xalatan as a
first-line treatment, Szutrely said, but the government pays for it
only when doctors can prove that all other eyedrops have failed. As
Szutrely said, ``If you don't have the reimbursement, you cannot
sell the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the debate revolves around dueling sets of
statistics about why Americans often pay more. Some say the price
of new medicines is driving up health-care costs. Kaiser
Permanente, the health maintenance organization, says it spent $4.7
million on glaucoma drugs in 1995, the year before Xalatan was
introduced. Last year, Kaiser's expenditures for glaucoma reached
$20.4 million, $9 million of it on Xalatan.
</P>
<P>
   To counter such numbers, industry officials argue that Xalatan
and other new medicines may be saving money as well, by reducing
the need for doctors' visits and also for surgery. At the same
time, they say the American free market provides the companies with
the profits they need to plow back into research, so that patients
can benefit from the next generation of drugs like Xalatan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about low prices in Europe,'' Harfstrand said.
``It discourages innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   And because more prescription drugs are made and sold in the
United States than in any other country, the thought of regulation
is especially troubling to the companies. In the case of Xalatan,
for instance, over half the drug's sales are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has been the only major free market for
pharmaceuticals,'' Fred Hassan, Pharmacia's chief executive, said
in a company newsletter last fall, ``and that has benefited
patients as well as our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Science vs. Selling
</P>
<P>
   As Xalatan's inventor, Bito likes to think of the drug as a
triumph of science. But at Pharmacia, they speak proudly of Xalatan
as a triumph of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's recommendation of Xalatan as only a backup therapy
presented a considerable challenge to the company: how to persuade
doctors to turn to their drug before other glaucoma medications.
The company pursued an aggressive strategy, according to the drug
agency's records and interviews with eye doctors, leaving the
impression but not stating explicitly that Xalatan should be
considered as a first-line therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's growing sales suggest the strategy has worked; in an
advertisement announcing its merger with Monsanto, Pharmacia
proudly called Xalatan ``the new gold standard for treatment of
glaucoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Company documents show that Pharmacia spent 40 percent of its
overall revenue on marketing and administrative expenses last year,
more than twice what it spent on research. In the last year alone,
it increased its global sales force by 30 percent to 6,500 people,
including scores of ``detail men'' who make door-to-door visits to
doctors. Last year, company officials say, those detail men gave
away more than a million free samples of Xalatan to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies gauge a product's success by its gross-profit margin _
the money left from sales after expenses, but before taxes. The
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association says only
three out of 10 medicines recover their research and development
costs. But those that do, like Xalatan, can be hugely profitable.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of Xalatan's profitability, based on outside
experts and company documents, suggests its profit margin is likely
higher than the company's average of 76 percent, perhaps as high as
90 percent. The company, however, will not talk about Xalatan's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As Harfstrand said, ``We never comment on gross margins on
individual products.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Behind the Popularity
</P>
<P>
   To spend a day in the examining room with Dr. Harry Quigley,
director of the glaucoma service at the Wilmer Eye Institute at
Johns Hopkins University, is to see why Xalatan is popular with
both doctors and patients. As one of the United States' best-known
eye specialists, Quigley sees as many as 40 patients on any given
day, and these days, it seems, he is prescribing Xalatan to most.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the drug for the obvious reason: It reduces intraocular
pressure. His patients like it, too; in interviews, several said it
caused less redness and irritation than other glaucoma drops, and
they preferred its once-a-day formula. Other drugs to combat
glaucoma must be taken as often as four times a day. For Quigley,
convenience is hardly a side issue; the once-a-day regimen, he
said, means patients are more likely to take their eyedrops.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1996, a few months after Xalatan was on pharmacy
shelves, Quigley prescribed it to Russell, the retired optician,
who is blind in his right eye and nearly blind in the left. The
drug worked to perfection, lowering Russell's intraocular pressure
to well within normal range. ``It was fantastic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was the price. ``Forty-five bucks,'' Russell
exclaimed, cradling a bottle of Xalatan in his hand. ``I flinch
every time I think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many older people, Russell takes other medications that run
up his monthly prescription-drug bill. For a time, he said, he paid
out of pocket for Xalatan. Then his wife, Millie, discovered that
Pharmacia runs a prescription assistance program for patients with
``short-term financial hardship.'' Under the program, the company
provides drugs, with patients typically making a $5 co-payment to
the pharmacy, for six months, and then patients can reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was approved for the program. But last August, he
received a letter from Pharmacia telling him his discounted supply
of Xalatan would run out in November, and urging him to find
another, more permanent, way to pay for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell did not have another way to pay. So Quigley proposed
an alternative that Medicare would pay for: surgery to lower the
intraocular pressure. It was not the optimal solution, Quigley
said, because Russell's glaucoma was well controlled with the drops
and the operation meant a 2 percent to 3 percent risk that he would
lose sight in his only good eye, plus a continuing risk of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to take care of Russell would have been to
continue his medications,'' the doctor said. ``That was not
practical, so we did the next best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Quigley, the situation was hardly extraordinary. Too many of
his patients, he said, are ``being forced to choose between paying
the rent, buying food and taking expensive medicine.'' And he is
irritated that Pharmacia offers patients only short-term help. ``If
somebody is going to start taking medication,'' he said, ``they are
going to need it indefinitely, and they are unlikely to be poor for
only six or 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Also troubled is Dr. J. William Doyle, a University of Florida
ophthalmologist who has studied company assistance programs and
found them often inaccessible to patients. ``It's a hassle,'' he
said, and many patients choose cheaper, less effective medicines
rather than jumping through the bureaucratic hoops necessary to get
drugs at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   At Pharmacia, officials will not divulge information about how
many patients receive help from the medication assistance program,
or how much the company spends on in it.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, for one, says he is quite familiar with the
pharmaceutical industry's arguments about the cost of prescription
drugs, and he does not believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the extra price is for research,'' he said. ``That's
hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is not the most often-prescribed glaucoma drug,
Xalatan brought in more revenue last year than any of its
competitors, and was Pharmacia's best-selling product before the
company's merger with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia, which had $7 billion in revenue last year, before the
merger, forecasts $750 million in annual sales for Xalatan by 2002.
But the patent is due to expire in 2011, according to the company,
and competitors are busy developing rival products. Pharmacia is
busy, too; it is already seeking FDA approval of a new product, a
combination of Xalatan and timolol, the leading generic competitor,
that could extend the life of the patent.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bito, he has closed down his lab at Columbia and is back
in Budapest, living in a spacious apartment with high ceilings and
wood floors and a large picture window that looks out on the Roman
Catholic church he attended as a boy. Despite the millions he has
earned from Xalatan, he lives relatively modestly, driving around
hills above the Danube in an 18-year-old Russian car. He has
finally achieved his dream of becoming a novelist; his latest book,
``Abraham &AMP; Isaac,'' has made the best-seller list in Hungary.

FEDERAL WELFARE WINDFALL FREES NEW YORK MONEY FOR OTHER USES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Minn., Texas, Mich.)  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the four years since the overhaul of the
nation's welfare laws, New York has taken at least $1 billion given
to it by the federal government for new anti-poverty programs and
used it instead to indirectly finance huge tax cuts and other
programs that appeal to middle-class voters, according to
government and private estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The budgetary switch has been employed by other states,
prompting Congress to open an investigation to determine the scope
of the practice nationwide. But New York, with the nation's
second-largest welfare population, appears to be among the most
aggressive states in using its federal welfare dollars to help pay
for other programs it would otherwise find difficult to afford.
</P>
<P>
   It is that practice that is a source of growing scrutiny among
lawmakers in Washington, as well as advocates for the poor. In a
recent letter to governors, Rep. Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut,
the chairwoman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee
on Human Services, warned against replacing existing state
expenditures with federal welfare dollars, saying that it would
lead Congress into ``assuming we have provided states with too much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, for example, officials have apparently used $48
million over two years to replace money the state itself once spent
on social services, according to a report by the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research organization in
Washington. In Minnesota, state leaders have apparently earmarked
$100 million in federal welfare money to pay for programs that the
state once paid for itself, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted similar practices in Texas, where $162
million in federal welfare dollars has evidently been used to free
up state money, and in Michigan, where $120 million of the state's
federal welfare grant has been set aside to replace previous state
spending on social services.
</P>
<P>
   To date, New York has taken in roughly $6.1 billion in federal
welfare funds and earmarked about $5 billion of it _ there is some
disagreement as to the exact figure _ to finance traditional
programs for the poor, like public-assistance grants. But it has
spent very little of the remaining money to create programs
intended to help welfare recipients make the transition to
permanent employment, as proponents of the new federal welfare law
had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the state used that money, as much as $1.3 billion by
some estimates, for welfare programs that the state once financed
itself. That has freed up an unprecedented amount of state money
that has been used to help pay for politically popular programs,
from a host of new tax cuts to fiscal relief for cash-strapped
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The situation represents a missed opportunity, say advocates for
the poor, who have been urging the state to invest its welfare
money in the kinds of innovative anti-poverty programs envisioned
by proponents of the welfare overhaul, including intensified
casework, job placement and state-subsidized employment.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing illegal about supplanting state expenditures
with federal welfare dollars, provided the states meet minimum
spending levels outlined in the 1996 federal welfare law. In New
York's case, that totals about $1.7 billion a year, or 75 percent
of its average expenditure in 1994 and 1995. The state is spending
that amount, and state officials insist that it is more than
sufficient to meet the needs of the poor. But the problem, as
members of Congress have pointed out, is that states that use
federal funds to free up their own welfare money run the risk of
federal lawmakers concluding that they do not need so much federal
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say their concern has also been
heightened because the 1996 federal law that reshaped the nation's
welfare system limits recipients to no more than five years of
benefits. That means that tens of thousands of recipients face the
prospect of exhausting their eligibility for public-assistance
benefits as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   The looming deadline comes as New York confronts a welfare
population that is perhaps the most deeply mired in dependency the
state has ever had. The state's own figures show that nearly half
its welfare recipients have been on the rolls for five years or
more, raising serious questions about how the state intends to
nudge them into self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other problems that may result from the way New
York and other states have spent their federal welfare grants. The
situation will almost certainly strengthen the hand of Republicans
in Congress who want to cut the welfare block grant that states
receive from Washington when that grant comes up for
re-authorization in two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, members of both parties have sharply questioned the
way states spend their welfare money, focusing on whether it has
been used for the intended purpose of helping poor families. In
fact, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, is looking into whether states are using the welfare
money they have received from Washington to replace money the
states now spend on anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Ramirez, the chairman of the New York State Assembly
Committee on Social Services, expressed alarm over how New York was
spending its money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the state is doing here is subsidizing other areas of
government at the expense of welfare recipients,'' said Ramirez, a
Democrat from New York City, where the bulk of the state's welfare
population resides. ``My concern is that we are sending a message
to Washington that we don't need all this money to deal with our
welfare population. We are being penny-wise and pound-foolish.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare overhaul ended the decades-old role that the
federal government played in providing states with money to help
every poor family on the welfare rolls. Instead, the new law gave
states block grants that would remain fixed for five years, no
matter how many welfare recipients the states had. In return, the
states gained flexibility to run welfare programs as they saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unexpected twist, the states have wound up with far
more federal welfare money than they would have under the old
system. That is because the welfare rolls nationwide have dropped
steeply while federal financing remains fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, poverty experts say, states have used the
extra money in their treasuries not only to provide traditional
welfare grants but also to expand job training, child care and
other services.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, a number of states like New York have used
the federal welfare windfall, as it is commonly known, to pay for
existing programs that they once financed themselves. In effect,
the budgetary switch frees state and local money, but does not
result in any new services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of Gov. George Pataki, a Republican,
acknowledges that using federal money to pay for programs that the
state used to support has freed up $1 billion in state money _
money that could be used for school aid, tax cuts, or any other
state budget priority. Officials at the state Senate and some
independent analysts say the figure is closer to $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State officials defend the practice, saying that the state
continues to spend about $1.7 billion annually from its own coffers
to provide benefits and services to welfare recipients. In all,
they say, the state has spent $10.4 billion on the poor since the
1996 federal welfare overhaul, pumping money not only into
traditional public-assistance grants but also into new programs to
help recipients make a permanent transition into employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two groups of individuals who think that $10
billion is not a lot of money,'' said John Madden, a spokesman for
the state's Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. ``One is
federal bureaucrats, and the other is advocates for the failed
welfare system.''

 By JEFF GERTH and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, 1982, in a laboratory at Columbia University, a
little-known science professor, Laszlo Z. Bito, finished a
nine-month experiment on the eyes of cats. In his handwritten data,
carefully charted in gray hardcover notebooks, lay the origins of
what every pharmaceutical company longs for: a blockbuster drug.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is Xalatan, a best-selling eyedrop for glaucoma. With
$507 million in sales last year _ and the potential for billions
more, most of it pure profit _ the 4-year-old medicine is the
equivalent of liquid gold for its manufacturer, Pharmacia Corp. The
eyedrop earned Columbia University about $20 million in royalties
last year, and it has made a millionaire of Bito as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other, unseen, partners in the creation of
Xalatan: the American taxpayers, who backed Bito's work with $4
million from the National Institutes of Health. The taxpayers have
reaped no financial return on their investment; their reward,
government officials say, is the eyedrop itself.
</P>
<P>
   Xalatan costs patients $45 to $50 for a tiny bottle that lasts
six weeks. That price _ about $1 a day for a drug that staves off
blindness _ may not seem excessive. But the key ingredient in that
daily dose costs Pharmacia only pennies to make, and Americans, who
live in the only industrialized nation that lacks government
restraints on drug prices, pay more than twice what European
patients pay for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   To officials at Pharmacia, the price is fair. ``We are bringing
forth innovation,'' said Dr. Anders Harfstrand, the company's vice
president for ophthalmology, ``and innovation always brings a
premium.''
</P>
<P>
   In this election year, the cost of prescription medicines is at
the center of the political debate. With the biomedical revolution
yielding a flood of new therapies, drugs are now the
fastest-growing component of the United States'
trillion-dollar-a-year medical bill.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress contemplates expanding Medicare to include
prescription-drug coverage and some states move to bring drug
prices more in line with those in foreign countries, the industry
is struggling to fend off federal regulation that might limit its
ability to set prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the fight is Harfstrand's contention that the
price of medication is justified by the extreme risk of failure and
high cost of drug discovery _ an average of $500 million per drug,
by the industry's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument that the pharmaceutical industry, one of the
world's most lucrative and secretive businesses, has relied on for
over 40 years. But it has rarely been put under a microscope,
because the industry will not divulge the costs of researching and
developing a particular drug.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on the subject, The New York Times examined
Xalatan, from its genesis in Bito's laboratory to its arrival in
the medicine cabinets of patients in 57 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia declined to disclose specific financial information
about the making of the drug. But through interviews with key
participants and an analysis of publicly available documents, the
examination found, among other things, that Pharmacia spent no more
than $150,000 to buy the rights to Bito's invention from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Though it later spent tens of millions of its own money to
develop the drug, the company acknowledges that Bito, with the
taxpayers' support, provided it an ``uncut diamond'' that later
became Xalatan.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's reliance on taxpayer-supported research _
characterized as ``a subsidy'' by the very same economists whose
work the industry relies on _ is commonplace, the examination also
found. So commonplace, in fact, that one industry expert is now
raising questions about the companies' arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Dr. Nelson Levy, a former head of research and
development at Abbott Laboratories, who now works as a consultant
for industry and the federal government on drug development,
bluntly challenged the industry's oft-repeated cost of developing a
drug. ``That it costs $500 million to develop a drug,'' Levy said
in a recent interview, ``is a lot of bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the examination found, federal officials have abandoned
or ignored policies that could have led to lower prices for
medicines developed with taxpayer dollars. That is partly because
the government has lost track of what drugs are invented with its
money, and partly, officials say, because the industry resisted
government efforts to get involved in pricing.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1980, Congress passed legislation that directed
federally financed researchers like Bito to patent their
inventions, or risk losing control of them to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayh-Dole Law was designed to push federally financed
research from the university laboratory into the marketplace.
Scientists who made discoveries using taxpayer money were required
to file invention reports with the government. Universities were
directed to license patented inventions to companies that would
commercialize them.
</P>
<P>
   The law was originally passed to aid small businesses, but later
it was modified so that even big companies like Pharmacia could
benefit. If a company did not develop a product quickly enough, the
government could revoke the company's license and hand the job over
to a competitor. It could also take control of an invention to
alleviate ``health or safety needs,'' the law said.
</P>
<P>
   Once an invention is on the market, the law grants the
government the right to buy it without paying customary royalties.
At the same time, say patent experts in the Clinton administration
and at the National Science Foundation, other laws enable federal
agencies to put taxpayer-financed inventions out to competitive
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government, which buys Xalatan, could give
companies other than Pharmacia the opportunity to manufacture the
eyedrop and sell it at a lower price _ but only to the government.
</P>
<P>
   So, these experts say, the Bayh-Dole law, in conjunction with
other provisions, could result in lower drug prices for the
Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of
Health, two major purchasers of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 20 years since the Bayh-Dole bill became law, the
government has not taken advantage of these provisions, say
officials at the health institutes. One reason, said Dr. Wendy
Baldwin, a deputy director at the agency, is that the government
already buys drugs cheaply by purchasing them in bulk. But even if
federal officials wanted to use the Bayh-Dole Act to get medicines
at still lower prices, they could not, because they do not keep
track of products, including drugs, that are invented with taxpayer
money.
</P>
<P>
   That failure has drawn criticism from the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, which last year
conducted a review of the government's invention reporting system.
``Inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent,'' the accounting office
concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y. _ Snugly sheltered by geography and
sensibility from the workaday bustle of Long Island's North Fork
and the antsy glamour of the Hamptons to the south, this summer
resort island has become a kind of year-round Elder Dorado. More
than a third of its 2,300 winter residents are over 60, which is
twice the average nationally and in the metropolitan area. The
percentage may be even higher insummer when the population swells
to about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But even when gray is a primary color, it is not an ethnic,
racial, religious or socioeconomic group.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anthropologists from the booming geriatric-industrial
complex might find a monograph of sorts here in the faltering
campaign by some older residents to build a $750,000 center
exclusively for the island's elderly. The plan has been attacked by
some of the island's old people who think a senior center is
unnecessary or should not be done without doing something as well
for working parents and teen-agers; they seem afraid of a tax
increase, of change, of isolation, of seeming greedy, of being a
burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which old people are we talking about?'' asks the Rev. Fred
Puelle, 65, a retired Lutheran minister who leads the island's
Senior Citizens Affairs Council, an advisory board, and delivers
Meals on Wheels. ``The ones rocking in the corner or the folks who
flirt, work out at the fitness center and enjoy the grape? The
folks waiting for me to bring them food or the ones down in Palm
Beach for the winter?''
</P>
<P>
   Rockers or flirters, natives or weekenders, the old on Shelter
Island did not arrive from somewhere else waving Medicare cards and
a lease on a condo in an isolated village with the word leisure or
heritage on the locked gate. Because the nation is aging rapidly,
what is happening here now, while unusual, may be the harbinger of
a returning way of life; the old here aged here and stayed here.
</P>
<P>
   This 8,000-acre island, one-third of which is protected by the
Nature Conservancy, was settled in the 17th century by the English,
who displaced Indians and built a food and timber plantation worked
by African slaves. Later, it was a base for commercial fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mansions are best seen from the water, and the
scattering of trailers and rusted cars in weedy backyards tend to
be clustered in the island's middle. Most homes appear to be middle
class, an eclectic mix of suburban ranches and split-levels, frame
cottages and beachy boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any small island where the inhabitants know all and
reveal little, the facades are misleading; living next door to
occasional weekenders with city apartments and stacks of frequent
flier miles are the house painters and real estate agents who
depend on them.
</P>
<P>
   And both groups include many on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The island is not a place created for the needs of
sunset-special diners; there are few stores or restaurants, it is
accessible only by ferry and plagued by power blackouts, rampaging
deer and Lyme ticks, all local badges of hardy courage. Local
politicians can safely express their concern for the young families
driven off-island because the older people who helped drive up real
estate prices are so fragmented by their politics, economics and
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to think that this island is very special,'' says Art
Barnett, the 70-year-old former publisher and editor of the weekly
Shelter Island Reporter and now its town hall reporter. ``But I've
come to think that it's like everywhere else, except maybe you can
see things more clearly here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most poignantly and universally, you can see those sore spots
where individual vulnerability rubs against independence, and where
the romanticized American past rubs against the present reality of
communities trying to care for their own. The heroes of the island
are the volunteers of the fire and rescue companies; yet the aging
population has not only increased their workload, it has lowered
their pool of young recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, who opposes the all-senior center, and Seymour
Weissman, 68, its most vocal champion, are aware of those sore
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Weissman, a retired Manhattan television producer, describes
himself as the flamethrower of the nonprofit foundation formed to
raise the money for the prospective all-senior center. Stocky,
emphatic, he punches out his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an invisible elderly population here suffering from
malnutrition and from the greatest disease of all, loneliness,'' he
said. ``A center would offer socialization, give caregivers
respite, we could have nurses, technicians, social workers come in
from off-island. There's a great deal of federal and foundation
money available, but you have to have the building first. The money
goes to programs, not to bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett discounts Weissman's bleak portrait as he campaigns for
the renovation of the local American Legion hall, underused as old
soldiers fade away, into a community center for children,
teen-agers and the elderly. A former marketing executive from Long
Island, trim and measured, Barnett speaks softly about using the
past for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for what I call noninstitutional care,'' he said.
``Neighbors looking out for each other, the way it's always been.
It never gets into The Reporter, but the police are always helping
an old man back into his bed, reassuring an old woman who has heard
sounds in the night. Someone brings a casserole, drives you to the
doctor, takes care of the dog. Someone looks out and sees that the
lights are still on in Charlie's house, the newspaper hasn't been
picked up, and calls Henrietta, who probably has done something
about it already.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Henrietta Roberts, 67, the part-time coordinator of Senior
Services, checks on three shut-ins on her way home and runs a
``telephone reassurance'' network for 14 others. But she thinks
that ``the islander mentality of taking care of their own'' may be
outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked once, but there are too many old people now,'' she
said, in her basement room off the Red Cross offices. An attached
garage is crammed with donated canes, walkers and wheelchairs. ``I
think we may now have almost 1,000 seniors on the island. They are
living so long that their problems become very complex. Just like
everywhere else. Sometimes this work is so depressing. It's a
crystal ball of what's coming for me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As did Weissman and Barnett, Roberts moved here permanently
after years of vacationing on the island. She retired as a human
resources manager for a Manhattan corporation. She likes the idea
of an all-senior center because of the services and personnel it
could draw, but she is torn; her 15-year-old grandson also needs a
safe place to drop in with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it's all about money,'' she said. ``People are
afraid of taxes. When I wrote to the seniors about the Town Board
giving us the land for a center, I got a letter back asking me to
use cheaper stationery.''
</P>
<P>
   Money creeps into every conversation about the center. Critics
of the proposed building roll their eyes at an architect's
rendering of four offices, a conference room, a classroom, a porch,
a patio and a fireplace, and landscaped grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the total community,'' Barnett said,
``because you can't separate the needs of the aging from the needs
of their grandchildren _ who may need a youth center to let off
steam _ and of their sons and daughters who work and need day care
for the kids. We don't even know exactly what the needs of the
community are, and here we have a $750,000 Taj Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   Weissman bristles at that. ``Too good for old people? No one
really wants to deal with this; the problems of old age are viewed
with horror, coming attractions to be denied. No celebrities, it's
not sexy. The Yacht Club raises money to send a young sailor around
the world to race. That's fine so long as it's not at the expense
of what's really necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes a deep breath. ``You know what it really is. Pure class
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   A more recent class warfare story is told at the weekly
community-wide senior lunch at the Presbyterian church, the current
headquarters of senior nutrition services paid by Suffolk County.
About a year ago, 14 older bridge players from the Ram Island
neighborhood, the island's geographical and social Upper East Side,
appeared one Monday. The regulars were thrilled and intimidated.
The newcomers sat by themselves at the $2 lunch, stayed late to
play cards and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   But the moral of that story _ rich folks are snooty _ loses
steam quickly; the regulars had made no effort to welcome the upper
crust and, in fact, do not much mix among themselves either.
Husbands and wives save seats for each other.
</P>
<P>
   At a Monday lunch, Alice Fiske, coquettish about her age and
dressed for a cocktail party, dismissed the cliquish Ram Islanders
with a wave, as only she can. She is the grande dame of Sylvester
Manor, the island's original English settlement. Her late husband's
ancestors once ran the slave plantation on the site. Why does she
come to Monday lunch? ``It is my duty,'' she said, ``to support
worthy causes.''
</P>
<P>
   She expressed her noblesse oblige amid 30 lively middle-class
diners, mostly in their late 70s and early 80s. Typically, they had
retired to Shelter Island 20 years ago after many years of
summering here or visiting relatives. They had driven themselves to
the church. They all happily complained about how busy their lives
were; after lunch, which few lingered over, they had to rush off to
shop, walk the dog, quilt, get to a meeting, pick up a grandchild,
see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant Alice Fiske noted that no one had done a real study
of what anybody of any age really needed. What kind of building do
older people want? And which programs? Do Shelter Island retirees
need or want square dance lessons, a dialysis unit, day care for
Alzheimer's patients? She said she wanted more details about the
kind of activities in any new center. ``Why are old people old?''
she asked. ``Because younger people put them in places and stack
them like logs.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of a random telephone poll of 300 residents,
presented to the Town Board two weeks ago, seemed to indicate that
if no tax money was involved, people had no strong preferences
among a community center, a youth center or a senior center. But
the center dropped out of favor if taxes needed to be raised 3 to 5
percent. Where had those figures come from?
</P>
<P>
   Town Supervisor Gerry Siller said he did not know, although he
had endorsed the poll. He said it was financed by an anonymous
older resident who had rejected Weissman's plea for a donation,
citing a lack of data. The senior issue, Puelle thinks, needs more
than just money. ``There has to be a readjustment in attitude,'' he
said. ``It's about acknowledging a population that no one _
including members of the population _ really wants to identify
with.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking fast as he steered the Meals on Wheels van up a
driveway of overgrown weeds and broken concrete. In the back, his
wife, Doris, also 65, was preparing the boxes of food.
</P>
<P>
   This first house was dark, overheated and stinking of liniment,
as were most of the dozen houses he visited that day. Puelle
checked for danger signals: too many days of unwashed dishes,
bathroom smells, moans of pain. A querulous voice from a distant
room ordered him to just put the food on a kitchen counter strewn
with prescription medicine vials. Puelle called out his standard
farewell, ``See you next week, God willing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van, he asked, ``So, what kind of senior center does
he need? Do Doris and I need?''

 &HT;    Florida school deals with `failing' label
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ One by one, second-graders in Patricia
Ferrell's class dropped objects into a glass bowl at the front of
the class. A wooden block. Next, a paper clip. Then a cotton ball,
crayon and marble. Marquis, one of the student volunteers, pinched
the marble between his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it sink or float?'' Ferrell asked her class of 20 kids.
``Who thinks it will sink?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every hand shot up. Marquis released the glass ball.
``Yes! Yes!'' kids cheered as the ball sank.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unremarkable grade-school exercise in a lot of places,
as common as fishsticks and white milk in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   But here, any bit of learning is as cherished as a Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate small victories,'' said Judith Ladner, principal
at A.A. Dixon Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the marble, Dixon's 370 kids are in their own
fishbowl. They're scrutinized as products from one of the state's
only two ``failing'' public schools. The school has been labeled
under the education reform plan championed by Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Bush's reform are tax-subsidized vouchers, which
parents can use to help pay for private-school tuition. Legislators
in Georgia and Alabama have joined the nationwide throng debating
vouchers as a tool to improve public schools. Vouchers and a state
education lottery will figure prominently in this fall's
gubernatorial race in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, students gain voucher eligibility if their public
schools fail a controversial standardized test two years in a row.
Bush reasons the pressure of losing state financing _ up to $4,000
per voucher _ forces underachieving schools to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 78 schools failed the test. When test scores are
released in June, nearly 60,000 students statewide may become
eligible for vouchers. Currently, just 52 students in Pensacola are
using the ``opportunity scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   A state court in March ruled Florida's voucher system _ the
first statewide plan in the nation _ violated the state
constitution, threatening the quality of public education by
diverting tax money to private systems. Pensacola's voucher
students can remain at their private schools until the end of the
school year, the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the decision, a private group announced it has
raised $2 million to fund more than 1,100 new voucher students.
</P>
<P>
   POVERTY IS PREDICTOR
</P>
<P>
   For now, just two Pensacola elementary schools _ Dixon and
Spencer Bibbs Academy _ stick out as public institutions Florida
condemns as critically failing. The distinction makes their student
bodies eligible for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The designation is based on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment
Test, the so-called FCAT. At a ``C'' school, 60 percent of students
pass the reading and writing segments. At Bibbs and Dixon last
year, just one-quarter of students passed the reading test; less
than one-third passed writing.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators and parents bristle at the failing label. Before
Bush implemented his ``A-plus'' plan, Dixon and Bibbs scrambled to
improve the way they taught. Writing teachers were hired. New
reading programs emerged. Computers were purchased. Bibbs started
after-school and weekend remediation programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you that we haven't made mistakes,'' said Ladner,
who became Dixon principal in 1994. ``But we've come a whole long
way in six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, school officials say, is a key predictor of academic
success.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and Bibbs are in the poorest sections of Pensacola, a Navy
town nestled near the sugar-white beaches of the Gulf of Mexico.
It's common for five or six kids in a family to share the same
mattress in public housing, teachers say. Some homes lack air
conditioning. Few kids from those schools have ever seen the sand
dunes 20 minutes across the Pensacola Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   There's daily exposure to crime. Drug deals can be seen walking
to school. Often, a parent goes to jail and the child ends up with
a grandparent or other relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take into consideration where the kids started,''
said Bibbs principal Linda Scott.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bibbs district, one-quarter of the 3,500 households fall
below the poverty level. Poverty hits two of every five families in
the Dixon district. When rent comes due, some families find a new
place to live.
</P>
<P>
   More than nine of every 10 kids at both schools qualify for free
or reduced lunches. All of Dixon's kids are entitled to free
breakfast. In poor homes, there's TV but little else. There's no
discussion. About anything. What language skills the kids develop
comes from whatever they saw on WWF wrestling the night before,
teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   In Linda Martin's Dixon kindergarten class, she runs through
simple exercises. ``Point to a girl,'' Martin commands. ``Now point
to a boy.'' Smiling kids swivel in their seats, pointing.
``Language is the big thing here,'' Ladner said. When adults do
talk with their children at home, ``it's not very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florida schools in similar depths of poverty have earned
passing grades. At Cleveland Elementary in Tampa, for example, 96
percent of the students receive free or reduced lunches _ a level
similar to Bibbs and Dixon. Cleveland earned a ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it can happen because schools are doing it,'' said
JoAnn Carrin, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education.
She said state Commissioner of Education Tom Gallagher ``feels very
strongly that inner-city schools should not have a different
standard. He feels all kids can learn and should have the same
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTERS IN CLASSROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and Bibbs are undeterred by the state's unwillingness to
consider the environment that surrounds the school when assigning
grades. At Dixon, 65 kindergarteners can read. At Bibbs, tests show
the children are learning more than a year's worth of schooling
every year. Banks of Macintosh computers sit in every classroom at
Bibbs, a technology magnet for the Escambia County school district.
In the morning, students put together their own closed-circuit
television broadcasts of school announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things we do that aren't measured by the
(FCAT) test,'' said Scott, the Bibbs principal. As with Ladner at
Dixon, Bibbs knows nearly every student by name. They wave or rush
to hug her when she walks the halls or enters a class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would put my kids up with anybody as being marketable for
jobs of the future,'' Scott said. ``To say they're failures, that's
not right. That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoniette Stallworth, a 32-year-old homemaker, agrees. She
moved out of district but chose to keep her three children _ from
kindergarten to fourth grade _ enrolled at Bibbs. Pro-voucher
groups tried convincing her to move her kids to a private school.
At her husband's accounting office, people always ask why they keep
their kids at an ``F'' school. Her parents ask the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them have actually been to Bibbs,'' Stallworth said.
``We try to build a rapport with all of the teachers. From the
first day, we felt very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   With an emphasis on direct instruction in reading, Scott is
confident Bibbs will come off the failing list when statewide
standardized test scores are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can learn just the same as anyone else,'' Scott said,
``they just don't have the same skills when they get here.''

KNICKS' CHALLENGE: GET AN EARLY JUMP ON YOUNG RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The image is always the same. It is the opening
minutes of the game, and an exasperated Jeff Van Gundy is standing
in front of his team, with his jaw clenched as tight as a fist.
</P>
<P>
   He has called a timeout. It is maybe four minutes into the game.
And already there is a gaudy deficit, maybe eight points or 10.
Already, Vince Carter has driven, pulled up and unleashed a flurry
of fadeaway jumpers. Already, Latrell Sprewell and Larry Johnson
have had their confidence shaken like a carton of orange juice.
Already, Allan Houston's defense has been mocked by Tracy McGrady
or Dell Curry or Doug Christie. Already, Patrick Ewing has been
knocked on his 37-year-old duff by his former bodyguard, Charles
Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there is trouble. Deep inside the huddle of giants, the
diminutive Van Gundy thinks for a bit, then unleashes a vehement
plea for his players to get it together, only to see them fail time
and again to rescue the outcome. In the first quarter of their last
three games with the Toronto Raptors, the Knicks have trailed
32-16, 26-18 and 28-11. In each instance, they have gone on to lose
by double-digit margins.
</P>
<P>
   In a first-round, three-of-five-game playoff series, there is
little time for recovery. Under pressure to maintain home-court
advantage, the third-seeded Knicks could face a demoralizing
situation if they allow the sixth-seeded Raptors to seize quick
control of Game 1 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt they've dominated us in the first quarter,''
Van Gundy said after his team's first of two workouts on Friday at
SUNY-Purchase. ``They've been more ready earlier in the game than
we have to compete at the level you need to compete at. Their
intensity has been much greater than ours earlier in the game. I
think our starters have played fairly hard, but I think their
starters have been off the chart. I think their intensity and focus
and physical presence has been dominating.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been devastating to the Knicks' spirits. But as Ewing
proclaimed last week, ``It's a new day.'' That is how the Knicks
are treating it. They believe in their preparation, their ability
to flip a switch for instant intensity, and their pattern of
inhaling the air of desperation and turning it into adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally and physically, we'll be ready,'' Sprewell said. ``I
know this team. I don't think we're intimidated by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors' initial wave of energy is daunting, though. In each
game, they have come tearing out with the enthusiasm of Pop Warner
football players bursting through poster paper. So far, the Knicks
have failed to match them. In fact, they have come unglued in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving the ball, the Knicks panic. In their last
three games against the Raptors, the Knicks had a total of seven
assists in the first quarter, while their more fluid opponents in
purple combined for 32. As a result of rushed shots, quick jumpers
and failed one-on-one attempts, the Knicks are often out of the
game before it even begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have to look for each other more,'' Sprewell
said. ``We have to find each other, play unselfish. That's when
we're at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   They have to unearth their defense, as well. That means not
getting lost in the Raptors' pick-and-roll routines. And that means
confronting their fear of Carter. So far, Sprewell and Johnson _
both of whom will spend time guarding Carter _ have allowed the
Raptors' sleek superstar to shoot 60 percent and average 33 points
a game.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting reels of film, Van Gundy could come up with a
different look to start the game. Maybe the Knicks will double-team
Carter, funnel him into help or mix up the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do new things,'' said Van Gundy, who did not disclose
what his matchups would be. ``But I don't think in two days you can
reinvent yourself. Whatever you do, you have to do it with passion.
A lot of different guys will have the opportunity to play Vince
Carter. It can be anybody, and it will probably be everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Carter who has unsettled the Knicks. It is
the way Houston has been shut down by the long-armed McGrady. ``I
just have to be more assertive, and I will,'' Houston vowed.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the way Oakley has inserted his elbows into the
Knicks' subconscious. ``I've said it before,'' said Ewing, who has
been roughed up by the gruff veteran who used to protect him as a
Knick. ``Oak has been in a lot of wars with us. Unfortunately, he's
on the other team now. We have to do our job just like he does
his.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until now, the Knicks have been procrastinators against
the Raptors. They have waited to see how the Raptors will come out
and have paid dearly with an ominous deficit. This time, they want
to make the Raptors adjust. This time, they want to beat Toronto, a
team stocked with young, untested stars, with their experience and
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy could surprise the Raptors with the big backcourt. At
times, Van Gundy will probably use Sprewell and Houston as a
counter to Christie and McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're holding it in hiding,'' Van Gundy said.
``We've used the big backcourt to start the last home game we had
with them, and we were down, 31-23. So can it be effective? Sure it
can. Has it been ineffective against them like everything else?
Absolutely. Everyone whips it out as the cure-all. It's not the
cure-all.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution may be found at the start. Can the Knicks be the
aggressors? Can they dilute Carter's immediate impact? Can they
take control of Game 1? To lose it would be mentally devastating,
considering it would be the Knicks' fourth loss in a row to the
Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't shoot ourselves in the foot,'' Houston said. ``We
have to set the tone from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   If Van Gundy is forced to call a timeout _ maybe four or six
minutes into the game _ there is trouble, big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always digging holes and trying to crawl out of them,''
said Marcus Camby, whose challenge is to be the X-factor in the
playoffs that he was last season. ``It's almost impossible to do,
especially if Vince starts scoring a lot of points. Our starters
have to get us off to a good start, and us bench guys have to come
in with that spark that we need. We can't start by trailing.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Repeal of the estate tax may be well on its way
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some of the wealthiest people in the country could
get an enormous break, because growing opposition to estate tax may
lead to its repeal or reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Very few Americans ever come face to face with the estate tax,
the levy assessed by the government on what wealthy Americans leave
behind when they die. The first $675,000 is exempt from taxes this
year, and that figure will rise to $1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of the 2.5 million Americans who are
expected to die this year will leave estates large enough to be
taxed, according to an estimate by Congress's Joint Committee on
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Why then does a majority of the House of Representatives back a
bill to repeal the tax House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas)
calls ``the despicable death tax''?
</P>
<P>
   Armey promises the House will take up the subject when lawmakers
return from their Easter vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation in the Senate has 24 sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   And George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, favors eliminating the estate tax, which his tax plan
calls ``the antithesis of the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear the tax's defenders tell it, Republicans _ who
predominate in the opposition to the estate tax _ are speaking up
for their political benefactors. Estate taxes, its supporters say,
help keep the tax system progressive and spur charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to other ways of paying for government, who could
quarrel with a tax that raises a good deal of money without
bothering almost 99 percent of us?'' said Robert McIntyre,
executive director of the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice, in a
posting on the think tank's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, leaders of the movement to abolish the tax have
recognized some of the obstacles they face. They studiously avoid
calling it an estate tax, preferring the harsher-sounding death tax
instead.
</P>
<P>
   And they have attempted to remake their image to look more like
America. It used to be the public face of the lobbying effort was
``middle-aged white guys who were well off,'' said Frank Blethen,
publisher of The Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   Blethen, 54, who fits the category he described, is among the
more vocal newspaper owners who call for getting rid of the estate
tax as a way to keep family owned papers from going public or being
gobbled up by large chains.
</P>
<P>
   The National Black Chamber of Commerce argues the estate tax
deprives African-Americans of the means to economic empowerment.
And the issue is a growing concern to women who own businesses,
according to a study by the Center for the Study of Taxation, a
California group that staunchly opposes estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The chief argument of many owners of family businesses,
including family farms, is the estate tax takes such a large bite
out of their holdings the value is vastly diminished when it passes
to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   The tax is especially hard on land-rich but cash-poor farmers
who may have to sell off land to pay the government.
</P>
<P>
   Studies cited by opponents of the tax say the estate tax's
consequences are dire for many business owners. One figure cited by
Armey states flatly that ``70 percent of family businesses fail to
survive the first generation because of this unjust tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Blethen, who has spent tens of thousands of dollars over 25
years to ensure his newspaper will remain in the family, conceded
the possibility Blethen might lose control of The Seattle Times is
at least two generations away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reason I've become so passionate is that I don't want
anyone else to go through what I and my family have gone through,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another statistic sometimes cited by proponents of repeal is
family businesses make up less than 10 percent of the estates that
are subject to estate taxes each year.
</P>
<P>
   Even academics who favor the taxation of wealth at death support
changing the tax structure to take care of not liquid family
businesses. ``Most large estates are very liquid, and exempting
farms and small business would cost a relatively small part of the
revenue,'' said Michael Graetz, a Yale Law School professor and tax
expert.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle to full repeal may be the budgetary constraints put
in place by the Republican-controlled Congress. The estate tax will
generate nearly $30 billion this year, and any plan to forgo that
money has to replace it, or eat into anticipated budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the estate tax is just one of several tax
provisions Republicans are eager to send to President Clinton. They
have little hope of enacting major tax breaks this year, but want
to be able to use the topic in this fall's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the event Bush is elected and Republicans retain control of
Congress, next year could bring substantial tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with soaring home values and retirement savings plans that
have boosted many Americans' wealth in recent years, most Americans
will remain unaffected by the 84-year-old estate tax, according to
projections.
</P>
<P>
   The tax was created to keep the wealthy industrialists of the
early 20th century from passing too large a share of their fortunes
to succeeding generations.
</P>
<P>
   The tax may have failed in that respect. Families like the
Carnegies and Rockefellers have done well.
</P>
<P>
   But as George McGovern learned when he proposed startlingly high
taxes on inheritances during his 1972 presidential campaign, voters
object to the government taking too much of what parents save for
their children, even when the threshold approaches $1 million a
parent.

GIULIANI SAYS CASTRO ORCHESTRATED GONZALEZ RAID 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lashed out at the Clinton
administration Saturday for the early-morning raid that snatched
Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives, saying that
the government had sent ``storm troopers using guns'' to do the
bidding of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the saddest days we've seen,'' Giuliani said at a
press conference at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The
mayor condemned the Justice Department's use of armed federal
agents ``pointing guns at people to rip a boy away from a family
that is caring for him, and a boy who has at least indicated an
interest in growing up in democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said the government had
been a pawn of the Cuban dictator. ``You would have to have ignored
the whole history of communism not to realize that this is an
orchestrated plot by Castro,'' he said. ``It is even said that when
he goes back to Cuba he will have to go into an indoctrination
camp. I can't imagine that the American administration has lost its
way so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said repeatedly that Elian should be granted asylum
in the United States, and has focused on what he calls White House
ineptitude in the case in his Senate campaign against Hillary
Rodham Clinton. He harshly criticized Attorney General Janet Reno,
saying, ``She should have negotiated as long as it took.'' He
added: ``She has had some pretty disgraceful situations as attorney
general, but this one probably ranks right up there. It has been a
heck of tenure as attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani focused his most passionate remarks on President
Clinton, who he suggested had given in to influence from Castro and
had ignored the threat of communism. Giuliani has frequently warned
of the dangers of being complacent about communism in campaign
appearances and remarks to reporters at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he thought the White House had decided to
forcibly remove Elian, he said: ``I have to imagine it has to do
with deals, arrangements, negotiations with Fidel Castro. The
person calling the shots here as usual in foreign policy is not
President Clinton; the person calling the shots is Fidel Castro.''

OUTDOORS: TIME TO PRACTICE THE CALL OF THE TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many veteran turkey hunters are already prowling hardwood
hillsides trying to locate male wild turkeys, which will become
legal game when New York state's monthlong spring season for them
opens May 1. Although gobblers are bagged by those who eschew this
preseason ritual, taking part in it improves your chances of
success.
</P>
<P>
   The spring season, limited to bearded birds _ females are rarely
so adorned _ comes when most hens are on their nests. There will be
a few still seeking impregnation, and they are the ones the
impassioned toms are after. Hunting ends at noon each day because
the females don't usually take a daily break from sitting on their
10 to 12 eggs until that time. Hens have to eat, too, and once the
heady business of mating is done, the gobbler's contributions to
the various females he has serviced are over. Thus, the eggs of a
deceased hen are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Few hens are shot by mistake. In addition to almost never having
a beard, the hen is smaller and of a much lighter hue than the
male, and its approach to the hidden hunter's yelping is totally
unlike the strutting arrival of the gobbler. His tail feathers are
usually spread out like a fan and his wing tips drag along the
ground. Also, the male's head is a garish mixture of red, white and
blue, while that of the hen is a muted blue-gray and gray.
</P>
<P>
   Fully camouflaged, the human hunter sits down in a likely spot,
back against a tree _ one, hopefully, within hearing distance of a
gobbler _ and begins talking turkey, which is defined by the
dictionary as blunt or candid communication. For the hunter's
purposes, brevity is a quality also much desired. If you give vent
to a hen's yelp and a gobbler answers, control your ardor; don't
launch into a continuous spate of yelping. Wait five or 10 minutes
or more and perhaps you'll hear the tom's gobble close at hand or
hear him running through the forest duff. Unless you are a master
caller, fewer yelps are always better than more. You may hit a sour
note and spoil the whole gambit.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to get an early start. Most spring gobblers are
taken in the first hour of daylight, so you have to make your way
to your chosen location in darkness and be in position before dawn.
Make yourself as comfortable as possible, be sure you have a good
field of view and remember that toms sometimes have a disconcerting
habit of approaching from behind. As an aside, if you've got the
yen for it, and the stamina, you can devote the afternoons of your
New York state turkey hunting to trout fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In spring, the yelp of the hen is the basic call. The
swinging-lid box call is the easiest to master and has the greatest
range. Its disadvantage is that you can't operate it and hold your
gun at the ready at the same time. Turkeys have marvelous vision
and can spot hand movements. The so-called diaphragm call, which is
held in your mouth, does away with this problem, but its range is
more limited and it takes quite a bit of practice to learn how to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   Spring turkey hunters sometimes gobble. The purpose of this is
to attract a tom who is enraged that another male has invaded his
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey hunting equipment is becoming increasingly sophisticated.
The March 28, 1999, catalog of Uncle Lee's Wing Supply in
Greenville, Ky., lists hundreds of turkey calls, including box
calls, diaphragm calls, push-button box calls, slate calls, glass
calls, copper pot and pump action calls, gobbler shaker calls and
even owl calls. The last-named are sometimes used to locate
roosting gobblers at dawn. Such birds will also occasionally
respond to a crow call. Wing Supply also offers dozens of turkey
decoys. Spring hunters often use decoys, a common combination being
a jake and two hens. A jake is a young male turkey whose presence
with the hens is calculated to raise the ire of the area's dominant
gobbler. Decoys are also used in the fall when hunting with dogs is
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Only shotguns and shells loaded with bird shot may be used when
hunting turkeys with firearms in New York State. Shot size cannot
be larger than No. 2 or smaller than No. 8. Full choke is
recommended. A special turkey permit is needed in addition to a
hunting license. The bag limit is one bird a day, two for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't already done it, it's wise to draw the head and
neck of a turkey to size on a sheet of paper and fire at it from a
distance of 30 or 40 yards with the load you intend to use. If the
shot pattern is evenly dispersed, centered on the head and neck
with no so-called ``blown'' areas, and there are several pellets in
vital areas, you're in business. You can usually deal with a blown
pattern by changing the load or the choke, or both, but if the
pattern isn't centered on the target, you'll have to remind
yourself to compensate for this at the moment of truth by holding a
bit high or low or left or right. A few turkey hunters use shotguns
equipped with adjustable iron sights or scope sights. Such sights
can be adjusted for windage and elevation.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Cole, wildlife manager for New York state's Region 3,
said: ``This past winter wasn't bad, so it probably didn't have
much effect on turkey populations. We've also had a lot of turkey
sightings. We should have a good season.''
</P>
<P>
   The turkey take is usually higher in the spring season. In New
York state, the spring kill, 1996 through 1999, was, in order,
10,341, 9,159, 9,189 and 8,973; the fall kill for the same years
was 5,043, 7,464, 5,985 and 7,666.
</P>
<P>
   And if you've ever wondered why this splendid, wily bird that is
indigenous to North America was named after another country, the
Pilgrims are to blame. They believed it to be a species of New
World guinea fowl. Guinea fowl had been brought to England by
Turkish traders, and the English called them turkey hens and turkey
cocks. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ He knows they are whispering about him. He hears
the chatter between mother and daughter at the red light on the
corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Lucerne Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would he be in traffic, riding a big, red motorcycle in
the middle of the afternoon?''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal turns around and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I want to?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal guns his candy-apple red, custom Titan with the obscenely
long forks and motors from a light practice to his acupuncturist in
Thousand Oaks for a blood-letting treatment, has a couple of slices
of pizza at a place off Ventura Boulevard and then peels off into a
parfait sunset, toward the Santa Monica Mountains, where the
biggest star in the NBA lives.
</P>
<P>
   On his way through the traffic-choked streets of L.A., he barks
back at a miniature schnauzer in a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   You follow him down Sepulveda for miles, hitting each traffic
light.
</P>
<P>
   At one intersection, O'Neal points to an American Express
billboard with his mammoth smiling face beside the words,
``Invincible since '92.''
</P>
<P>
   He points and opens his arms wide, a big man living large,
inhaling everything about the town he has enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has been patient, they've been good to me,'' Shaq
said. ``They've been very good. They're just waiting for us to
bring it back. What's it been, a 12-year drought?''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers have not won a championship since
Showtime started its decline in 1988. They are not long-suffering
fans, but they miss the way Magic Johnson distilled a city with his
boyish exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Magic may be gone, but here comes Shaq, pulling up to the red
light with a helmet to match his bike, a helmet that bears the
Superman logo and barely fits his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a city filled with celebrities like L.A. _ all the
so-called Hollywood glitz and glamour _ it's nice to have the best
player in the league on that team,'' said Rick Fox, O'Neal's
teammate and a part-time actor who is married to Vanessa Williams.
``As animated as Shaquille is, it's pretty clear he's best suited
for this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is a very L.A. kind of day for O'Neal on his motorcycle.
After his acupuncture treatment, he will eat, visit a friend, then
retreat to his 15,000-square foot home in Mulholland Estates.
O'Neal is allowed to drive a motorcycle, but he has a contract
clause that prohibits him from sky diving. ``I don't think I can
scuba or water ski either,'' he said. His neighbors in Mulholland
at various times of the year include Wayne Gretzky, Tom Arnold and
Loni Anderson _ ``that woman who took all of Burt Reynolds'
money,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the game's most awesome force leads the Lakers on
a path many believe will take them to a championship. ``This is the
way I thought he could play basketball,'' said Phil Jackson, the
Lakers' first-year coach who always coveted a center of O'Neal's
stature while building a dynasty in Chicago. ``All of a sudden he's
becoming a dominant player, starting to make an escalation we
haven't seen. I expect even more out of Shaq. He's just touching
the area.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's last trip to the NBA finals, when he played for
Orlando, is mostly forgettable, a four-game sweep to the Houston
Rockets in 1995. He came to the Lakers via free agency before the
1996-97 season. Though his teams have won a lot of games during the
regular season, O'Neal has battled nagging injuries and the
criticism accompanying an All-Star center swept from the playoffs
in three of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But he has just completed a most valuable player-type season,
his best in his eight seasons in the league. He led the NBA in
points (29.7), field-goal percentage (.574) and double-doubles
(63), and he ranked in the top five in six major statistical
categories. On March 6 _ his 28th birthday _ he exploded for 61
points against the Clippers. Everything he puts up, it seems, is
caught by the net.
</P>
<P>
   If he is still on his way to becoming king of his sport, he is
already approaching royalty away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the sprawling, beige-toned Santa Monica office of Leonard
Armato, O'Neal's agent whose big-man clientele once included Hakeem
Olajuwon and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, another O'Neal empire takes
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Armato is finishing an agreement with Digex, one of the largest
Web-hosting companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The agent has also entered O'Neal into an agreement with
FreeInternet.com. O'Neal and Bob, the talking baby in recent
advertisements, will appear in commercials together over the next
few weeks
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Shaq.com _ the site where you can watch O'Neal morph from
a gallery of baby and adolescent photos into a 7-foot-1-inch,
330-pound man with size-22 feet _ there is Dunk.net, an online
company that allows anyone to design his or her own custom-made
apparel and footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of `Be Like Mike' is over,'' Armato said. ``We don't
want you to be like Shaq. Shaq is going to inspire you to build
your own product. He wants you to be a mouse click away from the
selection you're going to make.''
</P>
<P>
   In Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 issue released in March,
O'Neal was listed at No. 35 _ his $31 million in salary and
endorsements surpassing David Letterman and Howard Stern. His net
worth is believed to be more than $100 million. Including a
collection of his greatest rap hits, O'Neal has released five CDs
and starred in two heavily panned movies, ``Kazaam'' and ``Steel.''
Armato said he is holding off on another film until he wins a pro
basketball title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done movies, he's done rap CDs,'' Jackson said. ``And now
he's moving into the technology areas. He's been there and done
that, and seen what it can bring you and what it can't bring you. I
admire his perspective. Enterprising guy that he is, he has also
been able focus on what's important.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In November, that meant spending an extra hour after practice to
work on his free throws. Today, it means taking care of his body
with a visit to Shen Hsu.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu (pronounced Soo) is the director of Harmony Center
Acupuncture, Inc. Several of the Lakers receive treatment from Hsu,
including the veteran John Salley.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who has an inflammation in his right hip, ducks under a
6-10 doorway and into a cramped room. He removes his shirt, his
massive frame spilling over the treatment table. He plants his face
firmly in the headrest as Hsu goes to work, rubbing small plastic
suction cups along O'Neal's oiled back.
</P>
<P>
   Cupping and scraping are part of the Chinese folk medicine
tradition. Among other results, the process is said to purify the
blood and increase blood-cell production. The surface of the skin
is strongly sucked by the vacuum pressure in the cup, opening
capillary vessels and pores. It allows toxins to be excreted. It
also hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a tattoo,'' O'Neal said. ``Not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Certain days last season, I couldn't move my leg.
Shen would fix me up.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's lower body was in such pain from an abdominal strain,
he said: ``Without Shen, I couldn't have played last year. I'm
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The most painful process is yet to come. Hsu gently lances a
small, circular area on the right side of O'Neal's lower back, near
the top of his buttock. Placing the cup over the area, he holds it
there for several seconds until O'Neal's bright, red blood rises to
the surface. The process is continued for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe he let you watch the bloodletting,'' Salley
said while Hsu worked on O'Neal. ``I don't know how that'll go over
with people. I mean, we're Americans. This is Western civilization.
They might frown on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsu said: ``You see the movie `Sense and Sensibility'? They used
leeches for the bloodletting. It goes back to 18th-century England.
The farm-raised leeches are very expensive. The cupping is just as
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this, Shaq won't be walking like Patrick when
he's finished,'' Salley said, referring to the Knicks' Patrick
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's ingesting ginseng or eating healthful foods, O'Neal
is taking care of his body like never before. He lives with only a
personal chef, who prepares chicken, fish and vegetables. ``I'll
eat steak now and then, but I'm not a big red meat eater,'' he
said. ``My partying days are over. I've gotten serious about taking
care of my body. See, I don't get tired. I get beat up. You keep
chopping on a tree, you need to give the tree some rest so the
chlorophyll will fill back up and the tree gets its energy back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the acupuncture session, O'Neal walks down a flight of
stairs and sits in a mahogany-stained booth at a New York-style
pizzeria. He orders a plate of spaghetti with marinara sauce, two
slices of thin-crust cheese pizza and a large Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging nearly everyone who walked past him, O'Neal caught
a 10-year-old boy off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' the kid replied nonchalantly.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to a sudden halt behind O'Neal and taking one step back
to make sure it was indeed Shaq, the boy slowly mouthed to himself,
``Oh ... my ... God,'' before nearly running to tell his family.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot, O'Neal was approached by more people.
``Shaq, I don't know if you remember me,'' a young woman began,
``but I worked with you on `Kazaam.' I'm with Interscope.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked for an autograph for her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost you a dollar,'' he said to the woman, smiling. ``OK, I'll
let you go this time.''
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon, he looks into people's vehicles at nearly
every stoplight, acknowledging everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's slowly returning to that people-person side of him,'' Fox
said. ``The last few years, he's been stressed by the losing. But
you can see him start to come out of his shell, being playful and
enjoying himself. He is asked if he cares about his place in NBA
history. ``People are going to say Wilt is the greatest, Kareem is
the greatest,'' O'Neal said. ``I'm very honored to even have my
name mentioned. They don't even mention Ralph Sampson, and I
thought he was pretty good. They don't even mention Artis Gilmore.
Those guys were good. If my name is mentioned with Kareem or Wilt,
that's the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson? ``Big Ralph,'' O'Neal said. ``He had skills.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal straddles the handlebars on his Titan in the parking lot,
leans back and slowly pulls out. He motors up Ventura Boulevard,
merging into traffic, toward the hills, his sweatshirt and jeans
flopping in the breeze, blending seamlessly into the landscape.

Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and
author David Halberstam, who writes about why Vietnam has been so
stubborn in lingering in the American psyche.

Sheehan, who argues that Vietnam actually helped America because it
made us less willing to become the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   --An overview by Globe Deputy Managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr.
describing Vietnam today.
</P>
<P>
   --Four retrospective essays by Americans who had a range of

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS ARE OFFICIALLY ON BASEBALL'S CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somebody, please tell the New York Knicks to either
be very good or very brief. They and their entire league are
indulging in their annual habit of getting interesting just when it
is time to go outdoors and sniff the pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was so captivating in the first three weeks of the
season that the Knicks would never be missed if the Toronto Raptors
blew them away in three or four games. This is not to be construed
as a prediction or blatant rooting, just a humble observation.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much its chieftains monkey around with rocket
balls and interleague play and the threat of realignment, baseball
somehow bounces back in the spring as tenacious as dogwoods and
forsythia.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, basketball had the good taste to get out of the way
right about now. The least the Knicks could do is match the Yanks
and Mets for plot and performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks are compelling because of their generally unbeatable
mixture of skill and luck. The Mets are fascinating because of
their shock troops named Mora and Payton and Agbayani. Not only
that, but minor league baseball is also breaking out on Long Island
and in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkering down in the middle of all this are the Knicks _ still
potentially ornery enough and talented enough to grind down the
youthful Raptors, run away from the transitional Pacers and
outbounce the staggering Heat, all for the privilege of being
stuffed by Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   It would be admirable if the Knicks played with panache en route
to their ultimate thwacking. But the evidence is that these guys
lurch from one stinker of a game to one showcase of a game, with
almost no gear in between.
</P>
<P>
   That is not good enough. Either play consistent ball or bring on
Hefty Bag Day. At least the other team from Dolanland, the hapless
Rangers, had the class to not qualify for the playoffs, to get out
of our ocular and olfactory senses.
</P>
<P>
   From here on in, the Knicks need to justify their existence.
There is no great need for them anymore, it says here. Baseball
season commenced in Japan, where guys like Mark Grace of the Cubs
and Mike Piazza of the Mets seemed to get it, that it was really
cool to play games that count on the other side of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then they started to play back in North America. One of my
favorite snapshots of this early season was out of Seattle, where
Japan's career leader in saves, 31-year-old Kazuhiro Sasaki, stood
up in the Mariners' dugout while Mariano Rivera pitched in relief
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki was more than watching. He was observing. He was
studying. He was staring. His intense eyes seemed to say: ``So this
is Rivera-san. What's he got? Can I be as good as he is?''
</P>
<P>
   Another snapshot from this young season came from the Mets'
series in Pittsburgh last weekend. Jason Kendall, the Pirates
catcher, his ankle reconstructed from the ghastly injury last
summer, is back.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall leads off. Kendall hits with power. Kendall steals
bases. Kendall handles everything behind the plate. And with easy,
compact motions, Kendall fires strikes to second base. It was sheer
enjoyment to watch Kendall match his varied skills with Piazza's
innate offensive power and earnest defensive klutziness.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees. Good grief. The Yankees. Already, they are a whole
highlight film, including the umpire's blown call on Jorge Posada's
unassisted double play at the plate on a ball that bounced off the
batter's leg. Some of us have been watching grotesquely lucky
breaks like that for decades. Decades.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget this one: David Cone in trouble. Batter slaps
ball toward the mound. Cone can do no more than deflect it. Ball
bounces directly to Derek Jeter, who smoothly, softly, almost
arrogantly, charges, throws home for the tag at the plate. Yankee
luck? You bet. Yankee skill? Yeah, that too.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Met finesse. Last Wednesday night, Derek Bell
slapped not one but two singles through holes just vacated by
Milwaukee fielders. The Mets have often lacked for such
professional legerdemain with runners in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Bell apparently carries his bats with him wherever he goes, the
great bags under his eyes making him look as old as Wee Willie
Keeler, the turn-of-the-previous-century batsman, whose slogan was,
``Hit 'em where they ain't.'' He also makes sliding catches in
right field a la Ron Swoboda in the magic autumn of '69.
</P>
<P>
   With all these good things going on at ballparks near us, New
Yorkers really don't need one of those hot-cold playoffs by the
Knicks, when Patrick Ewing takes clueless fallaway jumpers one
night, and gallant buzzer-beating jumpers the next night.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need these mood swings, but the Knicks could
alternately trudge and saunter right through the Kentucky Derby,
right through lacrosse season, right through Venus Williams'
retirement before the French Open, right through the Indy 500,
right through the Stanley Cup finals _ maybe decided by a
legitimate goal, for a change _ right through a few Tiger Woods
victories, right up to Venus Williams' comeback before Wimbledon,
just in time for a John Rocker sighting in Flushing on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could eat up the springtime with Van Gundy-sighing,
Houston-disappearing, Sprewell-chucking, Thomas-fighting,
Camby-fouling, Johnson-scowling, Ewing-fumbling.
</P>
<P>
   They could obstruct truly worthy things like El Duque's poise
and Edgardo Alfonzo's swing. You would like to think the Knicks
could at least hog the springtime with style and grace. Nah. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FUTURE MAY BE LATER FOR PRESENT RAPTORS
</HEADLINE>
  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Take a good look at the future of professional
basketball over the next week to 13 days. That's all it may last
if, as expected, those hardened ratings-killers from Madison Square
Garden measure up to veteran playoff form.
</P>
<P>
   By sending Vince Carter back to his room after one measly round,
the New York Knicks could very well be dooming The Chosen One to a
succession of first-round defeats, to a prolonged state of Grant
Hill-hood. And if the Toronto Raptors don't make some postseason
noise, Carter may realize that all of the made-for-TV marketing and
magazine covers have come with a stiff price _ the one player he
will need to continue at his current Air Canada altitude and
address.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose, the Raptors will immediately have to turn their
attention to what would be a far more devastating defeat, the
potential free-agent defection of Tracy McGrady. ``He's in a
position to make a lot of money,'' said Marcus Camby, who played
one season in Toronto with McGrady, then right out of high school.
``I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is one thing. Attention is another. David Stern cannot be
pleased that McGrady will soon have the unencumbered right to cash
in his Canadian currency, to instantly become the generic go-to guy
in Orlando or Chicago. Without McGrady, Carter's cousin, his
Scottie Pippen, the Raptors would become Carter and the nonspeaking
cast of Jurassic Park, at least until Carter figures out a way back
to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Try to ignore all the network blather about the baby Raptors,
who are in the NBA playoffs for the first time during their
five-year history. Charles Oakley is not young, and nor are Antonio
Davis, Dell Curry, Kevin Willis, Muggsy Bogues, Dee Brown and, for
that matter, Doug Christie. If Toronto has a future, it is because
fate brought them Carter and McGrady, who, physically and
stylistically, are about as close as you get to Jordan and Pippen,
without cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the other day who McGrady most reminds him of, Jeff Van
Gundy paused fairly ponderously between ``You could easily'' and
``compare him to a Pippen.'' No coach and astute basketball mind
wants to make the cheap Next Jordan or Next Anyone comparison those
of us in the news media and in the league's overzealous marketing
department are so good at. Van Gundy couldn't help it, though,
after watching the 6-foot-8-inch McGrady do terrible things to
Allan Houston and the Knicks in the Raptors' home-court blowouts of
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the wingspan,'' Van Gundy said, ``and the ability to
have a dramatic impact on the game, and he doesn't have to have the
ball. People don't realize that he is the premier perimeter shot
blocker in the league, and he may be the premier perimeter defender
in the league. When you find a guy who doesn't have to have the
ball to have an impact, then you have a unique player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors had another such player, but they traded him to the
Knicks for an older, more earthbound model. That's a different
story entirely, but the reality is that without Camby and his
unique wingspan, the Knicks' frontline is as creaky and
unimaginative as Toronto's.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Indiana's Davises were going to dominate the Knicks
last spring in the conference final? Van Gundy had better hope that
Camby is healthy enough to again torment Antonio Davis, now manning
Toronto's middle, as well as Miami and Indiana, or whomever comes
next. The playoffs are all about improvisation, the element of
surprise. With all due respect to Patrick Ewing, Camby is as
central to the Knicks' championship hopes as McGrady is to Carter's
future in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern's minions just couldn't stop from getting way ahead
of themselves, from panicking over the regular-season ratings
plunge and rushing Carter into America's living rooms. The strategy
was short-sighted, begetting what could be a classic double
negative. What message will the public have received when Carter is
gone by the first week in May and what missive has McGrady possibly
rejected with regards to his own 20-year-old's ego?
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A, of course, was the former can't-miss tandem of
Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett, the Next Stockton and Malone.
Marbury leveraged his way out of Minnesota as soon as he realized
whose team that was, and always would be.
</P>
<P>
   It took Jordan and Pippen several years to become what they
finally were, to realize how much they needed each other to survive
the daunting playoff wars. Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant seem to
have finally figured it out, with a little help from Phil Jackson.
The Knicks, a team with no players among the leaders in most
statistical categories, at least know what these tension-filled
games are about. The Raptors, cast in the mold of the modern NBA,
will soon find out.
</P>
<P>
   Check your personal agendas at the door, or lose.  &QL;

 &HT;    ELIAN, JUAN MIGUEL REUNITED AT ANDREWS AFB
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. - After five months of separation,
young Elian Gonzalez was reunited Saturday morning with his father,
Juan Miguel, at this closed air force base outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Delivered here about 9:20 a.m. EST on a government plane after
being forcefully removed from his Miami relatives' home four hours
earlier, Elian spent the day in private on the base with his
father, step-mother, Nersy, and baby brother, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer, Gregory Craig, praised U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno for going the ``extra mile'' to get the
boy and his family together. In a telephone interview aired on CNN,
Craig said Elian appeared relaxed and happy in his father's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally at ease,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph taken by U.S. Marshals released showed a smiling
Elian being held by his beaming father and surrounded by Nersy and
baby Hianny. A second picture showed Elian again smiling, and
playing with Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   The hordes of media reporters, who were banned from the air
force base, congregated outside the main gate _ along with dozens
of protesters carrying rosaries and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am incensed . . . that a child could be taken in this way,''
said Ivette Curros, a Cuban-American immigrant and Miami resident
who was in the Washington D.C.-area en route to a convention in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Curros said she came to the base to protest the federal
government's effort to reunite the boy with his father, who plans
to return to communist Cuba following the current appeals process
in federal courts. ``I thank God every day that my mother risked
her life to come to this country,'' she said, adding that Elian,
whose mother died trying to reach the United States, should not be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Blazquez, who fled Cuba in 1967 and now lives in the
Washington area, agreed, saying the removal of Elian from the Miami
home was ``a stab in the back'' of the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   But while perhaps a dozen protesters opposed the government's
action, a roughly equal number supported the father-and-son
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian is not an orphan; it's not fair to keep him away from
his father,'' said Wanda Davis, a Washington-area resident who
stopped to cheer Elian's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
   She said while the 6-year-old was in Miami, Elian ``was being
used as a political pawn'' by Cuban-Americans. ``Now he is free,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's cousin and primary caregiver, Marisleysis Gonzalez, and
other Miami relatives arrived late Saturday afternoon on an
American Airlines flight into Washington-Reagan National Airport.
They hope to visit with the father and boy at Andrews, where they
are expected to remain sequestered for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews Air Force Base, just outside the nation's capital, is
the secured base used for the president's travels.

 &HT;    (1200&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuban exiles raged through the streets of Miami's Little
Havana Saturday, burning tires, overturning dumpsters and tangling
with roaming squads of riot-clad police who fired tear gas to quell
the outburst triggered by the pre-dawn removal of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible day,'' said Nancy Milian, 33, a
Cuban-American who joined the crowd on N.W. 27th Avenue. ``I'm
ashamed to be an American. Clinton is definitely leaving a legacy.
Cubans will never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   The lightning-strike raid to take the boy caught Miami's exiles
completely by surprise. Reporters estimated that only about 30 to
50 demonstrators were outside the house at 5:10 a.m. EST when
several white mini-vans pulled up to the home on N.W. Second
Street.
</P>
<P>
   A team of about one dozen black-clad officers fired a chemical
gas to disperse the crowd, while eight other officers wearing
helmets, flak jackets and carrying semi-automatic weapons battered
open the door of the house and swept inside. They held lawyers and
family members at gunpoint and snatched the boy from the arms of
one of the fisherman who rescued him at sea last Thanksgiving Day,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Elian screaming in English, 'Help me, help me,''' said
Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman, who was standing in a closet with
the boy. ``I just held his head. My God, America, what did you do
to this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer who had been invited into the
home pointed his camera and captured an image that was flashed
around the world within minutes: an agent wearing goggles, a
helmet, a bullet-proof vest and aiming a semi-automatic black rifle
reached out to Dalrymple to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's face wore a look of stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white T-shirt and plaid shorts, wrapped partially in a
sheet, the boy was whisked from the home, crying as a female agent
who spoke Spanish carried him to a waiting van. The textbook-like
operation lasted three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was taken to a waiting helicopter about 10 miles away and
flown to Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami, where a doctor
examined him. By 6 a.m. EST, he was put on board a government jet
and flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. He
reportedly played with Play-do and other toys on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Elian was reunited with his father, leaving
behind a family devastated by grief and anger and a community
boiling with rage and feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the raid spread like wildfire through Little Havana. By
6:30 a.m. EST, several hundred people milled around the house, some
yelling at reporters, others crying. Faces were etched with rage,
dejection and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to express my anger and hurt,'' said Susana
Ruiz, 43, who stood outside the home, her eyes brimming with tears.
``I hurt for this family. I hurt like you wouldn't believe. I can't
believe what they have done. I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police took no part in the raid, although a top-ranking
officer from the department rode in the lead car of the federal
caravan so that local officers would know the action was
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Police Chief William O'Brien said he learned of the
impending strike at 4:15 a.m. EST, and for security reasons he told
only a few top assistants. He did not notify Miami Mayor Joe
Carollo, who afterwards lashed out at the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal agents went in as if they were assaulting a military
bunker,'' Carollo said. ``This family is decent, law-abiding
people, and they came in with machine guns and gassing people. This
is America. This is not Cuba or Hitler's Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Carollo appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he did not notify Carollo out of concerns for the
security of the operation. ``I'm a policeman, not a politician,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the boy was gone, Miami police began
mobilizing, and quickly set up perimeters around an area of about
40 square blocks. By 8 a.m. EST, roaming crowds of demonstrators
began congregating at major intersections.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. EST, sporadic outbursts erupted. Along N.W. 27th
Avenue _ also named ``Unity Boulevard'' _ a crowd of about 50
people set fire to a tire at a major intersection. Men tossed heavy
benches with wooden backs and cement legs into the street. They
overturned newspaper boxes and tossed around trash cans, contents
spewing across the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a team of riot-clad officers raced to the scene
to reinforce the dozen or so officers stationed at the
intersection. The team rode in unmarked sedans, which screeched to
a halt, all four doors flying open and the officers piling out.
</P>
<P>
   Some carried weapons rigged to fire tear gas. Others carried
cans of the chemical, ready to fling them into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One man was in the street, overturning a newspaper box, but ran
as the cars blazed in. An officer chased him down and rolled him to
the ground in a flower bed, pinning him with his knees while
another officer slapped on metal handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the crowd dispersed, most walking south on Unity
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, small caravans of cars _ apparently from homes
inside the perimeter _ crept down the broad boulevard, horns
blaring, passengers waving Cuban flags and yelling as crowds along
the sidewalks cheered. Police cars whisked up behind the caravans,
lights and sirens blazing, moving them out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   News helicopters hovered overhead, filming everything.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbances seemed unorganized and spontaneous, an
outpouring of emotion. Many people walked peacefully, holding flags
or signs, standing on sidewalks and merely watching.
</P>
<P>
   And most of sprawling Miami-Dade County's 2.5 million residents
went about their normal Saturday business, or stayed in their homes
watching the melee unfold on television. Outside Little Havana,
businesses were open and traffic moved normally.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The city's Miami Heat professional basketball team held their
first play-off game at the downtown American Airlines arena,
tipping off at 12:30 p.m. EST as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles away in Little Havana, chaos roamed in ragged
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts were unpredictable, flaring up all through the
long, hot day.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:30 a.m. EST, the crowd at N.W. 27th Avenue and Flagler
Street was calmly standing on the four corners of the intersection
as about 20 police milled around in the middle of the street. A
woman driving a red car stopped in the intersection, opened her
door, stepped out and began yelling at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman walked over and ordered her back into the car.
Within seconds, dozens of protestors surrounded the car, screaming,
``Let her go, let her go.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers with plastic shields and nightsticks rushed
to the group. A tall officer grabbed a man in a green shirt who was
screaming and flailing his arms. The crowd surged. People started
running, some being shoved around by the jostling crowd. Two
teen-aged girls cried and screamed as officers brushed them out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A woman on one of the corners threw part of a broken broomstick
in the general direction of the officers and was immediately
wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by four men wearing helmets.
Several officers ran to their cars for gas canisters, while others
with plastic shields formed a line and began pushing the crowd
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the street, officers jammed several men to the ground,
mashing them into the pavement, twisting their arms and cuffing
their wrists. One man was led away with angry red scraps on his
forehead. Sweating and heaving for breath in the hot sun, he was
led to an old school bus painted white and stenciled with the
words, ``Miami Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the bus was filled with detainees. The windows
were covered with heavy metal mesh. The people inside stamped their
feet and rocked the bus.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports on the number of people arrested
or how many police or demonstrators suffered injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks roamed the area, extinguishing the tires that
protestors set ablaze in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke roiled into the sky, followed at times by clouds of
choking gas fired as officers moved from one hot-spot to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors threw rocks and bottles at police and media crews.
Roaming demonstrators smashed the windows of one television truck.
</P>
<P>
   Two men ran down Unity Boulevard, carrying a large U.S. flag
turned upside down, the Stars and Stripes dragging the pavement.
Two women carried an American flag tied at the center with a black
band.
</P>
<P>
   A woman stood off to one side as officers moved toward a large
clump of protestors, holding a bright green sign emblazoned with
one word: ``Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman yelled ``assesinos'' _ ``assassins.'' A man ran up
to a reporter, grabbed his shirt and screamed into his face: ``You
better write the truth. You better write that this was murder here
today what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere, people carried copies of the famous photograph
snapped before dawn as the riot-clad, gun-totting federal agent
reached out for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for this,'' said Hope Kahn, who saw the
photograph for the first time as she stood near Unity Blvd. ``There
was no need to use weapons. He wasn't a drug dealer. He was a
little boy.''

   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. - After five months of separation,
young Elian Gonzalez was reunited Saturday morning with his father,
Juan Miguel, at this closed air force base outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Delivered here about 9:20 a.m. EST on a government plane after
being forcefully removed from his Miami relatives' home four hours
earlier, Elian spent the day in private on the base with his
father, step-mother, Nersy, and baby brother, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer, Gregory Craig, praised U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno for going the ``extra mile'' to get the
boy and his family together. In a telephone interview aired on CNN,
Craig said Elian appeared relaxed and happy in his father's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally at ease,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph taken by U.S. Marshals released showed a smiling
Elian being held by his beaming father and surrounded by Nersy and
baby Hianny. A second picture showed Elian again smiling, and
playing with Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   The hordes of media reporters, who were banned from the air
force base, congregated outside the main gate _ along with dozens
of protesters carrying rosaries and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am incensed . . . that a child could be taken in this way,''
said Ivette Curros, a Cuban-American immigrant and Miami resident
who was in the Washington D.C.-area en route to a convention in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Curros said she came to the base to protest the federal
government's effort to reunite the boy with his father, who plans
to return to communist Cuba following the current appeals process
in federal courts. ``I thank God every day that my mother risked
her life to come to this country,'' she said, adding that Elian,
whose mother died trying to reach the United States, should not be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Blazquez, who fled Cuba in 1967 and now lives in the
Washington area, agreed, saying the removal of Elian from the Miami
home was ``a stab in the back'' of the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   But while perhaps a dozen protesters opposed the government's
action, a roughly equal number supported the father-and-son
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian is not an orphan; it's not fair to keep him away from
his father,'' said Wanda Davis, a Washington-area resident who
stopped to cheer Elian's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
   She said while the 6-year-old was in Miami, Elian ``was being
used as a political pawn'' by Cuban-Americans. ``Now he is free,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's cousin and primary caregiver, Marisleysis Gonzalez, and
other Miami relatives arrived late Saturday afternoon on an
American Airlines flight into Washington-Reagan National Airport.
They hope to visit with the father and boy at Andrews, where they
are expected to remain sequestered for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews Air Force Base, just outside the nation's capital, is
the secured base used for the president's travels.

 &HT;    MIAMI ERUPTS FOLLOWING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEIZURE OF ELIAN
 &HT;    (1200&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuban exiles raged through the streets of Miami's Little
Havana Saturday, burning tires, overturning dumpsters and tangling
with roaming squads of riot-clad police who fired tear gas to quell
the outburst triggered by the pre-dawn removal of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible day,'' said Nancy Milian, 33, a
Cuban-American who joined the crowd on N.W. 27th Avenue. ``I'm
ashamed to be an American. Clinton is definitely leaving a legacy.
Cubans will never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   The lightning-strike raid to take the boy caught Miami's exiles
completely by surprise. Reporters estimated that only about 30 to
50 demonstrators were outside the house at 5:10 a.m. EST when
several white mini-vans pulled up to the home on N.W. Second
Street.
</P>
<P>
   A team of about one dozen black-clad officers fired a chemical
gas to disperse the crowd, while eight other officers wearing
helmets, flak jackets and carrying semi-automatic weapons battered
open the door of the house and swept inside. They held lawyers and
family members at gunpoint and snatched the boy from the arms of
one of the fisherman who rescued him at sea last Thanksgiving Day,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Elian screaming in English, 'Help me, help me,''' said
Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman, who was standing in a closet with
the boy. ``I just held his head. My God, America, what did you do
to this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer who had been invited into the
home pointed his camera and captured an image that was flashed
around the world within minutes: an agent wearing goggles, a
helmet, a bullet-proof vest and aiming a semi-automatic black rifle
reached out to Dalrymple to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's face wore a look of stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white T-shirt and plaid shorts, wrapped partially in a
sheet, the boy was whisked from the home, crying as a female agent
who spoke Spanish carried him to a waiting van. The textbook-like
operation lasted three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was taken to a waiting helicopter about 10 miles away and
flown to Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami, where a doctor
examined him. By 6 a.m. EST, he was put on board a government jet
and flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. He
reportedly played with Play-do and other toys on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Elian was reunited with his father, leaving
behind a family devastated by grief and anger and a community
boiling with rage and feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the raid spread like wildfire through Little Havana. By
6:30 a.m. EST, several hundred people milled around the house, some
yelling at reporters, others crying. Faces were etched with rage,
dejection and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to express my anger and hurt,'' said Susana
Ruiz, 43, who stood outside the home, her eyes brimming with tears.
``I hurt for this family. I hurt like you wouldn't believe. I can't
believe what they have done. I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police took no part in the raid, although a top-ranking
officer from the department rode in the lead car of the federal
caravan so that local officers would know the action was
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Police Chief William O'Brien said he learned of the
impending strike at 4:15 a.m. EST, and for security reasons he told
only a few top assistants. He did not notify Miami Mayor Joe
Carollo, who afterwards lashed out at the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal agents went in as if they were assaulting a military
bunker,'' Carollo said. ``This family is decent, law-abiding
people, and they came in with machine guns and gassing people. This
is America. This is not Cuba or Hitler's Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Carollo appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he did not notify Carollo out of concerns for the
security of the operation. ``I'm a policeman, not a politician,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the boy was gone, Miami police began
mobilizing, and quickly set up perimeters around an area of about
40 square blocks. By 8 a.m. EST, roaming crowds of demonstrators
began congregating at major intersections.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. EST, sporadic outbursts erupted. Along N.W. 27th
Avenue _ also named ``Unity Boulevard'' _ a crowd of about 50
people set fire to a tire at a major intersection. Men tossed heavy
benches with wooden backs and cement legs into the street. They
overturned newspaper boxes and tossed around trash cans, contents
spewing across the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a team of riot-clad officers raced to the scene
to reinforce the dozen or so officers stationed at the
intersection. The team rode in unmarked sedans, which screeched to
a halt, all four doors flying open and the officers piling out.
</P>
<P>
   Some carried weapons rigged to fire tear gas. Others carried
cans of the chemical, ready to fling them into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One man was in the street, overturning a newspaper box, but ran
as the cars blazed in. An officer chased him down and rolled him to
the ground in a flower bed, pinning him with his knees while
another officer slapped on metal handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the crowd dispersed, most walking south on Unity
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, small caravans of cars _ apparently from homes
inside the perimeter _ crept down the broad boulevard, horns
blaring, passengers waving Cuban flags and yelling as crowds along
the sidewalks cheered. Police cars whisked up behind the caravans,
lights and sirens blazing, moving them out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   News helicopters hovered overhead, filming everything.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbances seemed unorganized and spontaneous, an
outpouring of emotion. Many people walked peacefully, holding flags
or signs, standing on sidewalks and merely watching.
</P>
<P>
   And most of sprawling Miami-Dade County's 2.5 million residents
went about their normal Saturday business, or stayed in their homes
watching the melee unfold on television. Outside Little Havana,
businesses were open and traffic moved normally.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The city's Miami Heat professional basketball team held their
first play-off game at the downtown American Airlines arena,
tipping off at 12:30 p.m. EST as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles away in Little Havana, chaos roamed in ragged
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts were unpredictable, flaring up all through the
long, hot day.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:30 a.m. EST, the crowd at N.W. 27th Avenue and Flagler
Street was calmly standing on the four corners of the intersection
as about 20 police milled around in the middle of the street. A
woman driving a red car stopped in the intersection, opened her
door, stepped out and began yelling at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman walked over and ordered her back into the car.
Within seconds, dozens of protestors surrounded the car, screaming,
``Let her go, let her go.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers with plastic shields and nightsticks rushed
to the group. A tall officer grabbed a man in a green shirt who was
screaming and flailing his arms. The crowd surged. People started
running, some being shoved around by the jostling crowd. Two
teen-aged girls cried and screamed as officers brushed them out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A woman on one of the corners threw part of a broken broomstick
in the general direction of the officers and was immediately
wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by four men wearing helmets.
Several officers ran to their cars for gas canisters, while others
with plastic shields formed a line and began pushing the crowd
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the street, officers jammed several men to the ground,
mashing them into the pavement, twisting their arms and cuffing
their wrists. One man was led away with angry red scraps on his
forehead. Sweating and heaving for breath in the hot sun, he was
led to an old school bus painted white and stenciled with the
words, ``Miami Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the bus was filled with detainees. The windows
were covered with heavy metal mesh. The people inside stamped their
feet and rocked the bus.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports on the number of people arrested
or how many police or demonstrators suffered injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks roamed the area, extinguishing the tires that
protestors set ablaze in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke roiled into the sky, followed at times by clouds of
choking gas fired as officers moved from one hot-spot to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors threw rocks and bottles at police and media crews.
Roaming demonstrators smashed the windows of one television truck.
</P>
<P>
   Two men ran down Unity Boulevard, carrying a large U.S. flag
turned upside down, the Stars and Stripes dragging the pavement.
Two women carried an American flag tied at the center with a black
band.
</P>
<P>
   A woman stood off to one side as officers moved toward a large
clump of protestors, holding a bright green sign emblazoned with
one word: ``Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman yelled ``assesinos'' _ ``assassins.'' A man ran up
to a reporter, grabbed his shirt and screamed into his face: ``You
better write the truth. You better write that this was murder here
today what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere, people carried copies of the famous photograph
snapped before dawn as the riot-clad, gun-totting federal agent
reached out for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for this,'' said Hope Kahn, who saw the
photograph for the first time as she stood near Unity Blvd. ``There
was no need to use weapons. He wasn't a drug dealer. He was a
little boy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chanting ``Libertad para Elian!'' scores of angry demonstrators
staged a raucous, traffic-blocking march through the Cuban-American
stronghold of Union City, N.J., on Saturday to protest the forcible
removal of Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives in a
predawn raid by armed federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 protesters, clotting a highway intersection, tied up
traffic in and out of the Lincoln Tunnel, one of the transportation
links between New Jersey and New York City, for nearly half an hour
shortly after noon, and slowed traffic on nearby John F. Kennedy
Boulevard to a trickle. Hundreds of car horns blared, but _ judging
by Cuban flags waving out windows _ there seemed to be as many
sympathizers in the chorus as drivers angered by the delays.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged by televised images of agents in riot gear waving an
assault rifle in front of the boy and carrying him away as he
sobbed for help, protesters denounced President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno, calling them tools of President Fidel
Castro and likening the raid to the tactics of a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to reaffirm the value of a single human life, of a
6-year-old child who has in fact not received a full hearing in a
competent court of law,'' Lazaro Alvarez, a human rights and
anti-Castro activist, shouted as protesters in the nation's
second-largest Cuban-American community waved flags and banners,
honked horns and voiced dismay over the sudden turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Elian was seized and flown to a reunion with his
father near Washington, political leaders in New Jersey joined
protesters in expressing disgust and resentment over the Clinton
administration's decision to use force in the midst of negotiations
to resolve an international custody battle that has been under way
for nearly five months.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, a Union City Democrat who has been
involved in the negotiations, called the raid ``a despicable use of
the force of the federal government against a humble, unarmed and
law-abiding family, who had only one interest: Elian's future and
his best interests as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Menendez, a Cuban-American and a frequent
critic of the Castro government, said: ``It's really a day of
infamy. To take a child out at gunpoint, awakened from his sleep in
the dark of night by masked agents, reminds us of the tactics of
the Castro dictatorship, not of the democracy we enjoy in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Reno, Menendez said: ``Now that she has made this
decision to use the full force of the federal government to uphold
the father's rights, I hope she's going to use the full force of
the government to uphold the boy's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, Cuban-Americans and recent Cuban immigrants,
began gathering in a light rain at about 10:30 a.m. at Bergenline
Avenue and 41st Street, the main intersection in Union City, which
for decades has been a center of Cuban-American life in the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   A few were wrapped in Cuban flags. Some held American flags
upside down. Others held banners proclaiming ``First Waco, Now
Elian,'' and ``Reno-Clinton-Gore, you can celebrate with your
friend Castro.'' They blocked traffic, sang the Cuban national
anthem and chanted ``Liberty for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Frontela, who lives in North Bergen, N.J., and came to
the United States six years ago from Santa Clara, Cuba, was angry
and sad. ``Fidel Castro bought Bill Clinton and Janet Reno,'' he
said. He said he had heard Clinton on the radio, addressing the
nation after the raid, and said: ``The Bill Clinton who was
speaking today was Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon, the demonstrators left the center of Union
City, and marched south on Kennedy Boulevard, snarling traffic in
the four northbound and southbound lanes. As car horns blared,
Cuban flags appeared out the windows of many cars, and it appeared
that as many drivers were sympathetic to the demonstrators as not.
</P>
<P>
   But when the protesters reached the intersection of Interstate
495, the main highway feeding traffic into and out of the Lincoln
Tunnel, the sympathy evaporated and for nearly half an hour,
traffic was stalled and drivers were clearly angry. The police did
nothing to break up the protest, however, and the demonstrators
dissolved the clot voluntarily and returned to downtown Union City
without further incident.

DIXON SHOWS HE IS COMFORTABLE ON FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ga., Fla.)   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he flew over Manhattan for the first time last week, Ron
Dixon acknowledged that he leaned toward the commercial jet's
window, nearly pressing his nose against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes were just so wide open,'' said Dixon, the New York
Giants new wide receiver and surprise third-round draft pick. ``I
couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived inside the locker room, he was introduced to
some of his new colleagues, including his fellow receiver Amani
Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation a few minutes later, Dixon referred to his new
teammate as ``Mr. Toomer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was directed to his dressing quarters. With so many
rookies and free agents trying out for the team last week, a number
of players shared lockers. Dixon was paired with Ron Dayne, the
Heisman Trophy winner, college football's career rushing leader and
the Giants' first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon looked at the two nameplates above the locker stall.
``From the top to the bottom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And when television cameras and reporters soon crowded around
Dayne, Dixon retreated to a corner. ``I'm just a country boy,''
said Dixon, who played one year of football at Lambuth University
in Jackson, Tenn. ``Our media was one guy with a pad.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after the Giants plucked Dixon from the obscurity of the
National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics school, he
remained the most intriguing new face on the team. At 6 feet 1 inch
and 183 pounds, with spindly arms and legs, he was the receiver
that coaches, players and team executives stopped to watch during
last week's minicamp workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon put on a good show. He displayed his speed, and perhaps
more important, he caught just about everything thrown to him, even
in traffic over the middle. Granted, with no one in pads _ and no
hitting _ it was an appraisal that had its limitations; but, the
overall impression was that Dixon needed time to fill out, but that
he had talent, quick moves and the innate ability to run fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a guy who's raw but very comfortable on the field,''
coach Jim Fassel said. ``We knew he could run but he also makes
quick, change-of-direction moves. He's shifty.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly caught backup quarterback Jason Garrett _ and Dayne
_ by surprise on one play during Friday morning's workout. Dixon
went in motion the wrong way as the ball was being snapped and
barreled over Garrett and Dayne in the backfield. Dixon came up
with a thigh bruise that kept him out of that afternoon's workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are going to happen,'' Fassel said with a smile.
``This is all new to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Going from the NAIA to the National Football League is about as
big a jump as a football player can make, but there were signs that
Dixon's presence was not the fluke it might seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   There was an interesting interchange between Dixon and Giants
wide receiver Ike Hilliard, a former first-round pick after a
celebrated career at Florida. The two clearly knew each other. How?
</P>
<P>
   They were together on a recruiting trip to Florida in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Dixon, a highly recruited high school prospect from
Wildwood, Fla., did not score high enough on college entrance exams
to qualify for a Division I scholarship and ended up at Itawamba
Community College in Mississippi. After two seasons, he enrolled at
Division II West Georgia, but did not apply himself scholastically
there either and left the school in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Out of football and working various jobs, Dixon said he sat down
on May 20, 1997, and wrote a list of eight goals for himself,
things like, ``get back into college, earn at least a 3.0 academic
average, play football, be the best receiver in the league, get
drafted by an NFL team.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few others that Dixon politely declined to divulge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my life passing me by and I got fed up,'' said Dixon,
who will be 24 next month. ``I would stay up nights and think about
all the opportunities I had let go by. They weren't anybody else's
fault. When I got to college, I wanted to go out and see all the
things I hadn't see before. I wanted to party.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1997, I saw that things were slipping away. I wrote down
what I wanted to do, and I put it in my Bible back home.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived at home while going to two junior colleges trying to
get the credits he needed to apply to bigger football schools. He
wanted to play football at an NCAA school, but by 1999 his five
years of NCAA eligibility had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIA became his best chance and a friend referred him to
Lambuth. He played in games attended by about 300 fans. But the
number included NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave up the dream,'' Dixon said. ``But I don't know if
I ever thought it would come true.''
</P>
<P>
   His first taste of pro football now concluded, Dixon is trying
to digest what he saw and get accustomed to being a Giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an interesting few days,'' Dixon said. ``Some things
I'll still have to get used to. Like running through the tunnel at
Giants Stadium for the first time.''
</P>

 JETS WOULD WANT RICE IF 49ers DO NOT KEEP HIM  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a great debate within the San Francisco 49ers
organization _ to keep Jerry Rice or not to keep him. Depending on
whom you talk to on the team, the 49ers either want to cut Rice
after June 1 to save valuable salary-cap room, or have Rice take a
dramatic pay cut so he can stay one more season and then retire as
a 49er.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will most likely try to figure out a way to keep
Rice. It would be a major embarrassment to the team, and to the
league, if Rice played in a uniform other than the 49ers. Still,
there is a chance it might not be worked out. If that happens,
would Rice be willing to play for another team? And will other
teams be interested in signing Rice?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are yes and yes, and one of the teams that might
take a hard look at Rice, should he become available, is the New
York Jets, a team that, like the 49ers, is battling its own
salary-cap problems.
</P>
<P>
   A Jets team official said his team would examine the possibility
of signing Rice to a short-term deal if the 49ers discard him.
Again, chances are the Jets will not get the opportunity to sign
him, because Rice wants to work something out with San Francisco.
``He wants to stay with the 49ers,'' his agent, Jim Steiner, said.
``It's just a matter of working out the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the 49ers and Rice cannot reach an agreement to
renegotiate Rice's contract, would he play elsewhere? ``Jerry
believes he still has good years left in him,'' Steiner said. Would
Rice consider retiring? ``That is definitely not in his plans right
now,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins may also want to sign Rice, and another impediment
to Rice joining the Jets is the Jets' interest in Carl Pickens, the
Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are not allowed to publicly comment on another player
under contract, as Rice is. But make no mistake: if Rice is
available after June 1, and the Jets have not signed Pickens, they
will definitely take a long look at the player many consider the
greatest receiver in history.
</P>
<P>
   Teams know Rice is no longer the player he once was. At 37, he
cannot separate from defensive backs because he has lost the burst
that once made him among the most feared offensive players in
history. But despite age and knee surgeries, he can still be quite
effective. On a bad team last season, with a terrible quarterback
and offensive line, Rice still led the 49ers in catches (67), yards
receiving (830) and touchdowns (5).
</P>
<P>
   The Jets think Rice could jump-start his career with them the
same way quarterback Vinny Testaverde and linebacker Bryan Cox did.
Remember, there was a time when many in the NFL thought Testaverde
and Cox were finished as players, but both were invaluable to the
Jets when the team was one victory from the Super Bowl two seasons
ago. And the Jets have precedent in terms of snagging longtime
great 49ers. The Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott left San Francisco to
join the Jets for the last few years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is under contract until 2004, and next season has a $5.49
million salary-cap number. The 49ers have maintained they will not
keep Rice unless he drastically reduces that figure. Last week Rice
and general manager Bill Walsh met privately, and Walsh has
expressed optimism that Rice would remain with the team. However,
others in the organization are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers and Jets both have salary-cap problems, the main
reason the Jets let Johnson go to the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Jets were $3.5 million under the $62.172 million
cap. But that cap room is an illusion. It will take about $6
million to sign their draft picks, so the team will have to do some
serious renegotiating of veterans' contracts just to bring their
picks into the fold. Such renegotiations are believed to already be
under way, and will continue in the summer, especially after June
1, when the Jets can cut players without serious salary-cap
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, by 2002, Testaverde and running back Curtis Martin
will count $20.4 million against the cap, and defensive back Ray
Mickens is scheduled to earn $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless those contracts are restructured, the Jets will have
three players counting for more than $25 million against the cap.
That is an intolerable situation. And if the Jets had signed
Johnson, it would have been a total salary-cap crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Jets' four first-round draft picks will earn
combined signing bonuses of around $13 million, the same bonus
Johnson received from the Buccaneers. The difference is that the
Jets are paying that amount to four players, not one. That is the
trend many teams, like the Giants, are following _ staying away
from paying a handful of players the bulk of the salary-cap money,
and spreading it out more sensibly.
</P>
<P>
   If San Francisco lets Rice go, the Jets could sign him
relatively cheaply. Maybe he has enough left _ just enough _ to
help fans forget about Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing Kearse
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee defensive lineman Jevon Kearse, last season's
defensive rookie of the year, is finding out just how busy, and
financially rewarding, stardom can be.
</P>
<P>
   There are now massive demands for his time, some because of the
marketing deals he is signing. Kearse is shooting Reebok
commercials, has been approached about a Kearse sports drink, and
even his own mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Kearse, nicknamed ``The Freak'' because of his
dazzling physical skills, shied away from endorsement deals, mainly
because he wanted to focus on football. Now, thanks to his agent,
Leigh Steinberg, Kearse is going to cash in on his great year, one
that included a Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse will most likely earn millions of dollars in future
endorsements. The real challenge for Kearse in the face of all this
newfound popularity and money will be to do what he did last season
_ stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard's Legacy
</P>
<P>
   It could be only a matter of months, maybe weeks, before Bobby
Beathard, San Diego's general manager, retires from football.
</P>
<P>
   There was no better evaluator of talent than Beathard when he
was with the Washington Redskins and helped to build the franchise
that dominated the National Football Conference East in the late
1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But his reputation will be tarnished by his disastrous draft
picks as general manager of the Chargers. One of the worst in NFL
history was Beathard's selection of quarterback Ryan Leaf as their
No. 1 pick in the 1998 draft. It is possible Leaf could turn his
career around, but so far he has proved to be lazy and immature, to
the point where his own teammates are publicly calling him a baby. &QL;

 &HT;    FEDERAL OFFICIALS SEIZE ELIAN IN EARLY-MORNING RAID ON MIAMI
RELATIVES HOME
 &HT;    With ELIAN-RIOTS-0423; ELIAN-REUNION-0423; ELIAN-SEIZED-0423.
 &HT;    Moving in both International and Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elian Gonzalez was reunited with his father at a
nearby Air Force base Saturday just hours after armed federal
agents seized the Cuban shipwreck survivor from his Miami
relatives's home in a predawn raid ordered by U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But the reunion of Elian and Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not end
the ferocious tug-of-war over the 6-year-old castaway, now elevated
to icon status on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it bring peace to the Little Havana area of Miami, where
much of the heart-tugging international drama has unfolded over the
five months since Elian was rescued at sea, having lost his mother
in a desperate attempt to flee Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian and his father celebrated their reunion at Andrews Air
Force Base, Cuban Americans took their anger into the streets of
Miami, setting fires, throwing rocks and bottles and, in one
instance, punching a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters also gathered at the gates of Andrews, a
top security facility where the president's fleet of aircraft is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Washington attorney Greg Craig released photographs of a smiling
Elian with his father, stepmother and stepbrother at their reunion.
The photos contrasted sharply with the news images earlier in the
day of federal agents removing the screaming boy from the Miami
home of his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be very happy to be back with his father,'' Craig
said. ``It is amazing how quickly that bond re-established itself.
It was almost instantaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent corroboration of Craig's account of the
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Cubans reacted jubilantly to the news that Elian had
been reunited by the U.S. authorities with his father after their
five-month separation. Cuban television used U.S. television
networks's footage to provide blow-by-blow coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government called the events ``a favorable movement,''
but cautioned that ``the need to fight for Elian has not ended''
because of pending legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father are expected to remain in the United States
until a federal appeals court decides whether he can be returned to
Cuba. He and his family will live at an undisclosed location in the
Washington, D.C. area after spending a few days at Andrews,
according to federal immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives lost a U.S. District Court battle to get
a political asylum hearing for the boy. An appeals court has
ordered Elian to stay in this country until it decides that case.
But it did not bar Reno from switching custody. A hearing is set
for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all await the outcome of the appellate process, I think
it is important for us all to accept Elian's long-overdue reunion
with his father,'' Reno said during a news conference at the
Justice Department. ``It is time to heal wounds that have divided a
community. It is time to help this little boy heal from the
tragedies that he has experienced. Let us give him and his father
the space, the calm, the moral support they need to reconnect and
reaffirm their bond between father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's Miami relatives arrived in Washington later Saturday
in an effort to meet with the boy and his father, suggesting little
calm in the days ahead. Craig had discouraged them from making the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the dramatic images of the frantic and forceful
removal of Elian from his relatives' home in Miami following the
collapse of negotiations for a voluntarily surrender of the child
to his father did nothing to promote peace. Neither did the fiery
political rhetoric triggered by the surprise Easter weekend events.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, in a round of television appearances,
denounced the federal agents as ``thugs'' and ``atheists,'' called
their actions ``a crime'' and declared that he ``could not trust
our government any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas called the seizure of
Elian a ``police-state-type raid'' by the Clinton administration.
And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said, ``My
first thought was that this could only happen in Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The events in Miami also reverberated in the American
presidential campaign, with Vice President Al Gore distancing
himself from the administration's actions and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, questioning the
administration's claim that it had no alternative but to reunite
Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said, I believe this issue should have been handled
through a family court and with the family coming together,'' Gore
said in a brief statement released by his campaign office in
Nashville rather than his vice presidential office at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``All sides have claimed to be acting in Elian's best
interest, but surely no one can argue that taking a young boy at
gunpoint is in his best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's statement echoes the claims made by Elian's Miami
relatives that the boy was taken at gunpoint by the eight federal
agents who rushed into their home shortly after 5 a.m. Saturday. An
emotional Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's 21-year-old cousin and
primary caregiver, claimed that agents had placed a gun to Elian's
head at one point during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters brandished copies of a news photograph showing a
federal agent wearing green riot gear, a helmet and goggles and
carrying an automatic rifle as he confronts a man clutching a
frightened Elian in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The man holding Elian in the photograph is Donato Dalrymple, one
of the fishermen who rescued Elian last Thanksgiving Day from an
inner tube in the open Atlantic Ocean an incredible 48 hours after
a crowded boat carrying him and his mother capsized. His mother and
10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, at her news conference, said the ``paramount concern''
throughout the operation was ``the well-being of Elian'' and ``the
safety of the agents and others.'' She noted that law enforcement
officers ``must be prepared for the unexpected,'' but insisted that
the photograph of the agent confronting Dalrymple was proof of the
caution with which the raid was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the beauties of television is that it shows exactly
what the facts are,'' Reno said. ``And as I understand it, if you
look at it (the photograph) carefully, it shows that the gun was
pointed to the side, and that the finger was not on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ordered the boy taken from the relatives who have
cared for him since his rescue at sea because the relatives had
rejected her latest proposal for surrendering the child to his
father. ``The Miami relatives rejected our efforts, leaving us no
other option but the enforcement action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that had been under discussion called for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez and Elian, Lazaro and Marisleysis to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington, with formal
custody being transferred immediately to the father. The two sides
could not agree on the custody issue or how long they might live
together pending the end of the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was briefed through the night on the
Justice Department's plans, told reporters at the White House
Saturday that he supported the decision to use federal agents to
reunite Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the decisions that were made ... and I believe that
it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. He credited Reno with
exploring ``every conceivable alternative'' before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was, in the end, about a little boy who lost his mother
and has not seen his father in more than five months,'' the
president said. ``I hope, with time and support, Elian and his
father will have the opportunity to be a strong family again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case of Elian Gonzalez is far from ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's miraculous rescue from the sea took on Biblical
dimensions to some of the hundreds of Cuban Americans who have
surrounded the boy's Little Havana home in recent weeks. He has
even been compared to Moses, who, according to Jewish and Christian
faiths, led the children of Israel from bondage in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   And the timing of the raid, on Holy Saturday, or the Angelic
Night, a time of sadness and joy for Christians, led some
protesters to compare the events to the crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like crucifying the Messiah all over again,'' said
Ralph Anrrich(CQ), a social worker helping Elian's Miami relatives
Saturday. ``This is a slap in the face to the Cuban-American
community and the Christian community.''

according to federal immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives lost a U.S. District Court battle to get
a political asylum hearing for the boy. An appeals court has
ordered Elian to stay in this country until it decides that case.
But it did not bar Reno from switching custody. A hearing is set
for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all await the outcome of the appellate process, I think
it is important for us all to accept Elian's long-overdue reunion
with his father,'' Reno said during a news conference at the
Justice Department. ``It is time to heal wounds that have divided a
community. It is time to help this little boy heal from the
tragedies that he has experienced. Let us give him and his father
the space, the calm, the moral support they need to reconnect and
reaffirm their bond between father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's Miami relatives arrived in Washington later Saturday
in an effort to meet with the boy and his father, suggesting little
calm in the days ahead. Craig had discouraged them from making the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the dramatic images of the frantic and forceful
removal of Elian from his relatives' home in Miami following the
collapse of negotiations for a voluntarily surrender of the child
to his father did nothing to promote peace. Neither did the fiery
political rhetoric triggered by the surprise Easter weekend events.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, in a round of television appearances,
denounced the federal agents as ``thugs'' and ``atheists,'' called
their actions ``a crime'' and declared that he ``could not trust
our government any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas called the seizure of
Elian a ``police-state-type raid'' by the Clinton administration.
And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said, ``My
first thought was that this could only happen in Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The events in Miami also reverberated in the American
presidential campaign, with Vice President Al Gore distancing
himself from the administration's actions and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, questioning the
administration's claim that it had no alternative but to reunite
Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said, I believe this issue should have been handled
through a family court and with the family coming together,'' Gore
said in a brief statement released by his campaign office in
Nashville rather than his vice presidential office at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``All sides have claimed to be acting in Elian's best
interest, but surely no one can argue that taking a young boy at
gunpoint is in his best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's statement echoes the claims made by Elian's Miami
relatives that the boy was taken at gunpoint by the eight federal
agents who rushed into their home shortly after 5 a.m. Saturday. An
emotional Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's 21-year-old cousin and
primary caregiver, claimed that agents had placed a gun to Elian's
head at one point during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters brandished copies of a news photograph showing a
federal agent wearing green riot gear, a helmet and goggles and
carrying an automatic rifle as he confronts a man clutching a
frightened Elian in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The man holding Elian in the photograph is Donato Dalrymple, one
of the fishermen who rescued Elian last Thanksgiving Day from an
inner tube in the open Atlantic Ocean an incredible 48 hours after
a crowded boat carrying him and his mother capsized. His mother and
10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, at her news conference, said the ``paramount concern''
throughout the operation was ``the well-being of Elian'' and ``the
safety of the agents and others.'' She noted that law enforcement
officers ``must be prepared for the unexpected,'' but insisted that
the photograph of the agent confronting Dalrymple was proof of the
caution with which the raid was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the beauties of television is that it shows exactly
what the facts are,'' Reno said. ``And as I understand it, if you
look at it (the photograph) carefully, it shows that the gun was
pointed to the side, and that the finger was not on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ordered the boy taken from the relatives who have
cared for him since his rescue at sea because the relatives had
rejected her latest proposal for surrendering the child to his
father. ``The Miami relatives rejected our efforts, leaving us no
other option but the enforcement action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that had been under discussion called for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez and Elian, Lazaro and Marisleysis to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington, with formal
custody being transferred immediately to the father. The two sides
could not agree on the custody issue or how long they might live
together pending the end of the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was briefed through the night on the
Justice Department's plans, told reporters at the White House
Saturday that he supported the decision to use federal agents to
reunite Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the decisions that were made ... and I believe that
it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. He credited Reno with
exploring ``every conceivable alternative'' before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was, in the end, about a little boy who lost his mother
and has not seen his father in more than five months,'' the
president said. ``I hope, with time and support, Elian and his
father will have the opportunity to be a strong family again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case of Elian Gonzalez is far from ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's miraculous rescue from the sea took on Biblical
dimensions to some of the hundreds of Cuban Americans who have
surrounded the boy's Little Havana home in recent weeks. He has
even been compared to Moses, who, according to Jewish and Christian
faiths, led the children of Israel from bondage in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   And the timing of the raid, on Holy Saturday, or the Angelic
Night, a time of sadness and joy for Christians, led some
protesters to compare the events to the crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like crucifying the Messiah all over again,'' said
Ralph Anrrich(CQ), a social worker helping Elian's Miami relatives
Saturday. ``This is a slap in the face to the Cuban-American
community and the Christian community.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AT 32, SCHUTZ STAYS DRIVEN BY HER JUDO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the 12th graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't know which side of the world I'm on,'' said
Celita Shutz, a 32-year-old Olympic judo player, cheerfully. ``So,
I sleep when I sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 in the world, No. 1 in our hearts, Schutz is still out
there throwing people, 26 years after wandering into a New Jersey
dojo with a vague plan of learning how to trip her older brother.
She's still training there, but now her credit cards are maxed and
she is waiting for the U.S. Olympic Committee to reimburse her
travel expenses to international meets. That and the $500 a month
she receives from the national judo federation help with the
$35,000 a year she and her husband spend on her sport.
</P>
<P>
   She may be the last of the amateur athletes, although she hates
the word and its dilettantish implications; this woman consults
with two judo teachers, a psychologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a
physical therapist and a nutritionist. She hawks her poster,
T-shirt and autographed photo on her Web site. But she buys her own
New Balance running shoes. She canceled her ``elite athlete''
health card from the Olympic Committee because the taxes were
higher than the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we talk about the bright side?'' she said. ``Last month,
I got a call from a company in Canada, Toraki, and they offered to
make me free gi's. We're into sizing and tailoring right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Olympics, where she was captain of the American
team, and at all the national and international tournaments since
then, Schutz had been wearing off-the-rack judo uniforms, or gi's.
Does she ever think she should have stayed with basketball or
soccer, which she played at Yale? ``I try to focus on positive
aspects,'' she said in her precise way. ``Better things will happen
if I produce results. The best thing is to concentrate on my own
improvement and not let other things distract me. Worrying about
the past and future is unproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that how athletes get into trouble, stuffing down
emotions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not say stuffing down, let's say bouncing off,'' she
said, laughing. ``Between now and Sydney, when I wig out, I'll have
people there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schutz lost her only Olympic match in 1996, at 134 pounds (61
kilos). The USOC's female athlete of the year in judo the past two
years, she qualified for this team by placing fifth in the world
championships last October. After a realignment of weight classes,
she will be competing at 139 pounds (63k), a popular middleweight
division. She thinks she is stronger, better conditioned, more
technically competent now, smarter and, because of the Olympic
team's head coach Steve Cohen, better prepared; he's made sure, she
said, that team members see videos of potential opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One reason you've been hearing about Schutz now and then for the
past four years in this space is my fascination with her drive.
Bright, lively and open, she is also remarkably focused. At 12,
then a national junior champion, she was advised to quit after an
operation to try to stop the progression of Osgood-Schlatter's
disease, an inflammation in the knee joint.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, she shattered her leg in a tournament six months before
the Atlanta Olympic trials. Four years ago, she was accidentally
butted in training, and her forehead split open. Coincidentally
there, I drove her to the hospital. She seemed faintly bored by the
stitching process, relieved when she decided it wasn't going to
interfere with her weight-lifting program.
</P>
<P>
   Like many artists, elite athletes tend to be un-self-conscious
about their passion, their dedication and their sense of
entitlement. Be it a grant from a tax-exempt cultural foundation or
a stipend from a tax-exempt national sports body, the
artist/athlete thinks support is an appropriate response from a
grateful nation for talent and sacrifice. And maybe it is.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have easy-mail (write to me at
thelipsite(AT)aol.com), there is no reason not to discuss this.
Beyond the obvious hypocrisies of student-athletes, the Dream Team
syndrome and role-model merchandising, all sitting ducks, what
about these hard-working true amateurs? Should they be supported?
By us? Isn't that the market's job? If they love it so much,
shouldn't they just get day jobs and shut up, the way so many
composers, writers and painters do? Or do athletes deserve more? Do
they give us more?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, your response to thelipsite has been gratifying,
smart and more than I can handle quickly. I'll try to answer as
many as I can, but meanwhile, thanks for the fresh and thoughtful
insights, which you can be sure will inform the column.
</P>
<P>
   Recent messages have concentrated on attacking the NCAA, making
jokes about testosterone and shouting ``Racism!'' in a crowded
arena. Several readers think that coach John Thompson should not be
in the same uncomplimentary paragraph with Bob Knight and Jerry
Tarkanian because he is an educator and they are not. They think I
should apologize to Thompson and that I included him because he is
black.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, now retired, with his sneaker contracts and his
complicity in the perversion of higher education (which, truth be
told, does a good job of perverting itself even without sports), is
as much at fault as any of the white coaches _ Knight, Tarkanian,
Paterno, Coach K _ who have now and again operated teams that field
winning universities.

 &HT;    THE FINAL HOURS BEFORE TAKING OF ELIAN THE MOST RIVETING
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.
 &HT;    Moving in both International and Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno had allowed
deadline after deadline to slip away in her attempts to reunite
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez with his Cuban father. At 4:00 Saturday
morning, as she polled her top aides around the long table in her
Department of Justice conference room after hours of fruitless
negotiations, Reno's patience was at last exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, she authorized a team of more than 130 armed
federal officials to pluck the youngster out of the modest home of
his Miami relatives who had been caring for him for nearly five
months and bring him to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the final hours unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Friday 4:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reno confers with President Clinton on the latest chapter in the
talks with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez about handing over
the boy. The Miami family has faxed a final offer, which demands
that the father come to the Miami-Dade County- area and stay there
indefinitely while the two families reunited under the watchful eye
of an expert ``facilitator.'' That plan is nixed by federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno tells Clinton that she is continuing to talk with
intermediaries, including Miami attorney Aaron Podhurst, who are
offering new ideas for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Friday 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just before joining visiting family members for a Good Friday
dinner, Clinton is given an update by Reno by telephone. White
House chief of staff John Podesta is assigned to monitors events
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 2:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta calls Clinton with a somewhat hopeful report that, ``the
parties were continuing to try to work out a voluntary transfer of
custody,'' according to White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
But Podesta tells the president that if talks break down, Reno is
prepared to send in her SWAT team. Clinton approves the approach.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 4:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With Elian asleep in a bedroom, lawyers and others gather in the
living room of the Gonzalez home and continue the talks with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Reno goes around the table and asks for the views
of her top assistants. She holds out until the last minute, but
after seeing the talks go nowhere, the attorney general tells the
Miami household that their time has run out. She gives the go-ahead
for the law enforcement team.
</P>
<P>
   From Miami, Podhurst and the other negotiators call back to
attempt one last counter-offer, and Reno continues to talk, even as
outside the home the law enforcement team is already in action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 5:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed in combat gear with black helmets, visors and automatic
rifles, eight agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
pry open the Gonzales door, burst into the house and find Elian
inside a closet in the arms of Donato Dalrymple, one of the
fishermen who rescued him off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   As the SWAT team moves in, an Associated Press photographer
climbs over the fence and enters the house in time to photograph an
agent, his rifle in hand, reaching for the boy. ``What's happening?
What's happening?'' the photographer hears Elian ask in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   A female INS agent, without a helmet or visible weapon, then
takes Elian and rushes him out of the house and into a waiting
unmarked white van. The bilingual agent has rehearsed her script,
which was prepared by experts. ``This may seem very scary right
now, but it will soon be better,'' goes her message, delivered in
Spanish. ``We're taking you to see your papa ...You will not be
going back to Cuba. You will not be on a boat. You are around
people who care for you. We are going to take care of you. Please
don't be frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   In three minutes, the agents are out of the house and clearing
the way with pepper gas to allow Elian's motorcade to drive away
from the startled gathering of protestors. Elian is driven to
Watson Island and flown by helicopter to Homestead Air Force Base,
where he receives a brief physical and is pronounced unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday, shortly before 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reno telephones Clinton to inform him of the action and he
expresses ``satisfaction over the manner in which it had been
carried out,'' according to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by a child psychiatrist and a flight surgeon, both
of them bilingual, Elian flies toward Andrews Air Force Base, in
the Maryland suburbs of Washington. On board he has a play pack
including Play-Dough, a map with a toy airplane and food. He spends
part of the trip speaking by phone to his father, who had been
notified just as the federal officials were breaking into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's Little Havana, rowdy crowds briefly gather at
intersections, push garbage dumpsters into the street and set tires
afire. Police quickly disperse the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 7:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Reno defends her decision to take Elian by
force in the dark, despite earlier promises not to do so. ``Earlier
we had hoped that the matter could be worked out, that it could be
done in an appropriate way. Then the crowds began to suggest that
they were going to prevent it from happening,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us give him and his father the space, the calm, the moral
support they need to reconnect and reaffirm their bond between
father and son,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 9:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's plane arrives at Andrews Air Force base where he is
reunited with his dad, his stepmother and his infant half-brother,
out of view of TV cameras and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 10:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton meets briefly with reporters outside the White
House. ``The law has been upheld, and that was the right thing to
do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 1:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer Greg Craig releases photos showing
a happy reunion of Elian at Andrews Air Force Base, where the
family is expected to stay one or two nights before moving to an
undisclosed place in the Washington area to await the final court
rulings on his case.

   Reno confers with President Clinton on the latest chapter in the
talks with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez about handing over
the boy. The Miami family has faxed a final offer, which demands
that the father come to the Miami-Dade County- area and stay there
indefinitely while the two families reunited under the watchful eye
of an expert ``facilitator.'' That plan is nixed by federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno tells Clinton that she is continuing to talk with
intermediaries, including Miami attorney Aaron Podhurst, who are
offering new ideas for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Friday 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just before joining visiting family members for a Good Friday
dinner, Clinton is given an update by Reno by telephone. White
House chief of staff John Podesta is assigned to monitors events
through the night.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 2:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta calls Clinton with a somewhat hopeful report that, ``the
parties were continuing to try to work out a voluntary transfer of
custody,'' according to White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
But Podesta tells the president that if talks break down, Reno is
prepared to send in her SWAT team. Clinton approves the approach.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 4:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With Elian asleep in a bedroom, lawyers and others gather in the
living room of the Gonzalez home and continue the talks with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Reno goes around the table and asks for the views
of her top assistants. She holds out until the last minute, but
after seeing the talks go nowhere, the attorney general tells the
Miami household that their time has run out. She gives the go-ahead
for the law enforcement team.
</P>
<P>
   From Miami, Podhurst and the other negotiators call back to
attempt one last counter-offer, and Reno continues to talk, even as
outside the home the law enforcement team is already in action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 5:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed in combat gear with black helmets, visors and automatic
rifles, eight agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
pry open the Gonzales door, burst into the house and find Elian
inside a closet in the arms of Donato Dalrymple, one of the
fishermen who rescued him off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   As the SWAT team moves in, an Associated Press photographer
climbs over the fence and enters the house in time to photograph an
agent, his rifle in hand, reaching for the boy. ``What's happening?
What's happening?'' the photographer hears Elian ask in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   A female INS agent, without a helmet or visible weapon, then
takes Elian and rushes him out of the house and into a waiting
unmarked white van. The bilingual agent has rehearsed her script,
which was prepared by experts. ``This may seem very scary right
now, but it will soon be better,'' goes her message, delivered in
Spanish. ``We're taking you to see your papa ...You will not be
going back to Cuba. You will not be on a boat. You are around
people who care for you. We are going to take care of you. Please
don't be frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   In three minutes, the agents are out of the house and clearing
the way with pepper gas to allow Elian's motorcade to drive away
from the startled gathering of protestors. Elian is driven to
Watson Island and flown by helicopter to Homestead Air Force Base,
where he receives a brief physical and is pronounced unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday, shortly before 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reno telephones Clinton to inform him of the action and he
expresses ``satisfaction over the manner in which it had been
carried out,'' according to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by a child psychiatrist and a flight surgeon, both
of them bilingual, Elian flies toward Andrews Air Force Base, in
the Maryland suburbs of Washington. On board he has a play pack
including Play-Dough, a map with a toy airplane and food. He spends
part of the trip speaking by phone to his father, who had been
notified just as the federal officials were breaking into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's Little Havana, rowdy crowds briefly gather at
intersections, push garbage dumpsters into the street and set tires
afire. Police quickly disperse the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 7:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Reno defends her decision to take Elian by
force in the dark, despite earlier promises not to do so. ``Earlier
we had hoped that the matter could be worked out, that it could be
done in an appropriate way. Then the crowds began to suggest that
they were going to prevent it from happening,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us give him and his father the space, the calm, the moral
support they need to reconnect and reaffirm their bond between
father and son,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 9:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's plane arrives at Andrews Air Force base where he is
reunited with his dad, his stepmother and his infant half-brother,
out of view of TV cameras and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 10:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton meets briefly with reporters outside the White
House. ``The law has been upheld, and that was the right thing to
do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saturday 1:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer Greg Craig releases photos showing
a happy reunion of Elian at Andrews Air Force Base, where the
family is expected to stay one or two nights before moving to an
undisclosed place in the Washington area to await the final court
rulings on his case.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Armed U.S. immigration agents smashed their way into the
Little Havana home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives before dawn
Saturday, took the sobbing 6-year-old boy from a bedroom closet and
flew him to a reunion with his father outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators wept in rage and coughed from pepper spray and
tear gas, the agents wrapped the child in a blanket and carried him
to an airport to fly him to Washington. The action touched off a
fury in the streets outside the Miami home where Cuban exiles have
kept a vigil since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening? What's happening?'' Elian said in Spanish as
he was taken away. ``Help me. Help me.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents, wearing shirts with the words ``INS FEDERAL AGENT''
in bold yellow letters, ended a bitter standoff between Miami's
exile community and a federal government that stopped fruitless
negotiations with the child's defiant great-uncle and a community
that saw Elian as a symbol of freedom and a precious victory, now
perhaps lost, over President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, how could you have performed only half a miracle,'' said
a frantic, weeping Marisleysis Gonzalez, a 21-year-old cousin who
had been the boy's closest companion since he was rescued at sea on
Nov. 25 on a failed crossing from Cuba that drowned his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department said Saturday morning that Elian was
taken safely from the home at about 5:10 a.m. and was flown to
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, where his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, waited.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Gonzalez was seen carrying Elian from a
car at the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are together,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice Department
spokesman. Photographs released by Gonzalez's lawyer showed a
beaming Elian, joined by his father, stepmother and infant
half-brother. The family was taken to an undisclosed location in
Maryland, where they could be assured of privacy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, one Justice Department spokesman said, was subdued and
calm on the flight from Miami, as federal agents gently explained
what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   As pockets of unhappy Cuban-American demonstrators clashed with
the police here Saturday afternoon, the distraught Miami relatives,
claiming they wanted to assure themselves that the boy was happy
and safe, boarded a plane from Miami to Washington, seeking a
meeting with Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno told reporters Saturday morning that
she had tried until the final moment of the standoff to try to find
some other way that father and son could be reunited, but no
agreement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also defended the decision to use force, and armed agents,
saying there were reports that people in the crowd or the
neighborhood had weapons.
</P>
<P>
   She had no other choice, she said, but to order the raid on the
home of Lazaro Gonzalez. ``Elian is safe, and no one is seriously
hurt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean Elian is on his way back to Cuba. Under an
order by a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in Atlanta, Elian's father cannot take the boy home before
a decision in a hearing on Elian's application, filed by his
relatives, for political asylum. The hearing is scheduled for May
11.
</P>
<P>
   But at the two-bedroom house in Little Havana, where Elian has
lived under the constant watch of television cameras and eyes of
demonstrators who have turned him into an almost saintlike presence
as well as a prize in the 41-year-old Cold War with Castro, people
wailed, sank to the ground and cursed the U.S. government for what
it had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're animals,'' screeched Marisleysis Gonzalez to the
swelling crowd Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While exiles here have kept vigil in anticipation of such a raid
for months, the timing _ the morning after Good Friday and the day
before Easter in a heavily Roman Catholic community _ and the
violent, sudden nature of it, left them in as much disbelief as
rage.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of demonstrators had slowly dwindled overnight from
hundreds to about 50 people, some sleeping behind police
barricades, when three white, unmarked vans sped down the dark
street and stopped in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here! They're here!'' demonstrators shouted.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
leaped from the vans, tore through a chain link gate, broke through
the front door and, with brandished automatic weapons, stormed
through the tiny house in search of Elian. The Justice Department
said that eight immigration agents actually went into the house to
retrieve the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Camejo, a cousin of Lazaro Gonzalez, was in the house with
the family watching television as they agents burst in. ``They held
Marisleysis down and told her not to move in Spanish,'' said
Camejo. The agents shouted at the others not to move or interfere,
as Marisleysis pleaded: ``Don't take the boy. Don't take the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was hiding in a closet in the arms of Donato Dalrymple,
one of the two fishermen who rescued Elian from the Atlantic Ocean
and has been constant presence at the house.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in helmet and body armor, holding an automatic rifle,
pulled the boy from Dalrymple's arms. The agent, Dalrymple said,
pointed the rifle at him as Elian cried ``No! No! No!''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photograph, sent around the world, showed
the gun close to Elian's face, but Reno said the barrel was never
pointed at the boy, and the agent's finger was not on the trigger,
and the photograph bears out that description.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was handed to a female agent who cradled him in her arms
and, with help from another agent, raced out into the din and
confusion of the street outside and quickly into the side doors of
a van.
</P>
<P>
   A few protesters tried to form a human chain to block the front
of the house and keep the agents from taking the boy. Ramon Saul
Sanchez, an exile in Miami who has become the leader in the
demonstration, said he was struck by an agent's gun butt. He bled
from an ear as a young man held him upright.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Elian was taken from the bedroom closet, he was
aboard a plane and headed for Washington and his father. A female
U.S. immigration agent comforted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem very scary,'' the agent said in Spanish. ``It
will soon be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of being reunited with his father, Elian was
``totally at ease,'' and laughing with his father, Juan Miguel's
second wife and their infant son, said Gregory Craig, the lawyer
for the father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno called for giving father and son privacy to become
reacquainted. They were to stay for a time at Andrews Air Force
Base and then move to an undisclosed location in the Washington
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us give him and his father the space, the calm, the moral
support they need to reconnect and reaffirm their bond between
father and son,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents had whisked Elian to nearby Watson Island, where they
boarded a helicopter to Homestead Air Force Base in southern
Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor examined him there, and ensured that the boy had not
been injured in the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing an extraordinary voyage for a boy who was shipwrecked
off Florida and had never flown before, Elian was then put on a
U.S. Marshals Service plane for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard, the female immigration agent comforted Elian, the
officials said. She was joined by a psychiatrist, a flight surgeon
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who had led
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our reports so far are that the child has been very
calm, has not been anxious, has not been thrashing, has not been
crying,'' said Doris Meissner, Immigration and Naturalization
Service commissioner. ``And the basic feedback that we have from a
series of people now, who have been directly with him, is that he
is a real terrific, tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was offered a few toys: some Play-Doh, an airplane, a map
and a watch, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Few details had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The female INS agent at Elian's side, whose name was not
released for security reasons, soothed him with prearranged words
cleared by psychologists. He was offered food and drink. Experts
had recommended the Play-Doh as the ``best thing that you can do
for a child who might be experiencing stress,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez rushed to Andrews in a convoy of vans to
await Elian's arrival. Juan Miguel had been staying at the
residence in Bethesda, Md., of Cuba's top diplomat in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need more space,'' Meissner said. ``And they need more
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the attorney, reiterated Juan Miguel Gonzalez's pledge to
remain in the United States while the boy's Miami relatives seek a
political asylum hearing on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that he had merely to witness the warmth of the
father-and-son reunion to conclude that ``something terrible was
done'' by keeping them apart for nearly five months.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the boy apparently came as a shock to the family
in Miami. The family had thought that negotiations would continue,
said family members and their lawyers, but Reno said that it was
obvious that the family was not going to budge.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton said Saturday morning that ``the law has
been upheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all efforts failed,'' Clinton said, ``there was no
alternative but to enforce the decision by the INS and federal
court that Juan Miguel Gonzalez have custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. ``I
am very pleased with the way she handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, people compared the raid to communist Cuba and
swore that the U.S. government would regret its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected the federal government to come in like they
did, like thieves in the night,'' said Carlos Brito, a demonstrator
who has been outside the house almost every night for months.
``I've always been proud of being an American but this morning I
wish I were a citizen of any other country. I've always defended
this country, but to take this boy in the middle of the night?
Today, the federal government has betrayed me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rosa de la Cruz, 58, said she was knocked to the ground by an
armed man, near a gardenia bush in front of the house. ``I was
praying,'' Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno was lying the whole time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house, in the minutes after the raid, three young
men held each other and sobbed. One woman sat in a ditch, crying,
and holding her face in her hands. People rushed back and forth
yelling, but not sure who to vent their anger on. An American flag
was flown upside down in disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, protests gradually swelled as groups for blocks
around the house burned tires in intersections and snarled traffic
by standing or marching in the road. Protesters punched and kicked
at spit at the police and hurled bus benches into streets, which
soon clogged with backed-up traffic, ambulances and fire trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters blocked the access roads to the Miami International
Airport, and traffic backed up for miles. An apparently abandoned
house burned near the downtown. The police made several arrests as
of noon, but earlier in the morning as the raid was being
conducted, they appeared to have no uniform presence at all at the
house. Miami police had stood watch at the house for months, but as
the federal agents moved in, there seemed to be no uniformed
officers there to aid with the operation, though one Miami officer
was reportedly in one of the vans. That could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Only several minutes later, after the federal agents had left,
did Miami police move in.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said he had not been told about the
raid, but that was not a surprise. Carollo has made it clear that
he sides with the exile community in this fight.
</P>
<P>
   The exile community in Miami, Carollo said, is ``destroyed,
emotionally destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas, who had also sided with the exile
community here, said he also had not heard about the raid until
after it was over. Penelas had pledged that his officers would not
aid the federal government in any attempt to take Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the day, as smoke drifted over Miami, police from
both Miami and Miami Dade responded to try and keep the peace.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Overcast, cool conditions will linger over most of the Northeast
as the center of sprawling low pressure drifts east near the south
coast of New England. Steady rain will fall from the central Hudson
River Valley through much of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, scattered showers and drizzle will dampen areas
near the central Appalachians. Clouds will gradually break east of
the Appalachians in the Middle Atlantic States as breezes from the
northwest are dried on descent from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and some potent thunderstorms will surround
low pressure moving east across the southern Plains. Strong
shifting winds will impart rotation to some of the storms,
heightening the risk of a few twisters from eastern Texas and
Oklahoma to the southern Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, clouds and
showers will cling to the east slopes of the central and northern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Virginia Hail
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of reports of large hail, some almost 2 inches in
diameter, in Virginia were made on Friday. The outbreak of severe
weather was associated with a low-pressure system that moved slowly
east from the Ohio Valley. Ahead of the low, some humid air near
the ground provided fuel for thunderstorms. Strong updrafts in the
thunderstorms suspended tiny balls of ice in the cold upper
atmosphere. The balls of ice gathered minute unfrozen water
droplets and grew into large hailstones that pelted the landscape.

BUSH FAULTS U.S. DECISION TO USE FORCE TO TAKE BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In harsh language laced with outrage, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas criticized the Clinton administration for its
decision to use force when it transferred custody of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez to his father early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the photograph of the frightened boy being ``removed
from his home at gunpoint'' was ``chilling'' and ``not an image a
freedom-loving nation wants to show the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the 5 a.m. raid Saturday, Bush, the presumptive
Republican nominee for president, seized on the government's
decision to use force to remove Elian from the house in the Little
Havana section of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am profoundly saddened and troubled that the administration
was not able to negotiate a resolution, and instead decided to use
force to take a little boy from the place he calls home in the
middle of the night,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement that avoided any mention of Saturday's
raid, Vice President Al Gore continued to distance himself from the
administration's handling of the 5-month-old custody case.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said, I believe this issue should have been handled
through a family court and with the family coming together,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other senior Republicans also condemned the action. So did Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who is running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders condemned the government's
action as heavy-handed, with the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, R-Miss., saying, ``My first thought was that this could only
happen in Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Some law-enforcement officials said they also felt the raid was
heavy-handed. But others said the raid was successful, particularly
since no one was seriously injured and the federal agents were able
to move in and out quickly in what could have been a volatile
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was entirely appropriate,'' said John P. Julian, a
private investigator and a former Miami police officer who has
participated in raids. ``When you enter a home under these kinds of
circumstances, you have to expect, and be prepared for, the
absolute worst. You don't know what is inside that house. You don't
know what the reaction will be.''

POLICE KILL MAN WHO THEY SAY ATTACKED HIS MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police officers shot and killed a 43-year-old man in
Queens on Saturday after he attacked his elderly mother and
threatened the officers with a knife and a gun, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few details were available Saturday afternoon, but the officials
said preliminary reports indicated that the man, whose name was not
released, was shot after officers were called to his 70-year-old
mother's home about 9:30 a.m. A police official said that the man
appeared to be emotionally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the man was taken to Elmhurst Hospital
Center, where he was pronounced dead about 10:30 a.m. His mother,
who had apparently been beaten before the officers arrived, was
taken to St. John's Hospital, where she was in critical condition
Saturday afternoon, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Police Department was criticized after officers
shot and killed a Brooklyn man, Gidone Busch, 31, outside his home
on Aug. 30. The shooting of Busch, who was wielding a hammer and
had been committed to mental-care institutions twice, brought
hundreds of protesters to the streets of the Brooklyn neighborhood
where it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defend officers' actions in such situations, police
officials have pointed out that officers are having to quell more
emotionally disturbed people each year at the same time that
shootings by police have declined. In November a state grand jury
in Brooklyn decided not to bring charges against any of the
officers involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But community leaders have asked the U.S. Justice Department to
investigate the case and to examine police policies on handling
emotionally disturbed people.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, at a funeral for a livery cab driver in Queens, the
Rev. Al Sharpton, who is among those who called for a federal
inquiry into police methods after the Busch shooting, said, ``We
are dealing with a rash, an epidemic, we are dealing with a
continued problem of where police policy is going in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must keep pressure to where the federal government comes
in,'' Sharpton added. ``A large part of the city doesn't believe
the police stories, and that is why we need the federal government
to come in.''

A WINNING BALLPARK, BUT A LOSING TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (With BBO-NOTEBOOK) 
By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine Peter and Debby Magowan dressed up for an evening out in
spiffy new tuxedo and gown. They walk out the door and a bus comes
by and splashes muddy water all over them. Magowan's San Francisco
Giants have had mud splashed all over them, including right there
in their new $319 million park.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have played five games at Pacific Bell Park and lost
all five. Rain, not mud, forced postponement of a sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants haven't done much better on the road. They entered a
weekend series in Arizona with an overall 4-11 record, worst in the
major leagues, and in last place, an already distant 7 1/2 games
behind the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's wrong,'' Magowan said. ``We thought it was
the best team we've had since we took over. Everybody expected us
to have an excellent team that would contend. It clearly hasn't
started off that way. There's plenty of time left, but it's a
disappointing start.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor start, which has included a seven-game losing streak,
has been a team effort. ``Everything's been bad,'' Magowan added.
``Defense, pitching, clutch hitting. We found new ways to lose.
It's not been a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   To pronounce a series at the end of the third week of the season
as critical might seem foolish, but the Giants couldn't afford to
fall another three games behind the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let anybody get too far out there,'' Dusty Baker, the
frustrated manager, said before the series opener Friday. ``That's
why this weekend is so big.''
</P>
<P>
   Magowan added, ``They sweep us in Arizona, we definitely are in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble, at least in a small dose, averted. The Giants won the
first game, showing signs of life they had seldom exhibited in
previous games. The strongest signs came from three regulars who
hadn't been hitting. Rich Aurilia (.176), Bill Mueller (.205) and
Marvin Benard (.208) combined for seven hits and five runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   But other signs remain to be seen. Livan Hernandez, for example,
has had the exact opposite experience that his half-brother has had
with the Yankees. Orlando Hernandez hasn't lost in four starts;
Livan hasn't won. He has a 0-4 record with a 5.61 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   The past few seasons Baker was given credit for getting more out
of his players than their talent indicated they were capable of
giving. This season, though, the Giants and others thought they had
a legitimate contender. The raised expectations have made the poor
start more difficult to accept. But poor it has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period where whatever can go bad is going bad,''
Baker said. ``It's the toughest thing I've been through in a few
years. You blow a couple games, then you feel a little pressure and
guys start pressing. They want to do it all themselves. It starts
feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The Giants were down a run to Cincinnati in the
ninth inning last week. Danny Graves had thrown six successive
balls with no one out, and Benard got the take sign for the
reliever's seventh pitch. But he missed the sign, swung and
grounded out. Graves got the next two batters, and the Giants had
lost another one.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was quick to point out that the hitters have failed to do
their jobs as much as the pitchers have even though the pitchers,
whose 5.58 ERA is the second highest in the league, have borne the
brunt of the criticism for the poor start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about our pitching,'' the manager said, ``but
there have been games where we could've blown them open and didn't
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was going to be a glorious season for the Giants, the first
in their new home that has received unanimously rave reviews and
will be filled for every game because the Giants have sold 3
million tickets of about 3.1 million available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the best of times for the Giants since they moved
to San Francisco,'' Magowan said, ``but I think we have the worst
start since we moved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' 4-11 record indeed matched the worst 15-game start
in the team's 43 years in San Francisco. The last time it was this
bad was in 1983. Never did the Giants expect to duplicate that
record in the year of their new park, which was built with private
money. Four times voters had rejected the idea of taxpayers' money
funding a replacement for Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten reports from virtually everybody that it's the
best park they've ever seen,'' Magowan said. ``Even President
Clinton, who was in the park when the game was rained out last
Sunday.'' But can Clinton pitch?
</P>
<P>
   Magowan said the debt service will cost the Giants about $18
million a year, but the club's revenues will double, from $60
million to $120 million. ``We're ahead of the game,'' the owner
said. Not in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, however, can seek inspiration from an ancestral
team. The last time the Giants began a season worse than 5-11 was
the season that they had a 4-12 record. And when was that? In 1951,
the year the Giants won the pennant, the Giants won the pennant,
the Giants won the pennant.

   WHITE HALL, Ala. _ The beauty of spring-green pastures, swampy
woodlands and fields of red clover and wild yellow mustard softens
the poverty-roughened edges of this town of about 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your ordinary Southern backwater. Major civil rights
battles were fought and won here in White Hall and rural Lowndes
County. White Hall's four churches, each more than a century old,
sheltered thousands of people during the voter registration drives
and freedom marches of the 1960s. Thousands more, including a fiery
activist named H. Rap Brown, camped during those marches in tent
cities near the tiny town, which sits where the Black Belt crosses
the Bible Belt, halfway between Selma and Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the area's significance, the National Park
Service and the Alabama Department of Transportation plan to build
an interpretive center on U.S. 80, a few miles from White Hall's
mobile homes and small houses and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's plans seem modest compared with one
envisioned by Brown, now known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the
Muslim cleric charged in the slaying of a Fulton County deputy and
the wounding of another in Atlanta's West End neighborhood. Four
days after the March 16 shootings, Al-Amin was arrested in this
town where he once helped register black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest, Al-Amin, 56, had mapped out a plan for a $47
million rural Islamic complex in White Hall. In his written
proposal on the project, he said the money would come from
``investment funds over a five-year period.'' His proposal also
mentions a plan to build an urban Islamic complex in West End,
where he served for more than two decades as imam, or prayer
leader, at a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The rural complex in White Hall, designed to occupy 100 acres
near the Alabama River, would include farms, stables, retail
stores, a meat processing and distribution plant, a conference
center with lodging, an exercise facility, a medical center and
pharmacy and even an airstrip, according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Sketches of the project show a grouping of buildings around a
large domed mosque flanked by tall minarets. Industrial smokestacks
tower above the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The complex would be surrounded by ``nine well-placed security
cabins,'' the proposal says.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's followers in White Hall say there is nothing sinister
about the security cabins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would just be to protect the children and people living
here,'' said Sharif Al-Malik, 53, of Cleveland, who moved here with
his wife and 15-month-old twin daughters about a month ago.
``They'd be like those guardhouses at the entrance of gated
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Malik's family is one of three who came to White Hall to help
build the rural community proposed by Al-Amin, who served as
spiritual leader of 31 mosques around the country. Now, with
Al-Amin in jail, the Muslims say they still plan to forge ahead
with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream has not died; it just may take a little longer,''
said Clarence A. Rasheed, 53, who moved to White Hall with his wife
and 15-year-old stepdaughter from Richmond, Va. about six months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed said the idea of a rural Muslim complex appealed to him
because of the difficulties of being a Muslim in a predominantly
Christian culture. And he admired the Islamic community Al-Amin had
built in Atlanta, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West End, Imam Jamil had people moving in close
proximity to the mosque and building a subculture where people can
look after each other, take care of the children and follow the
teachings of Allah,'' he said. ``We also wanted to get away from
big-city drugs and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahib Al-Salaam, 52, a Marine Corps veteran from Norfolk, Va.,
was the first Muslim to settle in White Hall, coming here three
years ago. He said he and the others came at the invitation of
Mayor John Jackson, White Hall's first black mayor and a longtime
Al-Amin friend. The two worked together registering black voters in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Salaam said he hopes Muslims elsewhere in the country will
join them in rural Alabama _ something he believes will happen as
cities deteriorate. ``Once they find out they can't grow corn
through that asphalt, they will see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's brother, Ed Brown of Atlanta, said Al-Amin's major
goal in life was to spread the message of Islam around the country.
To do that, Al-Amin planned on building Muslim communities,
spiritually and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, it made more sense to create a homogeneous community,
more conducive to peaceful living and bringing up families,'' he
said. ``That is part of what his life's work is all about, building
Islam across the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin had followers across the country. Issa Smith, a computer
programmer for a refugee resettlement agency in Reston, Va., is
one. He said he had heard talk among other followers of the
creation of an ideal Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and the White Hall Muslims said that while Al-Amin
communicated with them through letters, phone calls and visits,
none of them was privy to the details of how the community would be
built or funded.
</P>
<P>
   If the complex, or some semblance of it, is someday built, it
won't be the first of its kind. In rural Putnam County, Ga., an
estimated 500 people are aligned with the Nuwaubian National of
Moors. Based on a 475-acre farm, it is the brainchild of Malachi Z.
York, who moved there in 1993 from Brooklyn N.Y., where his
Muslim-oriented group had been called Ansaru Allah Community. After
numerous conflicts with officials about alleged zoning violations,
the Nuwaubian compound in Putnam County has been put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims in White Hall _ who have no affiliation with the
Nuwaubians _ say they still hope to find investors willing to fund
their complex, but they are struggling financially in the meantime.
Two of the men work nights polishing floors for businesses in
Montgomery. The group has two ice cream trucks, currently being
repaired, that it plans to operate this summer. Rasheed sells
incense, copies of the Koran and other small items from his van.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family live in public housing off Freedom Road, the
two-lane county blacktop that runs north from U.S. 80 into the
heart of White Hall. Al-Malik and his family live in a green frame
building on Freedom Road that houses the one-room mosque and the
Bismillah Cafe, which Al-Malik runs. White Hall's only other small
eatery, housed behind a grocery store directly across Freedom Road,
serves barbecued pork on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   So far, business at the cafe, which features barbecued goat and
goat burgers, fried whiting and a potato dish called mampi-tampies,
has been slow, Al-Malik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a woman (who) tells people not to eat over here
because we put stuff in our food that will make them Muslims,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Five times a day, Al-Malik stands in front of the cafe, facing
east toward the grocery store and mobile homes, chanting the Muslim
call to prayer in a strong, melodious voice. Sometimes, smoke from
barbecuing pork drifts across the road to the Muslims, who are
forbidden to eat pork.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Salaam said locals are now accustomed to hearing the prayer
call ring out over the quiet woods and wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first heard it, they thought our heads were hurting
or that we were going crazy,'' he said. ``But the White Hall
children started singing it, when they used to laugh and giggle.
Now, the people here are respectful because they know we don't
offer a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   With only three Muslim families in White Hall, making the
population only 11, the possibility of a $47 million community
seems like a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Willie Vaughner said he had never heard anything about
the project. Neither have members of the White Hall City Council,
although the city is listed in the prospectus as a supporter. Mayor
Jackson would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see anybody putting $47 million in Lowndes
County,'' said Vaughner, 50, a lifelong resident of White Hall.
``It would take a long time to get your money back out of a project
like that here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the White Hall Muslims remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not man's way,'' said Al-Malik, playing with his twin
babies. ``This is Allah's way. He will make things right.''

<P>
   It was unintentional that a still photograph became an instant
icon of the television-driven saga of Elian Gonzalez. The
photograph of a federal agent in riot gear, with a gun pointed in
the direction of the little boy in the arms of the man who had
rescued him from the sea, was shown and discussed all day, rarely
mentioned without the words ``searing'' or ``chilling'' attached.
</P>
<P>
   And though the photograph demonstrates the power of a single
dramatic image, the Gonzalez family intended the taking of Elian to
be televised live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got Maced, we got kicked, we got roughed up'' by federal
agents, Tony Zumbado, an NBC camera man, told his colleagues on the
air Saturday afternoon, explaining why his pictures never
materialized. Zumbado and an NBC sound person, who were providing
the pool coverage to be shared by all the networks and cable
channels, entered the house alongside the Associated Press
photographer who took the central image.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous 10 days, the family had flip-flopped about
whether to allow a camera inside if federal officials arrived. Late
Friday afternoon, they consented. As Zumbado described the events,
he and the Associated Press photographer essentially raced the
federal agents to the door.
</P>
<P>
   A family member was pulling him into the house while a federal
agent was pulling him out, he said. When he got inside he was
kicked in the stomach and landed on the floor; by the time he
recovered, he said, the three-minute raid was over.
</P>
<P>
   That is the most ironic twist in what continues to be a battle
of television imagery, with the networks on the air from minutes
after the dawn raid through most of the morning, and the cable news
channels continuing all day.
</P>
<P>
   That battle calls for television anchors to put events in the
context of media manipulation, and on Saturday Dan Rather on CBS
provided the most cogent analysis of the public relations war. He
reminded viewers that the circumstances behind the volatile picture
needed to be seen from two sides. And he called attention to the
fact that Marisleysis Gonzalez went outside to give an emotional
response to the cameras, pulling coverage away from Attorney
General Janet Reno, who was holding a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was surely not coincidental, he said, commenting that
Gonzalez had ``trumped'' Reno in that media skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   The government's position was explained by Reno, who said that
the gun was not pointed at the child and that the agent's hand was
not on the trigger. The opposite view was presented soon after in a
live tour of the Gonzalez house, one more bit of imagery proving
how the family has learned to play the hungry media.
</P>
<P>
   In the tour, conducted by an NBC pool reporter and carried by
everyone, Donato Dalrymple, the man holding the boy, said they had
not been hiding in the closet but standing in front of the open
closet door. Then he and Marisleysis Gonzalez emotionally, angrily
attacked the government.
</P>
<P>
   The day's most tilted coverage may have come from Brian Williams
on MSNBC, who said that ``it is feared this photograph will have an
incendiary effect,'' and that ``the excuse given by the federal
government for the armaments'' was that they had information that
guns might have been in the house. The word ``excuse'' might have
been careless rather than deliberate, but it was characteristic of
a tone that undercut any attempt at balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the beauties of television is that it shows exactly
what the facts are,'' Reno said, but of course imagery is always
more complicated than that. CNN, early in the day, had shown a
version of the photograph that zoomed in to eliminate Donato,
making the gun seem aimed at Elian. But live images can be frozen
and manipulated too.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most-seen image of the day was video of the federal
marshal carrying Elian as they raced from the house to the waiting
van. Often that image was frozen, giving greater impact to the
image of the crying, terrified-looking boy. When Gregory Craig, the
lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father, announced that
he and his son had been happily reunited, Andrea Mitchell reported
that on MSNBC, adding, in an objective tone, ``despite those
devastating images.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has criticized his relatives for
putting Elian on display for the media, has waged a milder media
campaign. And soon Craig released the inevitable counterimages, a
happy family photograph of a smiling Elian in his father's arms,
along with Gonzalez's wife and their infant son. There was a second
still of Elian with his half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   The networks broke into their afternoon programming to show
these new images, the latest weapons in the media war.

GORE, BUSH HIT PREDAWN ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore refused Saturday to support
the administration's intervention to return Elian Gonzalez to his
father, instead issuing a brief statement reiterating his view that
the conflict should have been resolved in a family court ``with the
family coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore broke with the administration over Elian weeks ago, and has
weathered heavy criticism for it ever since, with opponents
accusing him of flip-flopping to appease the politically powerful
Cuban-American community in Florida, a state he hopes to carry ih
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But he has hardly been the only politician feeling pressure to
take a stand on the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, issued a statement Saturday criticizing the
show of force and, tying his opponent to the actions in Miami,
blamed the tense events on the ``Clinton-Gore administration''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am profoundly saddened and troubled that the administration
was not able to negotiate a resolution and instead decided to use
force to take a little boy from the place he calls home in the
middle of the night,'' Bush said. ``The chilling picture of a
little boy being removed from his home at gunpoint defies the
values of America and is not an image a freedom loving nation wants
to show the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did not stop there. After Gore released a two-sentence
statement essentially agreeing with Bush _ saying he wished the
matter had been resolved differently, and praising Miami residents
for their generally restrained behavior after the raid, a Bush
spokesman branded the Gore response as strangely bland and
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves so much out,'' spokesman Ari Fleischer said. ``This
statement lacks any emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Different politicians chose different targets Saturday: The use
of force, the abrupt timing, the decision to have the Immigration
and Naturalization Service burst into the Miami relatives' home
less than 24 hours before Easter.
</P>
<P>
   US Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi,
took issue with Reno's abandoning unarmed negotiations with the
family, and said his ``first thought was that this could only
happen in Castro's Cuba.'' US House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
Republican of Texas, issued an apology to ``all Americans who are
morally offended by the Easter weekend police-state-type raid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the sound of his pleas of `Help me! Help
me!' '' DeLay said. ``Can this poor child ever recover from a
machine gun waved in his face as he is once again pulled away from
the family he so clearly bonded with?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest criticism came from Florida Governor Jeb
Bush, a Republican, who said he spoke with President Clinton just
hours before the raid and was ``assured that the intention of his
administration was to resolve this matter in a voluntary,
nonforcible way through negotiated agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who is not up for re-election for another two years,
declined to question the need to return Elian to his father. Saying
he was disappointed by the show of force, Bush added: ``I remain
hopeful, however, that the president and his administration will
allow Elian's Miami relatives to see Elian soon and be active
participants in Elian's life during this period of transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration action did draw support from some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who spoke out was Representative J. Joseph Moakley,
Democrat of South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, also voiced
support for the action.

VIVID IMAGES AGAIN MAKE MEDIA PART OF THE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN AND MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With explosive pictures flooding the airwaves Saturday morning
after federal agents seized 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, CBS anchor
Dan Rather remarked that the US government ``badly needs'' a
``come-together, reuniting picture'' of Elian and his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, in order to quell tensions in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, such a picture had surfaced: a photo of a
smiling Elian in the arms of his father that quickly entered the TV
networks' rotation of compelling images.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Saturday, media coverage of an ongoing news story
became a factor in the drama, and once again, pictures held a
unique power to sway public opinion. The networks, especially the
all-news cable channels, repeatedly aired video footage of a crying
Elian being carried by a federal agent from the home of his Miami
relatives into a waiting van; Fox News Channel ran it in
slow-motion, heightening its emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most potent image of the day was an Associated
Press photo of a federal agent pointing a gun in the direction of
the frightened child and Donato Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who
resued Elian last November. By early Saturday afternoon, that photo
appeared on a sign held by a protester, who made sure to stand
behind network correspondents during their standups, creating a
media-mirror effect. Even Gregory Craig, the attorney for Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, conceded that images of Elian's removal may have
``seemed shocking and scary,'' which may explain why Craig moved
quickly to supply the smiling-reunion picture of Elian and his
father to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a home video of Elian saying he did not want to
return to Cuba became a weapon in the battle for public opinion. To
the end, both sides in the drama sought to use the media,
especially television, to bolster their case.
</P>
<P>
   After Elian had been removed, his cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez,
emotionally reenacted the scene for the benefit of TV cameras while
giving a tour of her home to show the damage inflicted by
government agents. On the other side, Craig sent a letter to the
news presidents of the TV networks Friday night, asking that they
refrain from ``exploitative television coverage of the child,''
especially of him being removed from the home.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the networks mobilized quickly to cover the story
Saturday, although ABC's live coverage lagged nearly 45 minutes
behind CBS, CNN, NBC, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and NECN.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, who was the first of the anchors from the three
broadcast networks to appear Saturday, asked a question that may
reverberate in the days ahead as the media mull their role in the
five-months-long Elian saga: ``Have we overcovered this story?''

 (PART I OF A 3-PART SERIES.)  
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Early on the evening of Nov. 22, Juan Miguel Gonzalez came home
from work to find his family in a panic. His mother was trying to
tell him something, but couldn't seem to get it out. Finally, she
took him into the kitchen and gave him the news: his former wife,
Elisabeth, and their 5-year-old son, Elian, were nowhere to be
found. The boy had been unaccountably absent from school that day,
and one of Elisabeth's friends had told the family there were
rumors that she had taken the child on a boat and left for la Yuma,
the United States.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel grabbed his younger brother, Tony, and took off
across Cardenas, the town on Cuba's north coast where they have
lived all their lives. When they arrived at the apartment Elisabeth
and Elian shared with her boyfriend, the door was locked; no one
was home. They went on to the apartment where the boyfriend's
parents lived, but no one was there either, and neighbors said the
family had sold its furniture and disappeared. Everyone assumed
that like so many Cubans before them, they had headed for the
Florida coast.
 &HT;    At 9:01 that night, Juan Miguel's father, Juan, called collect
to relatives in Miami. In the elaborate case put forward by the
lawyers and politicians who sought to keep the boy in the United
States, the phone bill for the call has been waved about as
evidence that Juan Miguel, 31, might have known in advance of plans
for the furtive crossing _ that he might actually have given his
approval so that his son could live in freedom. But even the
relatives who would later fight him for the custody of Elian recall
the conversation differently. ``They were worried,'' said Lazaro
Gonzalez, one of Juan Miguel's uncles. ``The mother had left with
the boy in some sort of boat.''
 &HT;    What is, in fact, clear about that first call, and the flurry of
others that followed it, is something that was easily lost in the
ensuing controversy: Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not hesitate to turn
to his aunts and uncles in Miami for help in the crisis, and they
did not hesitate to help him. The next day, Lazaro said, he bought
a $10 telephone card and called to reassure the family that such
trips often took a few days and that he would look out for the boy.
Finally, on Thanksgiving, the Miami relatives phoned Cuba with the
news that Elian had been pulled from the sea by a couple of
fishermen. Later, after visiting him at a hospital near Fort
Lauderdale, Lazaro called again to tell them that the boy's mother
had perished but that Elian had survived the ordeal astonishingly
well.
 &HT;    On Friday, Nov. 26, Juan Miguel's father spoke to his eldest
sister, Caridad, in Miami. Television news crews had already turned
up at the hospital, followed by the first Cuban-American
politicians offering their support. With all the attention, Caridad
had begun hoping for a second small miracle to follow Elian's
rescue: that her brother and his family might finally have a reason
to leave Cuba and join the rest of the Gonzalezes in the United
States.
 &HT;    ``I told him he should grab a visa and one for his wife and
another for Juan Miguel and come here right away,'' said Caridad, a
slender, elegant looking woman in her late 60s. ``It seemed like
they wanted to come; he said he would give an answer. I think they
started preparing their papers. But then they called back later and
said some functionary of the government would be coming to get the
boy.'' From the moment Caridad hung up the phone, her brother and
nephew began to slip from their relatives' view, leaving nothing
between Miami and Fidel Castro but a skinny little boy, now 6.
 &HT;    Yet even among the quiet minority of Gonzalezes in Miami who
tried again and again to persuade their family members to give the
boy back to his father, there has always been a charitable
explanation for what happened next. They say that starting with
Caridad and her brother Delfin, Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles
first thought of keeping Elian in the United States partly as a way
to pull the family together.
 &HT;    ``The obsession of her life has been to have the whole family
here,'' one of Caridad's nephews in Miami told me last month.
``That has been her reason for living. The idea was to use the boy
to bring the others here.'' However difficult it may be to think of
the struggle over Elian as the product of a misguided effort at
family reunification, it might once have been no easier to imagine
what it would take to break the Gonzalezes apart.
 &HT;    In the 41 years since Castro came to power, the family has held
together through political differences and personal tragedies,
long, painful separations and assorted family spats. Even now, it
is hard to have a conversation in either country without hearing
one of the Gonzalezes talk about how things used to be. ``Eramos
siempre tan unidos,'' they say. ``We were always close.''
 &HT;    The Gonzalezes have not been generous with their past. On either
side of the fight, they have surrendered only the simplest pieces
of their history, sometimes adopting the accounts of their new
allies rather than expose something more personal. In Miami as in
Cardenas, there have been party lines. And in the absence of any
real change in Cuba, or in Cuba's relationship with the United
States, they have been easy proxies for political adversaries that
know each other well.
 &HT;    Yet before the men started wearing suits and the women got
makeovers and everyone began speaking from prepared texts, the
Gonzalezes were like countless other Cuban families, divided by
geography and politics but also struggling in endless small ways to
bridge the Straits of Florida. Their choices _ even about whether
to stay in Cuba or leave _ have often been more personal than
ideological. Brothers and cousins a few years apart have seen the
country through different eyes, and their loyalties have been
shaped as much by their personalities as their ideals.
 &HT;    Before Elian, the faults that ran through the Gonzalez family
had less to do with political history than with telephone calls and
care packages and things said in anger that were never quite
forgotten. Now, however, the cold war has come to this: in the last
bitter days of the struggle over Elian, Juan Miguel's uncle Delfin,
62, stands behind a police line in Bethesda, Md., with one of Juan
Miguel's cousins, Alfredo Martell, who is 28. Speaking through a
translator, they tell one television news crew after another that
they just want a chance to talk to Juan Miguel, to work things out.
 &HT;    Delfin mentions that he is Juan Miguel's godfather; Alfredo and
Juan Miguel grew up together in the same house. Juan Miguel may be
within earshot of where they stand. But if so, he is somewhere in
the residence of the Cuban government's chief envoy to Washington,
and if he is watching on television, he is surrounded by Cuban
officials who would hurry to point out the man from the Cuban
American National Foundation, the most powerful anti-Castro
political group in the United States. He is the heavyset guy
standing directly behind Delf!n and Alfredo, the one translating
what they say.
 &HT;    Cardenas, where the story begins, is in some ways a logical
setting: it sits due south of the Florida Keys, in the path of
currents that have carried wave after wave of desperate migrants to
the United States. Though it is only two and a half hours east of
Havana, the town feels more distant. At rush hour, if it can be
called that, the main streets are a tangle of horse carts and
bicycles and vintage American sedans.
 &HT;    When most of its elegant colonial facades were built in the 19th
century, Cardenas was a thriving sugar town, a well-heeled neighbor
to the sophisticated port city of Matanzas. But the boom ended
before the century was over, a victim of the long fight to evict
Spain. By the time Castro and his rebels overthrew Fulgencio
Batista in 1959, the most strategic thing about Cardenas was
probably its rum distillery.
 &HT;    For the most part, Cardenas was remote from the centers of the
uprising. But it was by no means removed from the upheaval that
followed. Juan Miguel's grandparents, Luis and Georgina, weathered
the revolution relatively well; Luis kept his job as a stevedore at
the Cardenas port. The couple's nine children _ Juan Miguel's
father, aunts and uncles _ had a tougher time. Their eldest son,
Jose Luis, bought into the best cafeteria in town, the Cosmopolita,
only to have it confiscated by the new government. Others struggled
to find any work at all.
 &HT;    Delfin, then a dock worker in his early 20s, was among those in
the family with great hopes for the revolution. ``I think I
supported them for about a month,'' he said of the Communists.
``When I saw the injustices that were being committed, I knew that
it wasn't going to be the right thing for Cuba.'' Though many of
his friends had joined the new government, he did not hesitate to
attack it in their presence. Eventually, he began conspiring
against the new regime.
 &HT;    On March 22, 1962, Delfin was arrested and charged with
subversion. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and his mother,
especially, was devastated. Pina, as everyone called her, took down
the large framed photograph of Castro that she had put up on the
living-room wall. She also tried her best to banish politics from
the family's crowded home at No. 170 Cossio St.
 &HT;    ``When something would happen in politics, my uncles would
always want to discuss it,'' the eldest of Juan Miguel's cousins,
Jose Antonio, recalled. ``But anytime things got a little hot, my
grandmother intervened. She would say: 'You are brothers. You are a
family. Stay away from politics.''' Later, several of Juan Miguel's
aunts and uncles would remember 1962 as the year they began
thinking about a new life outside of Cuba.
 &HT;    One aunt saw her husband hauled off to prison with Delfin.
Another uncle, Manuel, or Manolo, as he is known, married and
resolved to try to raise his family in the United States. For
Caridad, whose husband had divorced her and hopped a boat for
Miami, America became a dream of opportunity, freedom and requited
love. In September 1965, Castro announced that Cubans with
relatives in the United States would be free to leave. By
Christmas, chartered American planes were flying twice a day out of
an airport 16 miles from the Gonzalez home, near the beach resort
of Varadero. In April, Caridad, then a 35-year-old seamstress,
boarded one of the so-called freedom flights and flew to Miami by
herself, crying the whole way. She was among more than 17,000
Cubans to make the trip that year, one of almost 300,000 who left
before Castro halted the flights in 1973.
 &HT;    Although Caridad promised Pina that she would eventually send
for everyone, the others had little choice but to make do. ``It's
like a chain,'' said the youngest of Juan Miguel's aunts, Haydee,
56, as she sat in the small home in Cardenas where she has lived
alone since the death of her husband and the departure of two of
her three children to Miami. ``Your husband has his family. You
have children, and then they have their families. You can't leave
just like that.''
 &HT;    Haydee got a job in a school cafeteria. Manolo trained as a
mechanic and found work repairing boat motors for a fishing
cooperative _ thinking every day, he said, about how easy it might
be to gather his family and disappear in the night. Lazaro emerged
as a talented young gymnast just as Cuba began to pour resources
into its sports program; early on, he was in some ways the
luckiest. Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela, eventually became a clerk
in the local courts, and his father, Juan, took a job as a police
investigator in the interior ministry. It was a career choice that
not all his siblings appreciated.
 &HT;    ``Think about it,'' said Delfin, who had at the time just been
freed from a nightmarish series of prisons. ``I criticized him a
lot. I'd ask: 'Why are you doing that? There is other work around.
Leave that alone.''' Unable to find a decent job and unwilling to
stifle his complaints, Delfin grew rice in the mangrove swamps and
waged a long, low-intensity conflict with the state. In 1979, with
Caridad's help, he got a visa and came to the United States just
months before his mother's death.
 &HT;    Not long after, Castro opened the doors again, and thousands of
Cubans left for the United States in the Mariel boat lift. Some of
the Gonzalezes bought new suitcases and packed up their belongings.
But in the chaos, they hesitated and were ultimately unable to
leave. Shortly thereafter, Caridad received U.S. citzenship, and
members of the family got ready again. Even with money sent by
Delfin, the passage wasn't easy. One of Juan Miguel's aunts brought
her family in 1983, and Luis, the family patriarch, followed her
the next spring.
 &HT;    Manolo and Lazaro took their families to Costa Rica in August
1984 and applied for American visas there. It was an agonizing trip
in which the two brothers had to leave their wives and children
behind for months while they went to the United States to establish
residency. Almost all of the Gonzalezes moved at first into the
insular world of Little Havana. Speaking almost no English, they
shopped at Latin-owned stores, gossiped at Cuban coffee stands and
got their news from Spanish-language radio and television stations
that mirrored the zealous politics they had left behind in Cuba.
The emigre culture that received them had begun to grow more
diverse with the influx of the younger, more liberal Marielitos.
But at the same time, older anti-Castro exiles were coming into
their own as an American political force.
 &HT;    In Cuba, the next generation of Gonzalezes grew up seeing the
country differently. Although the oldest of Juan Miguel's cousins
was only seven years younger than his uncle Lazaro, none of them
knew a world before Fidel. In the late 1960s and '70s, when some of
Juan Miguel's uncles were growing bitter, when his aunts felt like
outcasts for going to church, some of their children seem to have
thrived. What they remember now, more than the uniforms they wore
or the revolutionary songs they were made to learn in school, is
their life in the crowded house on Cossio Street.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't just on birthdays and Christmas _ it was every
night,'' Juan Miguel's cousin Lourdes Martell said. ``All of us,
the cousins, were together all the time.''
 &HT;    The opportunities they had varied. Like thousands of other young
Cubans of his generation, Juan Miguel's eldest cousin, Jose
Antonio, became the first member of his family to attend college,
earning a degree from the University of Matanzas that led him to a
job with the ministry of agriculture. His sister Milagros had a
less successful experience with the educational bureaucracy.
Considered for a coveted scholarship to art school, she was
rejected after an official came to her home for an interview and
saw a picture of Christ displayed on the wall.
 &HT;    But if Castro had chosen among the cousins for one to champion
his crusade, he could not have done better than Juan Miguel.
Following in his father's path, Juan Miguel joined the Union of
Young Communists at 15 and threw himself into the duties it
presented: attending political rallies, volunteering to work on the
agricultural harvest, keeping an eye on the ``revolutionary
morale'' of his comrades. He became a full member of the Cuban
Communist Party at the tender age of 24, an achievement he called
``the proudest thing that can happen to you.''
 &HT;    Like his father, Juan Miguel also fell in love with a woman who
seemed to share his commitment to the revolution. In September
1984, he met Elisabeth Brotons at her friend Ismary Pruneda's
quincea$era, the Latin equivalent of a sweet 16 party, and they
soon fell in love. Juan Miguel's friends remember him then as a
funny, gregarious kid of 15. Elisa, as everyone called her, was 14:
a pretty, diffident girl with black hair and a nice smile. ``She
talked so softly that you always had to tell her to speak up,''
Ismary said.
 &HT;    In a town that even now feels more country than city, and in a
country where sex and love are often the most available freedoms,
no one seems to have worried much that the novios might be too
young. ``They were little kids, but it was different,'' Elisa's
mother, Raquel Rodriguez, said, not quite explaining the
difference. ``Today, two kids get married that young and it lasts a
few months. That didn't happen with them.''
 &HT;    When they did marry, Elisa was just shy of 16, Juan Miguel not
yet 17. She rented a white dress from the Palace of Brides on the
Calle Real, the main drag in Cardenas, and they borrowed an elegant
old car to drive to the ceremony. In the fading black-and-white
photographs that Raquel Rodriguez now keeps in a plain cardboard
box, they toast each other with Champagne _ Elisa with a shy smile
and feathered, Farrah Fawcett hair; Juan Miguel in a dark suit with
both buttons buttoned and a wispy teen-age mustache.

 (PART II OF A 3-PART SERIES.)  
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After Elisabeth Brotons and Juan Miguel Gonzalez were married,
they lived first with Elisa's mother, Raquel Rodriguez, and her
second husband, Rolando, in an airy three-bedroom apartment above a
pharmacy in the center of town. Elisa, an only child, seemed to
thrive among the Gonzalezes. Juan Miguel left school after 10th
grade and went to work in a paper factory, training to become an
electrician. Before their marriage, Elisa had started a secretarial
program at a live-in vocational school in a town an hour away, but
she had become homesick and quit. Eventually, Elisa and Juan Miguel
went to night school to earn their high school degrees.
 &HT;    While he completed his three years of military service with an
army firefighting unit near Cardenas, she enrolled at a vocational
school in Varadero that prepared workers for jobs in hotels and
restaurants. Her timing couldn't have been better. Varadero, a long
ribbon of white-sand beach that extends out from the coast 10 miles
west of Cardenas, was becoming a centerpiece of Fidel Castro's
reluctant effort to attract foreign capital after the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Its hotels, many of them operated or partly owned
by foreign companies, offered some of the best-paying jobs in the
country.
 &HT;    Soon, the resort was providing enough dollars to make Cardenas
one of the most prosperous towns in Cuba. By the time Elisa
finished hotel school, the classes were filling up with Cuba's best
and brightest, those who could have chosen medicine or physics but
realized that the country's most lucrative jobs would be tending
bar and carrying tourists' bags. Like the scratchy signals of AM
radio stations and the television broadcasts that people in
Cardenas pull down from Miami on homemade antennas, Varadero was
also a window on the outside world. Kids from Cardenas would
hitchhike just to watch the tourists play Pac-Man or use Coke
machines.
 &HT;    ``You knew there were places called Canada and Spain and New
York because you learned about them in geography class,'' Juan
Miguel's cousin, Jose Antonio, 42, said. ``But when the tourists
started coming, we would go and stand next to them and just sniff.
And after all those years of the same soap, they smelled
different.''
 &HT;    In 1990, Elisa went to work as a chambermaid at the newest
Varadero hotel, the Paradiso-Punta Arenas. The job wasn't
glamorous, and there was a catch: the all-inclusive resort
discouraged tipping and it attracted mostly low-budget tourists on
package trips. But the wages were excellent by Cuban standards, and
they were augmented by a steady flow of precious gifts from the
guests _ half-empty bottles of rum, shampoo and cosmetics and
not-so-old clothes.
 &HT;    ``She said that job was her salvation,'' said Ismary Pruneda,
who finished the secretarial program they had started together and
ended up hawking pork sandwiches at a farmer's market. ``She would
say to me, 'Do you think I like cleaning floors?' She did it
because she could live decently from that. I had struggled so much
to finish, and there I was, 9 or 10 hours a day, yelling, 'Pork
meat!'''
 &HT;    Juan Miguel also found a job in Varadero, at Josone Park, the
converted estate of a Basque immigrant who ran the Havana Club
distillery in Cardenas before the revolution. Starting on the
maintenance crew, Juan Miguel worked his way up to the admission
booth, and he shared in the tips that the waiters and bartenders
pooled. Eventually, he and Elisa did well enough to buy a creaky
1956 Nash Rambler and to build a home for themselves beside the
house on Cossio Street. They watched videos on a hard-earned VCR
and drove to the beach in Varadero on weekends.
 &HT;    On the surface, at least, the couple remained steadfast
fidelistas. Elisa was by all accounts a diligent maid, and although
she was more muted about her politics than Juan Miguel, she, too,
became a party member and the secretary of the Communist Party
committee at her job. It was not coincidental that those working in
Varadero (who now include perhaps a fifth of the Cardenas labor
force) tended to be loyal revolutionaries. They showed a proud face
to foreign visitors and could be trusted to cope with the new
economy's darker side: rampant prostitution, petty theft by hotel
employees and a kind of tourism apartheid in which ordinary Cubans
were often barred from the restaurants and nightclubs where they
themselves worked.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel's cousin, Alfredo, became a hotel security guard and
earned much of his income from older foreign men who tipped him to
let them sneak young Cuban women into their rooms. They were women
whose faces he says he cannot forget. ``They would come to you
sometimes and say, 'Hey, look, I'm only doing this because I have
kids to feed or because my mother is sick,''' he said. ``That kind
of stuff hits you and hits you until you finally say, 'I am getting
out of here or I am going to die in the ocean trying.'''
 &HT;    After years of growing prosperity in the 1980s, Castro had
announced the ``Special Period in Time of Peace,'' an official
euphemism for economic disaster. Even with the cushion of their
Varadero jobs, the Gonzalezes had to make charcoal or scavenge for
crude oil in order to cook their meals. Alfredo, who did his
military service in the Cardenas police, saw the turmoil there
through the eyes of his uncle Juan, 54, a proud, easygoing man who
had always got along with the regime as he had with his brothers
and sisters.
 &HT;    ``Anybody who tried to sell things to get by, the cops took it
away,'' Alfredo said. ``When the lights went out, people would
throw bottles at us. Once upon a time, Juan was one of them. But
after the special period, he saw that things were not the way Fidel
said they were.'' Alfredo recalled one day when there was nothing
to eat and his uncle scrounged up a piece of bread, cut some grass
from the yard with a knife and made a sandwich of it. He ate it and
then threw up. Without telling his family, Juan Miguel's younger
brother, Tony, 25, applied for an American visa. When it was
granted, Juan Miguel and his mother talked him out of going, Juan
Miguel told me.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel and Elisa had other problems as well. From the time
she was 16 or 17, they struggled to have a child, losing four
pregnancies in succession. In 1989, she was found to have a
bacterial parasite that was thought to have caused her recurrent
miscarriages. Even after she was treated, she lost three more
pregnancies _ one of them at seven months. Under the rationing
system that governs the allocation of everything from children's
milk to gifts for newlyweds, expectant Cuban women could buy a crib
and a mattress in state stores. Elisa bought the items again and
again, her friend Ismary said. ``Later, she would have to sell them
because she couldn't handle the memories.''
 &HT;    After several years of marriage, Elisa and Juan Miguel had also
begun to drift apart. Friends saw them as having less and less in
common: she loved clothes and perfume and romantic movies; he liked
hanging out with friends. ``When they met, it was all dreamy, but
at that age, the same things don't matter that matter later on,''
said Marta Elena Hidalgo, the wife of one of Juan Miguel's closest
friends. ``Years later, they weren't alike at all. He is this
playful, outgoing guy, and she was a girl who was very low key,
very reserved.''
 &HT;    Juan Miguel, who liked to spend some of his comfortable salary
at bars and discotheques, began to go with other women. Sitting
around the dining-room table recently with his parents, his second
wife, Nersy, 23, and their infant son, Hianny, Juan Miguel spoke
uneasily about the breakup of his first marriage, mentioning the
long, stressful effort to have a child. His mother reminded him of
another issue. ``Yeah, it was mostly because of the way I was,'' he
said. ``How to put it? It was probably my fooling around with other
women, being on the street.''
 &HT;    Finally, in May 1991, they divorced. Then, several months later,
they were living together again. ``We had always wanted to have a
child,'' Juan Miguel said. ``We got together again to see if we
could do it. And finally we did.'' After months of bed rest and
prenatal checkups, Elisa gave birth on Dec. 6, 1993. The couple had
known from the sonograms that they were expecting a boy, and they
made up their own name for him, using the first three letters of
Elisa and the last two of Juan.
 &HT;    In his excitement, Juan Miguel couldn't wait for Elisa to return
from the hospital to start celebrating. ``I told them to wait,''
her mother, Raquel, 51, said. ``But he couldn't stop himself.
Elisa's half-brother had gotten this pig, and he slaughtered it
right then, and they started frying pork rinds and drinking beer
and rum with their friends. They had the party without us.''
 &HT;    Now, at least, it is impossible to find anyone who knew the
couple well who does not describe both young parents as having
cherished Elian. The games and toys that fill his rooms at Raquel's
apartment and on Cossio Street might not look like much to a kid
now hooked on Nintendo, but they must have looked extravagant to
his playmates.
 &HT;    ``Other kids around here may be in a difficult situation,'' said
Juan Miguel's cousin, Lourdes, who is Elian's godmother. ``But
there was nothing that boy wanted that he didn't have.'' For a
while, some of their friends said, the little boy with his father's
eyes and his mother's nose seemed to hold the couple together. But
after a while, the relationship buckled again.
 &HT;    As much as Elisa cared for Juan Miguel, she told her
girlfriends, she was tired of his running around. Juan Miguel, for
his part, said he felt different, too. ``She was like a sister to
me,'' he said. In February 1997, 11 years after they were married
and two months after Elian's third birthday, they separated for
good.
 &HT;    ``It was the same as before,'' Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela,
51, said, looking sadly at her son. ``The same motive.''
 &HT;    Elisa moved back in with her mother and Rolando, in the
apartment above the pharmacy, a short walk from Cossio Street.
According to several of her friends and several of Juan Miguel's,
she not only shared custody of the boy but also remained close to
her former in-laws. And she had a significant example: her mother,
Raquel, had remained on such good terms with Elisa's father that
she would go to parties with her husband and ex-husband on either
arm. Elisa's close friend Lisbeth Garcia said that Elisa and Juan
Miguel sometimes fought over Elian but that they generally did an
admirable job of remaining friends after the split.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I told her that they got along better as friends
than they did at the end of their marriage,'' she said. Still,
Lisbeth and others remember the months after the divorce as a
deeply lonely time for Elisa. She and Lisbeth worked long hours at
the hotel, often arriving home after 8 p.m., and Elisa seemed to
miss the bustle and warmth of Cossio Street. It made it worse that
Juan Miguel seemed to meet lots of other women and that his job
gave him a little more time to spend with Elian.
 &HT;    On Saturdays and school holidays, Juan Miguel would take the boy
with him to the park, and on the mornings after Elian stayed over
at Cossio Street, they had a long ritual of ``little hugs'' to mark
their goodbyes. ``There were times we almost missed the bus because
Juan Miguel would spend 10 minutes saying goodbye, doing those
little hugs,'' said his friend Fidel Ramirez, who has worked with
him at the park for a decade.
 &HT;    Elisa's life began to turn on an evening in August 1997, her
friend Lisbeth said. They had gone out after work to a Varadero
nightspot, the Havana Club. As they danced, several women together,
a young man approached them and asked if he could join. Lisbeth
agreed; she recognized him as El Loco, a guy she had seen around in
Cardenas. After a while, Lisbeth and another friend went to the
bathroom, leaving Elisa and the man, Lazaro Rafael Munero, on the
dance floor. By the time they got back, Lisbeth said, Elisa had
found a new friend.
 &HT;    Rafa, as they called him, showed no sign of the temper that
apparently earned him his nickname. When the group decided to
continue on to a second nightclub, he offered to pay for a taxi.
Then he drove them home in his own car, first dropping off Lisbeth,
her sister and her cousin and then leaving Elisa at the apartment
above the pharmacy. ``I don't think a week went by before they got
together,'' Lisbeth said. ``Within about two months, he went to
live with her at Raquel's house.''
 &HT;    To her mother and some of her friends, that seemed too fast. But
Elisa insisted that she had found a good man. The son of an oil
worker, Munero had dropped out of school in 10th grade; at age 18,
he was imprisoned for more than a year for breaking into a hotel
room with a friend and stealing $236.55 from a German tourist. When
he met Elisa, he was 22; his steadiest job had been selling soft
drinks and beer to tourists on the beach in front of one of the
Varadero hotels.
 &HT;    Mostly, he made his living as a taxi driver, shuttling between
Cardenas and Varadero without a license in a country that makes a
very big thing of licenses. But Munero was also a master in the
Cuban art of resolviendo, or getting hold of things, and he had
little trouble winning Elisa's heart. ``He knew how to work her,''
Lisbeth recalled. ``He was always very close to her, very
affectionate, very attentive. And little by little, she fell for
him.''
 &HT;    In the storm of propaganda that began soon after Elian's rescue,
no one has been hit harder than Munero, who also died in the
crossing. Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist
Party, described him this way: Munero was a bad kid. When he
dropped out of school, after picking fights with all sorts of
classmates, it was ``to undertake a criminal career.'' When he was
with Elisa, the paper quotes a friend of hers, she would turn up
with a black eye one day, a swollen wrist the next. ``Munero,'' the
report says, ``with his dominating and violent personality, exerted
a strange and fatal influence over Elisabeth.''
 &HT;    But as with much of the story, some of the same people cited in
the official account later described Munero in softer, more complex
terms. Dayana Oceguera, his jilted former girlfriend and another
bright Young Communist in excellent standing, described him as a
guy who came on strong and was very sure about things, like his
desire for her to quit her studies (which she refused to do) and
have his child (which she did). He was a lousy father, she said,
but could be helpful in emergencies.
 &HT;    ``He wasn't such a terrible person,'' she said. ``He had a
strong character and a lot of complexes. If somebody looked at him
crosswise, he got mad about it.'' But she added: ``He was a very
family-oriented guy. If I got sick, he would take care of me. He
could `resolver' anything _ things that were possible and things
that were impossible.'' Even Juan Miguel seemed reluctant to pile
on. ``He would come by here sometimes to pick up the boy or drop
him off,'' he said of Munero. ``We got along with him all right.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Less than a year after Lazaro Rafael Munero had moved in with
Elisabeth Brotons, he left Cuba in a small boat with three friends.
Elisa's relatives say that he tried to persuade her to go with him
but that she refused.
 &HT;    In Miami, Munero lived with an aunt and worked 12-hour days at a
car wash for $5 an hour. He passed again and again on invitations
to go out after work, to the movies to meet girls, and no one seems
to have been impressed by his enthusiasm for America. Milagros
Garcia, the aunt with whom he stayed, thought it was the
loneliness, more than the hard work, that Munero couldn't take.
 &HT;    She recalled the day when Munero received a letter from Elisa
with three photographs. On the back of one, she wrote in a loopy,
girlish script: ``My Love: Keep this photo which is sent to you
with all of the affection that you deserve. From your Little One.''
On another, in which Elian stares out at the camera with his eyes
still wide, she wrote, ``For Munero, with all the affection of his
little boy, Elian.'' Munero was thrilled, his aunt said, but she
kidded him mercilessly. ``I said, 'Ay, Rafa, she's so ugly!' But he
couldn't hear that. He told me: 'Auntie, don't say that! I'm in
love!' I think he was obsessed with her.''
 &HT;    Four months after his arrival in Florida, Munero asked his aunt
to hold some of his clothes and most of the $3,000 he had saved and
used the remainder to buy a motorized rubber raft. His relatives
tried repeatedly to dissuade him but could not. On Oct. 26, 1998,
he and another man were picked up by the Cuban Coast Guard as they
made their way into a bay in the central province of Villa Clara.
 &HT;    Munero spent the next two months there in prison, and Elisa's
friends said she visited him at least five times. Munero was
released on New Year's Eve, and he appears to have spent the
following weeks telling anyone who would listen that his trip north
had been a terrible mistake. Several people who saw him then said
they believed him; in Miami, his aunt would later say she had heard
that he was badly beaten by his jailers. For a time, Munero moved
back in with Elisa at her mother's apartment, but the arrangement
did not last.
 &HT;    Raquel Rodriguez says now that he was abusive to her daughter
and she would not stand for it. But while her views could be tinted
by both the loss of her daughter and pressure from the government,
she seems to have been clear, long before her daughter's death, of
her distaste for Elisa's young boyfriend. Not long after Munero's
return, the couple rented an apartment of their own and took Elian
with them.
 &HT;    Months later, they set off before dawn in a homemade boat with a
balky 50-horsepower motor: Elisa and Elian; Munero, his two
brothers and their parents; a friend of Elisa's, her husband and
his family; and a young couple with a 5-year-old girl. When engine
trouble forced the group back to shore for repairs, the young
couple had second thoughts and left the girl behind. Elisa kept
Elian aboard.
 &HT;    Five months later, there is nothing about Elisa's decision to
leave that is not contested in some way. In Miami, lawyers for the
Gonzalez family claim that she and Munero had been hounded by the
authorities because of his troubles with the law. In Cuba,
officials insist that Munero must have coerced Elisa into making
the trip. But if Elisa confided her thoughts to anyone who is still
alive, they have kept them to themselves.
 &HT;    In her silence, it didn't take long for Cubans on either side of
the Straits to seize on Elian as a metaphor for the country's
future. Juan Miguel remembers how quickly Cuban-American
politicians seemed to appear at his uncle's modest stucco home,
picking the boy up and holding him like a trophy. Only in their
first conversation after Elian was released from the hospital did
the boy ever speak about what had happened.
 &HT;    '''Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: 'Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: 'With all this, your life is set
here. With him having come on Thanksgiving and all that, they have
all kinds of money collected. They'll give you a house; they'll
give you a car. You won't have to work another day in your life.
The whole family can come with you.''' None of it was very
specific, Juan Miguel said, but several of his other aunts and
uncles called with similar pleas.
 &HT;    ``Then Lazaro and Delfin called, and they started to offend
me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me how bad the
government here is, all that. And me _ I have my ideals. I told
them, 'There's nothing to talk about with you guys,' and I hung up
on them. They never said a thing about the boy staying there _ they
were just insisting that we should go there.'' Caridad called back
again and again, Juan Miguel said, and he hung up on her every
time. Delfin said he was the first of the Gonzalezes in Miami to
insist that Elian should not be sent home and that Lazaro and his
21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis, were the first to back him up.
 &HT;    ``At the beginning, the father and the family there probably
thought about coming here and meeting up with the child in a free
country,'' Delfin said. ``But then things got out of their hands.
We saw that the government was getting mixed up in something that
is none of its business.'' Caridad told her nephew, ``I came to
this country to bring Cubans here, not to send them back.''
 &HT;    Whatever their politics, none of the Gonzalezes were wrong to
suspect that their relatives were being swept up by forces bigger
than themselves. On Nov. 24, the day before Elian was found, Juan
Miguel's mother, Mariela, had already gone for help to her boss at
the city tribunals. He, in turn, had spoken to the first secretary
of the Communist Party in Cardenas, Ricardo Chapelin, who called
Juan Miguel in the next day.
 &HT;    ``He was desperate,'' Chapelin said. ``He said the mother had
taken the boy, and he was completely against it.'' By the time
Elian was rescued on the 25th, Juan Miguel had been put in touch
with the foreign ministry in Havana, which two days later sent the
United States a diplomatic note seeking the boy's return.
 &HT;    Soon after that, Juan Miguel Gonzalez of No. 170 Cossio St.,
Cardenas, found himself face to face with the Comandante en Jefe.
Fidel Castro asked him how he felt about the situation and what he
wanted to do. ``He told me I could do what I pleased,'' Juan Miguel
said. ``If I wanted to leave, I could leave. Nonetheless, I told
him no. My decision was clear.''
 &HT;    Having taken the measure of his man, Castro was quick to
recognize the episode's political potential. Only two weeks before,
he had been embarrassed by criticism of his human rights record
from some of the Latin American leaders who attended a regional
summit in Havana. Now, he had an issue with the power to galvanize
not only the party faithful but also every Cuban parent and child
and millions of people abroad. It was an issue, as Cuban officials
were soon noting privately, that also had the potential to isolate
Miami's Cuban exiles from other Americans.
 &HT;    It is probably fair to assume that Juan Miguel would have been
willing to swim to Miami to pick up his son. Still, he may have
been stopped from going right away not so much to prevent his
defection (whatever the strength of his principles, his family
could always have been kept behind) but also because the Cuban
government was in no great hurry for the drama to end. Castro told
visitors as early as December that he expected the case to drag on
in American courts for months, and he has managed it accordingly,
ordering up protest rallies, television programs and ``Free Elian''
T-shirts on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Within weeks of his rescue, Elian had become the biggest
revolutionary symbol since Che. Castro's enemies were just as quick
to recognize a poster child when they saw one. Elian was not yet
out of Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital before the first
Cuban-American politicos were on the scene, led by a Sharpton-esque
political strategist and public-relations man named Armando
Gutierrez.
 &HT;    ``We met with the family, and I told them, 'You're going to need
help,''' said Gutierrez, who rushed over with a couple of local
Cuban-American politicians. ``I didn't want to make it into a
political thing. When I saw Elian's face, I knew it was something
special.''
 &HT;    As in Cuba, it has grown steadily more difficult in Miami to
untangle the thoughts of Elian's relatives from those of their
advisers, lawyers and political hangers-on. The $600-a-month rental
where Lazaro lives with his wife and two grown children has been a
magnet for politicians of various anti-Castro stripes, and it has
been infused from the beginning with their mixed feelings of
victimization and entitlement.
 &HT;    According to people working with the family, the cause has been
dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has
sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities, advised them
on strategy and helped arrange what has thus far been a largely
no-show job for Lazaro, who had been unemployed, at the Ford
dealership of one of its directors. The foundation, with a team of
lawyers, also helped to assemble its own narrative of Elian's
flight to freedom. Their method was not entirely unlike that of
Castro's state-security operatives, who, according to several
Cubans, moved systematically through the Gonzalez family's world,
interviewing people, sifting their stories and picking out the
parts that might be most useful.
 &HT;    Lazaro, who brought Elian home from the hospital, became the
most ardent crusader for the boy's continued stay. But while he has
worked closely with the politicians in Miami and Washington, his
own politics have remained vague. Many of his relatives say they
had thought of him as one of the least politically minded of his
brothers, and his life in Cuba was not marked by open conflict with
the government. In 1977, he followed his brother Juan into the
Cuban National Police and then resigned suddenly four months later,
returning to his previous work as an athletic coach.
 &HT;    Officials of the Cuban government _ which has a clear interest
in maligning Lazaro's reputation _ said he had been forced out
after an investigation found him to have associated with
``homosexual elements,'' and they provided copies of police files
purportedly documenting the inquiry. Lazaro denied the assertions
as libelous propaganda. The television crews have also gravitated
to Lazaro's daughter, Marisleysis, an assistant bank-loan processor
with a remarkable capacity to summon her anguish for the cameras.
(She has been hospitalized eight times since November for what have
been vaguely described as anxiety and stress-related illnesses.)
But while Marisleysis quickly stepped forward as a surrogate mother
for Elian, her own mother, Angela, has kept almost entirely out of
sight. Nor has the media seen much of Jose and Luis Cid, another
set of Juan Miguel's cousins, who both have long records of
problems with the law. (Luis Cid is awaiting trial in the
strong-arm robbery of a tourist in Little Havana last year.)
 &HT;    Among the Gonzalez cousins who have been most important to the
story told in Miami is one who came from Cuba little more than a
year ago, Alfredo Martell. As a latter-day emigre, Alfredo might
have been expected to take a more nuanced view of the events
surrounding Elian. His mother and sister, who remain in Cardenas,
cannot understand why their own family in Miami has put Juan Miguel
through such agony. Instead, Alfredo has been a font of assertions
meant to undermine Juan Miguel: that Elian's father wanted to move
to America himself; that he sometimes beat up Elisa; that he, too,
felt betrayed by what has happened to Cuba over the last decade.
 &HT;    A little more than a year after Alfredo arrived in Florida on
his own small boat, he views the case with the clarity of a
convert. ``Sometimes, you think it would be better for the boy to
be with his father,'' said Alfredo, whose own son, Lazaro, 5, has
once again been playing with his cousin Elian. ``But his father
knows he is probably better off here. And the kid tells you
constantly that he doesn't want to go. You also have to think _ the
boy would not be sent back to Juan Miguel; he would go back to
Fidel.''
 &HT;    Senior Cuban officials deny this, of course. They have always
maintained that as soon as Elian arrived in Cardenas, they would
stop the demonstrations, take down the posters and end the daily
two-hour television blocks devoted to the case. The houses on Juan
Miguel's block, which the government painted over in bright colors,
would be allowed to fade; the little shrine in Elian's classroom
would go back to being a desk.
 &HT;    ``He needs to recover his privacy,'' said Ricardo Alarcon, the
Cuban official who has managed the case for Castro. ``We are going
to have to work on that, but with time, it will happen.''
 &HT;    But if Elian will be missed by ``Nightline'' and ``Crossfire,''
his resonance in Cuba will be more lasting. ``What is clear is that
he is going to continue to be a boy symbol, a boy hero,'' said
Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist Party chief in Cardenas. ``This
battle did not begin with Elian. Our struggle has been one of
challenging the government of the United States for its attacks
against our country. And we will continue with this struggle, which
is one that strengthens us in every way.''
 &HT;    Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his
welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His
adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans,
managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the U.S.
attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading
influence on Capitol Hill. Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to
be weighing movie and book deals of various sorts. It is hard to
see most of the other Gonzalezes as anything but traumatized.
 &HT;    And but for Elian and Juan Miguel, none seem to have suffered
more than Juan Miguel's uncle Manolo and aunt America, who happened
to be in Spain on a long-planned trip in the days after Elian was
found. Of all the family members in the United States, they are the
ones who have remained closest to their relatives in Cuba, and they
are the ones who have tried hardest to persuade the others to give
Elian back to Juan Miguel.
 &HT;    Manolo says he cannot think about the boy now without
remembering the loss of his own son, Manuel Antonio, who died of
cancer 10 years ago at the age of 14. He has been hurt by the
shouts of ``Communist'' that he sometimes hears when he is
recognized on the street. But he said the worst of it came last
month on the last of his several trips to Lazaro's house, when his
brothers would not speak to him, Elian would not kiss him and no
one even tried to help him when he had to be rushed to the hospital
with chest pains.
 &HT;    ``What has happened, here I don't know,'' he said tearfully. ``I
never wanted that boy to go back to Cuba. I only wanted him to be
with his father.'' Manolo's wife, who sat beside him, started to
try to explain what he meant, but she, too, found herself at a
loss. ``From the beginning, this has been a family problem,'' she
said. ``Why could it not be resolved within the family?''

 &HT;    History of the Old West is a hot topic
 &HT;    By Marla Pierson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ History professor Ty Cashion entered his first
semester of teaching at East Texas State University eager to
present the latest scholarship on the American West.
</P>
<P>
   Students came in expecting cowboys and Indians, Cashion said.
They got women and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In history books such as the textbook Cashion assigned,
stereotypical Old West icons such as mountain men got little play.
</P>
<P>
   The attention they did get, Cashion noted, focused on how they
almost wiped out the beaver population and tipped the balance of
power among Indians by introducing diseases into tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students almost rebelled,'' Cashion said. ``There were
happy to eat the $40 for the book if they could leave it at home. I
went back to giving them gunsmoke and horse poop and they loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University history professor Tom Charlton said these
different views of the American West have made it one of the most
hotly contested areas of history today.
</P>
<P>
   Cashion, now professor of history at Sam Houston State
University in Huntsville, Texas, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a very vicious thing,'' Cashion said. ``If you want
to get right down to it, old Western history focuses on great men
and sensational events. It has a frontier fixation and it's written
in a romantic tone.''
</P>
<P>
   The scribe of that old history was Frederick Jackson Turner,
whose writing on the frontier in the 1890s provided the lens
through which the West was seen for the next 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus was on opportunity,'' Charlton said. ``It was more
or less a heroic view. It was people conquering the West, taming
the West. The West was always something people took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner and followers of his school see the West as an unfolding
frontier experience that is generally positive.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's view, Charlton said, missed the point. ``The West was
not an unoccupied land waiting for people.''
</P>
<P>
   It focused on the availability of land. It didn't taken women
into account. It didn't deal much with the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fairly limited view of what happened in the American
West. It was a patriarchal view,'' Charlton said.
</P>
<P>
   The old history focuses on individuals and skirts the federal
government's role in developing the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here again, that's not good news to a lot of people who want
to romanticize the West,'' Charlton said. ``They want to believe
people went out and conquered the West, not (that) the federal
government'' conquered it.
</P>
<P>
   Cashion said people are now asking, ``If there were winners of
the West, who were the losers of the West?''
</P>
<P>
   And what did the winners win? What did they do with the land?
</P>
<P>
   ``New Western historians, they have a more sober view of
history,'' said Cashion, who likes the interpretation but also
warns of transferring today's values and judgments to an earlier
time period.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the approach say the history focuses on the dark side
of the West and paints American expansion as ``an irresponsible
white man's adventure,'' Cashion said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton sees the new interpretation as a tool to see the West
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always come into my course carrying a lot of these
traditional views,'' Charlton said. ``Just about everything they
read is an eye-opener. I'm not trying to knock all of the myths out
of my students all all ... I'm trying to give them a larger context
to think about this.''

 &HT;    History didn't tell it like it was for women of the Old West
 &HT;    By Marla Pierson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The stars of the Old West tend to be men out
conquering the land, making themselves at home on the range or
defending the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shirley Weaver of Wortham, who has worked cattle with her
husband for 46 years, marvels at how her predecessors took on the
back-breaking tasks of plowing and farming while the men were away.
</P>
<P>
   The times were so much harder, she says, recalling how her
grandmother had to wring a chicken's neck and pluck its feathers to
feed unexpected company, how her ancestors canned the food they
lived off of.
</P>
<P>
   Scraping by with leftovers, surviving on the butter and egg
money, these wives cobbled together a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think women have gotten a bum rap,'' she said. ``And I
love cowboys. That song, 'My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,'
that's just the way I feel. I love men that are cowboys. But the
women, I mean they walked a lot of times on the wagon trains. They
were just tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Janice Woods Windle, who has researched the history of
her family in the Hill Country of Central Texas over several
generations, tells the story of a general in San Marcos who built a
fine home with wooden shingles.
</P>
<P>
   He told his very pregnant wife he needed to head out with a
posse and she asked what she'd do without him there to chop wood.
He, according to the story, told her she'd cope.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, he marveled at the newborn baby and his wife's
excellent health. Then he asked about the wooden shingles that had
been taken off the house.
</P>
<P>
   The wife, who had burned the shingles to keep warm and cook,
simply replied, ``Oh, I coped,'' Windle said.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the feats that make history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of women in the West is basically an oral history,''
Windle said. ``It is transferred from one female voice to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   When a woman is pregnant, she hears of the joys and fears of
raising children. When her survival is threatened, she learns how
her mother and grandmother dealt with threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ceremonies of life were not written down, except in
letters,'' Windle said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, details never made it into the records.
</P>
<P>
   Disease would have been such a part of daily life that a woman
might never have written about how a neighbor's entire family died
of smallpox or describe how she had washed the bodies. Horrors were
simply part of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost accepted that a woman would lose her first
baby,'' Windle said.
</P>
<P>
   These weren't the images printed onto posters at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   According to Don Reeves, curator of cowboy collections at the
National Cowboy Hall of Fame, by the 1900s calendars began
depicting ranch girls with hourglass figures, prim and proper with
riding skirt, gloves and hat.
</P>
<P>
   A six-gun would be strapped around their waists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You started seeing this kind of unusual thing of, 'Yes, she
was a lady, but she was a lady of the West,''' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   When women appeared in Westerns, it was often as a Calamity Jane
figure dressed as a man or as a harlot with a heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   The reality was much more complex.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, notes historian Katherine Jellison, ``when we
think of women in the West, we largely think of white women. Yet
there were so many women of color.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, the West, more than any other part of
country, was a cultural mosaic of Hispanic, Indian, Anglo, European
and African-American women, said Jellison, associate professor of
history at Ohio University.
</P>
<P>
   Even the white women hardly fell neatly into the boxes movies
created for them.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Jane Canary _ the model for Calamity Jane _ didn't live
up to her fictional counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Jellison describes her as a publicity seeker who hung around
mining towns, doing working class jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Conee Duran, a Baylor University graduate student in American
studies, notes that Calamity Jane fiction portrays her as a poor,
innocent girl who had to take up a gun to defend herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they ignored any part of the real story that didn't fit,''
Duran said. ``She was a madam; they left that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostitutes were common in the movies, but they were decked out
in glittery costumes.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, these women dressed like the working class, Jellison
said. They weren't as well spoken as Miss Kitty of the television
series ``Gunsmoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Their lives were more dangerous than the films show.
</P>
<P>
   Venereal disease before penicillin was virtually a death
sentence, Jellison said. Birth control was unreliable. And then
there was the physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotype of western women as sex objects doesn't mesh with
the harsh realities of living on frontier land, Jellison said.
</P>
<P>
   With females scarce, men needed partners that would give birth
to farm hands and take on a share of chores themselves, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The women who did make it West weren't likely to dress like men.
</P>
<P>
   According to diaries and letters, ``they really tried to
maintain women's clothing as a semblance of their identity as women
and the life they'd left,'' Jellison said.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorian standards settlers brought from the East began to
loosen somewhat in the West by the turn of the century, Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1900, for instance, it was more accepted for women to ride
astride and not sidesaddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1860s and early 1870s that would not have been
accepted. Ladies just didn't do that,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Women aren't usually depicted in cattle drives and, according to
Reeves, by and large they weren't there. ``But there were a few
rare instances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1879, Lizzie Johnson, a cattle owner from Austin, accompanied
her herd up the Chisolm Trail in her horse and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   Windle said girls from age 10 or 11 on up to when they got
married would be tasked with watching the gardens and protecting
needed crops from rabbits or foxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those young girls would sit up there with those rifles, and
they would learn to shoot at an early age,'' Windle said. ``They
learned this sharp-shooting skill out of sheer survival. It wasn't
out of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of surviving and living on, Windle said. ``Now
it's become myth. But it was born out of necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Men may have been finding the adventure they came West for, but
women were looking for something a whole lot tougher to get. ``What
they wanted most of all was to recreate the life they had known,''
Jellison said.
</P>
<P>
   And they did often end up doing pretty much the same kinds of
work as they had in the East.
</P>
<P>
   They were wives and mothers, laundresses and seamstresses and
domestic servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women didn't invent any new significant roles for
themselves,'' Jellison said. ``The kinds of images movies give us
of life in the West are largely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But these were not faint-hearted females, Windle said.
</P>
<P>
   They survived and kept a family together. ``As my mother said,
they learned they wouldn't melt when they got rained on,'' Windle
said.

LOTS OF NYUKS, NOSTALGIA IN `THREE STOOGES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE THREE STOOGES 
Starring: Paul Ben-Victor, Evan Handler, Michael Chiklis, John
Kassir 
Directed by: James Frawley 
On: ABC, Monday at 8 p.m.

   Good network biopics are very hard to come by. From ``The Audrey
Hepburn Story'' and ``The David Cassidy Story'' to ``And the Beat
Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story,'' they're enough to make even
the most rabid fame-seeker long for a life of obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   And so when a network biopic comes along that isn't exactly
excruciating, it's hard not to let out a little cheer. Which isn't
to say that ``The Three Stooges'' is a great biopic, or that it
equals any of the grittier life stories that regularly premiere on
the cable channels. For one thing, the movie does a quick
Curly-walk away from any of the Stooges' troublesome character
flaws. And for another, it relies too heavily on biopic cliches and
oversimplification as it crams the better part of a century and
four complicated characters into two scrawny TV hours.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Three Stooges'' does have a few important pluses that
make it worth a look. Most notably, all of the actors do an
exciting job of re-creating, but not impersonating, the classic
slapstick trio. They look like the Stooges, but they don't look
like they're trying too hard to look like the Stooges. Even with
the presence of Moe's trademark bowl-cut bangs and Larry's insane
frizz, there's none of the cheesy mimickry and kitschy costuming
that belongs in the campier context of a nightclub impersonation.
The acting is natural and affectionate, not self-conscious and
artificial.
</P>
<P>
   The framing device of ``The Three Stooges,'' set in the late
1950s, centers around Paul Ben-Victor's Moe Howard, a proud man who
doesn't want to reunite the Stooges despite the enthusiasm of a
young entrepreneur. As Moe recalls the history of the Stooges, we
see it all in flashbacks, from the early vaudeville days to the
years making short films for Columbia. We see his oldest brother,
Shemp (John Kassir), drop in and out of the trio due to a nervous
condition that the movie never quite explains. We see his youngest
brother, Jerome (Michael Chiklis), shave his head, adopt the name
Curly, and take Shemp's place. We also catch a glimpse of Curly's
personal woes, including alcoholism and pill-popping, which bring
him to an early grave, but the movie doesn't give up those details
either. And we meet Larry Fine (Evan Handler), who becomes like a
brother to the Howards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the better moments in ``The Three Stooges'' are the
reassembled Stooges skits, like the memorable ``Calling Dr. Howard,
Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard'' bit. These black-and-white scenes recapture
the joy and wackiness of the original versions, while they serve as
a reminder of the art behind this kind of comedy. A precursor to
the physical antics of Jim Carrey, the Stooges slapstick involved
careful three-person choreography and enough free-spiritedness to
look certifiably foolish. Their clowning was hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The skits in ``The Three Stooges'' also recall a time when
entertainment was so much more innocent than it is today. It's
amazing to see a few knocks on the head igniting hysterical
laughter in vaudeville audiences, and by the end of the movie you
may find yourself hankering for that same innocence and a few good
Stooges shorts (American Movie Classics airs them on weekend
mornings, from 8 to 11).
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the real story behind the classic
eye-poking comedians, you will be disappointed with ``The Three
Stooges.'' It raises a number of interesting facts, from Larry's
gambling issues to the Howard family's strong Jewish identity
(their real last name was Horwitz), and then it leaves them
hanging. But if you're in the market for some light nostalgia, then
you have only one thing to say to yourself: ``Why soitenly.''

   TOKYO _ Starting this week, music fans across Japan will be
stepping up to a gadget that resembles a souped up, stand-alone
automated teller, plugging in a blank minidisk, dropping in some
coins and, 30 to 40 seconds later, walking away with their favorite
recordings. And they will not be limited to just a few selections;
thanks to a super-fast, high-capacity digital connection to a
central computer, thousands upon thousands of popular songs will be
potentially available at the touch of a few buttons.
</P>
<P>
   No more long waits. No more illicit downloading of MP3 files.
Just music fast, simple and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a Music POD, and while it may seem like just another
plaything for Japanese teen-agers, it is in fact a powerful
representation of the tectonic shifts taking place in the economy
here.
</P>
<P>
   What the Music POD embodies is the entrepreneurial vision of a
30-year-old college dropout and the business skills of a
40-something former salaryman, founders of a young company called
V-Sync. They are the sorts of men who five years ago would have
toiled anonymously inside a major corporation, climbing the ladder
of seniority and keeping their dreams tightly locked up in their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   But today changes in the relationship between employer and
employee, the liberalization of the financial markets and the
explosion of new business models in the freewheeling arenas of the
Internet and information technology are spawning a whole new breed
of entrepreneurs who care little for the conventions that have
dominated Japan Inc. for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a gear turning the wheels of a big
company,'' said Katsuma Fujii, V-Sync's chairman and the younger of
its co-founders. ``It's difficult for a lowly gear to get his
bosses to listen to, let alone accept, his out-of-this-world ideas
in a traditional Japanese corporation. I want to do what I want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of start-ups that can be counted is still low
in comparison with the United States, venture capitalists say they
began detecting a significant increase in activity last year that
is continuing today despite the weak economy. The number of initial
public offerings was up for the first time last year since the peak
in 1995, and the percentage of those companies that were less than
10 years old was the highest it had ever been, according to Jafco,
Japan's largest venture capital company.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, of course, has always been a nation with many small
businesses, despite its image as the land of corporate leviathans
manned by regiments of salarymen. And what gets forgotten is that
some of those leviathans _ Honda, Kyocera and Sony, to name a few _
were spawned by visionary entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic structure that evolved after World War II, with
its heavy emphasis on government-directed bank lending, its
punitive tax structure, its ban on stock options and its lack of
pension portability, stifled the entrepreneurial spirit here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would call the upside didn't exist under that
system,'' said Karl K. Fooks, managing director in charge of
deploying venture capital for J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, where it has
recently announced investments in three start-ups. ``The banks
forced you to pledge your entire family as collateral, and the tax
man took most of your profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, until the last year or so, when many of those
disincentives started eroding, entrepreneurs tended to be shackled
to the big kaisha, or corporations, which provided them with a
steady stream of orders, helped them establish a line of credit
with a bank and squeezed their profits in hard times. They were,
effectively, the minor outlying satellites of the business clusters
called keiretsu, and their fortunes very much depended on the
kaisha's patronage.
</P>
<P>
   So Japan's best and brightest made the rational choice to join
the big companies, where salaries were small but benefits like
cars, housing allowances and school tuition were generous and
untaxed. The further one climbed up the ladder, the better the
benefits became, making lifetime loyalty far more attractive than
striking out on one's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to say the Japanese are risk averse,'' Fooks said.
``That simply isn't true. There was just no reward for taking
entrepreneurial risk in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is now changing. For one thing, many big companies are
slowly realizing the benefits of competitive procurement practices
and the costs of providing life support to so many small partners.
Corporations are also struggling to pare their work forces, largely
by drastically cutting hiring of new employees. Unemployment hit
another high in March, and a record share of college graduates this
year will be unable to find established jobs, a trend that is
encouraging more and more people to start businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the big companies that still dominate the economy are
adopting compensation programs based on performance and abolishing
remuneration determined by seniority, fast diluting the attractions
of lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the financial markets here is also helping
entrepreneurs, as new stock markets emerge designed to foster young
businesses and a flood of venture capital provides money that once
was parceled out almost exclusively by big banks largely interested
in corporate customers and real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even go to a bank when I started my company because I
was pretty sure about the answer _ no,'' said Moto Kuroi,
co-founder of Neuromagic, a Web design and strategic consulting
firm. ``I started the company with money from my friends and
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, V-Sync and Neuromagic have a few beneficial ties to
big business. Sharp, Sumitomo Trust, Marubeni and other established
Japanese companies have invested in V-Sync. Similarly, Neuromagic
relies on Dentsu, the giant Japanese advertising agency, for some
of its orders.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is if either of these two companies were to lose
those backers, they would scarcely miss a beat. When Internet
Initiatives Japan, which specializes in connecting corporate
customers to the Internet, wanted to raise money here two years
ago, it was stymied. It finally went public last summer _ on the
Nasdaq market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, two new stock exchanges have been set up
specifically to foster fledgling enterprises _ Mothers, which made
its debut late last year, and Nasdaq Japan, which will open this
summer. Meanwhile, the pool of venture capital here is swelling.
Even the government is eager to develop entrepreneurs, earmarking
10.3 billion yen, or about $97 million, for new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry so much about finding money,'' said Kuroi, who
almost sold Neuromagic recently but decided he would rather remain
independent. ``I worry about getting the right people to back us.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge for venture capitalists is that the large
majority of money available to finance new businesses arrived only
recently, so many of the entrepreneurs here have figured out ways
to build their operations without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one year ago, too little money was chasing too few
deals,'' said Mitsumasa Murase, chairman and president of Jafco,
the venture capital company. ``Now, we have too much money chasing
too few deals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true now that barriers to taking young
companies public have been eased, making private capital less
crucial in nursing them. ``Previously, if you invested in early
stage companies, it would take 30 years to cash out and make money
on them,'' Murase said. ``Now, companies are going public at
lightning speed, 1 1/2 or two years after they are founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, V-Sync began making plans to offer shares to the
public on the Mothers exchange. ``We are rather like a telecom
company, so we need money to build a fiber optic infrastructure,''
said Takaya Ibe, V-Sync's president and co-founder. ``That requires
a huge amount of money, and we feel the stock market is the best
place to go for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ibe is even more remarkable than his whiz-kid
partner, Fujii. To start with, after graduating from college, Ibe
went to work for Hoechst, the big German chemical company, rather
than a Japanese kaisha, a far rarer occurrence then than now.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually left for a company specializing in semiconductor
robotics, his second break from the traditional Japanese career
pattern that chains employees to companies for life. From there, he
went to Bandai, where he was part of a team that developed a
variety of popular gadgets using computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   But what most interested Ibe was developing circuitry to create
three-dimensional computer games. At that time, about 15 years ago,
Bandai was reaping the benefits of its simple, two-dimensional
Super Mario games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to the board that if we could introduce 3-D, the
prospect for games would be great,'' he said. ``But they told me,
`This two-dimensional Mario is beautiful and fun. Why should we
create something new? What do we need 3-D for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, he stayed at Bandai a few more years but then
struck out and founded his own company. On one project, he met
Fujii.
</P>
<P>
   The young Fujii was then working for a company that was a
subcontractor to Bandai. ``Even though I invented some smash hit
products,'' he said, ``the profit always went to Bandai. That's why
I decided to start my own company and asked Ibe to be my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibe had not forgotten his dreams, either. ``I kept remembering
the whole 3-D thing with Bandai and how Playstation and Nintendo
had proven I was right,'' he said. ``I did not want to repeat that
mistake and miss out on an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and Fujii pooled their money and went into business in
hopes of exploiting the emerging network technologies already
taking off in the United States. They were lucky when they received
a research grant from Okayama Prefecture. They won a bid to supply
information kiosks in train stations, beating out corporate titans
like NEC and Fujitsu. And the giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
turned to V-Sync when Mitsubishi Electric failed to deliver an
information terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of people like Fujii has been in recognizing that
subterranean Japan is a veritable spaghetti bowl of underutilized
fiber optic cable and finding ways of putting it to use. Indeed,
V-Sync's dreams go far beyond music; any kind of digital
information _ books, movies, software, games _ can be downloaded
through the POD.
</P>
<P>
   That understanding of the power resident in telecommunications
networks is what distinguishes many of the new entrepreneurs from
their predecessors and the big kaisha. They have largely had to
educate themselves, which has given them a self-confidence that is
rare in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroi, the Neuromagic founder, was a philosophy major studying
at the International Christian University in Tokyo _ ``I wanted to
go to Hitotsubashi University,'' he said, ``but I wasn't a good
enough student'' _ when he discovered the potential of networked
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, there was no commercial Internet, everything was
operating at a speed of 2,400 baud, you couldn't send images or
pictures of any kind, only text,'' he said. ``I knew the technology
would change, but my friends said what I was talking about was
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying out a couple of different jobs, Kuroi met several
employees of Apple Computer. ``Those guys didn't think like
Japanese, and being around them helped me to realize I don't need a
protector.''
</P>
<P>
   So he started Neuromagic with a friend who left IBM Japan. They
are still the sole owners of the company, which now has 20
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Neuromagic, a pioneer in Japan's young Internet production
industry, has worked on more than 100 Web sites, including sites
for Sony Music Entertainment and Citibank Japan. It helped Gap plan
its new store in Tokyo's trendy Harajuku neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuroi is not sanguine. Web site design companies are
springing up all over, and he is well aware that his U.S.
counterparts are often operating outfits with 25 times the staff
that Neuromagic has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more competitive, offer customers more services
and ideas,'' Kuroi said. ``That will take money.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents initially objected to Neuromagic, asking Kuroi to
explain why they had wasted money sending him to college. ``My
father wanted me to work for Hitachi, Toshiba, Matsushita,'' Kuroi
said. ``That was his direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kuroi, who is 37, has now convinced his father that he made
the right choice. ``We are different from our parents'
generation,'' he said. ``We have different DNA.''

LINGERING EFFECTS WILL DOG BOY THROUGH LIFE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He may suffer some temporary regression, perhaps by wetting his
bed or reverting to occasional baby talk. He likely will experience
nightmares or flashbacks, perhaps only for a while but maybe for
the rest of his life. And he almost certainly will have to cope
with various manifestations of clinical depression, with an
inability to attach to other people generally, and with a lingering
distrust, in particular, of close relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Mental-health and child-development specialists expressed deep
concern Saturday about just how wide a range of emotional and
developmental problems Elian Gonzalez will face for many years to
come as a result of the unrelenting series of traumas he has
endured since leaving Cuba on a rickety craft with his mother and a
group of other refugees last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of psychic injury to him is obviously very high,''
said Peter Metz, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Mass. ``He
will need help, a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts said the image flashed across television screens
just hours after the boy's seizure _ that of Elian, back with his
father, smiling and seemingly doing fine _ probably partly
reflected his happiness at being back with a man he loves and with
whom he has a solid bond. But they added that a major reason Elian
appeared normal also was that he was in shock and/or denial,
dealing with horrific and incomprehensible events in a way that a
6-year-old is capable of doing: by behaving as if they didn't
happen because he doesn't know how to interpret them or how to
react.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call him clinically numb,'' said Michael Brody, a
well-known specialist in childhood development and an officer of
the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, however, most likely beginning in adolescence,
the memories invariably come trickling or flooding back. And then,
mental-health professionals agreed, even children who haven't
exhibited many adverse effects and have responded well to therapy
can begin manifesting symptoms ranging from relatively narrow
issues like sleeplessness or learning disorders, to far broader
problems such as depression, negative self-image, and even a
greater proclivity for violent behavior because of pent-up anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid also is going to have to live with far more trauma
than most because he hasn't been given sufficient opportunity by
his caretakers to grieve,'' said Brody. He and others interviewed
Saturday explained that by concentrating on diversions such as
going to amusement parks and giving Elian new toys, the boy's Miami
relatives delayed the grieving process and thereby increased the
odds that he will suffer problems later in life because he hasn't
begun to resolve them at the time that they occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a parent, especially a mother and especially by a
young child, is widely viewed as a potentially personality-altering
trauma in and of itself _ without the overlay, in Elian's case, of
having watched her die; of having been in a life-threatening
circumstance himself at the time; of living with relatives who
presumably displayed animosity toward and allowed him to engage in
a videotaped confrontation with his surviving parent; of having
been glorified as something akin to an idol by crowds outside his
door; and, finally, of having been aggressively removed from
whatever security he felt by government agents in forbidding
uniforms and bearing large weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrifying,'' Joyce Maguire Pavao, a prominent therapist
and founder of the Center for Family Connections in Cambridge,
Mass., said of the aggressive method Attorney General Janet Reno
authorized to get Elian. While Pavao stressed her belief that he
belonged with his father, she added that the government should have
acted sooner and in a less violent way, perhaps the night the
Gonzalez stayed at a nun's house in Florida 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, everyone interviewed layed most of the
responsibility for the potential psychic damage to Elian _ beyond
that from his mother's death _ mainly on his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't able to put their egos aside and do what's best
for the child,'' said Pavao, who faulted both the relatives and the
government for having treated Elian as a pawn in a legal-political
game rather than as a small boy whose emotional well-being was at
risk. ``This is how we treat children all the time, as property,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Metz made a similar point, asserting that Elian's needs have
barely been addressed by anyone, including the media and public,
during discussions of his fate. ``To the extent that everyone is
focused on the asylum issue,'' he asserted, ``that's not honoring
this child.''
</P>
<P>
   All those interviewed Saturday remarked on how bright and
resilient a child Elian appears to be, both important factors that
will help him cope in the weeks and years to come. Moreover, the
experts agreed that Elian's prospects will be vastly improved if
two things happen: he receives long-term counseling, and all his
feuding relatives put aside their differences to ease the
transition for him and to show he is not to blame for the custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be inevitable that he will have scars, but how
he functions here on in, especially as he becomes an adolescent and
gets older, will depend on how the adults deal with his needs
now,'' said Ann Sullivan, a child-welfare specialist with the Child
Welfare League of America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the experts said, the healing period may not begin in
earnest for a long time because Elian seems likely to remain in the
spotlight during ucoming court fights, could be wrenched
emotionally again if his Miami relatives win asylum for him in the
United States, and seems certain to be the object of enormous
attention if he returns to Cuba within a few months with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna Hertz, a professor at Wellesley College whose specialty
is family sociology, was among many who said Elian could suffer
even if his various relatives do behave well for his benefit. Among
the reasons they cited were that he already senses or knows he is
at the center of hostility among the people he loves most; he
senses or knows that his various parental figures have been
perceived as unfit to raise him, or ``have fallen from grace'' as
Hertz put it; and he has been elevated to such a high level of
recognition by family members, the Cuban American supporters
outside his door, and the media _ clinically called ``grandiosity''
_ that he cannot help but sustain serious psychic injuries when the
attention inevitably fades, and he plummets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this kid has been catapulted into a position so
high,'' said Hertz, ``that no child his age, or maybe any age,
could hope to handle it.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Outraged that Elian Gonzalez was taken from them,
hundreds of Cuban-American protesters took to a major road here
Saturday, burning tires and throwing rocks as police officers in
riot gear moved in, firing tear gas and making several arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roamed along Flagler Street, a four-lane avenue that
cuts east-west through Little Havana not far from the house where
6-year-old Elian had been staying. The police initially appeared to
pull back, allowing protesters, many of them carrying Cuban flags,
to slow traffic. But by midmorning, officers moved in from several
directions across several blocks of Flagler, pushing protesters
back and firing tear-gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic protests continued throughout the day along the avenue,
leaving harried police officers to rush back and forth in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here, out of here,'' one man shouted as heavily
armed officers ran at 1:15 p.m. to Flagler and 30th Avenue, where
dozens of protesters had set fire to a pile of tires. ``You don't
belong, this is our home.''
</P>
<P>
   Tear-gas canisters were then fired in several directions, with
dozens of stunned protesters _ many, if not most, residents of the
neighborhood _ running for the side streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right to shoot tear gas at people who are in their
homes,'' said Hector Alvarado, 28, holding his shirt over his face.
``We were arguing with the police, asking for liberty for Elian.
Then they came and started firing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another protester, Eduardo Santana, said: ``They came right at
us, shooting tear gas at us. There were children there. The tear
gas hurt. I fell right there. I couldn't breathe, but they said,
`Go, get out,' and pushed me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana, 48, who held a Cuban flag, added: `This isn't right.
This is our country. We're Cubans, but we're U.S. citizens too.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul Mari, 62, who like many here believes that handing Elian
over to his father is akin to handing him over to the Cuban
government, said, ``I never thought they would take him; I thought
Clinton and Reno would respect the laws of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who had been
caring for the boy, a young man burned a small American flag.
Others equated the operation to the government's disastrous raid on
the compound near Waco, Texas, which had been ordered by Attorney
General Janet Reno. Several people held up crosses, one with a baby
doll nailed to the wood, red paint smeared across its body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible that this happened,'' Jesus Jorge, 53,
muttered, shaking his head. ``Clinton and Reno will pay for this in
front of God's justice. This is unpardonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd broke into spontaneous chants, shouting ``criminals''
and ``assassins,'' referring to the government force that swept
into the home where Elian had been staying since he was found
floating off South Florida on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators called for mass protests and hunger strikes, and
by midmorning hundreds of protesters hoisting the Cuban banner had
spilled onto nearby streets. Some overturned garbage cans and
newspaper boxes. By late morning, several protesters had been
arrested for trying to block traffic on the wide thoroughfares
nearby. Motorists, meanwhile, clogged up several routes nearby,
blowing their horns and waving Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   The political leaders of the city, whose careers flourished with
the political and economic strength of the Cuban-American
community, left no adjective unturned in their denunciations of
Reno and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feeling is that what our president of our country
and our attorney general ordered was one of the most shameful acts
I have ever seen,'' said Joe Carollo, the mayor of the city of
Miami. ``It is one of the most disgraceful and shameful acts in the
history of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``People are in total shock to see our government come
in this morning, pointing automatic weapons at women and
children,'' and at ``seeing the picture of little Elian being taken
out screaming and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Miami, residents and tourists were falling into
their routines on this Easter holiday weekend. Cruise ships lined
the harbor and traffic sped along the freeways, windshields
glinting in the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, four local English-language television stations and their
two Spanish-language counterparts showed a very different reality:
videotaped reruns and live shots of demonstrators gathering and
shouting, and in a few instances burning tires. These were
interspersed with videotape of the predawn raid on Lazaro
Gonzalez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all Carollo's fury, he said that his first concern was
``to keep peace in our community.'' He added: ``What I am asking
the people of Miami to do is act with their heads, not their
hearts. To use their heads and fight within the law.'' Any
violence, he added, ``will make Miami the loser, America a bigger
loser, and will only benefit the criminal dictator Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Others expressed relief. Marvin Dunn, the chairman of the
psychology department at Florida University and the author of a
definitive history of the 1980 riots in Liberty City, a
predominantly black Miami neighborhood, said Saturday: ``I'm
thrilled. It is overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the debate over Elian, and the obsessive media
coverage, Dunn said, were ``putting this community through a
protracted and ugly crisis. I admire Janet Reno for taking action.
And I'm very happy for this boy's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he believed the confrontation over the boy was ``the
most divisive event in Miami's history, and a lot of non-Cuban
Hispanics have been on the sidelines.''

WHAT ELSE FROM A COMMUNITY LIKE LITTLE HAVANA? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!''
</P>
<P>
   With a code word, Operation Reunion ended, barely three minutes
after it began. By striking when the crowd of protesters was at its
ebb _ and when, perhaps, the Miami branch of the Gonzalez family
had been lulled into a false sense of security _ US agents brought
the Elian Gonzalez custody soap opera here to a decisive halt.
</P>
<P>
   The predawn raid set off a range of emotions among the
bewildered group outside the family's home Saturday. First came
shock as word of the seizure began to spread. After sunrise, that
was followed by anger and a sense of betrayal among people who had
come to believe their numbers might prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The raid itself was carried out with a minimum of wasted motion.
Witnesses described how they were quickly shoved aside, sprayed
with pepper gas, and overwhelmed by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Usategui, a child psychologist who had been advising the
Miami family, was keeping vigil when the caravan of white minivans
rolled in. She said she saw the family spokesman, Armando
Gutierrez, run from the back of the Gonzalez house with his arms
waving, urging the small crowd to try to block the transfer. Then
she was ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground, and keep her head
down. Soon, she heard the agents signaling to one another that
Elian was in a blanket, and that the van doors were closing. As she
looked up, she was hit with a blast of pepper spray, like many
others at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible, just horrible,'' she said. ``It was so
violent, so brutal. This was so uncalled for, it was just
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the raid, disbelief began to harden into
anger. The first pictures from inside the house began to circulate,
including the ones showing a federal agent with a rifle on Donato
Dalrymple, who was holding Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters began to roll American flags in black bands. The
swelling crowd was peaceful, but increasingly testy. The Miami-Dade
mayor, Alex Penelas, was jeered by some in the crowd for showing up
too neatly dressed, too pulled together _ and too far behind his
political rival, Miami's mayor, Joe Carollo. Many people held one
another and wept. One man carried a large crucifix with a male doll
and a sign in Spanish that said Predsident Clinton had crucified
Elian. Hundreds of people just milled around, wondering what to do
with the huge emotions that had built up over the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   The pepper spray unleashed in the raid was just the beginning of
the police work. As the day wore on, officers used tear gas as
their tool of choice in an effort to disperse crowds and maintain
the very shaky peace in Little Havana. The crowd fanned out along a
widening area, disrupting traffic, burning tires, and generally
causing mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami police were holding their own, but then they've had
more experience with unrest than most departments. There were four
major disturbances here in the 1980s, including a full-scale riot
in 1980 from which the neighborhood where I grew up has never
recovered. It was clear that the police were following a plan that
had been put together well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In its zeal to affix blame, the crowd focused on the unholy
trinity of Reno, Clinton and Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Elian's
father. I think they were looking in the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro, and his high-strung cousin,
Marisleysis, who steadily raised the ante, putting the boy in
harm's way and inviting disorder in the streets. They allowed the
boy to be turned into a tool for their cause, allowing the
6-year-old to grant interviews and releasing that loopy videotape
of Elian declaring his supposed wishes. How was the government to
ignore that?
</P>
<P>
   We are not strangers to nutty behavior of any kind in Miami, but
never has so much anxiety resulted from the sheer recalcitrance of
a single stubborn family. While they were busy Saturday portraying
themselves as victims, the reality is that they overplayed their
hand, that they believed the cliche that possession is nine-tenths
of the law. The accounts of Gutierrez trying to rally supporters
are telling. The crowd was always their ace, and in the end it
wasn't nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   To much of the rest of the fed-up country, the Elian affair
falls somewhere between an annoyance and a side show. But for
Miami, this is disastrous. The city is pulling out of both
bankruptcy and a huge political scandal that resulted in the
removal of the previous mayor. Businesses are leaving town, ethnic
unity is a distant dream, and the city has again been portrayed
nationally as a bizarre banana republic that shares virtually
nothing with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the reunion was necessary and overdue, I can only think of
one good thing that will come out of it. This began as a tale of a
little boy, adrift in more ways than one, searching for his family.
Now that Elian has left Miami, probably for good, perhaps his fate
and future _ instead of his relatives, his supporters, and Cuban
politics _ can take center stage. It's sad to think that such
lengths were necessary to reclaim a childhood. But in this wildly
unhinged community, negotiation and peaceful resolution simply
proved too much to hope for. That's a familiar story for Miami.

VIVID IMAGES AGAIN MAKE MEDIA PART OF THE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN AND MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With explosive pictures flooding the airwaves Saturday morning
after federal agents seized 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, CBS anchor
Dan Rather remarked that the US government ``badly needs'' a
``come-together, reuniting picture'' of Elian and his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, in order to quell tensions in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, such a picture had surfaced: a photo of a
smiling Elian in the arms of his father that quickly entered the TV
networks' rotation of compelling images.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Saturday, media coverage of an ongoing news story
became a factor in the drama, and once again, pictures held a
unique power to sway public opinion. The networks, especially the
all-news cable channels, repeatedly aired video footage of a crying
Elian being carried by a federal agent from the home of his Miami
relatives into a waiting van; Fox News Channel ran it in
slow-motion, heightening its emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most potent image of the day was an Associated
Press photo of a federal agent pointing a gun in the direction of
the frightened child and Donato Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who
resued Elian last November. By early Saturday afternoon, that photo
appeared on a sign held by a protester, who made sure to stand
behind network correspondents during their standups, creating a
media-mirror effect. Even Gregory Craig, the attorney for Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, conceded that images of Elian's removal may have
``seemed shocking and scary,'' which may explain why Craig moved
quickly to supply the smiling-reunion picture of Elian and his
father to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a home video of Elian saying he did not want to
return to Cuba became a weapon in the battle for public opinion. To
the end, both sides in the drama sought to use the media,
especially television, to bolster their case.
</P>
<P>
   After Elian had been removed, his cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez,
emotionally reenacted the scene for the benefit of TV cameras while
giving a tour of her home to show the damage inflicted by
government agents. On the other side, Craig sent a letter to the
news presidents of the TV networks Friday night, asking that they
refrain from ``exploitative television coverage of the child,''
especially of him being removed from the home.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the networks mobilized quickly to cover the story
Saturday, although ABC's live coverage lagged nearly 45 minutes
behind CBS, CNN, NBC, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and NECN.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, who was the first of the anchors from the three
broadcast networks to appear Saturday, asked a question that may
reverberate in the days ahead as the media mull their role in the
five-months-long Elian saga: ``Have we overcovered this story?''

   ELIAN-PSYCHOLOGY _ The tactics used to seize Elian Gonzalez from
his Miami relatives were lightning quick and successful, but the
effect on the boy who has lived through five months of misfortune

science of using electronic sensors and computer programs to detect

Escambia County elementary schools, they're doing better. They'll
finish this school year. But what about next? If the ruling of a
circuit court judge stands, Smith's kids will be back in the public
school system they fled. ``They knew there was a chance that they
might stop the program from the beginning,'' Smith said. ``I'm just

   critical opportunity for candidates to show their stuff to the
nation as this historic campaign heats up and heads for Mexico's
July 2 election day. A crowded field of six candidates will be
included in this first debate. But the contest has clearly narrowed
to two: Francisco Labastida, who represents the same party that has
controlled Mexico's presidency for 71 years, and Vicente Fox, a
charismatic opposition candidate. Should Fox win, our neighbor next
door would have the first president from a different party in seven
decades. The rivalry is razor sharp. Fox, running strong against
corruption, called Labastida a ``leech'' recently. Labastida
labeled Fox a ``frenetic crazy man.'' (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   CUBA-HUSTLERS _ HAVANA _ In Cuba, they call them ``jiniteros,''

and ask what you need; others ask the time or where you are from to
try to lure you into conversation; still others whisper, ``Amigo,
you want restaurant? Hotel? Cigars? Girl?'' While not as
overwhelming as in other tourist destinations such as Jamaica, the
hustlers are a sign of how desperately people want American
dollars. We profile Nereyda Li, a particularly discreet, subtle
hustler; a grandmother working in a market who befriended an
American reporter and took him on a week-long roller-coaster tour
of Havana, her life, her dreams and hopes. (MWilliams, Cox News

   CoxNet FOCUS 0422: PAST IN PERIL _ As the oldest archaeological
site in the world, Pompeii provides an unsettling glimpse of what
can happen when the past is unearthed with no plan for the future.
Since the ruins were discovered in 1748, more than two-thirds of
the 163 acres within the city's walls have been unearthed. Block by
block, Italian, French, British and American archaeologists have
peeled away the 30-foot-deep layer of volcanic ash. Today, more
than 1,500 of Pompeii's buildings and 215,000 square feet of
frescoed walls, resplendent with everything from a Venus in a
seashell to portraits of the city's rich and famous, stand exposed.
To the sun. To the rain. To fast-growing vines. And to 2 million
visitors whose fascination with the ruins is hastening their
destruction. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

electronic commerce will never reach its full potential unless
people can complete a contract by using a computer to ``sign'' and
send legally binding documents. To speed the development of
e-commerce, Congress is now in the final stages of writing
legislation that would give consumers and business owners the
ability to close deals using ``digital signatures.'' (Geewax, Cox

fact. Not only is Once and Again, whose season finale airs Monday,
far from sappy, it remains TV's best new drama. Calm down, West

much better they would not have been published.'' Chandler wrote

</P>
<P>
   --A lead essay by Globe Editorial Page Editor H.D.S. Greenway,
and five additional ``postcards'' from Vietnam and Cambodia which

Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.

   --An exclusive essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and
author David Halberstam, who writes about why Vietnam has been so
stubborn in lingering in the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive commentary by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Neil
Sheehan, who argues that Vietnam actually helped America because it
made us less willing to become the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   --An overview by Globe Deputy Managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr.
describing Vietnam today.
</P>
<P>
   --Four retrospective essays by Americans who had a range of
experiences -- from fighting in the war to going to Canada to evade
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the war's impact on the arts, which led to its
own genre of books, movies and music that changed the American
culture.
</P>

   --A feature on Vietnam from the perspective of 20-somethings,
more of whom are taking an increasing number of college courses on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the feelings of Vietnam veterans today.
</P>
<P>
   -- An editorial, and three op-ed pieces by Vietnamese with
different perspectives: a Hanoi poet, a former North Vietnamese
Army officer who accepted the surrender of Saigon but has since
defected, and a Vietnamese-American who argues it is time for those
in the exile community here to bury the hatchet with Hanoi.

REAL ESTATE: LAWSUIT TO STOP MALL BRINGS DOWN ZONING PROCESS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Michael McKinney and 16 of his neighbors set
out to stop a shopping center, but they ended up freezing
development in one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit to keep a new strip mall anchored by a Target
store out of their neighborhood brought down the city's entire
zoning process, which a judge called illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision handed down on Monday, Judge Ben Tennille of
Superior Court ruled that the so-called fast-track process, which
decides about 80 percent of proposed construction in this booming
city of 500,000, is too fast, too informal and violates state law.
He halted 50 projects awaiting approval, and ordered the city to
design a more formal method for deciding zoning requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened a can of worms,'' McKinney said on Friday of the
lawsuit he helped organize last year, after a congested residential
area was rezoned to allow the strip mall. ``We knew we were getting
into an area that was a broader issue, and we thought it would be a
good thing for Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   City and business leaders, who have cheered on a construction
boom that has raised property values and helped revive a
once-moribund downtown, are not so sure. They fear that a more
trial-like review process, possibly requiring lawyers, traffic
studies and expert testimony, will drive developers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want the world out there to think Charlotte is not a
good place to bring their investments,'' said Walter G. Fields III,
who helped create the city's one-step approval process in the 20
years he worked on the planning committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, developers and residents could lobby City
Council members up to the time they voted on a project. The public
hearing before each vote typically lasted 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Tennille gave the city 90 days to design a
two-step system, where a decision over property zoning is followed
by a quasi-judicial hearing on proposed construction.

WHITE HOUSE RELIEVED RENO ACTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, Janet Reno's patience ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Whipsawed by the Miami relatives who, she said, ``kept moving
the goal post,'' by Juan Miguel Gonzalez, whose anger at being kept
from his son grew by the day, and by a White House anxious to see
the endgame, the attorney general gave a predawn order to send
eight armed agents into a Little Havana home to seize six-year-old
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did, until the final moments, try to reach a voluntary
solution,'' Reno told reporters Saturday morning. ``I negotiated
through the night. At times I was very encouraged, and then at
other times it seemed to slip away. And finally, time ran out.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's decision to use force has put her on the
hot seat, a place she's been before. It was seven years ago last
week that, after protracted negotiations, she ordered the FBI's
botched assault on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco that left
some 80 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did his best to distance himself from Reno
after Waco. Saturday he quickly went before the cameras to praise
the attorney general for her ``restraint, patience, and
compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She made the decision, she managed this, but I fully support
what she did,'' Clinton said. ``I think she did the right thing,
and I'm very pleased with the way she handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president certainly didn't want another Waco. To that end,
senior White House officials have been deeply involved in the Elian
case, to the point of micromanagement. It wasn't that they didn't
trust the attorney general, they say, though she and the president
have never been close. But they were concerned that Reno's unusual
sensitivity to what happened in Miami, her hometown, might paralyze
her from taking action to resolve a situation with wide political
implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been monitoring it from the day the child arrived in
the United States, and our regular communications with the Justice
Department have intensified over the last few weeks,'' said a
senior White House official who has been close to the case. ``We
knew the situation was potentially very explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   The official denied the White House pressured Reno to move
against the Miami relatives. But, the official said, top aides to
the president did urge her to ``bring more definition'' to the
option of using force after last week's US Circuit Court ruling
that will keep Elian in the United States until an asylum hearing
in May but did not transfer his custody to Juan Miguel, his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pointed out to the attorney general that with each passing
day, it became more and more difficult for the Justice Department
to maintain its credibility,'' the White House official said. ``We
were very careful to not say, `do X or Y,' because if something
went wrong, a lot of fingerpointing would be going on. But we did
say they should be ready with a plan, because a lack of action was
going to reflect badly on the department.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House Saturday provided an almost hour-by-hour
chronology, beginning late Friday afternoon, to show how the
president and his top aides monitored the Justice Department. The
president and Reno had thrashed out the administration's options
during a plane trip home from Oklahoma City Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, the
president talked to Reno twice Friday, once in the late afternoon
and again at 8:30 p.m. In that conversation, he said, Reno briefed
the president on the status of 11th-hour talks between a group of
mediators Reno had drawn from the Miami community, including a
Roman Catholic priest and officials of the University of Miami, and
the Gonzalez family and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   After that, John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, stayed
in hourly contact with the Justice Department, Lockhart said. At
2:15 a.m., Podesta informed the president the negotiations in Miami
still were going on and that they would continue, perhaps for days,
if they showed progress. If the talks reached an impasse, however,
Reno had decided to move in with force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president agreed with that approach,'' Lockhart said. At 5
a.m., Podesta called the president again to inform him that the
mediation had ended, and Operation Reunion, as the Justice
Department named it, was going forward. At 5:30 a.m., Lockhart
said, Podesta told the president the boy was out of the Miami house
and on his way to Washington. Thirty minutes later, Reno phoned the
president who, according to Lockhart, ``thanked her for her
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the harrowing photographs of the agents forced entry
into the house to seize the frightened child, Lockhart said the
president would have preferred a voluntary transfer of the boy,
which is what Reno had also long sought. ``That did not happen,''
Lockhart said. ``We were left with no other alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials thought there might be a negotiated
breakthrough Friday night. Reno gave mediators meeting at the home
of Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, a 3 a.m. deadline to
hammer out a plan that would have phased in the boy's transfer to
his father. As officials explained it, Elian would have stayed with
his cousin, Marisleysis, at a neutral site, with his father granted
expanding visitation rights. At an undetermined date, the father
would take full custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Miguel said he was afraid to go to Florida, and the
Miami relatives refused the Justice Department order that the
neutral site be in the Washington area. The biggest sticking
points, however, were that Marisleysis would not agree to transfer
the boy to his father, and she and Lazaro insisted Elian should
have a say in the matter, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trying to nail Jello to the wall,'' the
spokeswoman said. ``The family refused to entertain any discussion
of whether they would transfer custody. Juan Miguel said, `This is
ridiculous. It's my kid.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, Reno's top deputy at Justice, Saturday described
the negotiations as ``extremely frustrating,'' and said nobody was
more disappointed by the failure than Reno herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we thought we had achieved what (the Miami
relatives) wanted, it wasn't enough,'' said Reno, who could not
move the relatives when she met with them im Miami April 12. ``It
was a very frustrating experience. It was just one step after
another in which they moved the goal post.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sitting behind her desk, surrounded by her aides, she
gave the order for an operation that, like Waco, is bound to haunt
her and mobilize her many critics in Miami and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, the outcome of the order it sought could
have been much worse. ``We were all very glad it happened without a
hitch,'' a senior official said.

RAPTORS COACH FILES DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST CAMBY
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ On the eve of the New York Knicks' first-round
playoff game with the Toronto Raptors, Marcus Camby Saturday had to
deal with questions concerning a lawsuit filed against him by the
Raptors' coach, Butch Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was served papers late Friday night following a Knicks
practice. In the lawsuit, Carter claims he ``has been damaged and
suffered great pain and mental anguish, and has been held up to
ridicule and contempt by his friends, acquaintances and the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's suit was filed Friday afternoon in New York State
Supreme Court in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Camby, traded to the Knicks from Toronto before the 1998-99
season, said this week that Carter had promised him that the
Raptors would build their team around him. The trade quickly
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a liar,'' Camby said Wednesday before the Knicks played
their final regular-season game at Boston. ``I don't really like
him. No one likes him and no one wants to play for him. That's the
kind of guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust him. I think a lot of guys don't trust him. He's
just been ratting out people and doing things his way. From what I
hear, a lot of people are mad at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Camby declined to comment specifically on the lawsuit,
but when asked if he would be even more motivated to play against
his former team, he said: ``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, after several no comments following practice Saturday
regarding his lawsuit, responded to a question about the difficulty
of winning such a suit, because the threshold is higher for people
in the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm seeking is the truth,'' he said. ``There's an extreme
difference between sworn testimony. ...'' He paused a moment before
being prodded to finish the sentence. ``There's a difference
between sworn testimony and what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he decided right away to sue or if it took him several
days to make that decision, he said, ``It's the only way I can
answer professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Knicks found the timing of Carter's lawsuit curious,
considering the two teams will meet in Game 1 on Sunday at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never happened before, but everyone has to do his own
thing,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said Saturday after the team's
practice. ``We have to focus on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was asked about the timing of Carter's lawsuit. ``I'm
sure there is something psychological there,'' Van Gundy said,
``like trying to do something psychological, but they don't need
it. We're the ones who have to adjust to them. I don't care about
it, and I've talked to Marcus, he doesn't care about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klempner, a lawyer with the National Basketball Players
Association, seemed incredulous over the lawsuit. ``Until we see it
in black and white, we can't comment on it because it's such an
incredible and unbelievable claim,'' he said. ``Any such claim
would be insufficient legally on too many grounds to even begin
counting. I don't think they want to have a precedent with players
starting to sue coaches for coaches' comments about players.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby's lawyer, Patrick Noonan, said: ``This is an absolutely
frivolous lawsuit. It appears that Carter would be better off
spending his time getting his team ready for the playoffs than
pursuing these legal shenanigans.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Glen Grunwald of the Raptors said he could not
comment on a pending legal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the team is giving Carter its support, Grunwald
said, ``It's an individual matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter on Thursday had questioned the timing of Camby's
criticism _ coming several days before the Raptors would play in
the first playoff series in the franchise's history _ and he
reiterated that complaint Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think there's a lot to be said about timing,'' Carter
said. ``My hat's off to them about the timing of what they did. You
know, we've played against them six or seven or eight times since
the trade and there never was a problem. It was a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Grunwald had said that the possibility of
trading Camby came up a day or two before the draft and Carter
``had no idea anything like that was brewing, so I don't think
that's a fair criticism to say he lied to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Grunwald said: ``Marcus is upset at us and I understand
that. I just think his criticism should be based on a little more
of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Raptors players left the gym briskly Saturday, and only a few
addressed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter, Toronto's top scorer, said: ``I don't care about
that. That's between Butch and Marcus. It's Butch's problem. He can
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley, who was traded to Toronto from the Knicks for
Camby, said: ``I haven't got anything to do with that. We'll see
how it goes.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Onetime political lightning rod Ali has transcended divides to
remain a worldwide icon
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. _ Muhammad Ali stutter-steps into the Senate
chambers at the state Capitol to sustained, heartfelt applause. He
sits, trembly and somnolent, as his wife Lonnie implores the
lawmakers to cut loose some serious tax money for a proposed Ali
Center up the road in Louisville, their least-loved city. They toss
out a few softball questions, then wish the couple well without a
hint of reluctance to help bankroll the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Alis get their $10 million, along with a Senate resolution
lauding him for his ``lifetime role of goodwill ambassador of the
Bluegrass State to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. Thirty-four years ago, in this very room, another
resolution was passed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas Cassius M. Clay, a Kentuckian and the heavyweight
boxing champion of the world, has recently evidenced his
determination to avoid service in the Armed Forces of the United
States of America; and
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas, the notion that a young man of such athletic prowess
and verbose proclivity cannot serve his country is repugnant to all
true Kentuckians; and ``Whereas, this sudden aversion to fighting
on the part of Cassius M. Clay brings discredit to all loyal
Kentuckians and to the names of the thousands of them who gave
their lives for this country during his lifetime ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, therefore, be it resolved ... that Cassius M. Clay ... is
hereby urged to forthwith abandon his reprehensible efforts to
avoid duty to the country which afforded him the opportunity to
achieve eminence of the highest sort and to set a better example
for the other young men of this great nation by immediately
entering service.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, mainstream America pigeonholed Ali (nee Clay,
his ``slave name'') as an uppity, vain, trash-talkin', race-baitin'
conscientious objector hooked up with a way-out religion. Many
wished he would go away _ to jail, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to today, then cue up a true fairy tale. The
belittled has become the beloved.
</P>
<P>
   In public, where Ali, 58, prefers to live, he is a flesh magnet,
drawing all shapes, sizes, ages and colors, most of whom melt in
his presence. Professional photographers hand their cameras to
colleagues and beseech them to snap a picture with Ali. Dignitaries
who sign autographs for others ask for his. If there is a more
accessible icon, let him or her step forward and outdo Ali hugging,
kissing, playfully punching, performing simple magic tricks,
flirting and endearing for life.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he was shunned; now, we can't get enough of him. Ali's
farmhouse in Berrien Hills, Mich., needs a new wing to contain his
latest cache of awards, athletic and humanitarian, that were timed
to the 2000 changeover. One made-for-TV bio-pic has aired, a second
is in production, and Hollywood is preparing its version for the
big screen. There is a roving theater play. On the drawing board is
an $80 million Ali Center, a hybrid museum/learning facility
planned for his birth city.
</P>
<P>
   Without an amazing confluence of circumstances, Ali might be
regarded as just another punch-drunk ex-boxer, trying to make it to
the next day. His movements are staccato, his speech slurred and
barely audible, his stamina drained.
</P>
<P>
   The thief who ran off with his gift of gab and the remarkably
synchronized reflexes and strength is not named Spinks or Liston
but Parkinson. The rigid muscles and rhythmic tremor is better
explained by his Parkinson's syndrome than the cranium-crushing
blows he absorbed from padded fists.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through a prism, Ali is viewed with a blend of admiration
and pity. Unashamed of his physical limitations, he goes about his
business. The former human run-on sentence converses chiefly now
with his eyes and hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has adapted extremely well to Parkinson's,'' says his
physician, Dr. Mahlon DeLong, chairman of the department of
neurology at Emory. ``He doesn't let it bring him down. He
considers it a nuisance, more troubling to others than it is to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Thomas Hauser, his biographer and admirer, ``If he
was able to speak his mind, a lot of people might not like (some
of) what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ali does say is treat others with tolerance and
forgiveness. The one-time champ of the most barbaric of sports
wants us to turn the other cheek. To put a little love in our
hearts.

   BOSTON _ On Sunday, April 30, the 25th anniversary of the fall
of Saigon, The Boston Globe will publish a 20-page special Vietnam
retrospective. Included in the package, to move in advance on
Thursday, April 27, with photos, a map and graphics, are:
</P>
<P>

Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and
author David Halberstam, who writes about why Vietnam has been so
stubborn in lingering in the American psyche.

Sheehan, who argues that Vietnam actually helped America because it
made us less willing to become the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   --An overview by Globe Deputy Managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr.
describing Vietnam today.
</P>
<P>
   --Four retrospective essays by Americans who had a range of
experiences -- from fighting in the war to going to Canada to evade
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the war's impact on the arts, which led to its
own genre of books, movies and music that changed the American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on Vietnam from the perspective of 20-somethings,
more of whom are taking an increasing number of college courses on
the subject.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- An editorial, and three op-ed pieces by Vietnamese with
different perspectives: a Hanoi poet, a former North Vietnamese
Army officer who accepted the surrender of Saigon but has since
defected, and a Vietnamese-American who argues it is time for those
in the exile community here to bury the hatchet with Hanoi.

 &HT;    Proposed Ali museum to promote ideals
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ So, William Qualles, what do you know about
Muhammad Ali?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad and threw his belt into the river,'' William, 8,
said. ``(Because of) the color of his skin, he couldn't get served
at a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   A school friend sitting nearby wondered aloud, ``Didn't he do
some rapping?''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the proposed Ali Center in Louisville might
clear up some myths about his life. A larger goal is to spread the
word about believing in yourself and respecting others, tenets that
Ali has practiced and preached.
</P>
<P>
   The Center would have the typical elements of a sports museum,
from videos to virtual-reality games. But its supporters envision
visitors taking away more than a souvenir photograph or even a wave
from Ali in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's urban males _ especially young black males _ do not
put much hope in tomorrow,'' his wife, Lonnie Ali, says in
promotional materials. ``This Center will give us a chance to
reignite those fires of hope and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipe would include ingredients from Graceland to
presidential libraries, from the Carter Center to the Martin Luther
King Jr. Center, all of which project director Barry Alberts tapped
into for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In one room, Alberts speculated, leaders of rival African tribes
could sit across a table to settle their differences. In the next
room, youngsters could hear how Ali sacrificed 3 1/2 years of his
fight career to resist military induction and rail against war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of programs out there (for kids) about
tolerance,'' Alberts said. ``They're all good. And nobody gives a
darn about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters relate to money and the trappings of wealth,
he said. The center would convey how Ali forfeited millions of
dollars in earnings by declaring himself a conscientious objector,
thus freezing himself out of boxing's lucrative purses.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative target date for the center's opening is late 2002.
The price tag is $80 million, which includes a $20 million
endowment. Nearly $10 million has been donated by private sources,
while the state Legislature has kicked in another $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ali is active in the planning, from making sure no alcohol is
served to reminding designers to meet the needs of kids foremost.
</P>
<P>
   Alberts conceded amazement that kids are acutely aware of an
athlete two decades into retirement _ even if one maintains that
the teetotaling Ali once bellied up to a bar.
</P>
<P>
   As for being a rapper? Well, you could make the case that he is
the pop of hip-hop.

   No one likes to see armed men break down the door and snatch a
traumatized boy, but make no mistake about it: Justice and right
were served in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Little
Havana section of Miami. ``The law has been upheld, and that was

<P>
   If humanity and the rule of law were to be preservered, the
federal government had no other choice. Attorney General Janet
Reno, herself from Miami, had exhausted every last avenue of
compromise _ even into early Saturday. But it had become
increasingly clear that Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami had
absolutely no intention of allowing the boy to return to his
father, even though they had won a court decision that Elian would
not be returned to Cuba without an asylum hearing. The relatives'
negotiating tactic was just to stall and stall again _ and all the
while Elian was in effect held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton got it right Thursday when he said there was
``no conceivable argument'' against reuniting the boy with his
father, but yet the Miami relatives refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The armed operation in Miami was no Waco, the doomed FBI raid in
Texas that so damaged Reno's reputation. The door to the house
where Elian was being held was broken down only after Elian's
relatives refused to open it. Only eight officers were inside the
house for a mere three minutes. Nobody was hurt. A potentially very
dangerous situation was defused.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian Gonzalez affair needed to be resolved, and resolved
quickly. It could not be allowed to drag on and on until the boy
was hopelessly and irrevocably alienated from his father, and all
the while the law defied. The Miami authorities, to their shame,
had threatened not to cooperate with the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was traumatic for Elian, but the blame lies squarely
with the Miami relatives who were willing to let politics separate
a father from his son. As Reno said, this is ``a child who needs to
be cherished . . . to be with his father. And that is what this
case is all about.''

WHAT ELSE FROM A COMMUNITY LIKE LITTLE HAVANA?

<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!''
</P>
<P>
   With a code word, Operation Reunion ended, barely three minutes
after it began. By striking when the crowd of protesters was at its
ebb _ and when, perhaps, the Miami branch of the Gonzalez family
had been lulled into a false sense of security _ US agents brought
the Elian Gonzalez custody soap opera here to a decisive halt.
</P>
<P>
   The predawn raid set off a range of emotions among the
bewildered group outside the family's home Saturday. First came
shock as word of the seizure began to spread. After sunrise, that
was followed by anger and a sense of betrayal among people who had
come to believe their numbers might prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The raid itself was carried out with a minimum of wasted motion.
Witnesses described how they were quickly shoved aside, sprayed
with pepper gas, and overwhelmed by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Usategui, a child psychologist who had been advising the
Miami family, was keeping vigil when the caravan of white minivans
rolled in. She said she saw the family spokesman, Armando
Gutierrez, run from the back of the Gonzalez house with his arms
waving, urging the small crowd to try to block the transfer. Then
she was ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground, and keep her head
down. Soon, she heard the agents signaling to one another that
Elian was in a blanket, and that the van doors were closing. As she
looked up, she was hit with a blast of pepper spray, like many
others at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible, just horrible,'' she said. ``It was so
violent, so brutal. This was so uncalled for, it was just
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the raid, disbelief began to harden into
anger. The first pictures from inside the house began to circulate,
including the ones showing a federal agent with a rifle on Donato
Dalrymple, who was holding Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters began to roll American flags in black bands. The
swelling crowd was peaceful, but increasingly testy. The Miami-Dade
mayor, Alex Penelas, was jeered by some in the crowd for showing up
too neatly dressed, too pulled together _ and too far behind his
political rival, Miami's mayor, Joe Carollo. Many people held one
another and wept. One man carried a large crucifix with a male doll
and a sign in Spanish that said Predsident Clinton had crucified
Elian. Hundreds of people just milled around, wondering what to do
with the huge emotions that had built up over the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   The pepper spray unleashed in the raid was just the beginning of
the police work. As the day wore on, officers used tear gas as
their tool of choice in an effort to disperse crowds and maintain
the very shaky peace in Little Havana. The crowd fanned out along a
widening area, disrupting traffic, burning tires, and generally
causing mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami police were holding their own, but then they've had
more experience with unrest than most departments. There were four
major disturbances here in the 1980s, including a full-scale riot
in 1980 from which the neighborhood where I grew up has never
recovered. It was clear that the police were following a plan that
had been put together well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In its zeal to affix blame, the crowd focused on the unholy
trinity of Reno, Clinton and Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Elian's
father. I think they were looking in the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro, and his high-strung cousin,
Marisleysis, who steadily raised the ante, putting the boy in
harm's way and inviting disorder in the streets. They allowed the
boy to be turned into a tool for their cause, allowing the
6-year-old to grant interviews and releasing that loopy videotape
of Elian declaring his supposed wishes. How was the government to
ignore that?
</P>
<P>
   We are not strangers to nutty behavior of any kind in Miami, but
never has so much anxiety resulted from the sheer recalcitrance of
a single stubborn family. While they were busy Saturday portraying
themselves as victims, the reality is that they overplayed their
hand, that they believed the cliche that possession is nine-tenths
of the law. The accounts of Gutierrez trying to rally supporters
are telling. The crowd was always their ace, and in the end it
wasn't nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   To much of the rest of the fed-up country, the Elian affair
falls somewhere between an annoyance and a side show. But for
Miami, this is disastrous. The city is pulling out of both
bankruptcy and a huge political scandal that resulted in the
removal of the previous mayor. Businesses are leaving town, ethnic
unity is a distant dream, and the city has again been portrayed
nationally as a bizarre banana republic that shares virtually
nothing with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the reunion was necessary and overdue, I can only think of
one good thing that will come out of it. This began as a tale of a
little boy, adrift in more ways than one, searching for his family.
Now that Elian has left Miami, probably for good, perhaps his fate
and future _ instead of his relatives, his supporters, and Cuban
politics _ can take center stage. It's sad to think that such
lengths were necessary to reclaim a childhood. But in this wildly
unhinged community, negotiation and peaceful resolution simply
proved too much to hope for. That's a familiar story for Miami.

 &HT;    Olympic caldron ceremony lit hearts
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The venues were built. The participating nations were
signed up. The tickets were sold. Billy Payne imagined himself a
marathoner in the late stages of a race, most of the legwork behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ueberroth disabused him of that notion. ``You haven't made
the hardest decision yet,'' the maestro of the 1984 Summer Games in
Los Angeles advised his Olympic descendent in Atlanta. ``Who is
going to light the flame in the Opening Ceremonies?''
</P>
<P>
   Nominations were pouring into Payne's office. Among them was an
intriguing pitch from NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol. He
advocated Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Ali had an Olympic connection _ a boxing gold medal from 1960 _
and a face as familiar as any living person's. ``But,'' Payne said
recently, ``I was a little skittish at first on whether the
conscientious objection could diminish or erode the universal
acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a man who declined to serve in the military. And here
was an Olympics in a region of the country that is conservative in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
   To ease any concern, Ebersol plied Payne with boxes of
videotapes documenting Ali's good works. ``To say I was totally
impressed would be an understatement,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   About six months before Olympic liftoff, Ali was overwhelmingly
endorsed by Payne's inner circle. So, another imposing task arose:
keeping the identity of the last torchbearer a secret. ``The
surprise would be part of the magic,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   He even fibbed to Howard Bingham, the champ's aide-de-camp,
saying that a substitute was lined up if Ali spilled the beans and
was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   A 2 a.m. dress rehearsal two weeks before the ceremony produced
a new set of headaches. Ali strained mightily to hold the torch
steady, raising doubts whether he could conquer the trembling and
ignite the caldron. Then Payne spied a German TV reporter in the
vicinity and feared that he would blare details of the practice run
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Payne awakened the next day with his secret intact, and he took
Pentagon-like measures the rest of the way. When the Alis flew into
town for the Games, they entered a limousine with blacked-out
windows and were unloaded at a high-rise apartment building. Ali
emerged from the car covered by a blanket and rode a freight
elevator to his room. Janet Evans, the penultimate torch escort,
learned whom she would hand off to only moments before she began
her jog. The torch was filled with extra fuel to guard against the
flame burning out before Ali could complete the task. Evans
received special instructions in case Ali dropped it. She was to
reach down, pick it up and place Ali's hand on it alongside hers.
They then would light in tandem the wire that ran up to the
caldron.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Ali was able to go solo but a seeming eternity
passed before his shaking limbs allowed him to put the flame to the
fuse. ``He has the heart of a champion,'' Payne said. ``I knew he
would perform when the time came.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years later, the memory burns bright for much of the
two-thirds of the world's population that watched _ outshining
other scrapbook moments of the Games, from Michael Johnson to
women's soccer and even the park bombing. People have told Payne
that the ceremony was the emotional highlight of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't bad for the Alis, either. ``We had the best time,''
Lonnie Ali said. ``What an honor.''

WINDSTORM DAMAGE SLOWS BOSTON AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airplanes arriving at Logan Airport in Boston will
face delays for the next several days, and possibly longer, because
of a windstorm that knocked down the airport's main radar tower
early Saturday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The tower, located on the airfield, was sheared off its base at
about 4:15 Saturday morning, said Frasier Jones, a spokesman for
the FAA. ``It took a pretty major hit,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours the agency had found replacement parts at its
supply depot in Oklahoma City, he said, but the parts were too big
to fly on a conventional airplane.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, the agency was looking for a military
cargo plane or a truck to transport the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile controllers in the tower at Logan and at the Terminal
Radar Approach Control, which handles planes as they approach or
leave the airport, were using radar data from the Boston Air Route
Traffic Control Center, in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   But that radar is farther away and provides less precise
information. As a result, controllers must keep planes flying at
the same altitude separated by five miles. Normally, such planes
can be safely separated by two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the larger separations, Logan was accepting only 16
planes an hour Saturday, compared with the normal 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a safety issue,'' said Jones, because the spacing of
airplanes had been adjusted to the capabilities of remaining
equipment. But installing and testing the new equipment would take
several days, he said.

   No one likes to see armed men break down the door and snatch a
traumatized boy, but make no mistake about it: Justice and right
were served in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Little
Havana section of Miami. ``The law has been upheld, and that was
the right thing to do,'' said President Clinton after the event.
</P>
<P>
   If humanity and the rule of law were to be preservered, the

ALEXANDER H. COHEN, THEATRICAL PRODUCER, DIES AT 79

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alexander H. Cohen, one of the last old-time
independent theatrical producers, who produced 101 shows on
Broadway and in London's West End and originated the national Tony
awards telecast in 1967, died Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was respiratory failure, said his son Gerry Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's most recent production was Noel Coward's ``Waiting in
the Wings,'' starring Lauren Bacall and Rosemary Harris. Now
playing at the Walter Kerr Theater, it opened on Dec. 16, 1999, the
centenary of Coward's birth. It was the final Broadway production
for a man whose career began 59 years earlier with the play ``Angel
Street,'' starring Vincent Price, a hit that later became the film
``Gaslight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was not always so lucky _ in the theater, at least. He
financed his love of the stage with the money he had earned as a
successful television producer, almost always working with his
wife, the writer and actress Hildy Parks. The couple, who were
married 44 years, produced the first 20 years of the Tony awards
telecasts as well as 20 prime-time television specials, including
``Night of 100 Stars,'' the Emmy awards and shows like ``Happy
Birthday Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   These television successes allowed Cohen to pursue the mostly
highbrow type of theatrical productions that had always appealed to
him. Among his plays were Peter Brook's ``La Tragedie de Carmen,''
which received a Tony in 1984; ``Hamlet'' starring Richard Burton;
the Harold Pinter drama ``Homecoming'' which also received a Tony,
in 1967; Sheridan's ``School for Scandal,'' co-starring John
Gielgud and Ralph Richardson; and Trevor Griffiths' ``Comedians.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also presented such sophisticated entertainments as ``An
Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May''; ``Beyond the Fringe,''
the British revue that introduced Dudley Moore, Peter Cook,
Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett to the United States; another
British revue, ``At the Drop of a Hat,'' which brought Michael
Flanders and Donald Swann to Broadway; and concert engagements
starring Marlene Dietrich, Yves Montand, Victor Borge and Maurice
Chevalier.
</P>
<P>
   Though these productions were often financially successful,
Cohen liked to say: ``Any moron can make money, and in show
business any cretin can make money. My considerations have never
been financial. A flop in my head is a show or an experience I
didn't care for. And a hit in my head is something I enjoyed doing
very much. You'd be surprised how many of my flops have been hits
and hits flops.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such bravura, some of Cohen's flops were so staggering
that they entered theater legend: Among them were a revival of
Olsen and Johnson's ``Hellzapoppin''' starring Jerry Lewis, which
closed in Boston during its 1977 Broadway tryout at a cost to Cohen
of $2 million; ``Rugantino,'' the first _ and last _ attempt to
import an Italian musical comedy to Broadway complete with
subtitles; ``Prettybelle,'' a musical comedy that closed in Boston,
with Angela Lansbury as a mental patient; and a Richard Rodgers
musical version of ``I Remember Mama,'' starring Liv Ullmann.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where fortunes are sometimes made and more often
lost overnight, Cohen steadfastly refused to play the pauper. His
theatrical disasters never dented his zest for high living.
</P>
<P>
   Always the master showman, he rode around town in stretch
limousines fully equipped with phones before that was the fashion,
and jetted between New York and other homes he kept at various
times in London; Mougins, France; St. Croix in the Virgin Islands;
Pound Ridge, N.Y.; and Fairfield, Conn. He was so much the epitome
of a theatrical producer that Woody Allen cast him as one in ``The
Purple Rose of Cairo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alexander Henry Cohen was born in New York City on July 24,
1920, the elder son of a successful businessman who died when
Alexander was only 4. His mother later married a banker, and the
family lived on Park Avenue in a duplex penthouse. As Cohen later
recalled, his brother Gerry and he were cared for by ``two Irish
spinsters named Catherine and Mary. They were lovely. When my
mother had parties, we all used to sit upstairs and look down. But
we were never invited down or introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's relationship with his mother remained troubled and it
collapsed entirely when Gerry committed suicide in 1954. ``That was
the day I stopped talking to my mother,'' he recalled. ``My belief
is that Gerry was incapable of coping with not having a family. I
did have a family, and it was in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's interest in the theater was whetted by an uncle, who
took him to see a show every week. He spent much of his inheritance
investing in theatrical ventures that usually failed. The big
exception was Patrick Hamilton's Victorian melodrama ``Angel
Street,'' which had considerable success in 1941. Cohen was listed
as associate producer, and when the play thrived, Cohen became
known around Shubert Alley as Broadway's ``millionaire boy angel.''
He was drafted into the Army during World War II but discharged
after a year because of a leg ailment.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of Cohen's producing career, he was employed by
Bulova Watch Co., where he spent seven years, becoming its director
of advertising and publicity. He kept the job once he started
producing, and often gave wristwatches as presents. (In an effort
to drum up other promotional clients, he also took out an ad in
Variety to announce his availability, which famously claimed,
``Have tux, will travel.'')
</P>
<P>
   After a number of flops, Cohen hit his stride with ``At the Drop
of a Hat'' in 1954, and many triumphs followed throughout the
1960s. In 1967 alone he was represented on Broadway with another
Flanders and Swann revue, ``At the Drop of Another Hat''; ``The
Homecoming,'' which received a Tony and a New York Drama Critics'
Award as best play; Peter Shaffer's ``Black Comedy''; Jules
Feiffer's ``Little Murders''; and two plays by Peter Ustinov, ``The
Unknown Soldier and His Wife'' and ``Halfway Up the Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of Cohen's favorite stories about his years in the theater
was about David Merrick, the frequently abrasive producer known
around town as ``the Abominable Showman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never enough for him to succeed,'' Cohen said of
Merrick. ``His competitors had to fail. In London, we both stayed
at the Savoy. I was having breakfast one morning and invited him to
join me. I said, `I have tickets tonight for ``Look Back in
Anger.'' We can both go, and the deal is if we like it, we'll do it
together.' He agreed. We both liked it and he did it alone. I never
had another business deal with him again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen got his revenge when he tried out an early version of
``Hellzapoppin''' in 1967 with Soupy Sales in Montreal. When he saw
that the show was failing out of town, he knew he would have to
tell the Shubert Organization, since he had booked its Broadway
Theater and was liable for its costs.
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen told the story, he was on his way to the Shubert office
when he ran into a theater manager who told him that Merrick was
producing ``The Happy Time,'' directed by Gower Champion, and
Champion was insisting on putting it in the Broadway Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the Shuberts and told them my show was ready and I
wouldn't go anywhere else,'' Cohen said gleefully. He was finally
persuaded to move ``Hellzapoppin''' _ for the sum of $50,000, paid
by Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say,'' he added, ``I sent that manager a wristwatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Cohen's other plays and musicals over the years were John
Houseman's revival of ``King Lear'' with Louis Calhern; Tyrone
Guthrie's production of ``The First Gentleman'' with Walter Slezak;
``The Devils,'' starring Jason Robards Jr. and Anne Bancroft; the
Sherlock Holmes musical ``Baker Street''; and the Dudley
Moore-Peter Cook revue ``Good Evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many productions Cohen presented in London's West End
were Neil Simon's ``Plaza Suite,'' Arthur Miller's ``Price,''
Charles Boyer in Terence Rattigan's ``Man and Boy,'' and James
Stewart in ``Harvey.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside New York, Cohen supervised the building of the O'Keefe
Center, a 3,100-seat theater for O'Keefe Brewing Co. of Toronto,
which he booked and managed for its first three years, starting in
1960, with Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in ``Camelot.'' In 1992
he opened and managed the Rich Forum for the Stamford Center for
the Arts in Connecticut, serving until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was also an active, if controversial, fund-raiser for the
Actors' Fund of America, maintaining that his three ``Night of 100
Stars'' television specials and his ``Parade of Stars'' television
production raised $3 million to build the fund's extended-care
nursing facility in Englewood, N.J. Behind the scenes, some on
Broadway sniped that Cohen's lavish producing style accommodated
his own needs better than they did the fund's.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Benincasa, who took over as executive director of the
Actors' Fund in 1989, said: ``Alex was the paid producer of all
three `Night of 100 Stars' events. He made money producing these
events and the Actors' Fund made money. He was a volunteer trustee
of the organization as well as a vendor. As executive director, I
would never pay any trustee to produce something. I'm not going to
say that that's wrong. It's just not the way we do things on my
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had something of the last word for all his critics when he
wrote, produced and starred in his own one-man show, ``Star
Billing,'' which opened off-Broadway in 1998 and ran as a special
attraction once a week for 22 performances. Lawrence Van Gelder,
reviewing the production for The New York Times, wrote: ``Cohen
proves himself a splendid anecdotalist with a highly developed
sense of comic timing. He has many a kind word for his friends and
an arsenal of well-honed, acid-tipped barbs for those he loathes,
among them David Merrick, Marlene Dietrich and Jerry Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen's involvement in television specials waned by the early
1990s, so did his finances. For his 100th show, ``The Herbal Bed''
by Peter Whelan, he took on producing partners, only one of whom he
had worked with before _ Max Cooper, the owner of every McDonald's
franchise in Alabama. (``The Herbal Bed'' flopped on Broadway,
closing after 13 performances).
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Cohen was planning to produce ``Sweet
Deliverance,'' a comic play about euthanasia that was to star Fran
Drescher. And he was embroiled in an arbitration with the League of
New York Theaters and Producers, trying to secure the rights to the
Tony wards broadcasts that he produced.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's first marriage, to Jocelyn Newmark, ended in divorce. He
married Parks in 1956. Besides her and his son Gerry Cohen, of Los
Angeles, he is survived by a daughter, Barbara Hoffmann of
Manhattan; another son, Christopher A. Cohen of Manhattan; one
grandson; and a great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, he kept his wry sense of humor and his traditional
sense of standards. He was appalled by the Disney Store annexed to
the New Amsterdam Theater and he would not sell merchandise for any
of his own shows, not even a poster.
</P>
<P>
   He also had contempt for the new-fangled musicals that he
believed had turned Broadway into a satellite of Las Vegas. When he
was offered the chance to invest $100,000 in the London production
of ``Cats,'' in order to get the New York rights, Cohen turned it
down flat.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed to have had no regrets about the millions he never
made _ not even about the millions he lost. ``I can owe a million
and I have,'' he said, ``but when I put my head on the pillow at
night, it's `Goodbye Charlie.' I get up the next morning and start
all over again. I like it. Besides, I don't know how to do anything
else.''

EDITORIAL: A PRECIPITOUS RAID 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 23:
</P>
<P>
   The sight of heavily armed federal agents breaking into Lazaro
Gonzalez's Miami home before dawn Saturday to take custody of Elian
Gonzalez is a disturbing picture for all Americans, and is likely
to haunt the country for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno should have given the two branches
of the Gonzalez family more time to try to resolve the case
amicably, and she should have applied more legal pressure on the
Miami relatives before battering down their door to remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The first question that must be answered in the days ahead is
why Reno, who had shown admirable restraint, did not let the latest
round of negotiations over Elian's fate proceed until any hope of
settlement was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Miami relatives had used discussion and
mediation as a stalling tactic in recent weeks, always introducing
yet another condition when a resolution seemed within reach. For
the last nine days, they had also defied the law by refusing to
turn over Elian after their right to care for him had been revoked
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be some prospect Friday night that
conditions for transferring Elian to his father could still be
worked out in talks that lasted past 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Before subjecting the boy to a forcible night-time raid, Reno
should have directed escalating law-enforcement pressure against
the adults in the Miami family. Though the issue of whether the boy
is entitled to apply for asylum has yet to be decided by the
courts, there was no doubt about the legal obligation of the Miami
relatives to comply with the INS order to return Elian to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce that ruling, Reno should have sought a federal
court order instructing Lazaro Gonzalez to produce the child. If he
still refused, he could have been held in contempt of court and
faced arrest and criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that the raid ended without bloodshed, and that
there was not a confrontation with Cuban American supporters of the
Miami relatives. But the emotional wounds for Elian will not be
easy to heal. He is back with his father, where he belongs, but
Saturday's traumatic events can only compound the child's
psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law is sacred in America, and the Miami relatives'
defiance was unacceptable. But the manner in which the law is
upheld in a free society can be as important as the law itself. In
this case, the methods used by the government are likely to
overshadow and diminish the principle that Reno and President
Clinton set out to defend.
</P>
<P>
   The first icon of the new century for those who question the
administration of justice in America is certain to be the
photograph of a federal agent in assault gear approaching Elian in
the middle of the night with an automatic rifle at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was quick to note that the agent did not have his finger on
the trigger, and was not pointing the rifle at Elian, but that
offers little solace to a nation that is wondering on Sunday why
the government, with all its power, could not have acted with
greater restraint and continued patience.

PHILIP KEENAN, 92, ASTRONOMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa.)   By ERIC COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip C. Keenan, whose work in the spectral classification of
stars helped astronomers understand the chemical evolution of
galaxies, died Thursday at a hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan (pronounced kee-NAN) was emeritus professor of astronomy
at Ohio State University in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the Atlas of Stellar Spectra in 1943 with Dr. W.W.
Morgan, who died in 1994. Its system of classifying stars by their
spectra, or the wavelengths of light they emit, is still in wide
use.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan also had an extraordinarily long history of professional
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``He published longer than most astronomers live,'' said Jay A.
Frogel, a colleague of Keenan at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Sandage, an astronomer at the Carnegie Observatory in
Pasadena, Calif., said the importance of the Morgan and Keenan
atlas and system for analyzing spectra (called the MK system, after
their names) was in formatting earlier work for easier use by other
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of looking at the spectra of each star and
determining its luminosity and temperature,'' said Sandage, who had
known Keenan for more than 45 years. ``It provided the framework
which other people used to put stars into the context of stellar
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a photograph, the spectrum of light that emanates from a star
appears as a series of tiny lines, like a bar code in miniature.
Each type of star has its own sequence of bright and dark lines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cecilia Barnbaum, a professor of physics and astronomy at
Valdosta State University in Georgia, who had collaborated with
Keenan since 1993, recalled that he retained his intellectual vigor
far into old age. She also remembers visiting him at his office at
the Perkins Observatory in Delaware, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tens of thousands of note cards stacked to the
ceiling, each with a photo of a spectrum on it, the name of the
star and the type of star,'' Barnbaum said. ``He could look at the
spectrum and know the star. I don't know anybody else who could do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan was born in Bellevue, Pa., on March 31, 1908. As an
undergraduate at the University of Arizona, he published his first
paper in 1929, about the color of the moon during eclipses. He
received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Arizona
in 1929 and 1930, and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in
1932; he was an instructor there from 1936 until 1942. He was a
physicist with the Navy Bureau of Ordnance from 1942 until 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he became an assistant professor in the department of
astronomy at Ohio State and a member of the staff at Perkins
Observatory. He retired from Ohio State in 1976, but continued his
research for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan wrote his final paper last year with Barnbaum; in it they
calculated distances of stars from Earth using the Hipparchos
satellite, which gives the most accurate distance measurements to
date.

ALFRED PECK O'HARA, 80, FORMER BACARDI PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif., Puerto Rico)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Peck O'Hara, a Manhattan lawyer, former
federal prosecutor and past president of Bacardi Corp., died April
15 at his home in Patterson, his birthplace in Putnam County. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, O'Hara, known as Pete, was with the
Manhattan-based international law firm of Kelley Drye &AMP; Warren,
which he joined in 1986. Before that, he was a senior partner in
Rogers Hoge &AMP; Hills, dealing chiefly with trademark and
unfair-competition matters.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1987, he was president and chairman of Bacardi
Corp. of San Juan, Puerto Rico, the liquor concern.
</P>
<P>
   He also sat on the boards of numerous companies and
organizations, including the National Association of Manufacturers
and Bacardi Capital Ltd. He was a chairman of Guiding Eyes for the
Blind, which provides guide dogs to the blind and sight-impaired.
At the time of his death, he was a member of its board.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s he handled the incorporation of the National Cancer
Foundation, now known as Cancer Care. He was also the
organization's trustee and national campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Pete O'Hara graduated from Syracuse University in 1940 and
received his law degree at Fordham University two years later. He
started his legal career as secretary to a U.S. District Court
judge and went into private practice in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant U.S. attorney and chief of the civil
division for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan for
three years during the 1950s. He handled major cases involving tax
fraud and racketeering before joining Rogers Hoge &AMP; Hills as a
senior partner in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He was a counsel to the U.S. Trademark Association and secretary
of the City Bar Association. He also taught trial practice at New
York University for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he oversaw successful litigation in foreign
jurisdictions over the issue of private ownership of trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara is survived by his wife, Martha Stein O'Hara; his two
daughters, Jane Ann O'Hara of Woodstock, Ga., and Margaret O'Hara
Vodrey of Los Angeles; two sons, Peter J. of Poughquag and John E.
of Pawling; 10 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His
first wife, Muriel Sandberg O'Hara, died in 1969 after 29 years of
marriage.

RONALD LOCKLEY, 96, ASTUTE CHRONICLER OF NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald Lockley, a naturalist and prolific author whose four-year
study of rabbits inspired Richard Adams' 1972 book ``Watership
Down,'' died on April 12 in Auckland, New Zealand. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Lockley wrote about 60 books, around 40 of them about islands,
one of his driving passions. Many of the others were about birds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he established the first formal bird observatories in
both Britain and New Zealand and wrote definitive studies of the
puffin and the Manx shearwater. He also was an early organizer of
the conservationist forces that grew into the environmental
movement.
</P>
<P>
   But it was with the publication in 1964 of ``The Private Life of
the Rabbit: An Account of the Life History and Social Behavior of
the Wild Rabbit'' that Lockley achieved his greatest recognition.
It was a rigorously factual work with none of the anthropomorphic
sentimentality that infused ``Watership'' with its charm, but it
bristled with fascinating insights.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Literary Supplement said Lockley ``shows the rabbit to
be a more complex fellow than one had thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In Time, Stefan Kanfer wrote: ``Lockley was apparently born with
a seventh sense _ of wonder _ and has expended most of it on
rabbits, which he has studied in every imaginable sort of
enclosure, even including a real burrow with specially installed
infrared lighting and glass sides.''
</P>
<P>
   In his acknowledgments, Adams credited Lockley's book for his
own description of bunny behavior in his tale of wandering rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wishes to know more about the migrations of
yearlings, about pressing chin glands, chewing pellets, the effects
of overcrowding in warrens, the phenomenon of reabsorption of
fertilized embryos, the capacity of buck rabbits to fight stoats,
of any other features of Lapine life, should refer to that
definitive work,'' Adams wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Mathias Lockley was born in Cardiff, Wales. He and his
five brothers and sisters were raised mainly by their mother, as
their father's job as a railway manager kept him away much of the
time. She founded a successful boarding school outside Cardiff.
</P>
<P>
   He was a delicate, scholarly child, and his fascination with the
natural world blossomed when he sat in a chair in the family's
garden recovering from appendicitis in the summer of 1914. He made
a detailed inventory of the garden's wildlife and read Thoreau's
``Walden.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Lockley worked with his
sister on a small Welsh poultry farm for five years. He spent most
of the time observing the natural world around him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, with his first wife, Doris, he took a 21-year lease on
Skokholm Island, a 240-acre island off the western tip of
Pembrokeshire, a region of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   They lived a Swiss Family Robinson existence, rebuilding an
ancient farmhouse with wood from a wrecked schooner, which also
supplied their fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The island's interior was carpeted with wildflowers and alive
with sea birds. And, yes, there were rabbits, velvety chinchilla
rabbits to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Lockley envisioned paying his bills by selling fur, but the
rabbits proved frustratingly hard to catch.
</P>
<P>
   Lockley responded by turning his attentions to birds and
writing. He wrote three books about the island, as well as an
authoritative study of the Shearwater species of sea bird. It was
then that he founded Britain's first bird observatory, which in
1934 drew former King Ferdinand of Bulgaria as a visitor; he was
attended at all times by a servant carrying the stool he used for
his frequent rests.
</P>
<P>
   His bird work drew the interest of Buckingham Palace, where
officials wondered if he could find a pet razorbill, a shore bird
species, for Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, on one of the first live television broadcasts, a
handful of viewers witnessed him being ignominiously bitten as he
opened the bird's basket.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, he wrote the screenplay for one of the first nature
films, ``The Private Life of the Gannet'' (a gooselike bird). It
won the Academy Award for best documentary.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a naval intelligence officer during World War
II, he moved with his second wife, Jill, to a large estate called
Orielton near Milford Haven in Wales. There he did his intensive
study on rabbits, under contract from the British Nature
Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of high maintenance costs, he was forced to sell
Orielton to the Field Studies Council, which continues to run it as
a nature education center. He also arranged to have Skokholm and
another nearby island acquired as permanent natural areas.
</P>
<P>
   He fought a prominent and losing battle to stop an oil refinery
from being built in western Wales. Partly in frustration at the
British government's inability to protect its own landscape, he
moved to New Zealand in 1977, with his third wife, Jean. She died,
but he is survived by a daughter, Ann Mark, and two sons, Martin
and Stephen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New Zealand, his writing continued, though his standards
changed: in a 1979 book about marine mammals, he allowed the
creatures to talk in the manner of ``Watership Down.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one review, an unsigned one in The Economist, objected
to the change, saying, ``Mr. Lockley should have kept off imaginary
conversations with dying killer whales.''
</P>
<P>
   He could never escape rabbits. New Zealand had no rabbits until
settlers in 1864 decided that they needed something besides deer
and wild pig to hunt. The result was that the country was overrun
with rabbits, spurring Mark Twain to remark that the man who
introduced them would be hanged immediately, if apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the situation only worsened. Lockley was asked in
1991 for expert advice on whether a rabbit-killing virus should be
introduced. He said it was needlessly cruel and would never work.

KNICKS-LAKERS SERIES WOULD THRILL NBA  
 HILL-DUNCAN GUESSING GAME  
 AESTHETICS OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Jackson sidled up to an NBC producer nearly a month ago and
offered up a rhetorical proposition: ``I bet you guys would love to
see the Knicks and the Lakers in the finals, wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   The producer smiled at the Lakers' coach and left it at that. No
use adding to the conspiracy theories harbored by dozens of
small-market fans who think their Pacers, Jazz or Spurs won't get a
referee's call when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, too, they will be crying foul _ the moment Vince
Carter is sent to the free-throw line because Latrell Sprewell
breathed on him in the final seconds of a tight game. After all,
Carter, the skywalking Raptor forward, was pictured in all his
airbrushed, angelic glory this week on the cover of ESPN Magazine
with the heading: ``Must See VC.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carter and players with flair and panache like
Sacramento's Jason Williams and Chris Webber generate better
ratings, just as genuine rivalries like New York-Los Angeles
generate more fan interest. And at a time when numbers have dipped
considerably, the National Basketball Association and its broadcast
partners are dying for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that someone is pulling strings in either the NBA
or NBC corporate offices seems a bit of a reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazes me every year there's this conspiracy to get
certain teams into the finals or the conference finals for ratings
or whatever, and I think that takes away so much,'' Doug Collins,
the NBC analyst and former coach, said last week. ``I've never been
one to believe that. Maybe I'm naive, but I think that puts a World
Wrestling Federation mentality on a sport that I think has a lot of
integrity. I hate to see that come up all the time: `NBC wants
so-and-so in the finals so they can get ratings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, someone out there needs to start watching more
regularly if the league plans to return to the sweeping popularity
it enjoyed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 34 NBC telecasts
this season, ratings dipped 21 percent below those for last
season's 28 telecasts. Since Michael Jordan retired before the
1998-99 season started, ratings are down 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson might be understating the possibility. Knicks-Lakers may
not only be good for the league and network _ it may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great,'' Lakers forward Robert Horry said.
``Hopefully it would bring a lot of happiness back to the NBA.
Because right now, it doesn't seem like the NBA is too happy.
They're trying to bring some happiness back. Cameras in the locker
rooms. Cameras at the end of practice. Microphones everywhere.
After a while, something has to give. Maybe it's us in the
finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Duncan and Economics
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill recently laughed at the notion that he was recruiting
his friend and Olympic teammate, Tim Duncan, to join up in Orlando
next season after the two become free agents in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone said I was calling him on the cell phone,
lobbying him,'' Hill said. ``I don't even think Tim owns a cell
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, meanwhile, shot down another rumor that the Spurs had
offered their All-Star center a four-year contract to keep him in
San Antonio until after the 2003-4 season.
</P>
<P>
   When their respective teams are knocked out of the playoffs, the
speculation and rumors about Hill and Duncan will grow
exponentially. Especially because the two share the same attorney,
Lon Babby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all sounds plausible, but nothing is on the table from
anyone,'' Babby said Friday afternoon by telephone from his
Washington office. ``People can guess all they want and some will
probably be right. But it's really a non-issue with both Grant and
Tim right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Babby said he will sit down with Hill and Duncan independently
after the season. Orlando and Chicago are the major players in the
free-agent market, having cleared millions in salary-cap room to
lure the top players. But the Pistons and the Spurs can negotiate
more lucrative deals to retain their respective franchise players.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is the more likely to leave in a potential sign-and-trade
deal, especially if the Pistons fall short in the first round
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it'll work is, I'll give them packets analyzing a
team's strength, salary-cap history and whether they're better off
with a short-term or long-term deal,'' Babby said. ``It'll have
what cities have fewer taxes and which ones tax heavily. But the
answer right now to the question `Are they leaning anywhere?' is
no. Not that they've told me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one player in line for a substantial pay raise this
off-season. Shaquille O'Neal is about to reap another windfall. He
is expected to take advantage of a contract-extension clause in his
seven-year, $121 million deal this summer, a possible three-year
extension that could land him an additional $76 million.
</P>
<P>
   The way the raise-increase works for players whose contracts
were grandfathered into the collective bargaining agreement signed
last year is this: You can get a 5 percent raise over the last year
of your current deal. In O'Neal's case, that would make his salary
nearly $23 million. In the next two years, players are entitled to
a 12.5 percent raise over the last year of their deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers offer the maximum and O'Neal accepts as expected,
he would earn $24.15 million in the 2003-4 season, $25.875 million
in the 2004-5 season and another $25.875 million in 2005-6 _ at the
age of 34. With the current rules, only Kevin Garnett stands to
make more over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said his agent, Leonard Armato, convinced him to
renegotiate after four years rather than just sign for the long
term. He was able to exercise an escape clause with Orlando in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where a lot of veterans messed up and didn't realize
the economics had changed,'' O'Neal said. ``Like Karl Malone. When
they first started giving out big money, Malone said, `OK, I'll
take 10 years with no outs.' Scottie Pippen did the same thing.
Then when the money game changed, those guys were upset about the
deals they had. Oh well.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Stats Through Rules
</P>
<P>
   Whether a migration of underskilled underclassmen was to blame
or merely a heavy concentration on defense, the aesthetic quality
of the NBA has taken its hits over the last few years. The mix of
bruising and sometimes bad play has resulted in low scores, fewer
offensive possessions and eyesores on the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule changes implemented this year to prevent much of
the chucking and grabbing by defensive players have apparently made
for at least a more appealing product.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three years, scoring and field-goal
percentage improved. Teams scored an average of 97.5 points per
game this season, up nearly six points from last season's 91.6
average. Teams shot an average of nearly 45 percent from the field,
as compared with .437 during last season's truncated season. Teams
also took about four more shots per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the rules had everything to do with it, but
that's what people have always wanted to see _ a more wide-open
game,'' the Lakers' Kobe Bryant said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, the Eastern Conference was all about who could
stop who on defense. Now, you look at Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady,
Eddie Jones, Sprewell; they have some real athletes out there.
Things are changing.''

ON HOCKEY: UPSETTING DEVELOPMENTS, BUT FEW UPSETS
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angry about a slashing penalty, Chris Simon of the
Washington Capitals took a seat in the penalty box but he did not
sit still Friday night. Simon began bashing a television camera and
then he threw an extra puck onto the ice. When this earned him an
additional 10-minute misconduct penalty, Simon left the box for the
locker room, smashing his stick along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this first-round series of the Stanley Cup playoffs,
Simon missed a game while suspended for cross-checking Pittsburgh's
Peter Popovic in the head. With the Capitals now out of the
tournament and idle until October, Simon can begin serving a
five-month misconduct for trashing, if not trash-talking. But he
also deserves some credit. The man with hockey's longest hair and
the most goals on his team behaved in a way that was appropriately
symbolic of Washington's shabby play.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second in the Eastern Conference in the regular
season, Simon and the Capitals left the playoffs Friday night after
losing for the fourth time in five games against the Penguins. The
score was 2-1, the winning goal coming when Jaromir Jagr of
Pittsburgh passed a puck that deflected off Washington defenseman
Calle Johansson and behind goalie Olaf Kolzig. There have been a
few strange goals like this around the NHL in a first round that is
coming to an end either Monday or Tuesday. But there have been very
few upsets.
</P>
<P>
   Some favorites won easily, like Detroit sweeping Los Angeles and
New Jersey sweeping Florida. Only five games were needed for
Philadelphia to eliminate Buffalo, for Dallas to oust Edmonton and
for Colorado to finish the Phoenix season. The most surprising
series may be St. Louis-San Jose; the league-champion Blues trail
the eighth-seeded Sharks, three games to two.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL can be grateful for that one. Without a 5-3 victory by
the Blues on Friday night, the league would be without a Sunday
afternoon game for the ABC network, its new partner. However, in
view of hockey's recent low ratings, it may be just a mixed
blessing. Bigger audiences are found for the Weather Channel, which
people tune in to watch spring flowers grow. Oh, but they are
watching _ and listening to _ Hockey Night in Canada for the Battle
of Ontario. Going into Game 5 last Saturday night, Toronto and
Ottawa were tied at two victories each.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie madness is the theme here. Not to be outdone by Curtis
Joseph of the Maple Leafs, who accidentally knocked down a referee
during a display of temper, Tom Barrasso of Ottawa got even by
cursing on air during an interview on the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. ``I could really give a hoot what you people think,'' is the
PG translation of Barrasso's words. This was after a victory in
Game 4. This is Barrasso in a good mood! Where was this ray of
sunshine when the edgy Fox network had the U.S. television rights?
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso is not the only one proving that, while sticks and
pucks may break your bones, words can hurt you, too. After the
Penguins ousted the Capitals, Matthew Barnaby of Pittsburgh
reflected again on the proclamations of Ron Wilson, the Washington
coach. When told his team would have to play an extra early game in
Pittsburgh because of a building conflict, Wilson said the Capitals
could play all seven on the road and still win the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an embarrassment to the whole Capitals organization,''
Barnaby said of Wilson's comments. ``Why come in and embarrass a
team and give them life? That's what he did. Total disrespect for
our team. Our biggest motivation was him. We ended it in five. I
don't think he'll be talking too loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby and the Penguins have a few days to talk about the next
round against the Flyers, who usually beat them in both the regular
season and the playoffs. The Flyers will still be without Eric
Lindros, their former captain, who is recovering from a concussion.
Another return in doubt is that of Roger Neilson, the Philadelphia
coach, who wants to come back after cancer surgery. Management,
taking a wait-and-see position, plans to talk with both Neilson and
doctors. The fourth-seeded Devils will play either No. 3 Toronto or
No. 6 Ottawa. The Devils would have a home-ice advantage against
only the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, Detroit, Colorado and Dallas all
await the St. Louis-San Jose result. If the Blues win, they play
the Red Wings. If the Sharks win, they play the defending-champion
Stars. The West winner has taken the trophy in the last four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For those planning their viewing that far ahead, some games in
the finals will be on ABC with Al ``Miracles'' Michaels at the
mike. The few viewers who watched last week might have noticed that
ABC has retained the aggravating Fox habit of showing long
stretches of action from low cameras behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   This takes a sport that is difficult to televise and makes it
almost impossible for even devoted fans to comprehend. ABC had
better hope Chris Simon watches on Canadian television instead of
American. If he gets frustrated, he may destroy some more cameras.

MAYOR DEFENDS WELFARE HIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after the Manhattan district attorney's office
said it had begun an investigation into the activities of a
Virginia company when it was preparing a bid for New York City
welfare contracts, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the accusations the
company faced were ``created stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody acted appropriately,'' the mayor said at a news
conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks were his first on the subject since The New
York Times reported on Thursday that the Virginia company, Maximus,
had acknowledged hiring the father-in-law and a family friend of
the city's welfare commissioner, Jason Turner, just as it was
trying to secure $100 million in contracts to administer the city's
welfare-to-work program, a cornerstone of the mayor's welfare
overhaul package.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's staff has released a letter that the city's Conflict of
Interest Board sent to Turner in February advising him, in an
informal opinion, that his father-in-law's work for Maximus did not
appear to be a problem. But Turner had sought the opinion on Feb.
8, two months after his agency had selected Maximus for a major
contract, which officials said ran counter to a preferred procedure
of seeking an opinion before contracts are awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Giuliani said Turner and Maximus were blameless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will turn out that everybody gets cleared,'' he said. ``The
New York Times will write all sorts of stories making it appear
they did something wrong, and they will be all cleared and they
won't write all kinds of stories saying we were wrong to malign
them.''

POLICE KILL MAN WHO THEY SAY ATTACKED HIS MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Rewrites story throughout.) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mentally disturbed man accused of beating and
slashing his elderly mother before storming onto a Queens County
street with a handgun and knife raised in the air was shot at least
seven times and killed Saturday morning by police officers, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, James Murphy Jr., 43, was killed in a shootout with the
police on his street after he walked toward a group of officers,
dropped a knife and his light-blue denim jacket into a puddle of
water, pointed a black Luger handgun at them and began yelling,
according to law-enforcement officials and accounts from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The officers began firing, witnesses and police officials said,
after Murphy refused to comply with repeated demands for him to
drop the weapon. The officers had gone to the Murphy home, on 53rd
Avenue, after receiving a 911 call alleging that Murphy was beating
and slashing his 70-year-old mother in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and police officials said that a neighbor, Michael
Koto, 31, had helped the woman get away from her son, who was
wielding a knife, before officers arrived at about 9:30 a.m. By
then, Murphy had gone back into the house and retrieved a handgun,
the witnesses and officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that Murphy fired shots at two officers,
who ran for cover, on 53rd Avenue, before heading in the opposite
direction. ``He fired several rounds at us, and our officers began
returning fire,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of 53rd Avenue and 74th Street, witnesses and
police officials said, Murphy was confronted by a group of
officers. He shed his jacket, and, they said, began yelling ``I
guess you got me now,'' as the officers pleaded with him to drop
his weapon. ``It looked like `High Noon,''' said Frank Connolly,
68, a neighbor of the Murphy family.
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired at least 14 shots, after Murphy refused to
drop the weapon, officials said. Witnesses said that Murphy
stumbled across a sidewalk to a fence, where he stayed until an
officer ran over and placed his boot on the Luger handgun. Murphy
was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead at 10:17 a.m., officials added.
</P>
<P>
   One police investigator at the scene, where dozens of residents
congregated during or immediately after the shootout, said that
Murphy apparently began attacking his mother after she told him
that she did not support his plan to leave the United States and
move to Poland. The mother, who had been slashed on the shoulder
and bruised, was taken to St. John's Hospital where she was in
stable condition Saturday afternoon, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
   Koto's mother, Emmi, who harbored Murphy's mother in her home
until the police arrived, said the woman was afraid her son was
going to kill her husband, who was in the house at the time, or the
family's animals.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that in recent weeks, Murphy, who had spent much
of his career in the U.S. Navy and as a teacher at the U.S.
Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, had begun to show signs of
being troubled, including rambling, walking the streets all day
with his head low, and losing 20 pounds in one week.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, the neighbor, said he became so concerned that a few
weeks ago he asked Murphy's father to see if he could hide the
handgun and rifle that were in the house from his son.

CONE, STILL SEARCHING FOR HIS FIRST VICTORY, IS ROUGHED UP BY THE
BLUE JAYS
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The New York Yankees came here looking to extend an
eight-game winning streak against a Toronto pitching staff that
sported a 7.25 earned run average. But in the first two games of
the series, the Yankees and the Blue Jays have reversed roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense has hardly made a ripple, and their
starting pitching is being pounded. David Cone was hammered for
eight runs in three-plus innings and Toronto's Kelvim Escobar
allowed nine hits in pitching the Blue Jays' second consecutive
complete game against the Yankees in an 8-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has yet to get a win in any of his four starts, and his ERA
is 10.70. And while there have been times when his stuff has been
better than his results this year, Cone had a terrible game
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cone tinkers continually, with his delivery, with his arm angle,
with the position of his foot on the rubber. Manager Joe Torre made
a more substantive adjustment before Saturday's game, inserting Jim
Leyritz into the lineup as the catcher for Cone.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason Torre presented for the change was to give
Jorge Posada a day off, but there was probably more to it than
that. The Yankees, after all, just had a day off Thursday, and
Torre and some of the players had grumbled about having so many
scheduled days off early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Cone preferred the veteran Joe Girardi to be his catcher in
recent seasons, and it may be that the coaching staff sensed that
Posada and Cone were not working together. Torre said Posada came
to him and mentioned that Cone seemed frustrated with Posada _
something that Posada might not have volunteered a year ago, Torre
said, because Posada was used more sparingly. The working
discomfort between Cone and Posada, Torre mentioned, had more to do
with pitch selection than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Torre started Leyritz in an effort to aid Cone, leaving open the
possibility that he might maintain the pairing if it worked. But
Cone may have been beyond help Saturday. He had good stuff in his
first two outings _ a good fastball and not enough control _ and
surrendered 12 runs in 7 2/3 innings. It appeared Cone was facing
the Blue Jays with almost no pitches at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Cone jogged out of the visitors' bullpen to pitch the bottom of
the first inning, rather than out of the dugout, a routine he
adopted before starting against Texas earlier in the week; this
might help him stay loose before the first inning. When he reached
the mound, Cone kicked at the dirt in front of the rubber for
almost a minute, creating a small canal, before warming up. He took
his place on the right side of the rubber and looked for the sign
from Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   Fastball. Cone nodded, threw a ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fastball. Jose Cruz Jr., crushed a tremendous home run, an
estimated 429 feet; if you were sitting at a table in the
restaurant in center field, there might have been an instant of
fear before you remembered the glass would protect you from any
monstrous home run. It was the second time in four starts that Cone
permitted a home run to the first batter he faced; Darin Erstad
slugged a homer against him April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Like Erstad's home run that day, Cruz's was a portent, despite
Cone's incredible history of success against almost every hitter in
the Toronto lineup. Cruz came into the game with one hit in 12
at-bats against Cone, Homer Bush 1 for 8, Carlos Delgado 1 for 27
with 14 strikeouts, Tony Batista 2 for 19, Darren Fletcher 4 for 18
and Marty Cordova 1 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   But after shortstop Derek Jeter made a throwing error on a
routine grounder with one out, Delgado ripped a double inside the
right-field line, Raul Mondesi scoring after the ball bounced
awkwardly against a ball boy's stool. Brad Fullmer dumped a double
into left-center field. Blue Jays 3, Yankees 0.
</P>
<P>
   Cone tried a breaking ball against Batista, hung it, and the
Blue Jays' third baseman bashed it over the wall, his eighth homer
of the year. Cone's face is usually flushed from effort when he
pitches. At this moment, his face mostly showed self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley scrambled to warm up, before Cone closed out the
inning with back-to-back strikeouts. Torre undoubtedly wanted to
give Cone as much time as he could to settle down, to find a
groove, to gather command, and Cone shut out the Blue Jays in the
second and third innings. The Yankees scored a run against Escobar
in the fourth inning, Paul O'Neill driving home a run after Jeter
tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Cone hit Cordova with a wayward pitch in the fourth inning _
this didn't appear to have anything to do with the numerous hit
batsmen Friday _ and Alex Gonzalez pulled a single through the hole
between short and third. Grimsley jumped up in the bullpen and
resumed warming up, joined shortly thereafter by Allen Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was next and Cone fell behind two balls and no strikes. He
threw split-fingered fastballs on consecutive pitches to even the
count _ this is the conventional wisdom on Cruz, that he will
murder fastballs and has trouble hitting anything with unusual
movement. Then Cone tried to jam Cruz with a fastball but left it
over the inner half of the plate, and again, Cruz bashed it. Even
before the three-run homer landed inside the right field foul pole,
Cone was grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's day was over, as was the game, for all practical
purposes. The Yankees' offense, which had forced Chris Carpenter to
throw just 88 pitches Friday, was stifled again with ease. Escobar
averaged about 10 pitches per inning, as well.

   MIAMI _ Dr. Lydia Usategui and her husband Alfredo Manrara spent
Friday night at the house of Elian Gonzalez's Miami family, certain
that something bad might happen.
</P>
<P>
   A child psychiatrist, Usategui had examined Elian months ago,
and recently joined with other members of the Cuban-American
Psychiatric Association in strongly criticizing the plan by federal
officials to immediately take Elian from the home of his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m. EST Saturday, she and her husband were sitting on the
steps of a large apartment building immediately next door to the
Gonzalez home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them pull back the barricade at the end of the street
and I told my wife,'' said Manrara. ``Then Armando (Gutierrez, the
family spokesman) ran out of the house yelling, 'They're coming,
they're coming.'''
</P>
<P>
   A small caravan of stark white minivans sped to the front of the
house. The doors flung open and out poured black-clad federal
officers, Manrara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran to the front of the house and they came up,'' he said.
``They had guns and . . . ordered everybody back and sprayed us
with gas. They stormed the door, breaking it down with some kind of
ram. They ran inside the house. It all happened so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Usategui, meanwhile, ran around to the small home's back door,
and found three officers with guns trained on several Gonzalez
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told them to get on the ground and they had rifles
pointing at them,'' she said. ``They told me to get down so I got
down on all fours. They told me to look down. I imagined that if I
moved I'd get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the home, officers held family members and their lawyers
at gunpoint, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Donato Dalrymple, one of the the fisherman who rescued Elian on
Thanksgiving Day, was asleep on a couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed the little boy,'' he later told reporters. ``He was
screaming in English, 'Help me, help me.' They busted the door down
and it was if they were taking a terrorist. They grabbed him
physically. He was terrified. They threw a blanket over his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Usategui said she suddenly heard someone in the house
shout, ``Bingo, bingo, bingo,'' the apparent sign that the boy had
been taken.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers exited the front door, ``they yanked people out
of the way,'' Manrara said. ``They sprayed everybody again. I was
thrown against the fence and my jacket was torn. It was brutal and
provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Usategui was still shaken hours later, saying she had never seen
anything like it in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so fast,'' she said. ``This was the most dramatic and
traumatic thing they could have done to this boy. It was
inflammatory to the community, done just after the anniversary of
the Bay of Pigs, on Easter weekend.''

screaming in English, 'Help me, help me.' They busted the door down
and it was if they were taking a terrorist. They grabbed him
physically. He was terrified. They threw a blanket over his head.''

<P>
   Outside, Usategui said she suddenly heard someone in the house
shout, ``Bingo, bingo, bingo,'' the apparent sign that the boy had
been taken.
</P>

   As the officers exited the front door, ``they yanked people out
of the way,'' Manrara said. ``They sprayed everybody again. I was
thrown against the fence and my jacket was torn. It was brutal and
provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Usategui was still shaken hours later, saying she had never seen
anything like it in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so fast,'' she said. ``This was the most dramatic and
traumatic thing they could have done to this boy. It was
inflammatory to the community, done just after the anniversary of
the Bay of Pigs, on Easter weekend.''

agents might face armed resistance in ending the standoff. (Stephen

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chanting ``Libertad para Elian!'' scores of angry
protesters mounted raucous demonstrations in New York City and in
the Cuban-American stronghold of Union City, N.J., Saturday against
the forcible removal of Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami
relatives in a predawn raid by armed federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 protesters, clotting a New Jersey highway, tied up
traffic in and out of the Lincoln Tunnel, one of the transportation
links between New Jersey and New York City, for nearly half an hour
just after noon, and slowed traffic on nearby John F. Kennedy
Boulevard to a trickle. Hundreds of car horns blared, but _ judging
by Cuban flags waving out windows _ there seemed to be as many
sympathizers in the chorus as drivers angered by the delays.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, about 250 demonstrators gathered at 39th Street
and Lexington Avenue behind barricades, a block from the Cuban
Mission to the United Nations. They blocked traffic briefly, waved
Cuban flags, denounced President Clinton and Attorney General Janet
Reno as tools of President Fidel Castro and likened the Miami raid
to the tactics of a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Manhattan rally were non-Cubans who, like protesters
on both sides of the Hudson, had been enraged by the striking,
nationally televised pictures of a free-lance photographer who had
been in the Miami house at the time of the raid. The pictures
showed an agent in riot gear holding an assault rifle in front of
the cowering boy and carrying him away as he sobs for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of a role model do we have in Clinton?'' asked Peter
Brennan, one of the demonstrators. ``The picture of the machine gun
on the kid? That is cruel. How could the president allow this to
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Conlon, another non-Cuban protester, was also
disillusioned. ``To threaten a child like this?'' he said. ``I am
deeply ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   And Judy and Richard Kemp said they were stunned that the
government had taken the action, especially on the eve of Easter.
``The fact that on Holy Saturday they ripped him out of his home is
the most atrocious thing,'' Mrs. Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Elian bobbed on poles in the crowd, with freshly
painted signs proclaiming: ``What rule of law?'' and ``Child abuse,
Reno style.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan demonstration was noisy but peaceful, for the most
part, but several protesters burned flags and tried to cross police
barricades, and one man was arrested and accused of assaulting a
police captain. Later, the group marched to the U.N. headquarters,
where the protest disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Elian was seized and flown to a reunion with his
father near Washington, political leaders in New York and New
Jersey joined protesters in expressing disgust and resentment over
the decision to use force in the midst of negotiations to resolve
an international custody battle that has been under way for nearly
five months.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, angry and
using extremely harsh language, said the Clinton administration had
disgraced itself in what he called ``an orchestrated plot by
Castro,'' and had sent ''storm troopers'' to ``rip a boy away from
a family that is caring for him.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki, also a Republican, also expressed
shock. ``It's very upsetting and offensive that people with machine
guns and fatigues would break down a door to take a child out of a
home in America,'' he said at an Earth Day ceremony in Westchester
County. ``This is something that would happen in the Soviet Union,
not in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, U.S. Rep, Robert Menendez, a Union City Democrat
who has been involved in the negotiations, called the raid ``a
despicable use of the force of the federal government against a
humble, unarmed and law-abiding family, who had only one interest:
Elian's future and his best interests as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Menendez, a Cuban-American and a frequent
critic of the Castro government, said: ``It's really a day of
infamy. To take a child out at gunpoint, awakened from his sleep in
the dark of night by masked agents, reminds us of the tactics of
the Castro dictatorship, not of the democracy we enjoy in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Reno, Menendez said: ``Now that she has made this
decision to use the full force of the federal government to uphold
the father's rights, I hope she's going to use the full force of
the government to uphold the boy's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Raul Garcia of Union City, a Democrat who was born in Cuba
but grew up in Union City, called the Miami raid ``despicable'' and
added, ``It's a sad day for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey protesters began gathering in a light rain about
10:30 a.m. at Bergenline Avenue and 41st Street, the main
intersection in Union City, which for decades has been a center of
Cuban-American life in the metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to reaffirm the value of a single human life, of a
6-year-old child who has in fact not received a full hearing in a
competent court of law,'' Lazaro Alvarez, a human rights and
anti-Castro advocate, shouted as protesters in the nation's
second-largest Cuban-American community waved flags and banners,
honked horns and voiced dismay over the sudden turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   A few protesters were wrapped in Cuban flags. Some held American
flags upside down. Others held banners proclaiming ``First Waco,
Now Elian,'' and ``Reno-Clinton-Gore, you can celebrate with your
friend Castro.'' They blocked traffic, sang the Cuban national
anthem and chanted ``Liberty for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Frontela, who lives in North Bergen, N.J., and came to
the United States six years ago from Santa Clara, Cuba, was angry
and sad. ``Fidel Castro bought Bill Clinton and Janet Reno,'' he
said. He said he had heard Clinton on the radio, addressing the
nation after the raid, and said, ``The Bill Clinton who was
speaking today was Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon, the demonstrators left the center of Union
City, and marched south on Kennedy Boulevard, snarling traffic in
the four northbound and southbound lanes. As car horns blared,
Cuban flags appeared out the windows of many cars, and it appeared
that as many drivers were sympathetic to the demonstrators as not.
</P>
<P>
   But when the protesters reached the intersection of Interstate
495, the main highway feeding traffic into and out of the Lincoln
Tunnel, the sympathy evaporated, and for nearly half an hour
traffic was stalled and drivers were clearly angry.
</P>
<P>
   As cars, trucks and buses backed up for miles and motorists
honked in frustration, the protesters shouted, ``You're going
nowhere!'' A man with a megaphone screamed continuously, ``Free
Elian!'' and ``Freedom!''
</P>
<P>
   Three boys, 8 to 11 years old, lay in the westbound lanes in
front of a Greyhound bus. One, Julio Flores Jr., 11, of Union City,
gave an interview flat on his back. ``The U.S. government is
contradicting itself,'' he said. ``They say they don't want to
traumatize the child, but they go into the house with guns pointed
at him. Reno and Clinton are tools for Castro and communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers lined the roadway on both sides, but
did nothing to break up the protest, and the demonstrators
dissolved their clot voluntarily and returned to downtown Union
City without further incident. The Union City police later
described the demonstration as peaceful, and said there had been no
complaints and no arrests.

POPOV'S LOYALTY TO RUSSIAN WAYS COMES AT AN IMMEASURABLE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THREDBO VILLAGE, Australia _ Alexander Popov was talking about
his wife and young son, about the demands of being a new
International Olympic Committee member and about struggling to find
the motivation to keep pulling his long, lean, extraordinarily
supple body out of bed and through the water well before dawn. And
as he talked about the changes in his life and his attitude on the
terrace of a hotel in this mountain resort, he calmly brushed away
fly after fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australian salute,'' he joked, as his big hand moved
languidly left and right in the midst of a southern hemisphere
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Popov, the most successful Olympic swimmer of the 1990s, has
been living in Australia since 1992, long enough to pepper his
English with colloquialisms, long enough to begin building a house
in the Australian capital of Canberra, but not long enough to
change his mind about the nation he represents.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other coaches and athletes from the former Soviet
Union have switched allegiances, including the women's pole vaulter
Tatyana Grigorieva and the men's pole-vaulter Dmitry Markov, who
both compete for Australia, or Lenny Krayzelburg, the backstroker
who is now breaking world records for the United States after
moving there with his parents from Ukraine as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But Popov has remained loyal to Russia in name if not address.
He reads as much Tolstoy as his weary body will allow him to keep
his eyes open for; he watches the Russian language news, which is
aired each morning on an Australian cultural channel. His wife is
the former Russian Olympic swimmer Daria Shmeleva, and their
2-year-old son, who not surprisingly has already begun to swim, is
named Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my reputation as a Russian swimmer, and I plan to
remain a Russian swimmer,'' Popov said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationality is an increasingly anachronistic distinction in a
sports world in which more porous borders have blurred identities.
What should it matter if Popov is Russian or Australian?
</P>
<P>
   But Popov's decision is costing him, particularly with the
Summer Olympics in Sydney coming into full view and his sport about
to be showcased as it has rarely been in this country, where
swimmers are icons and their races often televised in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   If Popov, the two-time defending Olympic champion in the 50- and
100-meter freestyle, were Australian, he would be on billboards and
television screens pitching goods and services, and feathering his
nest for the retirement that is expected to come in the wake of his
third Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were Australian, he'd probably be making close to one
million Australian dollars a year in endorsement deals,'' said Rob
Woodhouse, an agent, who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Games in
Los Angeles in the 400 individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean more than $600,000 U.S. a year for the world's
greatest freestyler. Instead, he must settle for considerably less
than that and considerably less than the annual amount earned by
his training partner Michael Klim or the world's latest freestyle
sensation, a 17-year-old swimmer from Sydney, Ian Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Klim nor Thorpe has won a medal in an Olympics. And
while their training is generously subsidized by the Australian
swimming federation, Popov must pay 100 Australian dollars a day to
train at the Australian Institute of Sport with his coach Gennady
Touretsky, the former Soviet national sprint coach who works for
the Australians but has remained Popov's mentor and guide through
often troubled waters since 1990. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial thing is very difficult for Alex,'' Touretsky
said. ``He has sponsors, a few, but here in Australia he has none.
There is basically an embargo for him here because he swims for
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no embargo on more gold, but the situation will be
quite different in Sydney than it was in Atlanta, where Popov held
off the young American Gary Hall Jr. to become the first man to
defend the 50 and 100 Olympic titles. In 1996, Popov was still a
technical and physical cut above the opposition, but his aura of
invincibility is no longer intact.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow came the month after the Atlanta Olympics, when
he was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife during a late-night
altercation with three watermelon vendors on a Moscow street. The
knife sliced an artery, grazed one of his kidneys and damaged the
pleura, the membrane that encases the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But Popov's lungs were essentially untouched and after emergency
surgery in Moscow and three months of rehabilitation he returned to
the pool and then managed to defend his European sprint titles the
following August in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, he was beaten in the final of the 50 in the world
championships in Perth by the American Bill Pilczuk and last August
in Istanbul, he was beaten in both the 50 and the 100 at the
European championships by the new Dutch star, Pieter Van den
Hoogenband. Popov is still the world record-holder in the 100, but
his record time of 48.21 seconds is now six years old and while
young men like Van den Hoogenband, Klim and Thorpe are improving in
the 100, the 28-year-old Popov must now find a way to improve once
more, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be going in progression: Atlanta was harder than
Barcelona, and Sydney will be harder than Atlanta,'' Popov said.
``I'm not 21 or 24 anymore. Maybe you're a bit more experienced,
but there are some other guys in the field who are pretty fast at
the moment, and they are young and sort of hungry, and you are sort
of the lazy cat who sits in the chair and asks, `What am I here
for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lazy or not, the cat is still spending up to six hours a day in
the water and another hour or more in the gymnasium with Touretsky
watching over him, just as he watches over Klim, the world
record-holder in the 100 butterfly and the winner of four gold
medals in the last world championships in Perth. As usual, the two
trained in adjacent lanes during a recent training session at the
Thredbo pool, which at 1,360 meters is the closest thing this
sprawling continent has to a high-altitude training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are writing Alex off, but I'm not,'' said Klim, who
also plans to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle events in Sydney.
``I've seen him achieve some great things, and I've learned so much
from him, and I'm thankful he's still around and we can work
together toward the Olympics. Last time, he was still ahead of me,
but now I can sort of relate to him a bit more. But he's going to
be ready for more great things I'm sure when it comes to the
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Touretsky agreed. ``I know he will win the 100 again,'' he said,
laughing. ``The difference this time is I don't know how.''

 &HT;    Chattanooga embraces new park
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ In the hit movie ``Field of Dreams,'' a
voice tells Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, ``Build it and they will
come.'' Frank Burke had a different ballpark dream, but one that
was not much more improbable.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard Business School, the Chattanooga Lookouts
president knew there was only one way to ensure the future of
minor-league baseball in this city of 150,000 on the banks of the
Tennessee River: ``If you come, we will build it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that slogan, Burke, 39, began a three-month stadium drive
in the fall of 1998 that was a longshot at best. If fans would
agree to buy at least 1,800 season tickets, the Class AA Southern
League team promised to build a downtown ballpark on Hawk Hill near
the Tennessee Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think we had a chance?'' Burke asked. ``Well, we had
never sold more than 800 season tickets before. But I knew we
couldn't keep playing at Engel Stadium, and I didn't want to sell
the team and have Chattanooga left without baseball. That would
have been awful. We didn't buy the team (in 1995) to sell it. I had
to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga baseball fans responded with a home run. By early
1999, more than 2,000 season tickets had been sold and the deadline
met. Construction began in May. Ten months later, the $10 million
stadium came in on time and on budget, with $1 million in naming
rights from BellSouth and the sale of 12 luxury boxes helping to
pay the bill. However, Burke, the proud father, had plenty of
anxious moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this built almost killed me,'' said Burke, who owns
the team with his father, Daniel Burke, and Charles Eshbach. ``But
it was worth it. I think this is one of the most beautiful stadiums
in the minor leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Park opened April 1, with 6,512 cramming into the
stadium that normally seats 6,157 to see the Cincinnati Reds _ the
Lookouts' parent team _ play the Baltimore Orioles in an exhibition
game. Ken Griffey Jr. and Cal Ripken were playing in Chattanooga
for the first time, but the superstars had to share the spotlight
with the stadium, which drew rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Engel Stadium _ home to baseball in Chattanooga for 70
years _will be remembered fondly by older fans. But it offered none
of the features of modern stadiums, and it couldn't match BellSouth
Park's view.
</P>
<P>
   From the top of the grandstand or the picnic pavilion in right
field, you can see the Tennessee River winding around the outfield
and the mountains rising on the other side. Downtown Chattanooga
looms the other way, with the Tennessee Aquarium only about 200
yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept telling me there wasn't enough room for a stadium
up here, but I knew this was the perfect spot _ the only spot,''
Burke said. ``This area of downtown has really enjoyed a revival,
and 1.5 million people come to the Aquarium each year. When they
see the stadium, I'm sure a lot of them will come to our games,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lookouts expect to set a Chattanooga attendance record this
season by drawing more than 300,000 fans. Season-ticket sales
topped out at 2,400 and the team averaged 3,637 per game for its
opening homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my first game at Engel Stadium in 1932 and really loved
going to games there,'' fan Jim Hatchcock, 82, said. ``Harmon
Killebrew will always be my favorite player, but you can't keep
hanging on to the past, even when you are old like me. This stadium
is beautiful, and I know it will help draw more fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The only things that Judy Hudnall, 81, misses about Engel
Stadium is the roof over the grandstand and the easy walk from the
parking lot. But she rides the escalator up the hill from Third
Street and brings an umbrella to protect her from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure is pretty looking out to the mountains,'' said the
loyal Lookout fan, who has missed one home game since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Lookout players are as happy with BellSouth Park as the
fans, although the pitchers temper their enthusiasm a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engel Stadium was great to pitch in, because it was so big,''
said reliever Scott MacRae. ``But this park is beautiful and you
can't beat the new clubhouse. It's almost like being in the major
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel Stadium, with its cramped clubhouse, little dugouts and
grandstand ceiling fans, is used now for high school and
junior-college games. But some of the features have made the
two-mile trip to BellSouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke bottles now sit on the top of the new scoreboard, and
the Chattanooga Choo-Choo train engine rolls out from behind a sign
in right-center after each Lookout homer. Looie the Lookout, the
team mascot with the bug eyes, patrols the grandstand and you can
get an in-game haircut in the barber chair near third base.
</P>
<P>
   Third base is as far as the grandstand goes on the left side of
the field. U.S. 27 cuts close to the stadium, with a 42-foot high
screen protecting drivers from batted balls. ``Even with the
screen, it will be a while before I stop worrying about a car
getting hit,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Chattanooga embraces new park
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ In the hit movie ``Field of Dreams,'' a
voice tells Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, ``Build it and they will
come.'' Frank Burke had a different ballpark dream, but one that
was not much more improbable.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard Business School, the Chattanooga Lookouts
president knew there was only one way to ensure the future of
minor-league baseball in this city of 150,000 on the banks of the
Tennessee River: ``If you come, we will build it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that slogan, Burke, 39, began a three-month stadium drive
in the fall of 1998 that was a longshot at best. If fans would
agree to buy at least 1,800 season tickets, the Class AA Southern
League team promised to build a downtown ballpark on Hawk Hill near
the Tennessee Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think we had a chance?'' Burke asked. ``Well, we had
never sold more than 800 season tickets before. But I knew we
couldn't keep playing at Engel Stadium, and I didn't want to sell
the team and have Chattanooga left without baseball. That would
have been awful. We didn't buy the team (in 1995) to sell it. I had
to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga baseball fans responded with a home run. By early
1999, more than 2,000 season tickets had been sold and the deadline
met. Construction began in May. Ten months later, the $10 million
stadium came in on time and on budget, with $1 million in naming
rights from BellSouth and the sale of 12 luxury boxes helping to
pay the bill. However, Burke, the proud father, had plenty of
anxious moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this built almost killed me,'' said Burke, who owns
the team with his father, Daniel Burke, and Charles Eshbach. ``But
it was worth it. I think this is one of the most beautiful stadiums
in the minor leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Park opened April 1, with 6,512 cramming into the
stadium that normally seats 6,157 to see the Cincinnati Reds _ the
Lookouts' parent team _ play the Baltimore Orioles in an exhibition
game. Ken Griffey Jr. and Cal Ripken were playing in Chattanooga
for the first time, but the superstars had to share the spotlight
with the stadium, which drew rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Engel Stadium _ home to baseball in Chattanooga for 70
years _will be remembered fondly by older fans. But it offered none
of the features of modern stadiums, and it couldn't match BellSouth
Park's view.
</P>
<P>
   From the top of the grandstand or the picnic pavilion in right
field, you can see the Tennessee River winding around the outfield
and the mountains rising on the other side. Downtown Chattanooga
looms the other way, with the Tennessee Aquarium only about 200
yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept telling me there wasn't enough room for a stadium
up here, but I knew this was the perfect spot _ the only spot,''
Burke said. ``This area of downtown has really enjoyed a revival,
and 1.5 million people come to the Aquarium each year. When they
see the stadium, I'm sure a lot of them will come to our games,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lookouts expect to set a Chattanooga attendance record this
season by drawing more than 300,000 fans. Season-ticket sales
topped out at 2,400 and the team averaged 3,637 per game for its
opening homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my first game at Engel Stadium in 1932 and really loved
going to games there,'' fan Jim Hatchcock, 82, said. ``Harmon
Killebrew will always be my favorite player, but you can't keep
hanging on to the past, even when you are old like me. This stadium
is beautiful, and I know it will help draw more fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The only things that Judy Hudnall, 81, misses about Engel
Stadium is the roof over the grandstand and the easy walk from the
parking lot. But she rides the escalator up the hill from Third
Street and brings an umbrella to protect her from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure is pretty looking out to the mountains,'' said the
loyal Lookout fan, who has missed one home game since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Lookout players are as happy with BellSouth Park as the
fans, although the pitchers temper their enthusiasm a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engel Stadium was great to pitch in, because it was so big,''
said reliever Scott MacRae. ``But this park is beautiful and you
can't beat the new clubhouse. It's almost like being in the major
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel Stadium, with its cramped clubhouse, little dugouts and
grandstand ceiling fans, is used now for high school and
junior-college games. But some of the features have made the
two-mile trip to BellSouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke bottles now sit on the top of the new scoreboard, and
the Chattanooga Choo-Choo train engine rolls out from behind a sign
in right-center after each Lookout homer. Looie the Lookout, the
team mascot with the bug eyes, patrols the grandstand and you can
get an in-game haircut in the barber chair near third base.
</P>
<P>
   Third base is as far as the grandstand goes on the left side of
the field. U.S. 27 cuts close to the stadium, with a 42-foot high
screen protecting drivers from batted balls. ``Even with the
screen, it will be a while before I stop worrying about a car
getting hit,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime former Lookouts owner Joe Engel _ a small-town Bill
Veeck _ was a pioneer in minor-league promotions; he gave away a
house before a Depression-era record crowd of 24,839. Engel's
used-car night will come to BellSouth Park, but Burke said the team
will cut back on promotional giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this stadium, we can just sell baseball,'' said Burke,
who was a pitcher at Middlebury College in Vermont. ``That's the
way it should be.''

 &HT;    Nightmares likely, experts say
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The raid that seized Elian Gonzalez from his Miami
relatives was lightning quick and successful, but the boy may
relive it in nightmares, panic attacks and tearful flashbacks,
experts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically he's being kidnapped,'' said child psychologist
Allan Blum, looking at the now-famous photo in which Elian is seen
cowering in a closet before a gun-wielding federal agent. ``The boy
looks absolutely terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needed to be done differently,'' said Blum, a
psychologist who has treated children for over 25 years and taught
at City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though whisked away in an instant, the 6-year-old boy will
probably be reliving the horrific raid for months if not years,
stressed experts. He may face anxiety, depression and not feel safe
in any place, afraid this could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The raid shortly after 5 a.m. was the latest in a series of
unrelenting traumatic events crowded into Elian's short life over
the past five months _ leaving his homeland, being on a boat where
others, including his mother, died, spending days alone adrift, and
then being dragged into a high-profile custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child's sense of safety and security is going to be
shattered,'' said Bruce Blythe, head of the Atlanta-based Crisis
Management Inc., which helps school children overcome traumatic
events such as shootings and bus accidents. ``It could have
lifelong effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Blythe said the image flashed across television screen just
hours after the boy's seizure _ that of Elian smiling with his
father _ is probably genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any 6-year-old who is reunited with his father is going to be
happy. A 6-year-old can't fake a smile like that,'' he said. ``But
that doesn't mean he doesn't have traumatic stress reactions. To a
degree, he's numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differ as to how large the morning raid will loom in
Elian's mind, and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Figley, director of the Traumatology Institute at
Florida State University, said children do not typically see the
world realistically, and thus the federal agent with the automatic
rifle was like a character in a story, not a true figure of menace.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said much was done to soothe the child during the
frenzy of the early morning raid. The boy was told: ``This may seem
very scary. It will soon be better.'' He was being taken to
``Papa.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane that brought him to his father also carried the
Spanish-speaking female agent who carried Elian from the house, a
psychiatrist, a flight surgeon and the immigration agent who
commanded the operation. He was given toys, Play-Doh, a toy
airplane, a map, a watch.
</P>
<P>
   He may be reuniting with his father, but he is being ripped from
a doting home where he felt safe, which several experts felt could
also traumatize him.
</P>
<P>
   He needs a stable, nurturing environment, and those caring for
Elian need to watch for symptoms such as nightmares, panic attacks
and flashbacks, said Cooksey.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those interviewed held out hope that the relatives
who had fought so hard to keep Elian would now help to smooth the
transition to his father's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be another loss for him,'' emphasized Blum. ``But
the loss, without further contact with his Miami relatives, could
be even worse.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Voters forgetting candidates' positions, poll
shows
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
have wrapped up their parties' nominations, it appears voters are
forgetting what they had learned about the presidential candidates.
Voters are now less familiar with where candidates stand on issues
than they were two months ago, according to a poll released Friday
by the Joan Shorestein Center on the Press, Politics and Public
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One might expect citizens to become better informed as the
campaign progresses toward November, but that's not what's
happening,'' said Thomas Patterson, a professor at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government and co-director of the Vanishing
Voter Project, which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples include: after February's New Hampshire primary,
24 percent of voters knew that Bush is opposed to mandatory gun
registration. Now that percentage has fallen to 13 percent. The
number of people who knew Gore opposes vouchers _ or using tax
dollars to help parents pay for their children to attend private or
parochial school_ fell from 19 percent to 12 percent. The poll of
1,000 adults has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY PROPAGANDA HEATS UP BETWEEN CAMPS
</P>
<P>
   In the daily propaganda war that takes place behind the scenes,
both presidential candidates Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore are increasingly using news reports as
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   This ``read my clips'' approach to campaigning sometimes
provides a sharp contrast to the way the campaigns treat reporters
from these news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But despite media criticisms of Bush for not granting interviews
to national news organizations, and of Gore for having gone two
months before holding a news conference earlier this week _ that
hasn't stopped either candidate from touting news articles that are
to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent, third-party information has a higher
believability factor,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush.
``That's why campaigns circulate things other people have
written.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got major newspapers doing these stories, it helps
validate what you're doing,'' said Kathleen Begala, a Gore
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH LAYS OFF GORE, FOR THE TIME BEING
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides say the Texas governor is consciously passing up
opportunities to assail Gore in an effort to avoid alienating
voters at this early stage of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not giving in to the Washington temptation to attack, to
go after scandals,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``The
governor is determined to stay focused on policy, not on political
tit for tat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for his part, has been castigating Bush on guns, abortion,
Medicare and tax cuts, among other issues. ``You have two
candidates offering radically different visions for the future,''
said Gore press secretary Chris Lehane. ``I can understand why Bush
might not want to deal with the comparison because he won't fare
well in the comparison ... The public is very good at drawing
distinctions between negative personal attacks and fair
comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN TO HEADLINE FUNDRAISER
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the annual
Prescott Bush dinner May 22 in Stamford, Conn. The Republican
fund-raising event is named for George W. Bush's grandfather, who
was a U.S. senator from Connecticut. State GOP Chairman Chris
DePino said that he was ``extremely pleased that Senator McCain has
agreed to play a major role for Connecticut Republicans,'' and that
``McCain will appear under the banner of Governor Bush,'' the
likely GOP presidential nominee. McCain's candidacy was Bush's only
serious threat during the primary elections.

 &HT;    MIAMI ERUPTS FOLLOWING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEIZURE OF ELIAN
 &HT;    (1200&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuban exiles raged through the streets of Miami's Little
Havana Saturday, burning tires, overturning dumpsters and tangling
with roaming squads of riot-clad police who fired tear gas to quell
the outburst triggered by the pre-dawn removal of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   This is a terrible day,'' said Nancy Milian, 33, a
Cuban-American who joined the crowd on N.W. 27th Avenue. ``I'm
ashamed to be an American. Clinton is definitely leaving a legacy.
Cubans will never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, an uneasy calm fell over the streets, with
most of the demonstrators drifting away from the clashes. A house
fire broke out, but it was unclear if it was connected to the
disturbances. As night fell, a small group of demonstrators _ some
with shirts wrapped around their heads _ climbed on a city bus,
blocked an intersection and set a tire on fire in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Police made at least 140 arrests. Three officers were injured
when a man beat them with a baseball bat, sending two of them to
the hospital in serious condition. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper
was also injured in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning-strike raid to take the boy caught Miami's exiles
completely by surprise. Reporters estimated that only about 30 to
50 demonstrators were outside the house at 5:10 a.m. EST when
several white minivans pulled up to the home on N.W. Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   A team of about one dozen black-clad officers fired a chemical
gas to disperse the crowd, while eight other officers wearing
helmets, flak jackets and carrying semi-automatic weapons battered
open the door of the house and swept inside. They held lawyers and
family members at gunpoint and snatched the boy from the arms of
one of the fisherman who rescued him at sea last Thanksgiving Day,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Elian screaming in English, 'Help me, help me,''' said
Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman, who was standing in a closet with
the boy. ``I just held his head. My God, America, what did you do
</P>
<P>
   to this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer who had been invited into the
home pointed his camera and captured an image that was flashed
around the world within minutes: an agent wearing goggles, a
</P>
<P>
   helmet and bullet-proof vest, and aiming a semi-automatic black
rifle reached out to Dalrymple to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's face wore a look of stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white T-shirt and plaid shorts, wrapped partially in a
sheet, the boy was whisked from the home, crying as a female agent
who spoke Spanish carried him to a waiting van. The textbook-like
operation lasted three minutes with no reported injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was taken to a waiting helicopter about 10 miles away and
flown to Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami, where a doctor
examined him. By 6 a.m. EST, he was put on board a government jet
and flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. He
reportedly played with Play-Dough and other toys on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Elian was reunited with his father, leaving
behind a family devastated by grief and anger and a community
boiling with rage and feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the raid spread like wildfire through Little Havana. By
6:30 a.m. EST, several hundred people milled around the house, some
yelling at reporters, others crying. Faces were etched with rage,
dejection and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to express my anger and hurt,'' said Susana
Ruiz, 43, who stood outside the home, her eyes brimming with tears.
``I hurt for this family. I hurt like you wouldn't believe. I can't
believe what they have done. I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police took no part in the raid, although a top-ranking
officer from the department rode in the lead car of the federal
caravan so that local officers would know the action was
</P>
<P>
   legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Police Chief William O'Brien said he learned of the
impending strike at 4:15 a.m. EST, and for security reasons he told
only a few top assistants. He did not notify Miami Mayor Joe
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, who afterwards lashed out at the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal agents went in as if they were assaulting a military
bunker,'' Carollo said. ``This family is decent, law-abiding
people, and they came in with machine guns and gassing people. This
is America. This is not Cuba or Hitler's old Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Carollo appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he did not notify Carollo out of concerns for the
security of the operation. ``I'm a policeman, not a politician,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the boy was gone, Miami police began
mobilizing, and quickly set up perimeters around an area of about
40 square blocks. By 8 a.m. EST, roaming crowds of demonstrators
began congregating at major intersections.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. EST, sporadic outbursts erupted. Along N.W. 27th
Avenue _ also named ``Unity Boulevard'' _ a crowd of about 50
people set fire to a tire at a major intersection. Men tossed heavy
benches with wooden backs and cement legs into the street. They
overturned newspaper boxes and tossed around trash cans, contents
spewing across the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a team of riot-clad officers raced to the scene
to reinforce the dozen or so officers stationed at the
intersection. The team rode in unmarked sedans, which screeched to
</P>
<P>
   a halt, all four doors flying open and the officers piling out.
</P>
<P>
   Some carried weapons rigged to fire tear gas. Others carried
cans of the chemical, ready to fling them into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One man was in the street, overturning a newspaper box, but ran
as the cars blazed in. An officer chased him down and rolled him to
the ground in a flower bed, pinning him with his knees while
another officer slapped on metal handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the crowd dispersed, most walking south on Unity
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, small caravans of cars _ apparently from homes
inside the perimeter _ crept down the broad boulevard, horns
blaring, passengers waving Cuban flags and yelling as crowds along
the sidewalks cheered. Police cars whisked up behind the caravans,
lights and sirens blazing, moving them out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   News helicopters hovered overhead, filming everything.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbances seemed unorganized and spontaneous, an
outpouring of emotion. Many people walked peacefully, holding flags
or signs, standing on sidewalks and merely watching. Some youths
mugged and danced for television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And most of sprawling Miami-Dade County's 2.5 million residents
went about their normal Saturday business, or stayed in their homes
watching the melee unfold on television. Outside Little Havana,
businesses were open and traffic moved normally.

<P>
   The city's Miami Heat professional basketball team held their
first play-off game of the season at the downtown American Airlines
Arena, tipping off at 12:30 p.m. EST as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles away in Little Havana, chaos roamed in ragged
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts were unpredictable, flaring up all through the
long, hot morning.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:30 a.m. EST, the crowd at N.W. 27th Avenue and Flagler
Street was calmly standing on the four corners of the major
intersection as about 20 police milled around in the middle of the
street. A woman driving a red car stopped in the intersection,
opened her door, stepped out and began yelling at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman walked over and ordered her back into the car.
Within seconds, dozens of protestors surrounded the car, screaming,
``Let her go, let her go!''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers with plastic shields and nightsticks rushed
to the group. An officer grabbed a man in a green shirt who was
screaming and flailing his arms. The crowd surged. People started
running, some being shoved around by the jostling crowd. Two
teen-aged girls cried and screamed as officers brushed them out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A woman on one of the corners threw part of a broken broomstick
in the general direction of the officers and was immediately
wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by four men wearing helmets.
Several officers ran to their cars for gas canisters, while others
with plastic shields formed a line and began pushing the crowd
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the street, officers jammed several men to the ground,
mashing them into the pavement, twisting their arms and cuffing
their wrists. One man was led away with angry red scrapes on his
forehead. Sweating and heaving for breath in the hot sun, he was
led to an old school bus painted white and stenciled with the
words, ``Miami Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the bus was filled with detainees. The windows
were covered with heavy metal mesh. The people inside stamped their
feet and rocked the bus.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks roamed the area, extinguishing the stacks of tires
that protestors set ablaze in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Thick black smoke roiled into the sky, followed at times by
clouds of choking gas fired as officers moved from one hot-spot to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors threw rocks and bottles at police and media crews.
Roaming demonstrators smashed the windows of one television truck.
</P>
<P>
   Two men ran down Unity Boulevard, carrying a large U.S. flag
turned upside down, the Stars and Stripes dragging on the pavement.
Two women carried an U.S. flag tied at the center with a black
band.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman stood off to one side as officers moved toward a
large clump of protestors, holding a bright green sign emblazoned
with one word: ``Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another woman yelled ``assesinos'' ``assassins.'' A man ran
up to a reporter, grabbed his shirt and screamed into his face:
``You better write the truth. You better write that this was murder
here today what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, garbage crews were cleaning up the mess left
by the demonstrators, loading debris into dump trucks and running
street-sweepers along Unity Boulevard. Police maintained their
barricades, still on full alert should new disturbances break out.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7 p.m. EST, about 50 riot-clad officers marched
down N.W. Second Street after protesters reportedly attacked a
television crew from CNN, which has a bureau in Havana. A few
arrests were made, but most people walked quietly away from the
line of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking the media to leave because we can't guarantee
your safety,'' said Miami Police spokesman Carlos Alfaro. ``Some
people in the crowd may perceive some media as in cahoots with
foreign governments.''
</P>
<P>
   All through the crowds that raged earlier in the day, people
carried copies of the famous photograph snapped before dawn as the
riot-clad, gun-toting federal agent reached out for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for this,'' said Hope Kahn, who saw the
photograph for the first time as she stood near Unity Boulevard.
``There was no need to use weapons. He wasn't a drug dealer. He was
a
</P>
<P>
   little boy.''

   MIAMI _ Cuban exiles raged through the streets of Miami's Little
Havana Saturday, burning tires, overturning dumpsters and tangling
with roaming squads of riot-clad police who fired tear gas to quell
the outburst triggered by the pre-dawn removal of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   This is a terrible day,'' said Nancy Milian, 33, a
Cuban-American who joined the crowd on N.W. 27th Avenue. ``I'm
ashamed to be an American. Clinton is definitely leaving a legacy.
Cubans will never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, an uneasy calm fell over the streets, with
most of the demonstrators drifting away from the clashes. A house
fire broke out, but it was unclear if it was connected to the
disturbances. As night fell, a small group of demonstrators _ some
with shirts wrapped around their heads _ climbed on a city bus,
blocked an intersection and set a tire on fire in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Police made at least 140 arrests. Three officers were injured
when a man beat them with a baseball bat, sending two of them to
the hospital in serious condition. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper
was also injured in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning-strike raid to take the boy caught Miami's exiles
completely by surprise. Reporters estimated that only about 30 to
50 demonstrators were outside the house at 5:10 a.m. EST when
several white minivans pulled up to the home on N.W. Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   A team of about one dozen black-clad officers fired a chemical
gas to disperse the crowd, while eight other officers wearing
helmets, flak jackets and carrying semi-automatic weapons battered
open the door of the house and swept inside. They held lawyers and
family members at gunpoint and snatched the boy from the arms of
one of the fisherman who rescued him at sea last Thanksgiving Day,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Elian screaming in English, 'Help me, help me,''' said
Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman, who was standing in a closet with
the boy. ``I just held his head. My God, America, what did you do
</P>
<P>
   to this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer who had been invited into the
home pointed his camera and captured an image that was flashed
around the world within minutes: an agent wearing goggles, a
</P>
<P>
   helmet and bullet-proof vest, and aiming a semi-automatic black
rifle reached out to Dalrymple to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's face wore a look of stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white T-shirt and plaid shorts, wrapped partially in a
sheet, the boy was whisked from the home, crying as a female agent
who spoke Spanish carried him to a waiting van. The textbook-like
operation lasted three minutes with no reported injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was taken to a waiting helicopter about 10 miles away and
flown to Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami, where a doctor
examined him. By 6 a.m. EST, he was put on board a government jet
and flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. He
reportedly played with Play-Dough and other toys on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Elian was reunited with his father, leaving
behind a family devastated by grief and anger and a community
boiling with rage and feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the raid spread like wildfire through Little Havana. By
6:30 a.m. EST, several hundred people milled around the house, some
yelling at reporters, others crying. Faces were etched with rage,
dejection and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to express my anger and hurt,'' said Susana
Ruiz, 43, who stood outside the home, her eyes brimming with tears.
``I hurt for this family. I hurt like you wouldn't believe. I can't
believe what they have done. I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police took no part in the raid, although a top-ranking
officer from the department rode in the lead car of the federal
caravan so that local officers would know the action was
</P>
<P>
   legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Police Chief William O'Brien said he learned of the
impending strike at 4:15 a.m. EST, and for security reasons he told
only a few top assistants. He did not notify Miami Mayor Joe
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, who afterwards lashed out at the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal agents went in as if they were assaulting a military
bunker,'' Carollo said. ``This family is decent, law-abiding
people, and they came in with machine guns and gassing people. This
is America. This is not Cuba or Hitler's old Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Carollo appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he did not notify Carollo out of concerns for the
security of the operation. ``I'm a policeman, not a politician,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the boy was gone, Miami police began
mobilizing, and quickly set up perimeters around an area of about
40 square blocks. By 8 a.m. EST, roaming crowds of demonstrators
began congregating at major intersections.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. EST, sporadic outbursts erupted. Along N.W. 27th
Avenue _ also named ``Unity Boulevard'' _ a crowd of about 50
people set fire to a tire at a major intersection. Men tossed heavy
benches with wooden backs and cement legs into the street. They
overturned newspaper boxes and tossed around trash cans, contents
spewing across the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a team of riot-clad officers raced to the scene

RAPTORS COACH FILES DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST CAMBY
</HEADLINE>
  (REWRITES; ADDS 300 words)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Even against a backdrop of surreal
circumstances that have whirled around the New York Knicks during
the playoffs over the years, Marcus Camby was confronted with
perhaps the most bizarre when he walked into his Larchmont home
Friday night after practice.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend handed him papers detailing a defamation lawsuit
against him that Raptors coach Butch Carter had filed about
critical comments that Camby, one of his former players, had made
about him last week. The papers had been delivered to the house
earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was stunned. Was Carter serious? Was this some sort of
extreme psychological ploy by Carter for the playoffs? Saturday, on
the eve of the Knicks' first-round playoff series against the
Raptors, the team shrugged off the timing and merit of Carter's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly curious,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said Saturday
after the team's last practice in preparation for Game 1 at Madison
Square Garden Sunday afternoon. ``Out of 2 hours and 15 minutes, we
spent 12 seconds addressing it, and 8 seconds of that laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is something psychological to it, but they
don't need to do it. We're the ones who have to adjust to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have lost their last three regular-season games to
Toronto by double-digit margins. Even so, the overnight controversy
was a distraction. Camby declined to comment specifically on the
suit Saturday, but when asked if he would be even more motivated to
play against his former team, he said: ``What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, after several no comments following Toronto's practice
Saturday, responded to a question about the difficulty of winning
such a suit, because the threshold is higher for people in the
public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm seeking is the truth,'' he said. ``There's an extreme
difference between sworn testimony. ...'' He paused a moment before
being prodded to finish the sentence. ``There's a difference
between sworn testimony and what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter claims in the lawsuit, filed in New York state Supreme
Court in White Plains, that he ``has been damaged and suffered
great pain and mental anguish, and has been held up to ridicule and
contempt by his friends, acquaintances and the public'' by Camby's
comments about him last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Camby said that day that before he was traded to the Knicks from
Toronto in June 1998, Carter had promised him that the Raptors
would build their team around him. Still, the trade quickly
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a liar,'' Camby said Wednesday before the Knicks played
their final regular-season game at Boston. ``I don't really like
him. No one likes him and no one wants to play for him. That's the
kind of guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust him. I think a lot of guys don't trust him. He's
just been ratting out people and doing things his way. From what I
hear, a lot of people are mad at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby is not the first player to lash out at his former team.
While league officials had no comment on the lawsuit, Ron Klempner,
an attorney with the National Basketball Players Association,
seemed incredulous over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we see it in black and white, we can't comment on it
because it's such an incredible and unbelievable claim,'' he said.
``Any such claim would be insufficient legally on too many grounds
to even begin counting. I don't think they want to have a precedent
with players starting to sue coaches for coaches' comments about
players.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Saturday, Camby's lawyer, Patrick
Noonan, said: ``This is an absolutely frivolous lawsuit. It appears
that Carter would be better off spending his time getting his team
ready for the playoffs than pursuing these legal shenanigans.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's management might feel the same way. Distancing himself
from the legal issue, Raptors General Manager Glen Grunwald
classified the suit as an ``individual matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become very personal, though. On Thursday, it was
Carter who questioned the timing of Camby's criticism of him _
which came four days before the Raptors would play in the first
playoff series in the franchise's history _ and he reiterated that
complaint Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think there's a lot to be said about timing,'' Carter
said. ``My hat's off to them about the timing of what they did. You
know, we've played against them six or seven or eight times since
the trade and there never was a problem. It was a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd juxtapositions may have just begun. On Sunday, the
plaintiff will be on one end of the sideline, while the defendant
will be on the other. When Camby is on the floor, only the width of
that sideline will separate the two. If Camby were ever inspired to
play on a high level against the Raptors, it would be in this
playoff series. Last year, Camby was the Knicks' energy source
throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotions are good if you channel them the right way,'' Allan
Houston warned. ``I've always been fired up to play in the
playoffs, but that doesn't mean I go out and run around like a
crazed rabbit. You've got to channel it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's legal action against Camby, for $5 million, could be a
detriment to his own team. Raptors players left the gym briskly
Saturday, and only a few addressed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' said Vince Carter, the superstar
forward who has been the bane of the Knicks this season. ``That's
between Butch and Marcus. It's Butch's problem. He can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley, who was traded to Toronto from the Knicks for
Camby, said: ``I haven't got anything to do with that. We'll see
how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lawsuit will go down as another strange twist in a
Knicks playoff run. Over the last four years, there have been
fights with the rival Heat, miracle shots, controversial statements
by Larry Johnson during last year's finals and a string of
suspensions in between. Saturday, the swirl of attention around the
Knicks marked another sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a part of one before, unfortunately,'' Van Gundy
said with a smile. ``I was on someone's leg. I didn't plan that
one, though. I didn't say before the game, `If Larry Johnson and
Alonzo Mourning get in a fistfight, I'm going to go out there and
do what I did.' You know what? I'm not going to judge what others
do. All I care about is the game on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But could any psychological ploy _ if that is part of the motive
behind Carter's lawsuit _ disrupt the Knicks' focus?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know our minds, nothing could throw us out of whack,''
Van Gundy said. ``We're unwhackable. Thank God there were only
three days before the game and not another two days. Let's just
play the game, and I hope that's good enough.''  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Elian Gonzalez was reunited with his father at a
nearby Air Force base Saturday just hours after armed federal
agents seized the Cuban shipwreck survivor from a closet in his
Miami relatives's home in a three-minute predawn raid ordered by
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But the reunion of Elian and Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not end
the ferocious tug-of-war over the 6-year-old castaway, now elevated
to icon status on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   The distraught relatives from whom the child was taken earlier
in the day arrived Saturday evening at Andrews Air Force Base
demanding to see Elian once again. They were accompanied by Sen.
Bob Smith, R-N.H., a leading critic of the federal government's
efforts to reunite the child with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   However, the relatives were denied admission to the base, a top
security facility where the president's fleet of aircraft is
housed. They did not say how long they would be in the Washington
area, or whether they would make another attempt to see the father
and son.
</P>
<P>
   Influential Washington attorney Greg Craig, who represents Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, had discouraged the Miami relatives from making
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of Elian triggered an outpouring of anger in the
Little Havana area of Miami, where much of the heart-tugging
international drama has unfolded over the five months since Elian
was rescued at sea, having lost his mother in a desperate attempt
to flee Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian and his father celebrated their reunion at the air
base, Cuban Americans took their anger into the streets of Miami,
waving Cuban flags, setting fires, throwing rocks and bottles and,
in one instance, punching a police officer. One protester also
tried to burn an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, with the sun setting on the famous resort
city, a heavy force of Miami police moved into the streets with
tear gas as local officials pleaded for calm. Some of the
protesters accused the media of sympathizing with Castro, and riot
police warned reporters of possible violence directed at them.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters, some waving American flags, also gathered
at the gates of Andrews, which is located in the Maryland suburbs
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Craig released photographs of a smiling Elian with his father,
stepmother and baby brother at their reunion. The photos contrasted
sharply with the news images earlier in the day of federal agents
removing the screaming boy from the Miami home of his great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be very happy to be back with his father,'' Craig
said. ``It is amazing how quickly that bond re-established itself.
It was almost instantaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent corroboration of Craig's account of the
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Fidel Castro led a rally of jubilant Cubans. State
television used U.S. television networks's footage to provide
blow-by-blow coverage. The Cuban government called the events ``a
favorable movement,'' but cautioned that ``the need to fight for
Elian has not ended'' because of pending legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father are expected to remain in the United States
until a federal appeals court decides whether he can be returned to
Cuba. He and his family will live at an undisclosed location in the
Washington, D.C. area after spending a few days at Andrews,
according to federal immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives lost a U.S. District Court battle to get
a political asylum hearing for the boy. An appeals court has
ordered Elian to stay in this country until it decides that case.
But it did not bar Reno from switching custody. A hearing is set
for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all await the outcome of the appellate process, I think
it is important for us all to accept Elian's long-overdue reunion
with his father,'' Reno said during a Saturday morning news
conference at the Justice Department. ``It is time to heal wounds
that have divided a community. It is time to help this little boy
heal from the tragedies that he has experienced. Let us give him
and his father the space, the calm, the moral support they need to
reconnect and reaffirm their bond between father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic images of the frantic and forceful removal of
Elian from his relatives' home in Miami following the collapse of
negotiations for a voluntarily surrender of the child to his father
did nothing to promote peace. Neither did the fiery political
rhetoric triggered by the surprise Easter weekend events.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, in a round of television appearances,
denounced the federal agents as ``thugs'' and ``atheists,'' called
their actions ``a crime'' and declared that he ``could not trust
our government any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas called the seizure of
Elian a ``police-state-type raid'' by the Clinton administration.
And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said, ``My
first thought was that this could only happen in Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The events in Miami also reverberated in the American
presidential campaign, with Vice President Al Gore distancing
himself from the administration's actions and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, questioning the
administration's claim that it had no alternative but to reunite
Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said, I believe this issue should have been handled
through a family court and with the family coming together,'' Gore
said in a brief statement released by his campaign office in
Nashville rather than his vice presidential office at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``All sides have claimed to be acting in Elian's best
interest, but surely no one can argue that taking a young boy at
gunpoint is in his best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's statement echoes the claims made by Elian's Miami
relatives that the boy was taken at gunpoint by the eight federal
agents who rushed into their home shortly after 5 a.m. EST
Saturday. An emotional Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's 21-year-old
cousin and primary caregiver, claimed that agents had placed a gun
to Elian's head at one point during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters brandished copies of a news photograph showing a
federal agent wearing green riot gear, a helmet and goggles and
carrying an automatic rifle as he confronts a man clutching a
frightened Elian in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The man holding Elian in the photograph is Donato Dalrymple, one
of the fishermen who rescued Elian last Thanksgiving Day from an
inner tube in the open Atlantic Ocean an incredible 48 hours after
a crowded boat carrying him and his mother capsized. His mother and
10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, at her news conference, said the ``paramount concern''
throughout the operation was ``the well-being of Elian'' and ``the
safety of the agents and others.'' She noted that law enforcement
officers ``must be prepared for the unexpected,'' but insisted that
the photograph of the agent confronting Dalrymple was proof of the
caution with which the raid was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the beauties of television is that it shows exactly
what the facts are,'' Reno said. ``And as I understand it, if you
look at it (the photograph) carefully, it shows that the gun was
pointed to the side, and that the finger was not on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ordered the boy taken from the relatives who have
cared for him since his rescue at sea because they had rejected her
latest proposal for surrendering the child to his father. ``The
Miami relatives rejected our efforts, leaving us no other option
but the enforcement action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that had been under discussion called for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez and Elian, Lazaro and Marisleysis to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington, with formal
custody being transferred immediately to the father. The two sides
could not agree on the custody issue or how long they might live
together pending the end of the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations collapsed, armed federal agents arrived in
white minivans at the Little Havana home of Lazaro Gonzalez,
entered the house and removed Elian, all in about three minutes. As
the van carrying Elian departed, agents used pepper spray to
prevent protesters from approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was carried out of the home by a Spanish-speaking female
agent who had informed him that he was to be reunited with his
``papa,'' that he would not be going back to Cuba and that he would
not be placed in a boat.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was briefed through the night on the
Justice Department's plans, told reporters at the White House
Saturday that he supported the decision to use federal agents to
reunite Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the decisions that were made ... and I believe that
it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. He credited Reno with
exploring ``every conceivable alternative'' before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was, in the end, about a little boy who lost his mother
and has not seen his father in more than five months,'' the
president said. ``I hope, with time and support, Elian and his
father will have the opportunity to be a strong family again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case of Elian Gonzalez is far from ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's miraculous rescue from the sea took on Biblical
dimensions to some of the hundreds of Cuban Americans who have
surrounded the boy's Little Havana home in recent weeks. He has
even been compared to Moses, who, according to Jewish and Christian
faiths, led the children of Israel from bondage in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   And the timing of the raid, on Holy Saturday, or the Angelic
Night, a time of sadness and joy for Christians, led some
protesters to compare the events to the crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like crucifying the Messiah all over again,'' said
Ralph Anrrich(CQ), a social worker helping Elian's Miami relatives
Saturday. ``This is a slap in the face to the Cuban-American
community and the Christian community.''

PARK IN LIMBO AFTER DEVELOPING BLISTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ A day after stabilizing the starting rotation,
again there is concern. This time it centers around Chan Ho Park,
whose next start is in question because of a bad blood blister on
the middle finger of his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   The blister is about the size of a dime in the middle of the
fingerprint on the middle finger of his right hand. It knocked Park
out of his start Saturday after five innings despite his
pitch-count being low and the Dodgers well on their way to a 16-2
rout of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drained the blister and took some of the skin off,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I'm hopeful it will heal in
time and he won't miss a start, but I believe he'll probably miss a
start. That's very critical to his pitching. It was a huge blood
blister.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Park, who recorded his 50th career win, said he plans
on starting Thursday in Atlanta. He's hoping to either skip or push
back his day to throw in the bullpen in an effort to have the
finger heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think I'll miss a start,'' said Park, who improved
to 3-1 with a 3.38 ERA. ``It was hard to grip the fastball and
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems an annual ritual for Park to be afflicted with a
blister, but this is in a worse area. Usually, blisters are on the
side of the finger and cause problems on certain pitches. Park's
blister is in the middle of the finger, and Dodgers physical
therapist Pat Screnar said it's ``almost unavoidable'' not to have
the ball touch the blister area on every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Park actually tore the blister in the fourth inning, but Dodgers
trainer Stan Johnston treated the finger and Park, despite the
pain, finished the inning and then completed the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   If Park can't go, Orel Hershiser could slide into the spot.
Hershiser was sent to the bullpen Friday to make room for Kevin
Brown's return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Park) is going to get every kind of treatment he can get to
make him available, but I can't see him throwing on the side so
we'll have to see what happens,'' Johnson said. ``I hope he's not
going to be too bad. Between pickle juice and everything, hopefully
it'll toughen him up.''
</P>
<P>
   BROWN'S PEN PLEASING: Brown could take the final step toward his
return with a successful bullpen session and batting practice
today. He threw in the bullpen Saturday for the first time since
breaking his right pinkie April 8 trying to bunt in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Brown will throw again today in the bullpen before an official
decision is made, but barring an unforeseen setback he is slated to
be activated and pitch Tuesday in Atlanta against Tom Glavine and
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's there, but I don't think it's bad,'' Brown said.
``Just a matter between today and tomorrow getting a little work
in, trying to get a feel for everything: the ball, a release point
and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the swelling in his pinkie would probably exist for a
few more weeks, but since he doesn't use the finger much when
pitching it shouldn't be a huge distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect his stuff,'' said Davey Johnson. ``He was
nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   GOGGLE-EYED GAGNE: Johnson occasionally jokes about the
goggles-looking glasses that right-hander Eric Gagne wears when he
pitches, but he better get used to it. Gagne's thinking about
getting the corrective laser surgery, but he's years away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get that until your vision stops changing,'' Gagne,
24, said. ``My eyes get worse every week. I need new glasses every
three or four months.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Catcher Todd Hundley needed a triple to complete
the cycle Friday. In other words, he had no prayer. ``Triple wasn't
going to happen. No way,'' Hundley said. ``They (the outfielders)
would have had to fall down or die. Just ain't going to happen.''
Hundley's last triple was in 1997. ... Right-hander Alan Mills
walked with the bases loaded in the ninth inning for the first RBI
of his nine-year major-league career. ... F.P. Santangelo's two-run
single in the ninth was his first hit as a Dodger, breaking an 0
for 13 drought. &QL;

   MIAMI _ As President Clinton told the nation Saturday morning
that ``the law has been upheld,'' Lazaro Gonzalez was too
despondent to watch the large-screen TV in his Little Havana house,
where the upholding of the law was carried out before dawn with the
battering ram and brandished weapons of federal agents in riot
gear.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton was asked a question about the use of force to seize
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from his great-uncle's house, jeers arose
from the group of about a dozen people in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   But not from Lazaro Gonzalez. The great-uncle, for months an
outspoken proponent of keeping the boy in the U.S., was silent. He
walked through his house with eyes downcast and shoulders slumped.
</P>
<P>
   The despair inside the house was shared by many of the
demonstrators immediately outside in the first hours after the 5:10
a.m. raid. At first, there was a noticeable difference between the
subdued mood around the house and the angrier, more destructive
protests a few blocks away. The distinction was blurred by early
evening, however, as demonstrators attacked a CNN tent outside the
house and about 200 police officers arrived to clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of the crowd seemed heightened by the fact that
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents had acted so quickly
and efficiently in taking Elian. The few demonstrators outside the
house at the time mounted little resistance. When the white
minivans arrived, perhaps 50 protesters were there.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Goudie was one of them. A member of a prayer group called
Women Against Repression, she said she ran to alert friends when
she saw the commotion outside Lazaro Gonzalez's house. They tried
to form a ``prayer chain,'' Goudie said, but ``they threw us to the
ground and started pepper-gassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goudie said she looked up to see a law enforcement officer
aiming a gun at her and saying ``No te muevas porque la dejo ir'' _
Don't move because I'll let it go.
</P>
<P>
   As she remained still, Goudie said, she saw Elian leaving the
house, carried by a female agent and partially swaddled in a
blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Elian had been removed from the neighborhood did
larger crowds gather.
</P>
<P>
   Within 90 minutes, several hundred people milled around the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to express my anger and hurt,'' said Susana
Ruiz, 43, eyes brimming with tears. ``I hurt for this family. I
hurt like you wouldn't believe. I can't believe what they have
done. I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The still photograph of a goggled and helmeted federal agent
pointing an automatic rifle toward Elian and family friend Donato
Dalrymple was soon displayed on demonstrators' placards with the
words ``Federal Child Abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who pulled Elian from the ocean
last Thanksgiving, urged a crowd of about 300 in front of the
Gonzalez home to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask in the name of Elian, let's keep peace in Miami,''
Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone listened.
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ``to the streets'' arose from many in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters pounded on the hood of a patrol car, forcing the
sergeant to flee in reverse gear. The same thing happened when a
city fire-rescue car tried to cross the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Police retreated after filling a bus with arrestees.
</P>
<P>
   With no police in sight, demonstrators set tires and dumpsters
ablaze and tossed newspaper racks into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Police returned to the area within 30 minutes carrying shields
and batons and shooting tear gas cannisters into the crowd to
reclaim the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an abuse of the Latin people,'' Xiomara Quintana screamed
as the tear gas drove the crowd away. ``I'm angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The street violence appeared to be instigated by no more than
three dozen young men who wrapped shirts around the faces to
conceal their identities. One of them yelled, ``Viva la revolucion,
(Long live the revolution.), a slogan most often associated with
supporters of Castro. Bystanders said the youths were members of
street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not gang members,'' insisted one youth whose face was
masked by his shirt. ``The government is turning us into
terrorists.'' The man refused to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd was pushed farther back, a white truck filled with
used auto tires drove by slowly, giving the youths an opportunity
to grab tires from the truck. About a dozen were tossed into a pile
and set on fire in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to create trouble,'' said Alex Fernandez, a
Cuban-American who emerged from his apartment on the street to see
the chaos. ``But this is what they are going to put on the evening
news and all Cubans will be blamed for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another exile, Ramon Cisneros, said he didn't agree with the
disorder but said he understood why his fellow exiles are angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very frustrated because we had trusted in the laws and
the human rights in this country,'' said Cisneros, 55, who had
ducked into a Walgreens to buy poster board for a protest sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approve of burning tires, but we have the right of a
protest'' said Alejandro Ramirez, 33, a Cuban American engineer who
said he left Cuba five years ago and will become an American
citizen next month. ``We are just using the tools that people in a
democracy use.''
</P>
<P>
   In the street, people carried copies of the Associated Press
photograph showing an armed federal agent grabbing Elian. Some had
already made T-shirts with the photograph, accompanied by a photo
of Janet Reno and a swastika.
</P>
<P>
   The same photo was on the front page of an special edition of El
Neuvo Herald, The Miami Herald's Spanish-language daily, under a
banner headline reading: What a shame!
</P>
<P>
   Several standing outside the home were overcome by emotions,
tears streaming down their pained faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``God please help Elian,'' a young woman cried as she looked up
at the sky. The woman, Lisette Soler, said the early morning raid
will traumatize Elian for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Miami Mayor Joe Carollo appealed to residents
to obey the law, ``no matter how much our hearts ache. That is the
best way we can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said that 180 people had been arrested during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the Miami Beach nun who fought to keep
Elian in the United States, said the community should pull
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough pain has been done, enough sorrow has been spread,''
she said.

ATLANTA FANS SEEM TO BE OFF THEIR ROCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Tuesday, the Dodgers get to play in front of the
most disgusting, vile fans in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's a day (ital)after(endital) they can take the No.7 train to
Shea Stadium. After a brief stop Monday in New York, the Dodgers
head to Turner Field _ a place where they applaud racist comments
and have no qualms about cheering mightily for a guy who bashed
nearly every facet of human existence that isn't similar to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad John Rocker didn't get traded to Montreal. The
irony of him playing, and working, in another country would have
been tremendous. Of course, the Montreal players were too appalled
by his words to want him around, so they made signs and passed them
around the clubhouse in protest of the move.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about the situation is Rocker seemingly hasn't
learned a darn thing from it, and those who stand and cheer him for
it are no better. The Dodgers will experience it first-hand Tuesday
when they begin a three-game series in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But the remorseless Rocker isn't even willing to distance
himself from the disparaging comments he made about immigrants,
gays and minorities. Instead, he invites more scrutiny and more
disgust from his actions.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with Fox Sports Net after the Braves' game
Thursday, Rocker ripped the media for not being sensitive toward
his privacy, stemming from his ultra-insensitive comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of instances over the last three or four
months when the media has been completely oblivious of my privacy
and my family'sprivacy,'' Rocker said. ``They've overstepped their
bounds in a lot of areas. It's time for a little payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to be able to treat me the way they've
treated me and get me to jump at their every whim and do every
little interview theywant me to do. There were news trucks sitting
outside my house at 1 in the morning on Christmas Eve. I don't
think I deserve that kind of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. And all the people Rocker painted with his racist brush
should be subjected to his uneducated ranting.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's tried to paint himself as the martyr, but that's
nothing more than a defense mechanism to change the focus. He's
gone out of his way to be obnoxious, saying ``Beat it, media. I'm
not talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker's view is he's served his penalty, a two-week
suspension handed down from Major League Baseball. What he's
missing is an education on the various cultures that make up this
country, and his clubhouse. In Montreal, new owner Jeff Loria
decorated the clubhouse with flags representing the countries each
player is from.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what flag Rocker would choose?
</P>
<P>
   It's simple to blame the media, and in many situations
boundaries are crossed. But don't let that cloud the issue of
ignorance and racism, at least in the comments.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a situation about which very few people want to
speak. Instead, nearly everyone is distancing themselves from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem to put it out very well,'' said Phillies
manager TerryFrancona, whose club was the first to face Rocker when
the suspension ended. ``His apologies were kind of left-handed. I
don't know if they were to the point where people were willing to
let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not about Rocker's alleged half-hearted apology. It's about
his actions after the situation. He met with teammates, who are
still trying to back away from the situation, and he expected it to
end there. Yet, he continues to draw attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   People make mistakes. But they're supposed to learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Rocker was an upstanding citizen for the last four
months, it'snot enough time to make one think his beliefs have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when Rocker continues to get cheered from events
stemming from his stupid, callous remarks, it makes it that much
more difficult for him to understand how much his words can hurt. &QL;

DMITRI YOUNG FINDING RIGHT MINDSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball never seemed like a kids' game to Dmitri Young.
Football, maybe, but not baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the sport Young begged his dad to let him play when
he was too big to play on youth football teams. Although his skills
often allowed Young to compete against older players, he learned
that size and power are not all he needed to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Young was playing professionally by the time he was 17. The more
the Cincinnati Reds outfielder plays the game, the more emphasis he
places on his early realization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I signed and worked my way up, I came to find this game
is more and more mental,'' Young said. ``The talent that you
display in high school is what got you drafted. The same talent you
display while you're in the minor leagues gets you to the big
leagues. And the same talent you display to get to the big leagues
keeps you there, but the mental part is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The talent that got Young, 26, where he is was developed through
hours of work with his father Larry, who said he knew little about
the sport until Dmitri wanted to play. Larry wanted Dmitri to try
karate, but Dmitri cried at the idea, so Larry studied baseball and
sought help from coaches so his oldest son was taught properly.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline was a must in the Young family, and it's something
Dmitri tries to pass to brother Delmon, who is living up to high
expectations as a freshman at Camarillo (Calif.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young was a first-round draft pick _ fourth overall _ by
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1991 after earning All-America honors as
a senior at Rio Mesa High of Oxnard, Calif., where he set several
state batting records. The 6-foot-2, 235-pound switch-hitter, who
is in his fourth full season in the majors, won the American
Association Triple-A batting title in 1996 and has hit at least
.300 the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Young entered this weekend's series against the Dodgers hitting
just .211, but he doesn't dwell on stats.
</P>
<P>
   He studies the opposition to learn players' tendencies and what
he should expect to have to do, but he realizes he can only control
his own actions. Not worrying about things out of his control like
whether or not he's going to play, or where he's playing help Young
stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental preparation is a big part of the game and he does it
well,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Coping with things like travel, the media, fans and being away
from family are as vital as what happens on the field, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much to deal with on an everyday basis, people
can't even begin to understand or realize,'' he said. ``There's a
general appreciation. Every ballplayer looks at each other like, `I
know, you're doing it.' It's hard being up here every day, the
everyday grind. That's why they say when you get to the big
leagues, it's 90 percent mental and 10 percent physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical part is what got you to the big leagues. The
mental part is what keeps you there. You swing a bat, that's
physical. You catch a ball, that's physical. ... The mental part is
the strategy part of the game and everything surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot behind this game. It's a kids' game at the
beginning, but it's just like checkers and chess.'' &QL;

 &HT;    EDs: updates with Miami family attempting to see Elian, Juan
Miguel . . .
 &HT;    ELIAN, JUAN MIGUEL REUNITED AT ANDREWS AFB
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. _ After five months of separation,
young Elian Gonzalez was reunited Saturday morning with his father,
Juan Miguel, at this closed air force base outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Delivered here about 9:20 a.m. EST on a government plane after
being forcefully removed from his Miami relatives' home four hours
earlier, Elian spent the day in private on the base with his
father, step-mother, Nersy, and baby brother, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's cousin and primary caregiver in Miami, Marisleysis
Gonzalez, and other Miami relatives followed the boy Saturday
afternoon, arriving on an American Airlines flight into
Washington-Reagan National Airport. They had hoped to visit with
the father and boy at Andrews, but Juan Miguel Gonzalez refused to
allow them to see Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The family arrived in the Washington area, and promptly drove to
Capitol Hill to meet with Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who has been
sympathetic to their efforts to keep the boy here in the United
States. Smith then escorted them to Andrews in a minivan, but they
were turned away at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The family attempted to hold a news conference at a hotel across
the street, but were visibly shaken by hundreds of reporters and
protesters as they got out of the minivan. They climbed back into
the minivan without speaking to the crowd about their plans while
in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Juan Miguel's lawyer, Gregory Craig, praised U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno for going the ``extra mile'' to get
Elian and his immediate family together. In a telephone interview
aired on CNN, Craig said Elian appeared relaxed and happy in his
father's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally at ease,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph released by Craig showed a smiling Elian being held
by his beaming father and surrounded by Nersy and baby Hianny. A
second picture showed Elian again smiling, and playing with Hianny.
</P>

REDS TRYING TO IMPROVE GRIFFEY JR.'S SWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ So you thought Ken Griffey Jr. had the perfect
swing, something that doesn't need tinkering and will always be
true? Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to leave greatness alone, the Cincinnati Reds are
making alterations to the swing that made Griffey the youngest
player in baseball history to hit 400 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to shorten his swing a little,'' said Ken Griffey
Sr., the Reds' hitting coach. ``The National League is a little
different from the American League. In the AL, he saw a lot more
breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's seeing more fastballs in this league. He's been a little
late on his swing, and they're jamming him. Once he gets his hands
through the ball and on top of the ball, it's the same swing. With
quicker hands, he won't get jammed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it'll work out for Griffey and the Reds. But in
the short term, it's not going as planned. Griffey leads Cincinnati
with five homers and 18 RBI, but the career .298 hitter is batting
a paltry .203.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds, a close friend of
Griffey's, said not to underestimate the pressure of returning to
play at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a lot of pressure,'' Bonds said of leaving Pittsburgh
for the Bay. ``It was just a lucky year (in '93). It's tough to
come back to your home town. It's not that easy. Kenny will be
fine, though. Kenny's a great ballplayer. If Kenny's happy, that's
all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's had great years his whole career. I don't see any
reason why he won't now. I went from one National League team to
another. It's a big difference. I already knew all the pitchers.
He's going from the American League to the National League. That's
another change for him that I never had to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   GWYNN RETURNS: San Diego's Tony Gwynn returned to the Padres
lineup Wednesday after missing seven games, which equates to about
30 plate appearances, with elbow and knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Padres are glad to have him back in the lineup,
but there is a personal issue at stake for Gwynn. He signed a
contract extension in the spring in which he'll be paid $6 million
next season. It's an option extension that the club can pick up at
any time. The contract vests if Gwynn reaches 502 plate
appearances, but it's not a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Due to injuries, Gwynn hasn't amassed 502 plate appearances
since 1997. He's reached the mark twice since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   BOHANON TRADE BAIT: Brian Bohanon, the former Dodger who won 12
games last season, is on the trading block in Colorado after being
sent to the bullpen. He lost 20 pounds during the offseason and
weighs 250 and is finally pitching without pain after being
bothered by bone chips last season, but it hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   He's allowed 21 hits in 10 innings, has a 15.68 ERA and was
banished to the Rockies bullpen after three starts. General manager
Dan O'Dowd is trying to move Bohanon, set to make $5 million in
2000 and 2001, for another starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this is (going to the bullpen), just to get myself
right,'' Bohanon said. ``Its been a combination of a little bit of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Arizona had no Matt Mantei and no Matt Williams
for the first two weeks of the season, but the Diamondbacks still
have the best record in the National League. Mike Morgan has three
saves, but gave the closer role back Friday to Mantei. Meanwhile,
Williams had the stitches taken out of his foot and is walking with
a cast. ... Atlanta right-hander John Smoltz, who had elbow surgery
four weeks ago, is still months away from picking up a ball, but
he's surprised how good he feels. ``I have no reason to be ahead of
schedule, but in my head I am,'' Smoltz said. ... Cubs righty Kerry
Wood was 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA for Single-A Daytona and general
manager Ed Lynch said it's almost time. ``I'd say he's getting
very, very close,'' the GM said. ... Phillies righty Curt Schilling
is eyeing an April 30 return date. ... The Padres solved the case
of the missing batting cage. A club employee thought it was an
extra one and gave it to a local high school, St. Augustine. &QL;

 &HT;    EDs: updates with Miami family attempting to see Elian, Juan
Miguel . . .
 &HT;    ELIAN, JUAN MIGUEL REUNITED AT ANDREWS AFB
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0423.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. _ After five months of separation,
young Elian Gonzalez was reunited Saturday morning with his father,
Juan Miguel, at this closed air force base outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Delivered here about 9:20 a.m. EST on a government plane after
being forcefully removed from his Miami relatives' home four hours
earlier, Elian spent the day in private on the base with his
father, step-mother, Nersy, and baby brother, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's cousin and primary caregiver in Miami, Marisleysis
Gonzalez, and other Miami relatives followed the boy Saturday
afternoon, arriving on an American Airlines flight into
Washington-Reagan National Airport. They had hoped to visit with
the father and boy at Andrews, but Juan Miguel Gonzalez refused to
allow them to see Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The family arrived in the Washington area, and promptly drove to
Capitol Hill to meet with Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who has been
sympathetic to their efforts to keep the boy here in the United
States. Smith then escorted them to Andrews in a minivan, but they
were turned away at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The family attempted to hold a news conference at a hotel across
the street, but were visibly shaken by hundreds of reporters and
protesters as they got out of the minivan. They climbed back into
the minivan without speaking to the crowd about their plans while
in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Juan Miguel's lawyer, Gregory Craig, praised U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno for going the ``extra mile'' to get
Elian and his immediate family together. In a telephone interview
aired on CNN, Craig said Elian appeared relaxed and happy in his
father's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally at ease,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph released by Craig showed a smiling Elian being held
by his beaming father and surrounded by Nersy and baby Hianny. A
second picture showed Elian again smiling, and playing with Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   The hordes of media reporters, who were banned from the air
force base, congregated outside the main gate _ along with dozens
of protesters carrying rosaries and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am incensed . . . that a child could be taken in this way,''
said Ivette Curros, a Cuban-American immigrant and Miami resident
who was in the Washington D.C.-area en route to a convention in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Curros said she came to the base to protest the federal
government's effort to reunite the boy with his father, who plans
to return to communist Cuba following the current appeals process
in federal courts. ``I thank God every day that my mother risked
her life to come to this country,'' she said, adding that Elian,
whose mother died trying to reach the United States, should not be
returned to Cuba.

<P>

Washington area, agreed, saying the removal of Elian from the Miami
home was ``a stab in the back'' of the Cuban-American community.

FINLEY SAYS ANGELS LOST PROFESSIONALISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ When Chuck Finley decided to sign with
the Cleveland Indians this past winter, leaving the Angels after 14
years, many figured it had a lot to do with money.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians offered $27 million for three years, and the Angels'
budget wouldn't allow such an investment.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with Baseball Weekly, Finley says it wasn't
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things last year that told me, late in the
season, that it was time to move on,'' Finley said. ``I looked
around and there was nobody I recognized anymore. Year in, year
out, the injuries kept pecking away. You'd look up and go, `Well,
we lost this guy. The team's been through this before. I know
exactly what's going to happen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to fix it with this and that, but the tape comes off,
the wire breaks and the glue dries up. The main thing, though, was
that I thought the team had lost its professionalism. You can get
over losing talent _ guys getting hurt _ but when you have a group
of individuals who start losing their professionalism then that's
when you've got to really look at the situation and say, `Well,
where am I at?' It was taking pride in the pregame dressing, being
on time, the dress code, small things like that. It got pretty bad
(with) guys bitching at each other through the paper, which is
totally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Finley's comments is that this year's clubhouse,
run by manager Mike Scioscia, is as professional and workmanlike as
any in the league, according to many of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Finley's choice of the Indians is that Finley
wants to go to a World Series, and he got tired of seeing former
teammates of his get there without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play this game for the right reasons, that's all you
want,'' he said. ``(I would) flip on the TV and the World Series
would be on and there would be guys I played with. You go, `Geez. I
just watched five or six guys from my team go the World Series'
Devon White, (Dick) Schofield, Chili Davis. Jorge Fabregas was in
the World Series this year with Atlanta. You just want that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBERING DOC: Scioscia had a flashback of sorts when his team
played the Devil Rays on Friday. On the mound for Tampa Bay was
35-year-old Dwight Gooden, whom Scioscia faced as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Scioscia's most memorable moment involving Gooden was
his home run against him in the ninth inning of Game 4 of the 1988
NLCS. That tied the game the Dodgers would win, helping them win
the series and eventually the World Series. Gooden was 23 then and
one of the most dominating pitchers in baseball. Now, Gooden is
just trying to hang on and extend his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him when he was 19 years old,'' Scioscia said.
``Obviously, he doesn't have the same stuff, but he's going to
battle you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden won his first start this season against the Tigers, but
the Angels got him for six runs in four-plus innings. Gooden, a
Tampa native, had 34 friends and family members in the crowd. His
14-year-old son, Dwight Jr., served as the Devil Rays' batboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would have liked to have pitched better,'' Gooden
said. ``But, with everything that has happened in my career on and
off the field to still get to pitch in front of my family and
friends, nothing can take that away.''
</P>
<P>
   THE RAP ON RAP: Chad Curtis and Royce Clayton of the Rangers got
into shoving match last week after Curtis was offended by the
explicit lyrics in the rap music Clayton was playing on the
clubhouse stereo. But the Rangers downplayed the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's our job to make sure those things don't come
to a head and cause a disruption,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``But maybe it's good that there's a little spark in
the clubhouse. We knew with some of the new guys coming in, there
would be some new energy in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis caused a stir with the Yankees last season when he got
into a dispute with shortstop Derek Jeter. Curtis was upset with
Jeter because Jeter joked and laughed with Mariners shortstop Alex
Rodriguez during a fight between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Last week, we posed the following question to Albert
Belle on his Web site at athletesdirect.com: ``Just because a few
writers wrote something about you that you didn't like, does that
mean you should boycott all reporters?'' He did not respond in this
week's edition of ``Ask Albert.'' ... Word is that Mariners
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, a free agent at the end of the season,
will sign with either the Dodgers or Mets. The Braves also are
expected to make a strong bid. &QL;

COWBOYS LINEBACKER NGUYEN IN POSITION TO START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The first Vietnamese-American to play in the
National Football League is on the verge of becoming the first
Vietnamese-American to start in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Dat Nguyen will get his first look as the Cowboys' starting
middle linebacker during minicamp Friday through next Sunday at
Valley Ranch. The first of the two camps will be followed by the
first of two quarterback schools May 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, the 1998 Lombardi Trophy winner from Texas A&AMP;M, played
mostly in nickel packages and special teams for the Cowboys as a
rookie last season. He doesn't exactly measure up to NFL standards
for a middle linebacker at 5-foot-11, 231 pounds. One exception is
Zach Thomas (5-11, 235), who is working on a five-year, $22.5
million contract as the perennial leading tackler for the Miami
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys may have some trepidation about their overall lack
of size and depth at linebacker, but Nguyen is considered nothing
less than Randall Godfrey's successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted Dat to start,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said,
``and now he's getting his opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to the Cowboys from a business standpoint. In
February, Godfrey signed a five-year. $25 million contract,
including a $5 million signing bonus, as an unrestricted free agent
to play for the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, a third-round pick in 1999, will play this season for a
$250,000 base salary, while counting a modest $366,7000 against the
Cowboys' salary cap. He received a $350,000 signing bonus a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics look at the Cowboys' starting linebackers and wonder
how the team can afford to play both Nguyen and weakside starter
Dexter Coakley (5-10, 228) in the base defense, even though Coakley
made the Pro Bowl last season, his third year in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really doesn't bother me,'' Campo said. ``I'm a big
proponent of speed. And I think you always move your front four
around to create some different looks. Sure, physically (at
linebacker), there may be a problem at times. But in my opinion,
all that will be overcome by instinctiveness and speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum sees Nguyen moving up the NFL ladder
because he has a knack at achieving the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dat is so alert, so instinctive,'' said Slocum, recalling
Nguyen's many College Station accomplishments that were
Bunyanesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an onside kick once. You're just hoping somebody falls
on the ball ... but Dat picked it up and ran for a touchdown,''
Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   Campo argues that Nguyen isn't small; he's just short by NFL
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's disadvantage comes in locating the ball at the line of
scrimmage amid so many bigger bodies on both lines. He also has
tremendous lower-body strength and puts himself in good positions
to make the tackle. And once in the open field, Nguyen is adept at
swatting the ball loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys might add a linebacker through free agency after
June 1. Philadelphia and Seattle have released William Thomas and
ex-Cowboy Darrin Smith (1993-96), respectively, and both would
interest the Cowboys at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bowden, who started at outside linebacker for the Super Bowl
Titans, is an unrestricted free agent who faces a numbers crunch in
Tennessee. The Titans drafted three linebackers, including
Syracuse's Keith Bulluck in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel very good about our starting linebackers,'' Campo
said of Coakley, Nguyen and Darren Hambrick. ``I'm fully expecting
Dat to step in there and start, and for him to be effective for us
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   No question, it's a tall order. nn

ELIAN'S STORY IS FAR FROM OVER, BUT WHAT NOW? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Que pasa? Que pasa?'' Elian Gonzalez apparently
kept asking as federal agents seized him Saturday in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   What, indeed, was happening?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question that will be asked for a long time and in
many contexts _ as the inconsistent law enforcement legacy of the
Clinton administration and its attorney general, Janet Reno, is
considered; as the presidential campaign plays out nationally and
particularly in Florida; and as the United States ponders its
tortuously evolving relationship with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Reno claim to hold the legal and sociological high
ground by having relied on the rule of law to reunite Elian with
his father and only surviving natural parent, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives in Miami, other Cuban exiles and their
conservative supporters believe they have the moral upper hand in
seeking to have the boy remain in the United States; thereby,
denying Castro a 6-year-old human trophy to exploit and brainwash.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Cuban-American community, of course, want to exploit
the boy in their own way and for their own symbolic purposes.
That's regrettable, even given how understandable is their distrust
of Castro, an egregious leftover from the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case in any dust-up involving the United
States and Cuba, the simple answer _ in this case giving a minor
child to a parent, minus some showing of utter unsuitability _ may
not be the correct one, or at least not one easily arrived at.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law, international law (such as it is) and common sense
have to contend with the competing demands of a 4-decade-old
geopolitical blood feud.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Elian's story has been a harrowing part of
that continuing saga. Clinging to an inner tube, he watched last
November as his mother  &UR;  &LR; and nine others drowned while they floated
toward the United States. Elian's rescue, as a Florida writer
noted, was ``a sparkling moment of fate.'' The succeeding months
have not been so.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Castro has played the boy's plight for all the
gratuitous publicity and rabble-rousing he could muster. So what's
new? His government continued to try to stage manage the reaction
Saturday, with state-owned radio in Havana advising Cubans not to
celebrate publicly lest it look bad to the international audience.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, better was to be expected _ but was not always
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said
questions about Elian's custody should be left to a family court in
Florida. But in January, the INS ruled that the boy should be
returned to his father. Reno signed off on the decision, and
Clinton said the agency did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said, in effect, not so fast,
and has ordered that Elian not be removed from the United States
until the legal string has been played out. It is incumbent on the
Clinton administration to make certain this order is observed.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically, the Clinton administration has never been
able to get control of this story in terms of the politically
important imagery. By turns, it has looked ham-fisted or indecisive
as the Justice Department and INS dithered over how to enforce its
will. Early on, Clinton himself looked like he was willing to hang
Reno out to dry on the matter, but more recently he has been
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   As the dramatic chapter of the story initially unfolded
Saturday, the administration fell further behind the curve. The
pictures from inside the Miami home during the raid were exactly
what Reno _ and the White House _ had hoped to avoid: a beefy
federal agent, in riot gear and toting an assault rifle, snatching
Elian from the arms of his fisherman-rescuer in the middle of the
night. It wasn't a burning compound outside Waco, but it was an
unpleasant face of American authority.
</P>
<P>
   Even Juan Miguel Gonzalez' lawyer, Gregory Craig, had to concede
in a CNN interview that ``it looked shocking and scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House certainly breathed easier later in the day as
the seemingly unforced happy snapshots of the reunion of Elian and
his father were made available by the U.S. government and began to
chase the earlier, dire pictures around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the administration's missteps throughout the
high-profile standoff, Clinton has had what any politician wants in
such a fix: public support for his position. Polls have shown that
a clear and slowly growing majority of Americans believe Elian
should be given to his father, while a consistent one-third of
survey respondents believe he should remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian affair has proved to be an especially slippery slope
for Vice President Al Gore in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went into the full-straddle mode Saturday, repeating his
attempt to pander to Cuban-Americans (in which he broke with the
administration and said Elian's case should have been handled by a
family court) but yet not criticizing the federal seizure of the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   He felt called on to conclude a written statement with the
anodyne phrase of the day: ``I ask all Americans, no matter what
their position on this issue, to obey the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, took a few predictable shots at the INS
operation to seize Elian. Particularly rich, in light of Bush's
apparent problems with the gun-control issue, was his declaration:
``Ours is a nation of laws, not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush made a better effort than Gore to get into the serious
part of the Elian debate. He recalled the INS' initial decision to
leave the custody issue to a Florida family court and said: ``The
administration should have followed that legal and responsible
course. ... The more authority of our law comes from the
understanding that it will be applied in a fair and measured way.''
</P>
<P>
   Those certainly will not be the last words from Gore or Bush on
the issue. Or from Clinton or Castro. Or their biographers or the
historians.

   SAN ANTONIO _ The San Antonio Spurs' quest to repeat as NBA
champions just got a little bit tougher.
</P>
<P>
   With MVP candidate Tim Duncan out with an injury, Phoenix
quickly snatched homecourt advantage away from the Spurs as the
Suns captured Game 1 of the opening-round playoff series, 72-70,
Saturday at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   Each team set playoff lows for points scored in a game. The 142
points tied the playoff record set by Atlanta and Detroit on May
12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 will be played here Tuesday before the series shifts to
Phoenix for Game 3 next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were flat offensively and failed to protect the ball.
On the flip side, the Suns swarmed David Robinson, who made just 3
of 12 shots and finished with only 11 points and 11 rebounds in 30
foul-plagued minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the homecourt advantage that the Spurs secured in the
final game of the season no longer belongs to the defending NBA
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a nice job of fronting me,'' Robinson said. ``We need
to find a better way to be effective. Yeah, we need Tim. He brings
the size that we need. Everybody has to do their thing, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has missed the past five games because of a slight tear
of the lateral meniscus tear in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks first-round draft pick Samaki Walker, starting
in place of Duncan, had 13 points and a game-high 16 rebounds, and
blocked three shots. But his stellar performance was not enough to
offset 17 points apiece from Cliff Robinson and Penny Hardaway, and
15 points off the bench from steady Rodney Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first playoff start for Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have had about two or three more guys with that
same effort (as Walker), we wouldn't be having this discussion
about how we lost,'' guard Terry Porter said. ``But we did welcome
him to the real NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs trailed by 11 midway through the third period, but
clawed their way back and had a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   With the Spurs behind, 71-70, Sean Elliott passed up a wide-open
long jumper for a 15-footer that missed everything. Suns center
Corie Blount rebounded and was fouled with one second left.
</P>
<P>
   Blount made his first free throw, but missed the second attempt,
which was rebounded by Walker with 0.7 seconds remaining. After a
Spurs timeout, Mario Elie's inbounds pass at halfcourt for Walker
was intercepted by Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not done by a long shot,'' said Rogers, who grabbed an
offensive rebound and muscled in a shot over Malik Rose that gave
the Suns a 69-68 lead. ``We are just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get the big head. We have to maintain our cool. We
can't sit back and relax. We know they will come back strong on
Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team came out strong. The Suns won despite shooting 36.6
percent from the field. The Spurs struggled, too, missing 9-of-21
free throws, committed 18 turnovers and shot 37 percent from the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense could not get it done on a consistent basis, and
that hurt us,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``The free throw
situation obviously was not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had taken care of business at the line we would have
been in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Spurs are not in the best of shape. And Duncan,
who is questionable for Game 2, is not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's easier when you've got the MVP of last
year's Finals at the top (of the key), who can shoot jumpers or
take it to the basket,'' Spurs guard Avery Johnson said. ``We're
putting a lot of pressure on the rest of our (power forwards) to
make plays that we've been programmed to make with the MVP out
there.'' nn

   MIAMI _ Cuban exiles raged through the streets of Miami's Little
Havana Saturday, burning tires, overturning dumpsters and tangling
with roaming squads of riot-clad police who fired tear gas to quell
the outburst triggered by the pre-dawn removal of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   This is a terrible day,'' said Nancy Milian, 33, a
Cuban-American who joined the crowd on N.W. 27th Avenue. ``I'm
ashamed to be an American. Clinton is definitely leaving a legacy.
Cubans will never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, an uneasy calm fell over the streets, with
most of the demonstrators drifting away from the clashes. A house
fire broke out, but it was unclear if it was connected to the
disturbances. As night fell, a small group of demonstrators _ some
with shirts wrapped around their heads _ climbed on a city bus,
blocked an intersection and set a tire on fire in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Police made at least 200 arrests. Three officers were injured
when a man beat them with a baseball bat, sending two of them to
the hospital in serious condition. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper
was also injured in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning-strike raid to take the boy caught Miami's exiles
completely by surprise. Reporters estimated that only about 30 to
50 demonstrators were outside the house at 5:10 a.m. EST when
several white minivans pulled up to the home on N.W. Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   A team of about one dozen black-clad officers fired a chemical
gas to disperse the crowd, while eight other officers wearing
helmets, flak jackets and carrying semi-automatic weapons battered
open the door of the house and swept inside. They held lawyers and
family members at gunpoint and snatched the boy from the arms of
one of the fisherman who rescued him at sea last Thanksgiving Day,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Elian screaming in English, 'Help me, help me,''' said
Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman, who was standing in a closet with
the boy. ``I just held his head. My God, America, what did you do
</P>
<P>
   to this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer who had been invited into the
home pointed his camera and captured an image that was flashed
around the world within minutes: an agent wearing goggles, a
</P>
<P>
   helmet and bullet-proof vest, and aiming a semi-automatic black
rifle reached out to Dalrymple to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's face wore a look of stark terror.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white T-shirt and plaid shorts, wrapped partially in a
sheet, the boy was whisked from the home, crying as a female agent
who spoke Spanish carried him to a waiting van. The textbook-like
operation lasted three minutes with no reported injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was taken to a waiting helicopter about 10 miles away and
flown to Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami, where a doctor
examined him. By 6 a.m. EST, he was put on board a government jet
and flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. He
reportedly played with Play-Dough and other toys on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Elian was reunited with his father, leaving
behind a family devastated by grief and anger and a community
boiling with rage and feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the raid spread like wildfire through Little Havana. By
6:30 a.m. EST, several hundred people milled around the house, some
yelling at reporters, others crying. Faces were etched with rage,
dejection and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to express my anger and hurt,'' said Susana
Ruiz, 43, who stood outside the home, her eyes brimming with tears.
``I hurt for this family. I hurt like you wouldn't believe. I can't
believe what they have done. I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police took no part in the raid, although a top-ranking
officer from the department rode in the lead car of the federal
caravan so that local officers would know the action was
</P>
<P>
   legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Police Chief William O'Brien said he learned of the
impending strike at 4:15 a.m. EST, and for security reasons he told
only a few top assistants. He did not notify Miami Mayor Joe
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, who afterwards lashed out at the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal agents went in as if they were assaulting a military
bunker,'' Carollo said. ``This family is decent, law-abiding
people, and they came in with machine guns and gassing people. This
is America. This is not Cuba or Hitler's old Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Carollo appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he did not notify Carollo out of concerns for the
security of the operation. ``I'm a policeman, not a politician,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the boy was gone, Miami police began
mobilizing, and quickly set up perimeters around an area of about
40 square blocks. By 8 a.m. EST, roaming crowds of demonstrators
began congregating at major intersections.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. EST, sporadic outbursts erupted. Along N.W. 27th
Avenue _ also named ``Unity Boulevard'' _ a crowd of about 50
people set fire to a tire at a major intersection. Men tossed heavy
benches with wooden backs and cement legs into the street. They
overturned newspaper boxes and tossed around trash cans, contents
spewing across the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a team of riot-clad officers raced to the scene
to reinforce the dozen or so officers stationed at the
intersection. The team rode in unmarked sedans, which screeched to
</P>
<P>
   a halt, all four doors flying open and the officers piling out.
</P>
<P>
   Some carried weapons rigged to fire tear gas. Others carried
cans of the chemical, ready to fling them into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One man was in the street, overturning a newspaper box, but ran
as the cars blazed in. An officer chased him down and rolled him to
the ground in a flower bed, pinning him with his knees while
another officer slapped on metal handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the crowd dispersed, most walking south on Unity
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, small caravans of cars _ apparently from homes
inside the perimeter _ crept down the broad boulevard, horns
blaring, passengers waving Cuban flags and yelling as crowds along
the sidewalks cheered. Police cars whisked up behind the caravans,
lights and sirens blazing, moving them out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   News helicopters hovered overhead, filming everything.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbances seemed unorganized and spontaneous, an
outpouring of emotion. Many people walked peacefully, holding flags
or signs, standing on sidewalks and merely watching. Some youths
mugged and danced for television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And most of sprawling Miami-Dade County's 2.5 million residents
went about their normal Saturday business, or stayed in their homes
watching the melee unfold on television. Outside Little Havana,
businesses were open and traffic moved normally.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The city's Miami Heat professional basketball team held their
first play-off game of the season at the downtown American Airlines
Arena, tipping off at 12:30 p.m. EST as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles away in Little Havana, chaos roamed in ragged
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts were unpredictable, flaring up all through the
long, hot morning.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:30 a.m. EST, the crowd at N.W. 27th Avenue and Flagler
Street was calmly standing on the four corners of the major
intersection as about 20 police milled around in the middle of the
street. A woman driving a red car stopped in the intersection,
opened her door, stepped out and began yelling at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman walked over and ordered her back into the car.
Within seconds, dozens of protestors surrounded the car, screaming,
``Let her go, let her go!''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers with plastic shields and nightsticks rushed
to the group. An officer grabbed a man in a green shirt who was
screaming and flailing his arms. The crowd surged. People started
running, some being shoved around by the jostling crowd. Two
teen-aged girls cried and screamed as officers brushed them out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A woman on one of the corners threw part of a broken broomstick
in the general direction of the officers and was immediately
wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by four men wearing helmets.
Several officers ran to their cars for gas canisters, while others
with plastic shields formed a line and began pushing the crowd
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the street, officers jammed several men to the ground,
mashing them into the pavement, twisting their arms and cuffing
their wrists. One man was led away with angry red scrapes on his
forehead. Sweating and heaving for breath in the hot sun, he was
led to an old school bus painted white and stenciled with the
words, ``Miami Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the bus was filled with detainees. The windows
were covered with heavy metal mesh. The people inside stamped their
feet and rocked the bus.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks roamed the area, extinguishing the stacks of tires
that protestors set ablaze in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Thick black smoke roiled into the sky, followed at times by
clouds of choking gas fired as officers moved from one hot-spot to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors threw rocks and bottles at police and media crews.
Roaming demonstrators smashed the windows of one television truck.
</P>
<P>
   Two men ran down Unity Boulevard, carrying a large U.S. flag
turned upside down, the Stars and Stripes dragging on the pavement.
Two women carried an U.S. flag tied at the center with a black
band.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman stood off to one side as officers moved toward a
large clump of protestors, holding a bright green sign emblazoned
with one word: ``Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another woman yelled ``assesinos'' ``assassins.'' A man ran
up to a reporter, grabbed his shirt and screamed into his face:
``You better write the truth. You better write that this was murder
here today what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, garbage crews were cleaning up the mess left
by the demonstrators, loading debris into dump trucks and running
street-sweepers along Unity Boulevard. Police maintained their
barricades, still on full alert should new disturbances break out.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7 p.m. EST, about 50 riot-clad officers marched
down N.W. Second Street after protesters attacked a television crew
from CNN, tearing down their tent. The network has a bureau in
Havana. A few arrests were made, but most people walked quietly
away from the line of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking the media to leave because we can't guarantee
your safety,'' said Miami Police spokesman Carlos Alfaro. ``Some
people in the crowd may perceive some media as in cahoots with
foreign governments.''
</P>
<P>
   All through the crowds that raged earlier in the day, people
carried copies of the famous photograph snapped before dawn as the
riot-clad, gun-toting federal agent reached out for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for this,'' said Hope Kahn, who saw the
photograph for the first time as she stood near Unity Boulevard.
``There was no need to use weapons. He wasn't a drug dealer. He was
a
</P>
<P>
   little boy.''

   The disturbances seemed unorganized and spontaneous, an
outpouring of emotion. Many people walked peacefully, holding flags
or signs, standing on sidewalks and merely watching. Some youths
mugged and danced for television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And most of sprawling Miami-Dade County's 2.5 million residents
went about their normal Saturday business, or stayed in their homes
watching the melee unfold on television. Outside Little Havana,
businesses were open and traffic moved normally.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The city's Miami Heat professional basketball team held their
first play-off game of the season at the downtown American Airlines
Arena, tipping off at 12:30 p.m. EST as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles away in Little Havana, chaos roamed in ragged
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts were unpredictable, flaring up all through the
long, hot morning.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10:30 a.m. EST, the crowd at N.W. 27th Avenue and Flagler
Street was calmly standing on the four corners of the major
intersection as about 20 police milled around in the middle of the
street. A woman driving a red car stopped in the intersection,
opened her door, stepped out and began yelling at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman walked over and ordered her back into the car.
Within seconds, dozens of protestors surrounded the car, screaming,
``Let her go, let her go!''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of officers with plastic shields and nightsticks rushed
to the group. An officer grabbed a man in a green shirt who was
screaming and flailing his arms. The crowd surged. People started
running, some being shoved around by the jostling crowd. Two
teen-aged girls cried and screamed as officers brushed them out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A woman on one of the corners threw part of a broken broomstick
in the general direction of the officers and was immediately
wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by four men wearing helmets.
Several officers ran to their cars for gas canisters, while others
with plastic shields formed a line and began pushing the crowd
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the street, officers jammed several men to the ground,
mashing them into the pavement, twisting their arms and cuffing
their wrists. One man was led away with angry red scrapes on his
forehead. Sweating and heaving for breath in the hot sun, he was
led to an old school bus painted white and stenciled with the
words, ``Miami Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the bus was filled with detainees. The windows
were covered with heavy metal mesh. The people inside stamped their
feet and rocked the bus.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks roamed the area, extinguishing the stacks of tires
that protestors set ablaze in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Thick black smoke roiled into the sky, followed at times by
clouds of choking gas fired as officers moved from one hot-spot to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors threw rocks and bottles at police and media crews.
Roaming demonstrators smashed the windows of one television truck.
</P>
<P>
   Two men ran down Unity Boulevard, carrying a large U.S. flag
turned upside down, the Stars and Stripes dragging on the pavement.
Two women carried an U.S. flag tied at the center with a black
band.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman stood off to one side as officers moved toward a
large clump of protestors, holding a bright green sign emblazoned
with one word: ``Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another woman yelled ``assesinos'' ``assassins.'' A man ran
up to a reporter, grabbed his shirt and screamed into his face:
``You better write the truth. You better write that this was murder
here today what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, garbage crews were cleaning up the mess left
by the demonstrators, loading debris into dump trucks and running
street-sweepers along Unity Boulevard. Police maintained their
barricades, still on full alert should new disturbances break out.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7 p.m. EST, about 50 riot-clad officers marched
down N.W. Second Street after protesters attacked a television crew
from CNN, tearing down their tent. The network has a bureau in
Havana. A few arrests were made, but most people walked quietly
away from the line of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking the media to leave because we can't guarantee
your safety,'' said Miami Police spokesman Carlos Alfaro. ``Some
people in the crowd may perceive some media as in cahoots with
foreign governments.''
</P>
<P>
   All through the crowds that raged earlier in the day, people
carried copies of the famous photograph snapped before dawn as the
riot-clad, gun-toting federal agent reached out for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for this,'' said Hope Kahn, who saw the
photograph for the first time as she stood near Unity Boulevard.
``There was no need to use weapons. He wasn't a drug dealer. He was
a
</P>
<P>
   little boy.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Armed U.S. immigration agents smashed their way into the
Little Havana home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives before dawn
on Saturday, took the sobbing 6-year-old boy from a bedroom closet
and flew him to a reunion with his father outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators wept in rage and coughed from pepper spray and
tear gas, the agents wrapped the child in a blanket and carried him
to an airport to fly him to Washington. The action touched off a
fury in the streets outside the home where Cuban exiles have kept a
vigil since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening? What's happening?'' Elian said in Spanish as
he was taken away. ``Help me. Help me.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents, wearing shirts with the words ``INS FEDERAL
OFFICER'' in bold yellow letters, ended a bitter standoff between
Miami's exile community and a federal government that stopped
fruitless negotiations with the child's defiant great-uncle and a
community that saw Elian as a symbol of freedom and a precious
victory, now perhaps lost, over President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, how could you have performed only half a miracle?'' asked
a frantic, weeping Marisleysis Gonzalez, a 21-year-old cousin who
had been the boy's closest companion since he was rescued at sea on
Nov. 25 on a failed crossing from Cuba that drowned his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department said Saturday morning that Elian was
taken safely from the home at about 5:10 a.m. and was flown to
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, where his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, waited.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Gonzalez was seen carrying Elian from a
car at the base. ``They are together,'' said Myron Marlin, a
Justice Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of being reunited with his father, stepmother and
6-month-old half-brother, Elian was ``totally at ease'' and
laughing, said Gregory B. Craig, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs released by the lawyer showed a beaming Elian. The
family will be taken to an undisclosed location in the Washington
area, where it can be assured of privacy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, one Justice Department spokesman said, was subdued and
calm on the flight from Miami, as federal agents gently explained
what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of unhappy Cuban-American demonstrators clashed with
the police here Saturday afternoon, the distraught Miami relatives,
saying they wanted to assure themselves that the boy was happy and
safe, boarded a plane to Washington, seeking a meeting with
Gonzalez, who had not yet decided whether to grant one.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives _ Lazaro, Delfin and Marisleysis Gonzalez _ were
met at Reagan National Airport by a police escort. They had hoped
to go directly to Andrews to see Elian, but were told they would be
turned away at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   They drove to Capitol Hill, where they met with Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H. The family and Smith then drove to the Air Force base, where
they were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno told reporters Saturday morning that
she had tried until the final moment of the standoff to try to find
some other way that father and son could be reunited, but that no
agreement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also defended the decision to use force, and armed agents,
saying there were reports that people in the crowd or the
neighborhood had weapons.
</P>
<P>
   She had no other choice, she said, but to order the raid on the
home of Lazaro Gonzalez. ``Elian is safe and no one is seriously
hurt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean Elian is on his way back to Cuba. Under an
order by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
11th Circuit, in Atlanta, Elian's father cannot take the boy home
before a decision in a hearing on Elian's application, filed by his
relatives, for political asylum. The hearing is scheduled for May
11.
</P>
<P>
   But at the two-bedroom house in Little Havana, where Elian has
lived under the constant watch of television cameras and of
demonstrators who have turned him into an almost saintlike presence
as well as a prize in the 41-year-old Cold War with Castro, people
wailed, sank to the ground and cursed the U.S. government for what
it had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're animals,'' screeched Marisleysis Gonzalez to the
swelling crowd Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While exiles here had kept vigil in anticipation of such a raid
for months, the timing _ the morning after Good Friday and the day
before Easter in a heavily Roman Catholic community _ and the
violent, sudden nature of it, left them in as much disbelief as
rage.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of demonstrators had slowly dwindled overnight from
hundreds to about 50 people, some sleeping behind police
barricades, when three white unmarked vans sped down the dark
street and stopped in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here! They're here!'' demonstrators shouted.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
leaped from the vans and tore through a chain-link gate. Eight
broke through the front door and, displaying automatic weapons,
stormed through the tiny house in search of Elian.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Camejo, a cousin of Lazaro Gonzalez, was in the house with
the family watching television as the agents burst in. ``They held
Marisleysis down and told her not to move in Spanish,'' Camejo
said. The agents shouted at the others not to move or interfere, as
Marisleysis pleaded: ``Don't take the boy. Don't take the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was hiding in a closet in the arms of Donato Dalrymple,
one of the two fishermen who rescued Elian from the Atlantic Ocean
and who has been a constant presence at the house.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in helmet and body armor, holding an automatic rifle,
pulled the boy from Dalrymple's arms. The agent, Dalrymple said,
pointed the rifle at him as Elian cried ``No! No! No!''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photograph, sent around the world, showed
the gun close to Elian's face, but Reno said that the barrel was
never pointed at the boy and that the agent's finger was not on the
trigger. The photograph bears out that description.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was handed to a female agent who cradled him in her arms
and, with help from another agent, raced out into the din and
confusion of the street and quickly through the side doors of a
van.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's eyes were wide open. He cried and seemed terrified as
all around him people screamed, cursed and fought against a line of
federal agents who formed a wall with shields and automatic weapons
as a cloud of tear gas and pepper spray wafted down the street.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the operation took about three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A few protesters tried to form a human chain to block the front
of the house and keep the agents from taking the boy. Ramon Saul
Sanchez, an exile in Miami who has become the leader in the
demonstrations, said he was struck by an agent's gun butt. He bled
from an ear as a young man held him upright.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Elian was taken from the bedroom closet, he was
aboard a plane and headed for Washington and his father. A female
U.S. immigration agent comforted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem very scary,'' the agent told him in Spanish,
officials said. ``It will soon be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno called for giving father and son privacy to become
reacquainted. ``Let us give him and his father the space, the calm,
the moral support they need to reconnect and reaffirm their bond
between father and son,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Elian from the house, agents had whisked him to
nearby Watson Island, where they boarded a helicopter to Homestead
Air Force Base in southern Miami-Dade County. A doctor examined him
to make sure the boy had not been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing an extraordinary voyage for a boy who was shipwrecked
off Florida and had never flown before, Elian was then put on a
U.S. Marshals Service plane for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agent who comforted Elian on board was joined by
a psychiatrist, a flight surgeon and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service agent who had led the rescue operation,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our reports so far are that the child has been very
calm, has not been anxious, has not been thrashing, has not been
crying,'' said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. ``And the basic feedback that we have from
a series of people now, who have been directly with him, is that he
is a real terrific, tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Few details had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agent at Elian's side, whose name was not
released for security reasons, soothed him with prearranged words
cleared by psychologists. He was offered food and drink. He was
also offered a few toys: some Play-Doh, an airplane, a map and a
watch, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez rushed to the Andrews base in a convoy of
vehicles to await Elian's arrival. He had been staying at the
residence in Bethesda, Md., of Cuba's top diplomat in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need more space,'' Meissner said. ``And they need more
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer, reiterated his client's
pledge to remain in the United States while the boy's Miami
relatives seek a political asylum hearing on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The raid apparently came as a shock to the family in Miami. The
family had thought that negotiations would continue, said family
members and their lawyers, but Reno said that it had been obvious
the family was not going to budge.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday morning that ``the law has been
upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When all efforts failed,'' Clinton said, ``there was no
alternative but to enforce the decision by the I.N.S. and federal
court that Juan Miguel Gonzalez have custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it was the right thing to do,'' Clinton said. ``I
am very pleased with the way she handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, people compared the raid to something that might
happen in communist Cuba and swore that the U.S. government would
regret its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected the federal government to come in like they
did, like thieves in the night,'' said Carlos Brito, who
demonstrated outside the house almost every night for months.
``I've always been proud of being an American, but this morning I
wish I were a citizen of any other country. I've always defended
this country, but to take this boy in the middle of the night?
Today, the federal government has betrayed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa de la Cruz, 58, said she was knocked to the ground by an
armed man, near a gardenia bush in front of the house. ``I was
praying,'' Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house, in the minutes after the raid, three young
men held each other and sobbed. One woman sat in a ditch, crying
and holding her face in her hands. People rushed back and forth
yelling, unsure whom to vent their anger on. An American flag was
flown upside down in disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, protests gradually swelled as groups for blocks
around the house burned tires in intersections and snarled traffic
by standing or marching in the road. Protesters punched, kicked and
spat at the police, and hurled bus benches into streets, which soon
clogged with backed-up traffic, ambulances and fire trucks.
Protesters blocked the access roads to the Miami International
Airport, and traffic backed up for miles.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, the police had made 180 arrests. But earlier
in the morning as the raid was being conducted, they appeared to
have no presence at all at the house. Miami police had stood watch
at the house for months, but as the federal agents moved in, there
seemed to be no uniformed officers there to aid with the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Only several minutes later, after the federal agents had left,
did the Miami police move in.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joseph Carollo of Miami said he had not been told about
the raid, but that was not a surprise. Carollo has made it clear
that he sides with the exile community in this fight.
</P>
<P>
   That community, he said, is ``destroyed, emotionally
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County, who had also sided with
the exile community, said he, too, had not heard about the raid
until after it was over. Penelas had pledged that his officers
would not aid the federal government in any attempt to take Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, as smoke drifted over Miami, police officers
from both Miami and Miami-Dade responded to try to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   But the paralyzing of Miami that some people here had feared if
the government seized the boy never really happened. By late
afternoon, the crowds had dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   What many people talked about was a sense of something lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was taken out,'' said Ledia Chavez, 38, who came from
Cuba in 1962.

SAN JOSE LOOKS LIKE EASIER WAY FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars' yearly dispatching of the Edmonton Oilers has
been handled.
</P>
<P>
   Show them what they won, Gary Bettman ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, for our defending Stanley Cup champions, we have a
second-round series against either the Colorado Avalanche or the
San Jose Sharks. Both teams are playing especially well right now,
and both won the season series against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very interesting,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said
Saturday. ``This could be the first time in a long time we'll be
the underdog in a playoff series.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time he could remember was Detroit in 1998. And that
didn't turn out too well for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   So while Stars coaches and players huddle around their TV sets
this afternoon to find out who they'll play in the second round,
here are some questions for Stars fans to ponder:
</P>
<P>
   WHO WILL THE STARS PLAY IN THE SECOND ROUND?
</P>
<P>
   There are two possibilities, and the Stars could find out as
early today which one they'll face.
</P>
<P>
   If the San Jose Sharks beat the St. Louis Blues in Game 6 today
in San Jose, Calif., the Stars will play the Sharks. If the Blues
win Games 6 and 7, the Stars would play the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   So tune into the Sharks-Blues game at 2 p.m. today on
WFAA/Channel 8.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, ABC could use the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will ever say it, but the Stars would much rather play
the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   While San Jose would've been a pain-in-the-butt, first-round
opponent, the Sharks would be just what the doctor ordered for the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having to play the red-hot Avalanche, the Stars would
play a Sharks team that already has been extended by the Blues. The
Avs and Detroit Red Wings are then forced to slug it out in the
other Western Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars are sticking to the company line when asked if
they care who they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``I said one
time I cared and we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   DO THE STARS BECOME THE NO. 1 SEED IF ST. LOUIS LOSES?
</P>
<P>
   Kind of.
</P>
<P>
   If the Blues are eliminated by the Sharks, the Stars become the
highest seed left in the Western Conference. As a result, they'd
play the lowest seed left in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also would get home ice all the way through the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   WILL DEFENSEMAN SERGEI ZUBOV AND WINGER JERE LEHTINEN BE READY
FOR GAME 1 OF ROUND 2?
</P>
<P>
   Zubov? Very likely.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Saturday that Zubov, who hasn't played since
March 29, continues to skate at Dr Pepper StarCenter and should be
ready for the first game. Lehtinen, meanwhile, is going slowly on
his tender right ankle that caused him to miss all but 17 of the
Stars' 82 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Zubov nor Lehtinen played in the first round against
Edmonton. The Stars didn't miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think you're not going to be able to go through the
playoffs without adversity,'' Hitchcock said. ``Our residue from
the season gave us the ability to persevere. We weren't overwhelmed
when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   CAN THE STARS REPEAT AS STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONS WITHOUT A POWER
PLAY?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did a lot of things right in their first-round series
against Edmonton. The power play wasn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   They finished 2-for-26, which equates to converting about 8
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche and Red Wings are scoring on about one in every
four chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this time of the year it's all about wins not about
percentages,'' Hitchcock said. ``But you give yourself a better
chance to win if you have a lot of elements going well for you.
Obviously, power play is one of those elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Can they win without a great power play? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Can they win at 8 percent? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   DO THE STARS HAVE THEIR MO-JOE BACK?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano was the Stars' best player in their first-round
series. Hands down.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can't live on Mo alone. They need Joe Nieuwendyk
playing well, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a lot better,'' Hitchcock said about Nieuwendyk. ``He
dug into the series in the last two games, which was very good for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Austin Powers, the Stars aren't going very far without
their Mo-Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the Stars playing as well as they can play?''
</P>
<P>
   We'll let Hitchcock handle this question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no and no,'' he said. ``We're going to have to be a lot
better. Every round, we're going to have to be better.'' nn

DODGERS POUND REDS, 16-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Eric Karros was in a 3-for-22 slump and Shawn Green
had three hits in 19 at-bats with runners in scoring position, and
yet few words were spoken of their early futility.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is because Gary Sheffield is crushing the baseball.
The bigger reason is because the Dodgers have a deeper lineup than
years past, and they're knocking opposing pitchers around despite
the struggles of their fourth and fifth hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Karros showed signs of breaking out of his funk with a three-run
homer and a double, and the bottom of the order again produced
wonderfully as the Dodgers pounded three Cincinnati pitchers in a
16-2 pasting of the Reds on Saturday at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield and Kevin Elster added two-run homers, and Todd
Hollandsworth started the game with a homer as the Dodgers backed
Chan Ho Park with 15 hits. The 16 runs were the most the Dodgers
scored since May 6, 1995, in a 17-11 win at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out of that smog in L.A. to clear our minds. We're road
warriors,'' said Elster, alluding to the Dodgers averaging 7.5 runs
per game on the road. ``I think, mentally, for our big guns, it's
so nice the bottom is doing something. That way, they don't have to
think they have to carry the load all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone downer for the Dodgers (10-6), who go for the
three-game sweep today, was a blister Park developed that could
knock him from his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we go up against some pretty good pitchers, and
we give them a different look all the time,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``Our lineup is not easy to pitch to. We scored a
bunch (nine) of runs (Friday) without a major contribution from
Sheff and Green. Sheff chipped in today, but Green was a little
quiet, and we still scored a bunch of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle of the order _ Sheffield, Green and Karros _ offers
the intimidation factor. But it's the sixth, seventh and eighth
spots that's been so crucial in the Dodgers' early success.
</P>
<P>
   The three in the middle of the lineup are batting .337 with 13
homers, 36 RBI and 34 runs scored. Todd Hundley (or his backup Chad
Kreuter), Adrian Beltre and Kevin Elster, who comprise the bottom
part of the order, are hitting .295 with 11 homers, 33 RBI and 37
runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of strengths in a lot of areas, where if we're
not playing well we could still score runs,'' said Sheffield, who
leads the club with seven homers, 16 RBI and a .382 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're ready to get back to the park the next day, you're so
relaxed (when the whole order is producing). It's fun to be here
when you have a team like we have, when you have the balance we
have in our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning the first two games of this series, the Dodgers
scored 26 runs. Of course, they might need that many with lefty
Carlos Perez going today.
</P>
<P>
   The support of Park began quickly against Pete Harnisch (0-2)
when Hollandsworth hit his first homer of the season to lead off
the first. Michael Tucker tied it in the bottom of the inning with
a one-out homer, the only hit Park allowed in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second, Kreuter singled in a run and Elster homered
for the second straight day, a two-run shot that gave the Dodgers a
4-1 lead. They broke it open with five runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're clicking as a group,'' Hollandsworth said.
``Some of the hot guys we had early are rubbing off on other guys,
and we're picking it up and getting it going. It's a situation
where everybody's feeding off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The only starter not to get a hit was Green. &QL;

PENALTIES A STICKY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The National Football League is facing one of the
stickiest issues it has ever had to deal with, and when a solution
is reached, some of the bigger names in the game are going to get
hurt. Although no one wants to talk on the record about it, there
was a tough debate between the owners and players this past week on
what to do about the San Francisco 49ers and some of the top agents
in the game, who the league feels worked in concert to circumvent
the NFL salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners want Carmen Policy, current president of the
Cleveland Browns, to be suspended for a year for his role in the
deals that took place when he was heading up the 49ers. During that
period, the league says, the 49ers wrote contracts for Steve Young,
Brent Jones, and Jim Druckenmiller that violated salary cap rules.
Dwight Clark was general manager in San Francisco at the time, and
his name is on the contracts. When Policy left San Francisco for
the expansion Browns, he took Clark with him.
</P>
<P>
   Some time after that, John York became the top man in San
Francisco. His wife, Denise DeBartolo York, had taken control of
the 49ers when her brother, Eddie DeBartolo Jr., got into trouble
with the law in Louisiana and stepped away from the team at the
request of commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   York became alarmed when Jones reportedly came looking for
$500,000 he said was owed to him after he retired. This prompted
York to look at other 49er contracts, and when he discovered what
he thought was cheating, he turned the team in to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Judge David Doty in Minnesota ruled that the player
agents _ Leigh Steinberg (representing Young), his partner David
Moorad (representing Jones), and Gary Wichard (representing
Druckenmiller) _ are punishable under the collective bargaining
rules. The agents had argued they are not part of the CBA and
therefore are not subject to punishment. Doty ruled against them.
</P>
<P>
   This set the stage for a meeting in New York this past week, and
reportedly an owners committee wants the scalps of Policy, Clark,
and the agents involved. However, insiders say, the union feels all
involved should be punished in some fashion, but that Policy should
not be suspended for the year because Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was the
owner of the club at the time. The union argued that DeBartolo was
in charge and that nothing could be done without his approval, and
now that he is out of the league, there is no way he can be
punished. The union also feels that the present ownership and
management of the 49ers should not be punished because they had
nothing to do with the contracts in question and turned themselves
in.
</P>
<P>
   On the owners' side, the feeling is Policy should be fined and
suspended, and the 49ers should lose some draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged cheating with Jones and Young reportedly took place
in the year of San Francisco's last Super Bowl championship, and
some say the illegal salary cap maneuvers helped the 49ers win it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the collective bargaining agreement, the league and the
union must agree on the punishment, to a degree. Insiders say the
union will not go along with a suspension of Policy for a year but
does believe there should be fines for everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the players want tough punishment for the agents, who come
under the domain of the players and can be fined as much as
$250,000 each. Steinberg, Moorad, and Wichard, three of the top
agents in the game, may find themselves out of business in the NFL
for a time.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, Policy, Clark, and the agents likely will be
fined, and some, or all, may be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The action on Policy puts Tagliabue in a tough situation. They
have been good friends for a long time. When Tagliabue and the late
Jim Finks were competing to replace Pete Rozelle as commissioner a
decade ago, it was Policy who led the drive to an upset victory for
Tagliabue. Then, when Policy had a falling out with DeBartolo two
years ago, Tagliabue reportedly was the one who sold him to Al
Lerner as the best president for the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good situation for the NFL, and there is no easy way
out for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is some interesting behind-the-scenes stuff that took place
on the first day of the draft. After the New York Jets took
quarterback Chad Pennington of Marshall with the 18th pick overall,
the Pittsburgh Steelers offered to trade Plaxico Burress, whom they
had chosen at No. 8, to the Jets for Pennington and defensive
lineman Shaun Ellis. The Jets coveted Burress, the 6-foot-6-inch
wide receiver from Michigan State, and tried to trade up to get him
from Pittsburgh, but the Steelers stood firm and took Burress. With
the 12th pick, the Jets took Ellis and with the 18th pick they took
Pennington. This is when the Steelers offered a one (Burress) for
two (Ellis and Pennington) and the Jets said no. Meanwhile,
Carolina had been gearing up to get Pennington. Carolina coach
George Seifert and Seattle coach Mike Holmgren had a deal in the
works that would let Carolina move up from 22d to l9th to get
Pennington, but the Jets, in a surprise move, took Pennington one
spot in front of the Panthers, canceling the Carolina-Seattle deal.
Baltimore, after selecting Jamal Lewis of Tennessee with the fifth
pick and Travis Taylor of Florida with the 10th pick, still tried
to make a deal to get a late first-round choice. The guy they were
after was Louisville QB Chris Redman. The Ravens couldn't make the
deal but were stunned when Redman was still on the board for them
to take in the second round . . . John Scarpellini of Woods Hole
has done it again. Scarpellini, the national sales rep for Jostens
rings, has won the bidding to make the Super Bowl rings for the
world champion St. Louis Rams, and the AFC championship rings for
the Tennessee Titans. This is the 22d time Scarpellini has won the
bid. The league allows $5,000 per Super Bowl ring for 125 rings,
and $2,500 for the conference championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With just a little over two minutes left to play in the Super
Bowl, and St. Louis and Tennessee tied, 16-16, the Rams got the
ball on their own 20-yard line after the Titans kicked it into the
end zone. Tennessee, after trailing by 16, had the momentum. What
was Rams coach Mike Martz, then the offensive coordinator, thinking
when he called the next play, which turned out to be an 80-yard
scoring bomb from Kurt Warner to Isaac Bruce? ``Time dictated what
we did,'' said Martz, explaining perhaps the most explosive play in
Super Bowl history. ``I said to myself, `Let's go for something
deep with all four of our guys (receivers) and see if we can hit a
big one.' I thought, at best, we might get into field goal range.
There were five seconds left before the two-minute warning. So we
could run the deep pass routes, and our guys could rest during the
two-minute warning to catch their breath. If we were under two
minutes, or coming out of the two-minute warning, we wouldn't have
called that play, because if it didn't work, our guys would have
been tired and had trouble running the next few plays after that.
Bruce was our first look. He had the man-to-man when Kurt threw the
ball out there. I thought we had a chance for the catch, but I
couldn't believe it when I saw Bruce make a move after the catch
and get the touchdown. But if the time on the clock had been
different, we wouldn't have called that particular play.'' . . .
Most teams thought the Raiders were off the wall when they picked a
placekicker, Sebastian Janikowski, with the 17th choice on the
first round, but not one of the smarter people in the game, Bill
Polian, general manager of the Colts and Executive of the Year in
the NFL. ``He has the kind of talent to be picked there,'' said
Polian. ``If he doesn't have any problems in his deportation case _
and I'm sure the Raiders have done all of their research _ he
should be a great addition for them. However, my only question is,
what are they going to do about his salary down the line? How will
his next contract impact their salary cap, when it comes about?
That would be my big concern. But as far as talent, this kid has
it.'' Janikowski, a native of Poland who played at Florida State,
has been charged with trying to bribe a police officer, and faces
possible deportation if found guilty . . . In the two weeks before
the draft, just about every NFL general manager, player personnel
director, or team psychiatrist was on the record somewhere in the
media across this great land of ours talking about teams looking
more carefully than ever at the ``character'' of players in the
draft. And guess what? They were right: Every single ``character''
on the board was taken by someone, which just shows that, no matter
what a player has done in the past, talent will outweigh character
every day in the NFL. Teams will find an excuse, or invent one, to
take someone who can play, and it isn't going to change no matter
how much they talk about it. Winning is still No. 1.

UNDRAFTED, UNDAUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You are a member of the Undrafted. You watch the NFL's
selection show for two days, knowing in all likelihood your name
won't be called. As the last round commences, you feel fortunate
that you didn't put all your hopes into a childhood aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the draft, just as you begin envisioning
life after college football, the phone rings. Is it the NFL scout
who said, ``Stay close to the phone,'' during Round 5? No.
</P>
<P>
   It's your agent. Another team wants to sign, ``So let's go for
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it happened for University of Massachusetts
defensive back Jerard White, who was fortunate enough to sign with
his team of choice _ the Tennessee Titans _ after the Washington
Redskins' interest in him waned.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern linebacker Zach Falconer, who signed with the
Oakland Raiders, had all but given up after the draft and was
considering a co-op job _ until his agent called and relayed the
news that a contract was in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Eitzmann, the Harvard tight end who was signed by the
Patriots, was among the fortunate ones, as he had a choice between
New England and the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   They are among several players from local schools who made NFL
rosters as rookie free agents, and they hope to take advantage of
the 11th-hour opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear people say that guys from smaller schools
can't play with players from larger schools,'' said Eitzmann. ``I'm
going to find out if that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Other area players who signed include New Hampshire running back
Dan Kreider, who signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and
Connecticut defensive back Jordan Younger, who signed with the
Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Maine sports information officials said Black Bears linebacker
Brent Naccara has been invited to the New York Jets camp and soon
will sign a free agent contract.
</P>
<P>
   Though the three free agents from the Massachusetts schools come
from different backgrounds _ Eitzmann is from Hardy, Neb., White
from Fort Washington, Md., Falconer from Boston _ their stories are
quite similar and probably typical of many players who sign as free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up with NFL aspirations but had shelved those dreams
for more reachable goals by the time they reached college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to work in communications, and I was just
using football as a means of earning a college degree,'' said
White. ``Just shows that anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until they were well on their way toward obtaining a
degree (White and Eitzmann have degrees, Falconer graduates this
spring) that the idea of making it to the NFL resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   For all three, the idea came about after a shift in fortunes.
None was more striking than that of White, who in 1997 merely
wanted to finish up school after the Minutemen endured their worst
season (2-9) of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Then came new coach Mark Whipple, who brought in a winning
philosophy, a few skilled players, and a scheme that led to a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   He also moved White from safety to cornerback, and as the team
drew more attention, so did individuals like White. He had 15 pass
breakups in 1998, second on the school's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he led the team with 7 interceptions and 13 pass
breakups to go with 43 tackles and 2 fumble recoveries. That earned
him an invitation to the NFL combine, but even before that, he
began following the Titans, hoping they would sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent (Alan Herman) called me right after the draft,'' said
White, who thought he had a chance after teammate Khari Samuel was
drafted by the Chicago Bears in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't upset that the Redskins didn't call back because I
always wanted to go to Tennessee anyway. Everything worked out to
my advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before they got to the Super Bowl, I began following
them, and they do a lot of things on defense similar to what we do
at UMass, the way their corners and safeties play aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Eitzmann had a stellar career as a tight end, but he benefitted
from the attention given to Harvard teammate Isiah Kacyvenski, who
was drafted by Seattle in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely tougher for someone from a small school to get
a real good look,'' said Eitzmann. ``I think he did a lot for me.
He showed at the Blue and Gray game that Ivy League guys could play
with the big guys, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many players, Eitzmann had an opportunity to become
acquainted with the team that would eventually sign him. He worked
out for Patriots scouts and coach Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens called him during the seventh round and again after
the draft, expressing interest in him and another player. But he
told them he was signing with the Patriots, a team he was more
familiar with, and one on which he would have a better opportunity
because of uncertainties at tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was so excited that they were showing interest,''
he said. ``It's a good situation for me because I know a lot about
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   For Falconer, a two-thirds qualifier entering Northeastern, the
idea of making it to the NFL began making sense to him over time _
after he was switched from fullback to linebacker after his second
day at camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a work in progress, something that has come
along slowly,'' said Falconer.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Eitzmann and White, Falconer didn't receive word for
two days and had all but given up.
</P>
<P>
   That was until his agent, former NU and Raiders standout Sean
Jones, called and told Falconer that his former team had invited
him to camp, and that the contract would be mailed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't spoken to them,'' said Falconer. ``My agent
has handled everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all three undrafted players, getting a shot at the pros as
free agents has more than offset the disappointment of not seeing
their names and images flashed on the screen during the draft show
last weekend.

EDWARD LOGUE, VISIONARY CITY PLANNER, IS REMEMBERED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Mass.) By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Undaunted by the fact that he was doing the impossible,
Edward J. Logue roared up and down the East Coast from the 1950s to
the 1980s like an urban renewal whirlwind, building and rebuilding
precincts on which others had given up hope: downtown New Haven,
Scollay Square in Boston, Roosevelt Island and Charlotte Street in
the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Robert Moses and the anti-Robert Moses all at once,''
said Lawrence P. Goldman, president and chief executive of the New
Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, who once worked for Logue,
speaking of New York's other master builder of the mid-20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could think as big as Moses,'' Goldman said, ``and had no
less ability to implement. `I'm not inclined to generate plans that
don't get built' was one of his favorite assertions. But unlike
Moses, he was as committed to social transformation as he was to
physical building. Roosevelt Island had the most ambitious
socioeconomic mix of any new town in the U.S. and, possibly, the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Logue died Jan. 27 in his home on Martha's Vineyard at 78.
Goldman and hundreds of other friends and former colleagues planned
to gather here Saturday for a memorial service at Faneuil Hall,
restored as part of Logue's ``Walkway to the Sea,'' within sight of
the monumental, modernist Government Center complex that supplanted
ragtag Scollay Square in the mid-1960s, under his watch.
</P>
<P>
   They were coming with memories of a time when ``urban renewal''
was a promise, not a threat; when city planners thought big, not
just in physical scale but in social ambition, believing that good
architecture made good neighborhoods, and that economic integration
made even better neighborhoods; and when they possessed _ for
better and worse _ the political capital necessary to override
community opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Logue was the development administrator of New Haven from 1954
to 1960, development administrator of the Boston Redevelopment
Authority from 1961 to 1967, president and chief executive of the
New York State Urban Development Corp. from 1968 to 1975 (and,
almost simultaneously, president of the Roosevelt Island
Development Corp.) and, finally, president of the South Bronx
Development Organization from 1978 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bloodless administrator being recalled Saturday,
however, but a robust and pugnacious man whose convictions,
constitution and language were always strong. It was not so much
the successful builder of 33,000 housing units statewide but the
gambler who tried _ and failed _ to develop 900 low-income
apartments in nine Westchester County towns, facing a death threat
as he did so.
</P>
<P>
   It was young Lt. Logue of the Army Air Force in World War II,
going AWOL from the Mediterranean theater to visit his injured
brother, Frank, in France, risking court-martial. ``That tells you
much about his values, fearlessness and willingness to break the
rules,'' said Frank Logue, the former mayor of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Michael F. Groden, director of the planning office for
urban affairs in the Archdiocese of Boston, conjured another image
from the war: Logue as a bombardier, surveying whole cities below
him from an airborne bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that created in Ed,'' Groden said, ``was the sense of the
big picture of a city in a very graphic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Logue's tactics would see the same image in a far
less benign light. ``Logue tosses people and small businesses
around ruthlessly,'' the urban analyst Jane Jacobs said in 1970.
Logue and his allies always dismissed such charges, invoking his
motto of ``planning with people.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no question that he was not a man to stand on
niceties. Or business as usual. Or zoning. Or bureaucratic
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Mayor John F. Collins armed Logue with broad,
centralized powers as development administrator. He used that
latitude to hire inventive architects for an untraditional
Government Center in a very traditional town. The new City Hall,
with its honeycomb concrete facade looming like a great inverted
pyramid, was downright revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the function of distinguished architecture and
imaginative civic design to see that beauty is the hallmark of the
renewed city,'' Logue said in 1967, at the end of his tour at the
Boston Redevelopment Authority. ``Beauty once flourished in Boston.
It must again.''
</P>
<P>
   You would still get a debate here as to whether Government
Center is beautiful. But Anthony Lewis, a columnist for The New
York Times, attested personally to the allure of this reinvigorated
city, in remarks he prepared for Saturday's service. ``I came back
to this country from London in 1973, and the Times publisher let me
choose where I would live.'' he said. ``I chose Boston: Ed Logue's
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, having lost a mayoral campaign here, Logue was invited
to meet Gov. Nelson Rockfeller of New York to discuss a new kind of
agency, to be called the Urban Development Corp., that was to build
affordable housing and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this corporation going to be subject to local rules, zoning
and codes?'' Logue asked Rockefeller and Stephen Lefkowitz, then a
lawyer for the state and now a partner at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam
&AMP; Roberts, who recounted the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' the New Yorkers answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's no damn good,'' Logue replied, waving his hand.
``It's not going to mean a damn thing. You've got to bypass all
that.'' After Logue left, the governor turned to Lefkowitz and
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's what we've got to do. Do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted powers of eminent domain, exemption from local zoning
and the ability to sell its own bonds, the UDC (now Empire State
Development Corp.) undertook 115 housing projects across the state,
including three entire ``new towns,'' the most famous being
Roosevelt Island, into which residents started moving in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   On a long, narrow spit in the East River that had been home to
hospitals, insane asylums and prisons, Logue proposed an entirely
new, socially and economically integrated community of 18,000
people, saying he wanted to prove he ``could get in the city of New
York people of different income levels to live harmoniously and
send their children to the same schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally compelling for many who knew Logue was the numerically
more modest effort to build low-income apartments in Westchester,
100 in each of nine towns, including Bedford and Somers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Furious resistance met the plan. Just before one town hearing,
word reached Logue's office that a death threat had been received
and that some of those attending might be armed.
</P>
<P>
   Logue went anyway, recalled Richard A. Kahan, who was to head
the UDC himself one day but was then a fledgling staff member
accompanying the boss. Arriving at the meeting hall, Logue ``took
the most prominent position, folded his arms and sat down like
Buddha,'' Kahan said. ``I thought, `This is courage.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the nine towns plan foundered and led to a dilution by the
Legislature of the corporation's broad powers. Worse was in store.
By 1975, it was bankrupt, and Logue resigned. That was not be his
last act on the New York stage, however. He returned to head the
South Bronx Development Organization. ``He was not armed with the
development powers that were his hallmark,'' recalled Mitchell
Sviridoff, former president of the Local Initiatives Support Corp.,
which helped finance Logue's efforts. ``This was to be bare
knuckles, hand-to-hand combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was one of the most enduring images of contemporary
neighborhood renewal: 90 ranch houses with big backyards and white
picket fences, owned by the people who live in them, on what had
been rubble land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the most difficult project I undertook,'' Logue
said in 1985. ``In retrospect, building Roosevelt Island, tramway
and all, seems easy.''

NO-WIN SITUATION FOR STAR-CROSSED PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Glen Day, Olin Browne, Rich Beem, Brent Geiberger, Paul
Lawrie, J.L. Lewis, Tom Pernice Jr., Kirk Triplett, Jim Carter,
Brian Henninger, and Dudley Hart. Pretty good golfers, but you
wouldn't place them ahead of Ernie Els, David Duval, Davis Love, or
Nick Price.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each of those players has cashed a winner's check since the
last time Els, Duval, Love, or Price won a PGA Tour event. Heck,
Duffy Waldorf, David Toms, and Notah Begay have won twice since any
of those four superstars finished first.
</P>
<P>
   Which proves what?
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of good players capable of winning at any
particular time.
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   The best players don't always win _ but you'll drive yourself
crazy trying to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Duval squandered a great opportunity to win the
Masters. Last week, Els fell apart down the stretch at the MCI
Classic. In both events, Love was on the leaderboard, only to fall
short. Combined, these four greats have played 131 times without a
win, dating back more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Duval hasn't won since the BellSouth in March 1999, an 0-for-23
stretch. That triumph culminated an amazing period of 11 wins in 34
starts, so you could say things have changed for him. He concedes
that he put too much emphasis on winning the Masters at the expense
of other tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Els last won in Los Angeles a year ago February. Not that he has
disappeared (he's put up 11 top 10 finishes since then), it's just
that he may have forgotten how to close out a tournament. Is that
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said Els after blowing a
four-shot lead early last Sunday at the MCI. ``I just lost it. What
can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Love. His last win was at the MCI in 1998. Since then?
Zero for 52. And Price? He's 0 for 30 since taking the FedEx St.
Jude Classic in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If he were playing poorly, he'd be worried, but Love said,
``I've been close and had a lot of exciting things happen in
between. So it hasn't been grinding on me or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The others may subscribe to that thinking, too, since all are
playing well this year. Els, Duval, Love, and Price are ranked
seventh, eighth, ninth, and 16th, respectively, on the money list
and have 14 top 10s among them. But each has achieved a status
where the primary goal is to win _ so on that count, they are
coming up short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As tough as things may seem for Els, Duval, Love, and Price,
there are others off to slow starts in 2000, equivalent to batting
below .200 in April. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Elkington has gone 15 rounds since he last broke 70. In
23 rounds, he has shot under par just six times, and he missed the
cut at Doral, where he was defending champ.
</P>
<P>
   --In 14 tournaments, Ted Tryba has not finished better than
T-21, and he has missed the cut six times. His first round of the
year was an 80 at the Mercedes, and in each of his last three
tournaments before this week's Greater Greensboro Classic, he has
had at least one round of 80 or worse.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Pate had his best finish of the year (T-15) at the MCI
last week, just the third time in 10 starts he was able to have at
least two sub-70 rounds in the same event.
</P>
<P>
   --In eight starts, Justin Leonard has yet to finish in the top
10. In his last 19 medal rounds, he has broken 70 just three times.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With very little fanfare, Seve Ballesteros defeated Colin
Montgomerie in singles, 2 and 1, to lead Continental Europe past
Great Britain &AMP; Ireland in a competition called the Seve
Ballesteros Trophy. What happened Sunday was vintage Seve. He is
ranked 590th in the world now (which means there's probably a
player from Newton Commonwealth ahead of him) and should have been
swamped by the planet's third-best player. But Ballesteros did the
unthinkable: He found a few fairways, and even his errant drives
were playable. Consequently, he was often around the putting
surface in regulation, and his genius could shine through there.
And shine it did. Ballesteros birdied three of the first four
holes, had seven one-putts, and needed just 27 putts overall to
dispose of Montgomerie, an overwhelming favorite, who conceded:
``This was a point we felt was secure.'' Usually, the putting
stroke and short game fade first with older players, but
Ballesteros is a maestro with the flat stick and anything he chips
with. A generation of fans has witnessed only a glimpse of
Ballesteros _ his refusal to exit gracefully. The 81-81 at the
Masters, which included a 9 at the par-5 13th Thursday and a 9 at
the par-5 15th Friday, was sad, particularly for those of us who
consider Ballesteros one of the genuine heros of the sport . . .
Montgomerie, by the way, reportedly is set to put the new Callaway
ERC driver in his bag, even though the club has failed USGA tests
and is banned in this country. The Royal &AMP; Ancient, however, does
not adhere to the same springlike effect test applied by the USGA,
so the club _ which has an ultra-thin face and has been billed as
the company's ``hottest driver ever'' _ has been sold in Japan and
put into play on the Australasia Tour by Michael Campbell . . .
Move over Aaron Baddeley, there's another amateur from Australia
making noise. His name is Adam Scott, 19, and he shot a 63 in the
Greg Norman Holden International this winter. He is playing in
Morocco this week and has sponsor's exemptions into a few more
European Tour events this year . . . Baddeley's next start will be
in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in three weeks, a tournament to
which former US Amateur champ Hank Kuehne has been invited . . . So
there was Annika Sorenstam lining up a birdie putt when a member of
the animal kingdom entered the picture: a wild turkey. Sorenstam
calmly chased the intruder off the 10th green at last week's Longs
Drugs Challenge, then made her putt . . . Karrie Webb goes for her
fifth win in five starts this weekend at the Chick-fil-A Charity
Championship.
</P>
<P>

   Arnold Palmer considered doing something he has not done in a
long, long time: withdrawing from an event. Despondent after
opening with an 87 in the PGA Seniors Championship last week,
Palmer told his partners, David Graham and Andy North, ``I'm not so
sure I'll see you on the first tee.'' Graham wouldn't hear of it.
``I told him he'd never quit in his entire life,'' said Graham, who
encouraged Palmer to try out a new set of clubs. Sure enough,
Palmer dug into the trunk of his car, brought out a set of Callaway
Hawk Eyes, and shot a 1-under 71, his first sub-par round this
year. Had Palmer drained a birdie putt on the 18th, he would have
shot his age, a fact that did not escape North. ``If he'd made that
last putt, I wanted a copy of the scorecard I was keeping when he
shot his age,'' said the two-time US Open champion. The King missed
the cut, but the 71 had him in great spirits. ``It makes me want to
play again,'' he said . . . Jack Nicklaus followed his spirited
opening act at the Masters with a solid effort at the PGA Seniors
Championship. He shot 71-71-72 and finished in a tie for 12th, then
said he most likely wouldn't tee it up on the Senior Tour until the
US Senior Open in late June, two weeks after the US Open at Pebble
Beach, which Nicklaus will play . . . Speaking of the Seniors
Championship, it will move next year to Ridgewood CC in Paramus,
N.J., ending a long and sometimes quiet run at PGA National in Palm
Beach Gardens. Crowds were very small for the tournament and it was
somewhat fitting that its farewell was tortured by the weather (it
took five days to play three rounds) . . . Can you say, ``Look out
below''? Leonard Thompson was 4 under entering the final round of
the Seniors Championship when he got into the express elevator
going down, shooting an 85 to lose a bunch of cash. Had he closed
with an even-par 72, Thompson would have made $58,000; instead, he
got $3,400. The biggest hurt came at the par-3 15th, when Thompson
hit four in the water and took an 11 . . . Still, he whipped Phil
Tataurangi by seven. The New Zealander shot 92 Thursday in the
first round of the Greater Greensboro Classic, somehow managing
more double bogeys or worse (seven) than pars (six). Amazingly, he
was 2 under through four holes on the back before going 8 over on
the next five holes to make the turn in 42. He hit three balls out
of bounds at the par-5 second, took an 11, then made three more
doubles and two bogeys for a 50 on the front. He was trying to play
with a pinched nerve, just making ``half swings.'' . . . John
Bickerton of England was lining up a putt on the second hole at
Sunningdale during the Seve Ballesteros Trophy when he got smacked
in the right thigh by a ball struck by Lee Westwood _ his teammate,
no less. Seems Westwood, who had hit a short drive and was unable
to see Bickerton on the sunken green, thought the group ahead had
moved to the third tee. Bickerton said the ball stung, though his
sense of humor was intact. He told Westwood, ``I'm only sorry it
bounced so far from the pin.'' . . . Lawrie, by the way, is not
exactly taking the US pro tour by storm. He finished eighth at the
Mercedes but has missed three cuts in four medal-play events,
finishing T-73 in the other.

TV SCHEDULE KEEPS TEAM ON THE BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Did you notice that the NBA playoffs started Saturday?
If you did, you can take that three-day vacation and not miss a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, we look at the NBA playoffs the same way Bob
Hope used to regard the Oscars. As in, ``Gee, I wonder what it must
be like?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, even those who are still playing are angry _ there's
negativity elsewhere _ and with good reason. The NBA, in its
infinite wisdom, is kowtowing to TV once again with scheduling, and
it's worse than ever. Teams are being told to play a game, wait a
few days, play another, wait a few days, and so on. What is this,
the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rick Pitino would gladly trade places with any of the 16
men still on their coaching feet, but that misses the point. Pat
Riley called the scheduling ``absolutely insane'' and he's
absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   Look what the Knicks have in store. They open Sunday afternoon
against Toronto, with Game 2 Wednesday and Game 3 next Saturday in
Toronto. That's three games in seven days. The reason? NBC wants to
have Vince Carter on at least twice, which wouldn't be the case if
the schedule were normal and the Knicks swept the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat opened with Detroit Saturday and will host Game 2
Tuesday. Game 3? Saturday. Game 4? The following Wednesday.
Charlotte and Philadelphia play Saturday, Monday, Friday, Monday.
</P>
<P>
   I must be mistaken. I always thought the goal of television was
to increase viewer interest in the playoffs. Let's say,
hypothetically of course, that there's a down-to-the-wire decision
in Game 1 somewhere. And Game 2 would be when? 2007? That is not
how you hold viewers. It's how you push them away.
</P>
<P>
   We all know television has been running the playoffs for years.
It's television that blocks off two weeks for each series. It's
television that insists the NBA Finals are on after the May sweeps,
even though the Finals, with the exception of last season,
generally get pretty good ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But where was the voice of reason when this first-round schedule
was decided? The NBA is not a league that plays every third day.
It's a league that plays three games in four days, four days in
five, back to back. Most teams have maybe three or four breaks over
six months when there are no games over a three-game stretch. The
Celtics had one stretch this season in which they played fewer than
five games in a two-week stretch. And that was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allowing people to almost get bored, waiting four days
for games in the playoffs when people want it now,'' Riley said.
``You've been making them wait all year long, 82 games, and now
you're going to make them wait two weeks to get through five
games.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to devote two weeks to the playoffs, make them
all best-of-seven. Otherwise, do what you used to do and end the
season on a Sunday, with the playoffs starting Thursday. That
allows for a far more reasonable playoff schedule, not the
silliness we have now. But after the kind of season we've had, why
did we expect common sense to prevail?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, the ubiquitous owner of the Mavericks, no doubt made
a lot of friends among his peers with his comment in Friday's
Dallas Morning News. Cuban isn't afraid to spend money, that's for
sure. ``We're going to push the envelope,'' he said. ``I don't give
a care about the luxury tax.'' Cuban also said he fully expected
the Mavericks to make the playoffs next season. ``I won't accept
anything else,'' he said. Sentiment is growing among some Mavs to
keep Don Nelson aboard for another year. The Mavericks were an
eye-opening 9-1 in April, although Nellie lost out to Charlotte's
Paul Silas for Coach of the Month honors (the Hornets were 9-2).
Dallas, by the way, was 31-21 after Cuban emerged as the
owner-to-be. Throw out the ridiculous Dennis Rodman experiment, and
the record was even better . . . Dallas wasn't the only lottery
team that, like the Celtics, finished strong. The Mavericks beat
the Lakers, Seattle, and Portland in April. Houston won 10 of its
last 15, and that included wins at Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix
as well as a home win over Utah. The Nuggets won their last four,
beating Utah and Portland. Did you notice that the Trail Blazers
were casualties of all three teams? Hmm. Vancouver, meanwhile, lost
seven of its last eight, leaving soon-to-be-released coach Lionel
Hollins with an 18-42 record. That happens to make him the
winningest coach, percentagewise (.300) in Vancouver history. The
Grizzlies' best player, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, met with new owner
Michael Heisley last week. Abdur-Rahim said he might seek a trade
if Heisley, as expected, cleans house and gets rid of Hollins and
GM Stu Jackson . . . The Hornets-Sixers series and the Pacers-Bucks
series have one thing in common: Neither is deemed acceptable fare
for NBC. Each of the other six series will have at least one game
on network television. Those two are condemned to cable . . .
Speaking of the 76ers: They won 17 games by 3 points or fewer
(including two against the Celtics). That's one shy of the record
set by the 1966-67 St. Louis Hawks, who happened to have a player
named Paul Silas on their roster . . . Here's something to take
from the Celtics' season. They won 35 games. Twelve, or more than
one-third, were wire-to-wire wins in which they never trailed. The
Bulls played 96 minutes in the FleetCenter and never had a lead.
The Knicks, by contrast, won 50 games, but had only five
wire-to-wire wins . . . While we're on the subject of the Celtics,
it might be prudent to address the one thing they did more than any
other team: foul. We can't single out the press; they didn't press
that much. The Celtics also were the leaders in opposition free
throws (which, of course, is a cause/effect kind of thing).
Opponents took more than 31 free throws per game against the
Celtics. No other team was as high as 30. The Celtics also finished
next-to-last in blocked shots and, for the first time since
1979-80, no Celtic averaged as much as one block per game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pervis Ellison is not coming back. We know that. He knows that.
He knew that a long time ago. But that did not stop him from trying
to play the gray eminence role after the Celtics went Jerry
Springer during the game at Orlando. (Apparently, Pitino has
forgotten that incident, as he glowingly talks about how much he
loves his team and how great they are to be around. Remember the
``major suspensions'' and ``major trades''?) It can be hard for a
veteran who rarely plays to be taken seriously. But Ellison, who
knew he wasn't going to be around, nevertheless spoke like someone
who would be and like someone who cared. ``My concern was for those
guys to have a mental approach going into next season that was not
damaged. If you have a losing season, it's tough to get out of that
mindset. It's tough to lose. Take Antoine (Walker). He's been on a
losing team since he's been in the league. That's tough. Anytime
some kind of adversity comes up next year, you can't have someone
saying, `Here we go again.' It's more. You have to have an
understanding of why things happened. I mean, really understand.
You can sit down and have meetings all day, but if you don't
understand why you're losing, you'll be in the same boat next year.
Paul (Pierce) and Antoine are two great pieces. But they're also
young pieces. It's tough on those guys. Losing has an effect on
you. The big thing is: don't let this carry over to next season.
Have the guidelines in place, as opposed to dealing with it when it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, who missed the entire season, appears to be the
only Net left in Don Casey's corner. Reports out of New Jersey
indicate Casey is a goner. It's the life of a coach. Casey never
had a full deck, but neither did P.J. Carlesimo or Alvin Gentry.
They're out, too. Casey is approaching impending dismissal with his
typical, self-effacing style, which endears him to so many. ``The
only thing I ever plan is a pension,'' he said. ``In this league,
you could literally have a bus crash and every player has a broken
leg and you bring in a CBA team and lose and they'll say, `You
didn't win.' That's hard.'' Meanwhile, Keith Van Horn was talking
about the Nets being cursed with bad luck, which led the New York
Post's Fred Kerber to observe, ``Obviously, this young man has not
been around the Nets long enough. At .378, this was their second
most successful season since 1994 and their fourth best since
1986.'' . . . Ron Mercer had some interesting comments regarding
his wish to remain in Orlando. ``I learned about playing hard every
night,'' he said. ``I never did that before.'' . . . If Darrell
Walker has, indeed, coached his last game for the Wizards, he
certainly went out of town in a blaze of glory. His comments
following the Wizards' pathetic performance against Boston were
right on target. How many coaches would dare to call their players
``gutless'' and suggest that several should be shipped out of town?
``I know what kind of player I was,'' Walker said. ``Maybe not the
most talented, but pretty talented. I came to play every night.
This did not make sense. You have guys who don't need to be on this
team whether they can play or not.'' Walker may be given a job in
the organization, since Michael Jordan is determined to add
basketball people to the basketball operations staff. Among those
Jordan reportedly is interested in: Buzz Peterson (who withdrew
from consideration at the University of Houston) and B.J.
Armstrong. The latter is expected to be offered a job in the Bulls'
organization as well . . . The Celtics and Nuggets finished with
identical records, so there would be a coin flip to determine the
10th pick in the draft. The loser gets the 11th.

THE `NAMES' ARE DROPPING IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Smith, calling the shots in the Chicago
Blackhawks' front office since December, will take another couple
of weeks before deciding what to do about his club's coaching
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rush,'' said Smith prior to leaving Chicago for a
scouting mission in Zurich. ``You have that luxury in the
offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   If Smith decides to give Lorne Molleken his walking papers,
don't be surprised if the new head coach is not a household name.
The job of being a bench boss, Smith believes, has evolved to the
point that clubs no longer are concerned about hiring ``name''
coaches. He also doesn't believe it's critical to hire someone with
NHL experience, be it as a player or coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's vital is that he has head coaching experience
somewhere,'' said Smith. ``And the key there is not so much knowing
X's and O's. What's most important is that he can get a team to
overcome adversity, because that's what this business is about,
getting over adversity, putting a team together.''
</P>
<P>
   Molleken began this season as Chicago's head coach after taking
over for the final 23 games of the 1998-99 season. But that changed
when the Hawks opened the season a miserable 5-15-4. In the
overhaul, GM Bob Murray was fired and Bob Pulford was brought out
of mothballs to work the bench with Molleken. When the smoke
cleared, Smith was brought aboard as GM and the Pulford-Molleken
combination steered the Hawks to a 33-39-10 finish _ the third
straight year Chicago missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's coach, wherever he's coached, has to have dealt with
today's athlete,'' said Smith. ``We are in different times now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, said Smith, are the days of the whip hand. Players have
money in the bank. Some are teenaged millionaires. It isn't the
money alone that makes them different, or indifferent, but
financial security somehow triggers a numbing effect, leading
players to tune out coaches who try to rule and instruct through
intimidation. They're immune to the scare tactics of old, when
coaches waved bus tickets before their eyes or caught their
attention with an old-fashioned two-handed stranglehold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yellers and screamers aren't entirely extinct,'' said
Smith, ``but it's getting close. Today's players don't want to hear
that. They don't want to be humiliated in front of other players in
the room. The days of intimidation are over. Screaming and berating
didn't have long-term effectiveness anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does all this leave Molleken? Probably out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The working assumption around Chicago is that because Smith did
not endorse Molleken after the season, a change will be made.
Working Wisdom Part 2 has Smith hiring Maple Leafs assistant Alpo
Suhonen as head coach. Smith was the GM in Winnipeg when Suhonen
worked for the Jets and was instrumental in bringing Suhonen to
Toronto when he was restructuring the Leafs. Now an assistant with
Rick Ley in Toronto, working behind coach Pat Quinn, Suhonen will
be contractually free when the Leafs' season comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Next season the Penguins will have Ivan Hlinka, once head coach
of the Czech National Team and now working aside Herb Brooks in
Pittsburgh, as head coach. The 51-year-old Suhonen, who once
coached the Finnish National Team (1982-86), could be the second
European to head an NHL bench.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen is not exactly a household name, but if Smith is right,
the name game among coaches is going, going, and almost gone.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Word is that Bruins defenseman Don Sweeney, a free agent July 1,
doesn't plan to return to Boston. ``It certainly would be prudent
for him to listen to things,'' said his Boston-based agent, Mark
Witkin. ``Honestly . . . I think . . . well, there's nothing
happening now. Don's away right now on vacation, and when he gets
back, he'll probably sit down with Harry (Sinden) and talk.
Certainly it's not a guarantee that he'll stay, but I don't think
he's come to any decision. He's still decompressing.'' . . . Plans
remain in the works for ex-Bruin Ray Bourque to develop a twin-rink
facility north of the city, in conjunction with the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the Bruins. ``It's still very much in the
preliminary stages,'' said Bourque's longtime agent, Steve Freyer.
``Construction prices can be frightening for a project like this,
and right now we're trying to get those numbers in focus.'' . . .
While the Calgary Flames are on a mission to get season tickets
boosted from 9,000-plus to 14,000, the expansion Minnesota Wild
already cracked the 13,000 barrier. The Wild's new rink, about 75
percent complete, will include a hockey museum that will display
everything related to Minnesota hockey, including sweaters from
high school teams and those of the NHL North Stars and the WHA
Fighting Saints . . . The Wild hired Brian Israel from the Celtics'
staff to be media relations coordinator, working alongside Bill
Robertson, long one of the NHL's top PR directors . . . What about
Curtis Joseph's five-star nutty Monday night, bolting from the
Toronto net like an escapee from ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest''? Referee Mick McGeough was upended, another sad display of a
player's lack of control. Some of these guys (hello, Marty
McSorley) might want to band together and get a group rate for an
anger management course . . . Seeing the overflow crowds in Denver,
it was hard not to think about how the scenario might have played
in Quebec City, former home of the Nordiques/Avalanche. But
consider this: When the Providence Bruins recently played two
playoff games there against the Citadelles, the average crowd was
about 2,000. The night after Game 2 of that AHL series, some 14,000
filed into Le Colisee for a junior game between the hometown
Ramparts (owned by Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy) and Moncton. The
fact that the Citadelles are affiliated with Montreal, a hated
rival from the Nordiques' days, might have been a contributing
factor for the downsized AHL crowd . . . A beer commercial touting
Molson Canadian has rocketed to instant cult status throughout the
provinces. The spot, called ``The Rant,'' has actor Jeff Douglas
(``I am Joe Canada'') espousing the many virtues of his homeland,
underscoring and celebrating how it differs from the US. When it is
shown on rink messageboards, Canadian fans embrace it almost as a
second national anthem. Hardly fair, is it? After all, they already
have the best national anthem. Douglas showed up in Toronto last
week and recited the spot live before a frenzied Air Canada Centre
crowd. He then journeyed to the Corel Center for another command
performance, this time making it a pro-Ottawa soliloquy that poked
fun at the evil empire in Toronto . . . MIT/NHL brain teaser of the
week: If the net were 3 feet by 8 feet instead of 4 x 6 _ but still
a 24-square-foot hole _ would it lead to more or less scoring?
Caution: Answer cannot be given in smoots.

   The Kings went into their first-round series with little chance
of beating the powerful Red Wings anyway, but ex-Bruins Glen Murray
and Bryan Smolinski were of little help with lackluster play in the
4-0 sweep . . . Garry Galley, an unrestricted free agent July 1,
has had some preliminary talks with LA management about returning
next season . . . The Hawks have the Nos. 10 and 11 picks in the
June amateur draft. ``I don't think we'd make a deal to move up,''
said Smith. ``But it could make sense to move down with, say, one
of those picks and add a pick in the process.'' Smith on the draft
in general: ``It's a better year in Europe (for picks/prospects)
than it is in North America. It seems that way more and more,
doesn't it? But you can't fix your team through the draft. The
draft is a future fix.'' . . . Another Witkin client, ex-BC Eagle
Jeff Farkas, came to terms with the Maple Leafs on a two-year deal
that included a reported $675,000 signing bonus. While the Leafs
were facing the Senators in Ottawa, Farkas was working out at Maple
Leaf Gardens. If the Leafs decide against pushing him into the
playoffs, Farkas will head for the World Championships in St.
Petersburg, Russia, which begin Saturday . . . Don't be surprised
if Eric Lindros ends up in Toronto next season, especially if the
Leafs don't make a return trip to the Eastern Conference finals.
Toronto is one of the few clubs with the kind of income to pay
Lindros $8 million-plus. The Flyers won't get much in return, but
letting Lindros go would be addition by subtraction, and not just
to the bottom line . . . Anyone notice that Paul Allen dumped a
load of Microsoft stock late last month, bringing in a gross $2.3
billion? Allen would be the prime bidder for the Flames, should
they bolt Calgary, and he would move them to Portland, Ore. What's
$70 million or so for a man with that kind of wad in his pocket? .
. . No word on a front-runner for the Rangers' GM vacancy. In
contention: Don Maloney (current assistant GM), Colin Campbell
(ex-Ranger coach and now NHL disciplinarian), and John Davidson
(multimedia legend). Rest assured, former coach Mike Keenan already
has inquired about both jobs. One NHL insider is positive that
Oiler boss Glen Sather, fed up with the Byzantine ownership
situation in Edmonton, will make a serious play for the Rangers job
. . . Ex-Bruin defenseman Jim Schoenfeld, last seen as head coach
in Phoenix, has surfaced as a pitchman for a mattress company in
the Buffalo/lower Ontario area. Always good to have a fallback
position. He is also working for ESPN and showed up in Phoenix as
color man for the Avalanche-Coyotes series . . . Arthur Pincus, the
NHL's vice president of public relations from 1993-99, recently
signed up with WeMedia.com as VP for programming and content.
WeMedia.com will provide webcasts from the Sydney Paralympics in
Australia Oct. 18-29, and plans extensive, year-round internet
coverage of sports events for the disabled . . . NHL commissioner
Gary Bettman brokered the Coyotes sale, with Richard Burke handing
over ownership to the Ellman Co. for a reported $87 million. Word
around Phoenix is that Ellman will retain ownership for
approximately three years, then flip the club to a new owner when
the Coyotes' sparkling new home is built. Hall of Famer Wayne
Gretzky is mentioned as a possible suitor for the Desert Dogs.
Can't you picture the Great One's Coyotes going up against Mario
Lemieux's Penguins one day in the Cup finals?

EASLER HAS CARDINALS ON POWER TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No one blinks anymore, of course, at the news that home
runs are flying out of St. Louis at a record pace. As long as Mark
McGwire is wearing a Cardinals uniform, visitors will assume that
the Arch was designed to replicate the flight of one of Big Mac's
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the unexpected aspect of the Cardinals' power surge:
Big Mac has been a spectator for much of it. McGwire was sidelined
as of April 11 with back pain (inflammation of the lumbar region of
the spine) until returning to the lineup Thursday, but in his
absence, his teammates took aim at the fences on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards came into the weekend leading the majors in home runs
with 39, which puts them on pace to hit more than 400 this season.
They had hit at least one in 12 consecutive games. They've hit
back-to-back home runs in seven games. Catcher Eli Marrero last
week hit the first grand slam of his career, and then hit a
412-foot solo home run. Rick Ankiel, the rookie pitcher, followed
Marrero's second home run and went deep as part of a 3-for-3 night.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of 14 position players had hit home runs for the
Cardinals, the only exception being leadoff man Fernando Vina, who
has been a terrific table-setter, with a five-hit game and a
four-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the damage the Cards may do when McGwire is healthy
again and Ray Lankford, who as late as Wednesday was hitting just
.120 and was 1 for 16 with runners in scoring position, begins
swinging like he's capable.
</P>
<P>
   And who oversees this collection of Cardinal mashers? None other
than the Hit Man, former Red Sox coach Mike Easler, who is in his
second season as St. Louis hitting coach. Easler, best known for
being Mo Vaughn's personal tutor, has made an impressive return to
the big leagues after it appeared his string had run out when he
left the Sox after the '95 season and became head coach at National
Christian University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   There were snickers when Easler surfaced as manager of the
independent Nashua Pride in 1998, but no more, not after Tony La
Russa reached out and added him to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim Johnson, who returned to the big leagues this season as an
advance scout for the Brewers only to quit for what he called
personal reasons, will manage the Mexico City Reds of the Mexican
League again this summer. Johnson, who lost his job as manager of
the Blue Jays a year ago after being caught lying about serving in
Vietnam, led Mexico City to a championship last season. Johnson,
who distinguished himself in the minor leagues with the Dodgers and
Cubs and as Kevin Kennedy's bench coach with the Sox, hopes someone
will give him another chance in the majors . . . Cincinnati Reds
manager Jack McKeon thinks Holyoke's Mark Wohlers may be back in
the big leagues by June 1. Wohlers, who experienced a Steve
Blass-like loss of control and then underwent elbow surgery,
recently had a bullpen session in Cincinnati in which Sean Casey
and Ken Griffey Jr. swung at 27 of his 35 deliveries. He was
clocked in the low 90s . . . It hasn't taken long for former Sox
outfielder Damon Buford to hear that his job might be at risk in
Chicago. Buford, dealt to the Cubs for utility infielder Manny
Alexander, entered the weekend with a .186 average after a 4-for-28
slump and was benched twice last week, replaced in center field by
Tarrik Brock and Sammy Sosa. Meanwhile, highly touted Cubs prospect
Corey Patterson, playing for Double A West Tennessee, broke out of
a slump of his own Wednesday by going 4 for 7 with two home runs
and seven RBIs in a doubleheader. Cubs manager Don Baylor, who
played with Buford's dad, Don, with the Orioles, said the
20-year-old Patterson is at least a month away from a promotion.
``But the more he hits,'' Baylor said, ``the more we'll be talking
about it.'' . . . Ex-Sox player of the week: How about Elvis,
a.k.a. Mike Benjamin, who came into the weekend hitting .500 (9 for
18) for the Pirates . . . Vaughn, after missing third base to cost
the Angels a run in a 7-1 loss to the Blue Jays: ``I've been in
this league 10 years. I've been around too long for something like
that to happen. It's just stupid. Really. I'm disgusted.'' . . . A
pleasant surprise for the pitching-challenged Angels has been
lefthander Scott Schoeneweis, who is 3-0 and has given up just
three hits in each of his last two starts. Schoeneweis, 26, is a
former Duke University All-American who graduated with a degree in
history and cracked Mike Scioscia's starting rotation after making
31 appearances out of the bullpen last season. Lynn's Ken Hill,
meanwhile, has been bombed (15 runs on 16 hits in 7 IP) his last
two starts, and has a 1-3 record with an 8.84 ERA. Hill insists his
elbow is OK, but speculation has begun that Tim Belcher could claim
Hill's spot when he comes back from a rehab assignment . . . The
Big Unit, Randy Johnson, faced 102 consecutive batters without
issuing a walk until Larry Walker drew a base on balls in the
fourth inning Thursday night. Johnson, who averaged 120 pitches per
start last season and threw more pitches than any other big
leaguer, has gone 133, 112, 109, and 101 pitches in his four
starts, the last three of which have been complete games. He also
has had the first two three-pitch innings of his career, against
the Giants and Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Pat Rapp continues to be a pleasant surprise for Baltimore
after being cut loose by the Sox, the Orioles believe Scott
Erickson is just one rehab start away from returning to the
rotation. Erickson, who had surgery to remove bone chips from his
elbow, is due to pitch Tuesday for Single A Frederick. Rapp,
meanwhile, is 2-0 for the O's, who have gotten off to a much better
start under new manager Mike Hargrove (9-5 entering the weekend)
than they did against the universally discredited Ray Miller
(3-11). ``For any club it's essential to get off to a good start,''
Hargrove said. ``It makes things so much easier. I don't know that
many pennants are won in the first two, three weeks of the season,
but I guarantee there have been a lot lost.'' . . . Some thought
they'd detected slippage in Billerica's Tom Glavine in 1999, when
he won just 14 games after winning 20 the year before, and his ERA
climbed from 2.47 to 4.12. But the Braves lefthander, who held the
Phillies to a run in seven innings last week, is 3-0. In his last
22 starts dating to last June 15, Glavine is 14-4 . . . The
American League's most potent offense three weeks into the season?
No, not the usual suspects, like the Cleveland Indians. And no, not
the Blue Jays or Mariners, who took turns last week running up
football scores. Try the White Sox, who began the weekend hitting a
league-best .305, with 105 runs, and were second in slugging and
on-base percentage. Quietly, GM Ron Schueler has assembled some
good-looking kids who have been bashing the ball, including Magglio
Ordonez, Carlos Lee, Paul Konerko, Greg Norton, Jeff Abbott, and
Chris Singleton. By the end of the season, they may be joined by
Joe Crede, who was the Carolina League MVP in 1998 before
undergoing foot surgery last year . . . The Blue Jays' seven-game
homestand was a shocking display of pitching ineptitude for a team
that came into the season touted as having one of the best young
staffs in the league. In seven games against the Angels and
Mariners, the teams combined for 201 hits _ that's nearly 29 a game
_ and 142 runs (63 for the Blue Jays, 79 for the opposition). There
were 84 extra-base hits, including 33 home runs. With one pitching
coach in the division already gassed _ Rick Williams of the Devil
Rays, since hired by the Marlins as a big league scout _ it wasn't
a comfortable week for Rick Langford, Toronto's first-year pitching
coach . . . They were finally cooled off by the Blue Jays Friday
night, when their eight-game winning streak came to an end, but the
Yankees woke up Saturday morning with the best record in baseball
and are off to their best start since 1988. What has to be most
discouraging to the Bombers' pursuers is that they've been winning
with lefty Andy Pettitte and third baseman Scott Brosius on the
disabled list, no production from their DH, and ace closer Mariano
Rivera proving mortal for the first time in almost a year. Rivera
gave up a game-tying home run to Texas catcher Pudge Rodriguez. How
deflating was that to the Bombers? The next inning, little-used sub
Clay Bellinger hit a winning home run on an 0-and-2 pitch. As
usual, the Yankees have showcased their phenomenal depth: Ramiro
Mendoza, Lance Johnson, and Bellinger have emerged from the
background to play big roles in wins. Jorge Posada, handed the
everyday catching job when Joe Girardi was allowed to leave, is off
to a great start, as is 37-year-old right fielder Paul O'Neill,
mocking the Yanks-are-getting-old theorists. And you will find a
growing list of people, Joe Torre included, who will argue that El
Duque, Orlando Hernandez, is the best pitcher in the American
League outside of Boston's No. 45 . . . Until Rodriguez took him
deep, Rivera had converted 27 straight save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought the presence of Tommy Harper was going to
jump-start Boston's running game must not have noticed that the
former base-stealing champion is confined to the first-base
coaching box. The Sox tied their own big league record by not
stealing a base until their 14th game, when Trot Nixon swiped one
against the Tigers Wednesday night in Detroit. The Sox of Sam Horn
in 1987 were the last team to go that deep into the season without
a theft. But Harper notes that with Donnie Sadler in the minor
leagues and Darren Lewis primarily on the bench, the Sox have just
two legitimate stealers in Jose Offerman and Carl Everett. What
this team does have, Harper insists, is a number of players who run
the bases well, who know how to go first-to-third, second-to-home,
and make intelligent decisions. That list would include not only
Offerman and Everett but Nomar Garciaparra and Nixon . . . The
Yankees are running more this spring than in the recent past. With
new first base coach Lee Mazzilli in charge of base-running, the
Bombers were successful on 14 of their first 20 steal attempts.
That included Derek Jeter stealing five times in his first six
attempts after stealing 14 bases all last season . . . Hipolito
Pichardo, who pitched two hitless innings in Sarasota, may be no
more than a week away from a promotion to Pawtucket and could loom
as another successful Dan Duquette reclamation project. Pichardo,
who when healthy was one of the Royals' better starters, hasn't
pitched in the big leagues since having elbow reconstruction
surgery that cut short his '98 season . . . Indians catcher Sandy
Alomar has been an All-Star six times. Alomar, out with a strained
hamstring, has now gone on the disabled list eight times . . .
Texas outfielder Rusty Greer reluctantly underwent surgery to
remove bone spurs from his right ankle, but the Rangers figure the
long-term benefits outweigh losing him for 4-6 weeks . . . The
Dodgers claim that Orel Hershiser, who hit four batters in 1 1/3
innings to tie a big league record last week, didn't have enough
time to warm up before the game because the starting time was
pushed up five minutes for TV. Manager Davey Johnson took the rap
for not informing Hershiser of the change.

PLETCHER LEADS DERBY CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Trainer Todd Pletcher was once an assistant to D. Wayne
Lukas, but he never thought he'd come close to starting as many
horses in one Kentucky Derby as his prolific former boss.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has saddled the most starters overall with 33,
started a record five in the 1996 Derby, including winner
Grindstone. He also had Prince Of Thieves (third), Editor's Note
(sixth), Victory Speech (11th), and Honour And Glory (18th).
Pletcher won't match his mentor's mark, but, barring injury, he'll
come close, with four starters in this year's Run for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher, who worked for Lukas from 1989-95, intends to enter
Trippi, More Than Ready, Graeme Hall, and Impeachment. Pletcher had
a big day April 15, when Graeme Hall won the Arkansas Derby at
Oaklawn with Impeachment third, and More Than Ready ran second to
High Yield, trained by Lukas, in the Blue Grass at Keeneland.
Trippi has earned his chance to run at Churchill Downs by winning
all four career starts, including the Flamingo Stakes at Gulfstream
April 8.
</P>
<P>
   The son of trainer Jake Pletcher, Todd, 32, saddled his first
winner, Majestic Number, at Gulfstream Park in February 1996 and
came to prominence in 1998, when he scored the most stakes wins in
New York (13) while winning 20 races at Saratoga to lead the
standings. This year will mark his first try at the Derby, and
he'll be involved in a major way, as all four of his colts have
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to feel,'' said Pletcher in a conference call
from Keeneland. ``It's a strange and unusual situation. It is a
dream everyone dreams. If you had told me everything would come up
so well in April, I wouldn't have believed you. I'm surprised and
delighted. Wayne had tremendous success while I was with him, and I
don't see how that can't help me. I was part of his organization at
the time Thunder Gulch won the (1995) Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready, a son of Southern Halo, out of a Woodman mare,
was a star as a 2-year-old, winning five of seven starts. However,
he faded in the fall, running third in the Belmont Futurity and
fifth in the Champagne, and was held out of the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile. He came back this year to win the Hutcheson at Gulfstream
(in a dead heat with Summer Note) and run second to Mighty in the
Louisiana Derby, and proved he could handle 9 furlongs by finishing
a close second in the Blue Grass. His career record is 10-6-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi is a son of End Sweep, out of a Valid Appeal mare. He has
high speed and should be a prominent pace factor in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Hall, a son of Dehere, out of a Crafty Prospector mare,
has been steadily improving, and his Arkansas Derby victory put him
over the top. He has a career mark of 8-3-3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a son of Deputy Minister, out of a Misconduct
mare, and is a deep closer. He was flying at the end of the
Arkansas Derby, coming from last, some 30 lengths behind, to lose
second (to Snuck In) by a bob of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of my horses are somewhat speed-oriented,'' said
Pletcher, who rides John Velasquez on More Than Ready but is
holding the other three mounts open. ``Trippi is the fastest,
though, and he'll be forwardly placed. More Than Ready will be
somewhere close if there's not a problem on the first turn. But he
won't be on the lead. Graeme Hall is not necessarily a
front-running horse. That's just the way it worked out (when he
went wire-to-wire in the Arkansas Derby). He controlled a
comfortable pace, but that's not the way it has to be. Impeachment
will trail the field into the first turn. He's absolutely a one-run
horse. As for the distance of the Derby, the question of 10
furlongs is one everybody's got to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to have a speed duel, per se. More Than Ready
is comfortable wherever you put him. Trippi has a lot of speed.
Graeme Hall is versatile. But I certainly hope I don't see all
three of them battling for the lead. I don't think it will happen
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   While presumptive Derby favorite Fusaichi Pegasus was earning
the lion's share of the publicity by winning the Wood Memorial at
Aqueduct April 15, Pletcher's charges were displaying promise in
Arkansas and Kentucky. More Than Ready, Impeachment, and Graeme
Hall were all shipped to Churchill Downs Monday, joining Trippi,
who was already stabled there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the overall outcome last Saturday,'' said
Pletcher. ``But we wanted to win the Blue Grass, of course. All our
horses are settling down nicely at Churchill. Trippi worked 5
furlongs in 1:01 on Tuesday, and he handled the track very well.
I'm delighted that he got over it so well. Churchill can be a
tricky surface, and not all horses get over it. We'll see about the
others, but More Than Ready can run well over any surface. He
doesn't need to carry his track with him.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Pletcher may have learned from Lukas, who is a
consummate salesman, is how to juggle multiple owners. Keeping the
people who pay the bills happy is never easy, especially when their
horses are competing in the same race.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi and Impeachment are owned by Dogwood Stable, a public
outfit managed by Cot Campbell, a fine horseman himself. More Than
Ready is owned by James Scatuorchio, who made his money on Wall
Street and is retired. Graeme Hall is owned by Laura and Eugene
Melnyk, who live in Barbados. Eugene is chairman of the board of a
pharmaceutical company, and they name all their horses after
Barbados landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prepare each of the horses the best way I can,'' said
Pletcher. ``I hope all four run well. There are no favorites to be
played, and we are doing the best job we can. We try to do the best
with every horse in the barn. Hopefully, that's what gives our barn
an edge, and that's why we've been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one winner of the Derby, no matter how many
horses you start. And winning is what we're interested in.''

FOR WALTRIP, IT WAS A MARATHON WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ NASCAR Winston Cup driver Michael Waltrip says he was
compelled to participate in last Monday's 104th running of the
Boston Marathon _ after driving 500 hard miles a day earlier in the
DieHard 500 at Talladega, Ala. _ for no other reason than this: ``I
just did the Boston Marathon because I could. It's kind of like
getting the chance to play Augusta National or something like that.
If you get that kind of an opportunity, you about have to do it. I
think it's just fun to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 31st in the 43-car field at Talladega, Waltrip
climbed out of his No. 7 Nationsrent Chevrolet Monte Carlo, hopped
a jet to Boston, and toed the starting line the next morning in
Hopkinton with more than 17,000 other runners. He finished 14,316th
in a time of 4 hours 42 minutes 20 seconds, earned the distinction
of being the only entrant in the field to have run both the Boston
Marathon and the Daytona 500, and dispelled the notion that race
car drivers aren't really athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing at all that compares a marathon to what I do
in the race car,'' Waltrip said. ``Racing is my job and I'm very
serious and very intense about it. I want to beat everyone on the
track. I just did the Boston Marathon for the experience of it, to
see what it's like to run through where all of those college kids
are screaming and to come in at the end in front of all of the
crowds. That is the sole reason I did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put a competitive spin at all on my running, unless it
is with myself. Nor do I compare running the Boston Marathon to
running the Daytona 500 or vice versa. One's for fun and the other,
while I enjoy doing it and I love my job, there is a switch that
goes on once I get into the race car that separates me and my focus
from, say, the people who have done the Richard Petty Driving
Experience (driving school).
</P>

   ``I have people who come up to me all the time saying, `I've
done the Richard Petty Driving Experience. I know what it's like
for you.' Well, that's like me going up to one of those Kenyan
dudes and saying, `I know what it's like.'

   Waltrip said his goal was to finish in 4:34, but a 20-minute

   ``After making the first 13 miles in two hours, I saw that
wasn't going to be possible,'' he said. ``I walked through the
watering stations and then got on down the road. I was running in a
pretty large group the whole time. If I would have had a little
kick to give it there at the end, I probably could have passed
1,000 of them. But that wasn't what I was there for.''

   He was there to soak up the atmosphere and the pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's the nature of this world to ask, `Where'd you
finish?' or `How come 14,000 people beat you?' '' Waltrip said.
``That's not what running is about to me. I have to be so
competitive and so intense with my job that when I get out on the
road, I just run. I enjoy running. I do it for the fun of it.''

   Going winless over a span of 13 races might not be such a long
period for most NASCAR drivers, but given his track record, it
seemed like a drought for Jeff Gordon, who returned to Victory Lane
with last Sunday's triumph in the DieHard 500. Gordon became the
ninth different winner this season and captured his 50th career
victory, becoming the second driver this season to do so, after
Rusty Wallace won his 50th at Bristol, Tenn. Gordon and Wallace are
now tied with Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson on the career victory
list. ``This has been a great treat for all of us on the team,''
said Gordon, who delivered his new crew chief, Robbie Loomis, his
first victory with the No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet. ``But one victory
doesn't make a season. We know that we still have a lot left to
accomplish.'' What was most amazing about Gordon's victory was the
fact that he came from the 36th spot in the starting grid. Also
astonishing was the crowd's reaction: They cheered Gordon, who had
come to be resented by fans for his winning ways. It was just two
years ago that he tied a NASCAR record with 13 victories. ``I can't
say that I took them for granted,'' Gordon said. ``I think the
whole time we knew how special of a season we were having in '98,
but I've got to be honest with you, when you pull into Victory Lane
the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th time, it's not the same feeling. I think
when you work hard and you don't go to Victory Lane and time goes
by, I think you do start to respect it a lot more and realize how
hard it is and how competitive it is to get into Victory Lane.'' .
. . Geoffrey Bodine, who celebrated his 51st birthday Tuesday, got
back behind the wheel of his No. 60 Power Team Chevrolet for a
NASCAR test session Wednesday in Richmond, Va., just 61 days after
suffering extensive injuries in a horrific truck crash at Daytona.
``It was great,'' he said. ``I really missed this _ I missed the
people, the team, and the challenge. I was worried because I didn't
know how long it would take (to get the feel back) but it took
about two laps.'' In all, Bodine did 10 laps, with eight at full
speed. He is aiming to get back to full-time competition for the
NAPA Auto Parts 300 next Sunday at California Speedway in Fontana.
But car owner Joe Bessey isn't pressing Bodine. ``We've got a lot
of re-understandings about a lot of things that need to happen
before Geoffrey gets back in the car,'' Bessey said. ``The main
thing is he's able to get back in the car. I don't think there's
going to be any question about his ability. I'm sure it'll take a
week or two for him to get comfortable.'' . . . Though he has yet
to record a Winston Cup victory, Matt Kenseth moved ahead of Dale
Earnhardt Jr. in the race for Raybestos Rookie of the Year honors.
With his 18th-place finish at Talladega, Kenseth took a 2-point
lead (94-92) over Little E . . . Meanwhile, Tony Stewart, last
year's Rookie of the Year, is struggling. A sophomore jinx,
perhaps? Stewart has yet to lead a race this season and has had to
rely on provisionals to make the field in his last three races.

   Jeff Simmons, 23, of East Granby, Conn., made his Indy Lights
debut last weekend at Long Beach, Calif. Simmons, a 1998 Boston
College graduate, was impressive in starting fifth and finishing
fourth for Team Kool Green. ``I thought it was a great way to start
the season,'' said Simmons, who made the jump to the Indy Lights
after winning back-to-back titles in the Barber Dodge Pro Series.
``But I still feel like I have a lot to learn yet.'' Simmons spent
the last few days testing at Laguna Seca in Monterey, Calif., and
at Portland, Ore. Though he is familiar with several of the venues
on the 12-race Indy Lights schedule, Simmons will have to make a
transition to the high-speed ovals at Michigan and California
speedways. ``I don't think it's going to be a shock,'' he said.
``But it's going to be one of those tracks where you're (going)
over 200 miles per hour with about 20 cars all around you, so it'll
get your attention real quick.'' . . . It was a banner weekend all
around for Team Kool Green, which had its banner raised by Paul
Tracy's victory in the CART FedEx Championship race. Tracy captured
his first victory of the season after starting 17th, weaving his
way through the pack on the winding street circuit at Long Beach,
where passing historically has been difficult . . . Greg Ray and
Juan Montoya, the reigning open-wheel champions of the Northern
Lights Indy Racing League and CART FedEx Championship Series,
respectively, were 1-2 in a veteran open testing session April 10
at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Ray posted the fastest speed with a
hot lap of 220.713 miles per hour, while Montoya, whose previous
oval experience earned him advanced placement among the crop of
Indy 500 rookies, was second-fastest in 219.780. ``I don't feel
like a rookie,'' said Montoya. ``I was able to come out with some
very fast times in practice. It hasn't been too hard to adjust to
the new track. Every time I go out in the car, my adrenaline gets
flowing. I'm always trying to push the car to the limit.'' . . .
Sarah Fisher, 19, who is aiming to become the youngest female to
start the Indy 500 as driver for Derrick Walker Racing, took a step
toward that objective by passing her four-phase rookie orientation
with flying colors. ``Indy is probably the neatest place I've ever
run, and it's an honor to pass the rookie test here, especially
with Derrick's return here and my beginning,'' Fisher said. ``I'm
really proud to be here. It's a difficult racetrack to learn, and I
think the most difficult thing I'm learning is the line. Every time
I go around, I gain more and more confidence. I still have some to
gain from a driver's perspective, and we still have some more work
to do on the car, but it's definitely starting to come together. We
just need more practice and more laps, and then we will be
flying.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their self-imposed deadline was 5 a.m., and as the
minutes ticked away before federal law-enforcement officials had to
decide whether to seize Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint, Attorney
General Janet Reno was on the phone to lawyers for the boy's Miami
relatives, appealing to them one last time to end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are running out of time,'' an aide to the attorney general
recalled Reno as having said, describing her voice as emphatic but
laced with emotion and fatigue after all-night negotiations.
``You've got to decide now,'' Reno said. ``That's all the time you
have.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, as Reno held the phone in her office at the Justice
Department, a team of eight agents, some of them armed and wearing
body armor and jumpsuits, swarmed into the house of Elian's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It was just the kind of raid, armed
and confrontational and carried out under darkness, that the
officials had said for weeks was the situation they wanted to
avoid. In fact the image of an armed federal agent flushing the boy
from a closet was displayed on television all day.
</P>
<P>
   Within three minutes the agents were gone, taking the child to a
waiting minivan, ending a five-month-long custody battle that had
haunted Reno, who had tried, and repeatedly failed, to conclude the
case without the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning after the raid, President Clinton said that
Reno had made the right decision and that he supported her. ``The
law has been upheld,'' he said, ``and that was the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She made the decision,'' Clinton said. ``She managed this. But
I fully support what she did. And it was clear to me from our long
conversations that we were in agreement about this.'' He added, ``I
think she did the right thing, and I'm very pleased with the way
she handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials, who had scheduled the
operation for Saturday, had said that they had to begin the
operation no later than 6 a.m., when traffic lights in the area
would change from flashing amber to the normal red and green and
when crowds were expected to gather.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives complained that they were on the phone
with Reno asking for more time as the agents stormed the house.
Reno aides confirmed the account, but said that she had warned them
for hours that time for negotiations was rapidly coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, the immigration service commissioner who was by
Reno's side throughout the night, said the agents' commanders had
asked to be told no later than 3 a.m. whether to begin the raid, a
deadline that stretched another hour as the talks dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 a.m., Reno warned representatives of the relatives that
time had all but expired. ``At one point she said, `Don't make us
do what we don't want to do,''' an aide said. ```We're going to
take a law-enforcement action and we don't want to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The final assault team left its staging position around 5 a.m.,
which Justice Department officials said was the last possible
moment when the raid might have been called off. They said Reno
gave the relatives a final five-minute warning before the operation
began.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which agents had rehearsed for nearly two weeks,
hinged on their ability to carry out a lightning raid, with little
warning to local authorities, who federal authorities feared were
sympathetic to Cuban-Americans in Miami and might compromise
operational security.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, from the immigration service, some wearing shirts
indicating they were U.S. Border Patrol officers, arrived in force,
some carrying automatic weapons, sidearms and pepper spray. The
weaponry, officials said, was needed to ensure the safety of Elian
and the agents. The authorities were concerned about the
possibility of violence from small numbers of political extremists
believed to be among the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, Reno said that she had received
information that there might be guns ``perhaps in the crowd,
perhaps in the house'' and that agents were armed as a justifiable
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   She said Elian's Miami relatives left the government no
alternative but to take the child by force.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I informed the parties that time had run out,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   She expressed frustration over the actions of the relatives in
the long standoff. ``Every time we thought we had achieved what we
wanted, it wasn't enough,'' Reno said. ``It was just one step after
another in which they moved the goal post.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken by a photographer for The Associated Press who
was in the house during the raid showed one of the fishermen who
had rescued Elian at sea five months ago backed into a closet,
holding the startled-looking boy, as a helmeted agent in assault
gear held them at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the photograph, Reno said the gun ``was pointed to
the side'' and the agent's ``finger was not on the trigger.'' Reno
did not say whether any weapons had been found in the house.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours ticked down to minutes, Reno held out hope for a
settlement as civic leaders in Miami tried to broker a deal. From
her office, Reno relayed proposals and counteroffers between
lawyers for Elian's father and the Miami relatives, keeping hope
alive for a negotiated outcome, aides to Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' first proposals were so vague, the aides said,
that Reno demanded specifics before she took them to Gregory Craig,
a lawyer for Elian's father. ``The attorney general said she wasn't
going to take an offer that did not contain the components that we
knew would be required,'' an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks continued, Justice Department officials said, they
began to doubt that the lawyers in Miami were getting cooperation
from the family, who seemed to remain unwilling to surrender the
child unconditionally to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded to come up with a more concrete proposal, the relatives'
lawyer suggested that Elian be moved to a group home in a neutral
location in which father and son would live with the Miami
relatives while a federal appeals court decides whether the child
should remain in the United States, aides to Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig rejected the idea, officials said, countering with the
father's longstanding demand that Elian be turned over immediately,
but agreeing to move to a residence where the relatives would be
able to visit the child.
</P>
<P>
   The indirect discussion, carried out by telephone and fax
between Washington and Miami, bogged down and collapsed. Reno
polled her aides on whether time had finally come for the
law-enforcement action, officials said. Eric H. Holder Jr., the
deputy attorney general, said Reno's advisers were unanimous in
urging her to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   After two telephone conversations on Friday night between Reno
and the president, she advised Clinton of the status of the final
efforts to break the impasse, but did not focus on the timing or
specifics of the use of force to retrieve the child.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Reno had already discussed the potential risks of
such an operation on Wednesday night while returning from Oklahoma
City. Aides said they agreed to use a force that was large enough
to defend itself but one that would be the least traumatic to the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 2:45 a.m. the White House chief-of-staff, John D.
Podesta, who was receiving hourly updates from the Justice
Department, telephoned Clinton in the White House residence. The
president had postponed a trip to Camp David on Friday night, but
aides said it was because of weather. The aides said Clinton had
said he would support the tactical operation if the negotiations
seemed fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta woke the president just before 5 a.m. to advise him that
the talks were at a stalemate and that Reno had ordered the raid.
Half an hour later, Podesta called back to report that the
operation had been a success.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, as officials watched the raid, Holder
said he felt sadness. ``It was not an easy thing to see a boy of
that age carried out like that,'' he said.

 &HT;    Burkett hurt; Chen steps in
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves' intentions for their fifth starter's job
became less clear Saturday night. Or did they?
</P>
<P>
   When John Burkett left the game after three innings with
stiffness in his right shoulder, Bruce Chen threw three scoreless
innings to earn a 4-2 victory over Pittsburgh. After frittering
away the No. 5 job with a dismal spring camp, the left-hander might
wind up with the job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their sixth game in a row and their seventh out
of eight. Though the bullpen game up its first run in a week, John
Rocker worked the ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones' solo homer in the fifth inning, his fourth of the
year and his second in four games, gave the Braves a 2-1 lead. That
advantage grew to 3-1 the following inning, Keith Lockhart's
fielder's choice with the bases, loaded scoring Wally Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates scored one run in the seventh, Jason Kendall coming
in from third on a Kevin Young ground-out. That run, off Braves
rookie Luis Rivera, was the first score yielded by the Braves
bullpen in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett was gone before it was dark. After hurting himself while
pitching to Brian Giles in the third, he was able to finish the
inning, facing three more hitters, but was replaced by Chen, who
was recalled from Class AAA Richmond on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While manager Bobby Cox had said beforehand he hoped to get five
to seven innings from him, Burkett needed 68 pitches just to get
through three. Noted for his control, Burkett threw just 38 strikes
(55 percent) and went to ball-three counts against six of the 15
hitters he faced. He threw nine balls in 11 pitches at one point in
the third, when the Pirates got their first run, but then struck
out John Vander Wal on three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox refused to view Burkett's first start as a determinant
of his status with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's savvy,'' Cox said before the game. ``He's only as old
(35) as the rest of our starters. People are talking about him like
he's 50 years old. I mean, the guy can still pitch. I don't put any
emphasis on tonight's game at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves opened the bottom of the first with three straight
singles to load the bases but got only one run out of it. After a
sacrifice fly by Wally Joyner, Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones were
stranded by Brian Jordan's strikeout and Javy Lopez's ground-out to
Pirates starter Kris Benson.

WILL HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE HELP OR HURT LAKERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The question isn't whether the Lakers are up to
the challenge of bringing Staples Center its first professional
championship and Los Angeles sports fans their first professional
championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the arena and the fans are up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The only practical benefit of having won an NBA-best 67 games in
the regular season is that the Lakers earned the home-court
advantage in all four playoff rounds. But how much of an advantage
will that turn out to be, should the team have to lean on it in a
close series?
</P>
<P>
   The stereotypical image of L.A. crowds _ late to their seats,
early to their cars, quiet enough to eavesdrop on the stars in the
$500 seats _ has only grown more painfully accurate since the
Lakers moved from the Forum to Staples Center at the start of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson notices the fans with the cellular phones pressed
to their ears, waiting for a camera to point their direction, then
waving to a friend watching on TV. He never saw that at United
Arena, let alone Chicago Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play in a different (kind of) arena,'' the head coach said
the other day at the Lakers' practice facility in El Segundo,
Calif. ``It's not loud. The focus is sometimes not on the court.
Sometimes it's on the people in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an entertainment arena.''
</P>
<P>
   At a basketball arena, a season like Shaquille O'Neal's would
have elicited a nightly ``MVP!'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   But not until March did a Staples Center crowd take up the
campaign. It was the night O'Neal dropped 61 points on the
Clippers. The twist is that it wasn't technically a Lakers crowd.
It was a Clippers home game, with Clippers season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, at Lakers home games, ``MVP!'' chants have been
attempted in the upper deck but haven't caught on at sea level.
</P>
<P>
   A number of excuses could be made for the audible absence of
passion.
</P>
<P>
   The 19,282-seat Staples Center, its stands sloping gradually
away from the court, is so vast that crowd noise gets lost in
space.
</P>
<P>
   The high ticket prices squeeze ``real fans'' out of the
building, leaving the choice seats on the lower luxury-box levels
to corporate types and friends of season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   The ``real fans'' are relegated to the upper deck and in the
rafters nobody can hear you scream.
</P>
<P>
   Add the annoying fact the lights in the Staples Center stands
aren't dimmed during the action, and it's no wonder fans tend to
stare at each other as much as at the game. (Or so I'm told; I, of
course, pay rapt attention to the court at all times.)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers players and coaches don't complain. But after a season in
the downtown arena, they must know their home-court advantage isn't
what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   They went 36-5 at home, 31-10 on the road. The five-game
difference was only 20th best in the NBA this year. The Lakers'
home-court edge has been smaller only twice in the past 25 years.
Of course, the fact they were good enough to win everywhere they
went had something to do with that; but a five-game difference is
relatively low even compared to previous teams with 65-plus wins.
</P>
<P>
   In the first-round playoff series against the Sacramento Kings,
the home-court edge will be dulled further by the weird calendar
demanded by NBC television executives. The Kings will use the
unusual gap between today's Game 1 and Thursday night's Game 2 in
Los Angeles to fly home for three nights. They wouldn't be able to
do that on the normal every-other-day schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Kings will sleep in their own beds for all but
three nights in a 13-day span if they're able to stretch the series
to a decisive Game 5 in Los Angeles on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   So it's up to the people who pile through the turnstiles and
call themselves Lakers diehards to make sure the Kings remember
they were here. The Staples Center may never become known as The
Pit or The Madhouse. But it can be louder.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to sit on your hands, go to the opera
instead. If you need the message board to tell you when to yell,
give your ticket to a kid or a Clipper it might be his first
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the scoreboard to encourage the crowd,'' Jackson
said. ``I like it when the crowd connects with the players because
they're enthusiastic about the effort the players are putting out
on the court, that's when that energy becomes real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crowd can get it going sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now would be a good time. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers enter the playoffs as everyone's
darling, but their path of least resistance to the title got a
slight jolt this week, and they have no one to blame but
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There were some frowns from Laker quarters when they
unexpectedly learned the Spurs had gained home-court advantage in
their first-round matchup with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Lakers were not completely aware that under the
NBA's tiebreaker system, the Spurs were capable of gaining
home-court advantage against the Suns in their first-round playoff
series if they defeated the Lakers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs defeated the Lakers 103-98 in overtime in the regular-
season finale.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers assumed that if the teams tied with the same record,
Phoenix would gain home-court advantage. The teams split their
season series 2-2, but the Spurs won the tiebreaker because they
had a better record against Western Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   If that had been known before the game, it's doubtful that such
Laker bench-warmers as rookie John Celestand would have played 24
minutes, or Travis Knight 21, or Devean George 19 at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have done things a little differently (Wednesday
night),'' a Lakers source said.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem like a small matter, what with everyone
conceding the NBA title to the Lakers, but nobody worries Phil
Jackson like the Spurs, provided Tim Duncan's knee heals in time
for him to be a factor in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Without Duncan, the Spurs showed Saturday they probably won't be
able to beat Phoenix. But with him, the Spurs match up better with
the Lakers than any other team. And the Lakers would have loved to
see San Antonio open the playoffs without home-court advantage
against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have lost eight of their past nine games to San
Antonio, including a 4-0 thrashing in last year's playoffs, and
Jackson isn't taking any chances in seeking an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   He already fired up the Spurs by suggesting an asterisk be
placed in the record book next to their championship because it was
won during a 50-game season (maybe he'd like one next to his
championships in Chicago, because they were won with Michael
Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to see that Zen stuff work in Dallas or
Vancouver,'' Spurs guard Terry Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   NET SEARCH: The Nets are expected to officially fire Don Casey
on Monday, and the short list has already been compiled. The
biggest name is Isiah Thomas, but every other candidate also has
NBA experience. They are Nets assistant Eddie Jordan, former Nets
forward Buck Williams, former Nets forward Rick Mahorn and ex-Laker
Byron Scott.
</P>
<P>
   WARRIOR SHUFFLE: Golden State coach/general manager Garry St.
Jean gladly turned over coaching duties to assistant Dave Cowens,
after confiding to friends he was tired of the pressures of the job
and wanted a less stressful environment.
</P>
<P>
   Another Warriors assistant, Rod Higgins, is expected to get the
Wizards job, albeit a few months later then he wanted, after Golden
State refused to let him out of his contract during the season.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELING IN STYLE: Rockets guard Steve Francis earned a early
reputation as a malcontent after saying he did not want to play for
Vancouver, but he's shown a big heart in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When Rockets ballboy Landon Speijhts said he needed a ride for
his high school prom, Francis offered his Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous, though,'' Speijhts said. ``I'll be driving 20 mph
on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYOFF MADNESS: Thanks to TV, the first round of the playoffs
could take 14 days to play five games, and not everyone is happy
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stretch this thing out over two weeks is absolutely
insane,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``You're diffusing the
competitive edge, you're allowing guys to have more preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allowing people to almost get bored, waiting four days
for games in the playoffs when people want it now. You've been
making them wait all year long, 82 games, and now you're going to
make them wait two weeks to get through five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley didn't have to look far to find someone who disagreed.
Heat center Alonzo Mourning favored the take-it-slow approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way you can leave it all on the court, then have time to
rest up,'' Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   FIX IT YOURSELF: The Cavaliers are more than a little nervous
about how Shawn Kemp will spend the offseason. Last year, he was
AWOL for more than six weeks, with the club having no idea of his
whereabouts. It didn't help ease their concern that Kemp showed up
for training camp about 30 pounds overweight and out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine their horror Thursday, when Kemp appeared set for a
repeat disappearing act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to set aside team goals to work on my individual
goals,'' Kemp said. ``I'll worry about the team stuff once I come
back in October. This summer I'm going to worry about myself more
than what's going on in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to worry about Shawn Kemp for a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is crossing its fingers that Kemp means he will be
sequestered in a weight room.
</P>
<P>
   QUALITY BRAND: Still wondering whether Chicago's Elton Brand
deserves to be Rookie of the Year?
</P>
<P>
   Brand finished the season averaging 20.1 points and 10.0
rebounds, the first rookie to average double figures in both
categories since the Spurs' Duncan in 1997-98, and only the fifth
rookie in the '90s to average the double-double. Only 19 rookies in
NBA history have accomplished this feat. &QL;

NORTH TEXAS FOOTBALL PLAYER MAKING PROGRESS AFTER FIGHTING FOR HIS
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 TEXAS-RECOVERY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Shawn Kramer lay motionless in a hospital bed
with tubes and machines connected to his 6-foot-7, 270-pound body.
His size-17 shoes on the floor only a few feet away, this giant
young man struggled as a petite, dark-haired nurse commanded him,
at times without response, to simply squeeze her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer was fighting for his life in the days following his Feb.
26 collapse at North Texas' first spring football scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we met with the doctors that Sunday,'' said Gary Kramer,
Shawn's father, ``they didn't think he was going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months later, Kramer continues making a remarkable
comeback. Emergency neurological surgery at Dallas' Methodist
Medical Center kept Kramer alive after he incurred a blood clot on
his brain and two collapsed lungs. He spent 10 days in a coma, 24
days in critical condition and 35 days at the Dallas hospital
before being allowed to go back to his hometown of Topeka, Kan., to
enter a rehabiliation center.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer is far from recovered, but his medical turnaround has
been near miraculous in the eyes of his parents. His father said
his son is in a state of lethargy that varies between unconscious
and complete consciousness. The physical rehabilitation is
progressing, his father said. Shawn walked with a walker for the
first time last week and he has had conversations with family and
friends in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The mental recovery, as the doctors expected, is going slower.
He can hold a conversation but often can't remember it later. And
even through three hours of daily physical and speech therapy, it
likely will be a long time, if ever, before Kramer can remember the
events leading up to his mysterious collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing very well in therapy,'' said Chris Palmer, a
representative of the Kansas Rehabilitation Center. ``He's
progressing fine, but in his mother's words there's still a long
ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the strides he's made, however, that have his parents
eyeing a new goal _ having him back in classes at North Texas this
fall. That might be wildly optimistic, but his father isn't
doubting his son can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already surpassed anything they said he could do,'' Gary
Kramer said. ``If praying helps, he'll be fine, because he's had
plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Through prayer, the Kramers hope they discover the mystery to
their son's plight. No teammate saw Kramer, an offensive lineman,
take any serious blows at that Feb. 26 scrimmage. After the first
offensive series, he walked to the sideline, sat down on the bench,
then collapsed. Emergency personnel rushed him by helicopter to
Methodist Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the play before, I looked in his face and he was red,''
running back Ja' Quay Wilburn said. ``I just thought it was from
being in the heat of the battle. We got to the sidelines and his
eyes just closed. It was like he was asleep.'' SHOW OF SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's parents recall Shawn telling them he had taken a blow
to the head during workouts on Tuesday that week. They said he was
having headaches afterward and that he sat out of practice on
Wednesday, and was off with the rest of the team on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UNT head coach Darrell Dickey said Saturday the school is not
allowed to comment on an athlete's medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   His parents praised UNT for its quick response once their son
collapsed, and the university's support. Care Flight was at Fouts
Field in less than five minutes, and Kramer was in surgery less
than seven hours after his collapse. And care during the first 24
hours, one medical expert said, is often the key to first survival
and then recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of traumatic brain injury cases where the
recovery seems like an absolute miracle,'' said Dr. Mary Carlile,
medical director of traumatic brain injury at Baylor Institute for
Rehabilitation in Dallas. ``If so, it can be credited to early
care. When you get proper early care you see a lot of good
outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, the Kramers have had a flood of support
from old friends in Topeka to others who never have met their son.
His high school coach, Tom Stringer, and his junior college coach,
Skip Foster, were by his bedside by Monday following his collapse.
He was visited by residents of his dormitory and by high school
buddies. Others sent e-mails to the university, which were
delivered in stacks to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a genuine and very sincere concern from the
students and administration here,'' UNT athletic director Craig
Helwig said. ``Lots of support, lots of prayers. I know the family
was touched by the show of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's parents seemed surprised at the volume of letters and
e-mails wishing Shawn well, considering their son's short stay on
campus. Kramer transferred to UNT in January from Coffeyville
(Kan.) Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had only been here two months, and I'm sure the parents
were concerned about him going to a school where he didn't know
anybody and whether or not he was fitting in,'' Dickey said. ``It
was basically the opposite. They found out he was really fitting in
well and meeting lots of people.'' FITTING IN
</P>
<P>
   For those at UNT who didn't get to know Shawn Kramer, friends
and family from Kansas were more than willing to shed light.
</P>
<P>
   To his parents, he always has been sort of a gentle giant,
usually the biggest kid in his class, which is something he
struggled with at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the big kid,'' Gary Kramer said. ``Sometimes the
big kids don't always have it so easy. My wife and I called him our
big teddy bear. No matter what people said to him, we always told
him, `You can't be fighting people, you're too big.' And he never
did. He just wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer looked past the adolescent teasing to become the epitome
of a student-athlete at Hayden High School in Topeka. He played
football, basketball and baseball and was selected to the National
Honor Society with a perfect 4.0 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't earn a Division I scholarship, but he was determined
to get one. He went to Coffeyville in hopes of improving his
chances. He stayed on track, both athletically and academically,
while at Coffeyville. He started both years and earned a sparkling
3.9 GPA. UNT offered a scholarship last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Denton, friends say, was a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn's kind of a cowboy,'' said Jeremy Branson, a friend from
Topeka. ``He likes those cowboy boots, and his dad just bought him
a truck. Living in Texas fit him.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, at least until his first scrimmage. Shawn's collapse put
the family's life in turmoil. They tried to cope with what
happened, figure out what they could do to help their suddenly
helpless son and all the while wonder if and when he would improve.
</P>
<P>
   They are not worried about medical bills, at least not yet. Gary
Kramer said the bills will first go through their personal
insurance, then through the UNT athletic department's insurance. He
has been told the NCAA's catastrophic insurance policy will cover
any remaining expenses.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how much more progress Shawn Kramer can make, or
whether returning to UNT is a dream or a possibility. But P.J.
Prellwitz, a longtime friend and student at Pittsburg State
University in Kansas, said Kramer has made a habit of beating odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the best player (in football),'' Prellwitz said.
``But he would work harder than anybody else. There are a lot of
guys who may have been better than Shawn who aren't playing
football right now, and he still was.'' nn

U.S. CYCLISTS PUT FAITH IN HUMANS, NOT MACHINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last we saw of them, they were up to their handlebars in
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Their Olympic medal expectations had fallen dismally short.
Their team leader/coach was under fire. Their most-decorated
athlete, though she had one Olympic event still to go, had walked
off the team in disgust, leaving only the message, ``No one
cared.''
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, they sure had a nifty-looking bike.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. cycling program, the Atlanta Olympics prompted a
tempest of emotions. Some saw it as merely a three-week glitch in
what had been a glorious three-year run. Others harked to the
bottom line _ three medals won, no golds, millions of dollars spent
_ and demanded that somebody clean house.
</P>
<P>
   It is, therefore, a humbled and wiser USA Cycling that will
parade its best track racers in front of the Superdrome crowds this
week at the U.S. Olympic trials in Frisco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons, they say, have been learned. The stars of this show
will be the athletes sweating and competing on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the rallying theme had been Project '96, a
multimillion-dollar training and technology program that was
supposed to reverse the United States' long run of cycling
frustrations at the international level. Its star and semi-secret
weapon was a $30,000, custom-made, carbon-fiber,
zero-wind-resistance gazelle called the Superbike II.
</P>
<P>
   But as the U.S. cycling people soon learned, any bike can look
super when you put a primed, wily, world-class veteran cyclist atop
it. The Americans won no events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there was a lot of excitement and interest around
the Superbike,'' said Texas A&AMP;M graduate Sean Petty, USA Cycling's
director of athlete performance. ``Upon reflection, the bike alone
wasn't going to win any medals. I think one of the lessons learned
from '96 was that we needed to focus on the engine and not the
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The world governing body of cycling, UCI, made that point
somewhat moot by outlawing the Superbike technology after the
Atlanta Games. This, after all, wasn't Formula One auto racing.
Turning Olympic cycling into a technology contest would have priced
many countries out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we've gone to pretty much a retro bike,'' Petty explained.
``We're riding bikes that in terms of design, in a way, we would
have ridden 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a lot of ways, it's definitely helped, because it's put
everyone's focus on preparing the athletes physically and
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the names will be new at this week's Olympic trials.
Gone are three-time Olympian Connie Paraskevin-Young, who medaled
at Seoul in 1988, and Rebecca Twigg, the two-time medalist whose
abrupt departure underlined the problems at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the relative newcomers, Jennie Reid, 21, and Tanya
Lindenmuth, 20, are being counted upon to step up in the sprints.
With Twigg retired, the focus has shifted to Erin
Veenstra-Mirabella, 21, as a medal contender in the points race in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, two-time Olympic medalist Erin Hartwell, who
rode the Superbike II, is trying to make the transition from the
kilometer time trial to team pursuit. Marty Nothstein, 29, is back,
after riding to a silver medal in Atlanta in the match sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few years, we learned a lot,'' said Petty, whose
job entails coordinating the program's coaches. ``Atlanta was the
first Olympic Games where professionals were allowed to compete. We
knew they would have a great impact in the road events. But I don't
think anyone saw the impact that the pro road riders would have on
the track events.
</P>
<P>
   ``In team pursuit this year, then, we expect a majority, if not
all, of our team will be made up of pro road riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone is coach Chris Carmichael, the architect of the program's
1995 success who was vilified in Atlanta. Carmichael had summed up
the team's disappointing showing with a breezy ``that's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   With new ``old'' bikes, a new team leader and four years of
humble pie on its plate, USA Cycling will parade its hopeful new
look in front of what should be large crowds at Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Project '00. nn

`MISSING COMPUTER' MAY BRING SECURITY CHANGES AT STATE DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department is considering a
reorganization of its security system after the disappearance of a
laptop computer from an intelligence office with highly sensitive
files about weapons proliferation, a senior administration official
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright may recommend stripping
the department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research of its power
to manage its own security and place it under the aegis of the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the laptop was reported two months ago by
the Office of Intelligence and Research.
</P>
<P>
   The incident stirred an outcry among some Republican lawmakers.
Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, said it was the latest in ``a
long string of security failures'' at the State Department,
including the recent discovery of an eavesdropping device in a
conference room that was believed to have been placed there by
Russian spies.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators have not determined that the laptop was
stolen, its theft would represent the highest possible breach of
classified material, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer contained files designated ``code-level,'' a status
beyond top secret. Officials declined to elaborate on the contents
of the missing material, but confirmed that it involved sources and
methods relating to weapons proliferation, including data gathered
from satellites, and human and electronic sources. New details of
its contents were reported by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Intelligence and Research has been under fire as
having lax security for several years. Department officials
recently considered and rejected a proposal to transfer the
bureau's security to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which
protects United States diplomats and foreign dignitaries and fights
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department internal audit in December found that the
department allowed contractors and maintenance staff in the
building without escorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, who plans to hold hearings into the recent breaches,
charged that the department lacks a ``professional environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign policy analysts ascribed the problems to a culture
that is resistant to onerous security measures, and to budget
cutbacks.

   The New York Times devoted approximately 3 pages to stories and
photos concerning the Elian Gonzalez affair in editions for Sunday,
April 23:
</P>
<P>
   The NYT News Service has moved the following stories:
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-2NDLD-WRITETHRU (Miami) _ Armed U.S. immigration
agents smashed their way into the Little Havana home of Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives before dawn Saturday, took the sobbing
6-year-old boy from a bedroom closet and flew him to a reunion with
his father outside Washington. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-JUSTICE-1STLD-WRITETHRU (Washington) _ Their
self-imposed deadline was 5 a.m. Saturday, and as the minutes
ticked away before federal law-enforcement officials had to decide
whether to seize Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint, Attorney General Janet
Reno was on the phone to the boy's Miami relatives, appealing to
them one last time to end the impasse. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo NYT4)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-REUNION (Washington) _ Moments after 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was taken from a bedroom closet and the arms of a
Cuban-American fisherman, a female voice cooed into his ear. ``This
may seem very scary,'' the woman, a U.S. immigration agent, told
him in Spanish. ``It will soon be better.'' With that modest
promise amid a burst of terror, Elian Gonzalez began a wild ride
Saturday morning that reunited him with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who had pressed for his son's return for nearly five
months. By Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-SCENE (Miami) _ In minutes, it seemed, the street in
front of the home where Elian Gonzalez had been sleeping awoke to a
loud and raucous protest, as neighbors spilled from their homes and
Cuban-Americans summoned by cell phone rushed to the scene. Their
little boy was gone _ taken by federal agents who stormed the house
at 5:15 a.m. _ and they were not going to keep quiet. By Juan
Forero.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-NJ-1STLD-WRITETHRU (New York) _ Chanting ``Libertad
para Elian!'' scores of angry protesters mounted raucous
demonstrations in New York City and in the Cuban-American
stronghold of Union City, N.J., Saturday against the forcible
removal of Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives in a
predawn raid by armed federal agents. By Robert D. McFadden.
</P>
<P>
   (With NYT Photos 3,5,6.)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-MEDIA (Undated) _ It was unintentional that a still
photograph became an instant icon of the television-driven saga of
Elian Gonzalez. The photograph of a federal agent in riot gear,
with a gun pointed in the direction of the little boy in the arms
of the man who had rescued him from the sea, was shown and
discussed all day, rarely mentioned without the words ``searing''
or ``chilling'' attached. And though the photograph demonstrates
the power of a single dramatic image, the Gonzalez family intended
the taking of Elian to be televised live. (A Critic's Notebook.) By
Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo NYT7)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-NEWSPHOTO (Undated) _ Early television coverage of the
Elian Gonzalez situation relied heavily on a photograph by The
Associated Press that quickly became a focal point in the debate
over whether the Justice Department had used excessive force when
it removed the boy from the Miami home of his relatives early
Saturday morning. The photograph showed a federal agent in green
riot gear and goggles carrying a machine gun and facing off against
a frightened-looking man who was holding Elian. By Jim Rutenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-POLITICIANS (Washington) _ In harsh language laced
with outrage, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas criticized the Clinton
administration for its decision to use force when it transferred
custody of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father early Saturday.
Bush said the photograph of the frightened boy being ``removed from
his home at gunpoint'' was ``chilling'' and ``not an image a
freedom-loving nation wants to show the world.'' By Don van Natta
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-GIULIANI (New York) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lashed
out at the Clinton administration Saturday for the early-morning
raid that snatched Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami
relatives, saying that the government had sent ``storm troopers
using guns'' to do the bidding of Fidel Castro. By Thomas J. Lueck.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-HAVANA (Havana, Cuba) _ They are calling it the rescue
of Elian. ``Through a police operation, Elian Gonzalez was rescued
from his kidnappers in Miami,'' was how the excited commentator on
Cuban state radio described it 90 minutes after the raid, an
unusually swift delivery of news. But as this city awoke to the
news that U.S. agents had taken Elian from the Miami home where he
has stayed with relatives opposed to President Fidel Castro, the
streets appeared calm and normal. The government here had broadcast
warnings not to celebrate because ``that could negatively affect
the outcome of the case.''By Randal C. Archibold.
</P>
<P>
   EDIT-CUBAN-BOY _ The sight of heavily armed federal agents
breaking into Lazaro Gonzalez's Miami home before dawn Saturday to
take custody of Elian Gonzalez is a disturbing picture for all
Americans, and is likely to haunt the country for years to come.
Attorney General Janet Reno should have given the two branches of
the Gonzalez family more time to try to resolve the case amicably,
and she should have applied more legal pressure on the Miami
relatives before battering down their door to remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   (From a New York Times editorial appearing in editions for
Sunday, April 23.)
</P>
<P>
   From The Week in Review section:
</P>

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending April 15, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

Vintage Contemporaries, $12. These mordant tales are filled with
aging male hipsters whose ironic detachment and heightened
self-awareness leave them unable to connect with the real world.
``Gates can be very funny,'' Gerald Marzorati wrote in The New York
Times Book Review last year, but mostly he ``is concerned with
creating characters you haven't met in fiction before, getting just
right the words they use to disengagedly engage their women and
their friends and even their inner selves.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE IMMACULATE INVASION &LR;  By Bob Shacochis. Penguin, $14.95. A
novelist turns journalist in this account of the 1994 American
intervention that returned Haiti's first democratically elected
leader to power. The mission is depicted as a hopelessly absurd
affair in which the Americans' main objective was (despite their
good intentions) not to stop brutality but to protect themselves.
``Shacochis proves that he is a writer of rare grace and
intuition,'' Amy Wilentz wrote last year. He ``never stumbles and
never turns a blind eye.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY THE COCKS FIGHT: Dominicans, Haitians, and the Struggle for
Hispaniola &LR; , by Michele Wucker (Hill &AMP; Wang, $14), explores the
complex cultural divide between the two nations that share
Hispaniola _ French-speaking Haiti and the Spanish-speaking
Dominican Republic _ and reveals how racism and migration have
shaped their history. This account ``weaves together five centuries
of tragic conflict with a subtle picture of the island today,''
Patrick Markee wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOY ON THE GREEN BICYCLE: A Memoir &LR;  By Margaret Diehl.
Soho, $12. The author describes how her privileged childhood was
shattered by the death of her older brother and her father's
suicide soon after, and how she retreated into an ultimately
destructive fantasy world. ``Diehl's descriptions of both the
terrible events in her family and the golden stuff of her own
interiority are so entrancing that one realizes too late ... that
fairyland can be a gravityless hell,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BROKE HEART BLUES &LR;  By Joyce Carol Oates. Plume, $13.95. The
author's 29th novel, which revolves around a Brando-like heartthrob
who disappears mysteriously after captivating the student
population of a small town, is about the mythologizing of
adolescence by unhappy adults. The book ``displays great
inventiveness and a justified belief in its relevance to our own
emotional lives,'' D.T. Max wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEDUCTIVE JOURNEY: American Tourists in France From Jefferson
to the Jazz Age &LR;  By Harvey Levenstein. University of Chicago, $17.
A history professor chronicles the changing attitudes of American
travelers toward France, blending frank and amusing comments from
tourists' diaries with new insights into the cultural history of
going abroad. ``The result is a thoroughly readable and highly
likable book,'' Deirdre Bair wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LADIES' MAN &LR;  By Elinor Lipman. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
Harvey Nash is a womanizer in his 50s who reappears in Boston one
day to shake up the well-ordered life of the woman he jilted at the
altar 30 years earlier. ``I loved every page of this very funny,
insightful, sophisticated yet good-natured'' novel, Anita Gates
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHAKESPEARE: A Life &LR;  By Park Honan. Oxford University, $17.95.
More is known about Shakespeare's life than most people realize,
and Park Honan does an ``admirable job of collecting, synthesizing
and judging'' the data, Lois Potter wrote in 1999. ``His book _
comprehensive, up-to-date and agreeably written _ is exactly what
it was meant to be: a definitive (for the time being) life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LATE MR. SHAKESPEARE &LR; , by Robert Nye (Penguin, $13.95), is
a sprightly tale whose fictional narrator, an actor named
Pickleherring, crams his version of his mentor's life with red
herrings, gossip, trivia and true-to-life details. ``Nye's novel
has more of the real Shakespeare in it than the souffle-light
`Shakespeare in Love,'`` Allen Lincoln wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COWBOY WAY: Seasons of a Montana Ranch &LR;  By David McCumber.
Bard/Avon, $14. The author, a journalist who signed on for a year
as a hand on a 6,000-acre ranch, describes the hardscrabble culture
of the modern cowboy. ``With uncluttered prose and a laid-back
sense of humor, he underscores the nobility in hard work, personal
responsibility and love of the land,'' one critic wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRAVELLING HORNPLAYER &LR;  By Barbara Trapido. Penguin, $12.95.
This novel tracks the intersecting lives of two sisters, one of
whom dies in a traffic accident, and a British novelist and his
dyslexic daughter. ``Trapido keeps us happily engaged in the lives
of her clever, warmhearted characters,'' Edward Hower wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST KABBALIST OF LISBON &LR;  By Richard Zimler. Overlook,
$14.95. In this novel, a young follower of the mystical Jewish
tradition tries to track down his uncle's killer in 16th-century
Lisbon. In 1998 the reviewer Erik Burns admired the ``many-layered
narrative, in which a suitably complex cast of characters plays a
dangerous game with fate.''

GREEN, HORRY MAY BE KEY TO LAKERS' SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Maddeningly unpredictable, uncommonly
aggressive up and down the court, gambling, chaotic and absolutely
unique in oh-so-many facets. That's one way of viewing the
Sacramento Kings, the Lakers' first-round foe and a challenge like
no other they have faced in recent postseasons.
</P>
<P>
   But really, the task at hand is not so different at all. This is
a fill-in-the-blank exercise that stays consistent from one spring
to the next:
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers' unheralded power forwards, (name 1) and (name 2),
can at least contain All-Star forward (name of player) of the (name
of opposing team), they can win the series.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber of the Kings simply has stepped into the
well-established tormenting role that has in previous years been
manned by Tim Duncan of San Antonio, Karl Malone of Utah, Charles
Barkley of Houston, Rasheed Wallace of Portland and, in his
pre-bloated days, Vin Baker of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   New face, same challenge. Old hat to Robert Horry, the Lakers'
lithe forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you could just take a tape of what I said last year
and reuse it over and over,'' Horry joked on the eve of today's
series opener. ``Those guys are all great players. They're going to
get their points, they're going to get theirs, usually. It's up to
us to go out and just try to do as much as we can to equalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Same challenge, same philosophy. New tag-team partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know,'' said Lakers forward A.C. Green, ``that we have a
challenge. But it's nothing that we're not used to. It's nothing
that's not expected. We have to go out and play our game. Rob and I
are very capable of doing what we're used to doing all year long to
try and help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry has been fighting these uphill playoff battles for the
last three years. He now shares the pain with Green, re-acquired by
the Lakers last summer. Green starts, Horry often plays more
minutes and the fourth quarter. Both have the same unenviable task.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Webber won't be realistic. Limiting his effectiveness
is the only realistic goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' said Kobe Bryant, ``the heart and soul of their
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' six-year veteran had an MVP-type season, averaging
24.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Against the Lakers, he
was even better. In four games, he averaged 27.0 points, 11.0
rebounds and 5.0 assists, shooting 48.4 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Webber can hurt the Lakers inside and out, with the pass as well
as the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you spoke to (Kings coach) Rick Adelman right
at this moment, Rick would tell you that they probably don't want
him to score 35 points,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said, ``but
they sure like those 15 rebounds and 10 assists. He is a player
that plays all aspects of the game, and they run their offense
through him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's very important for us to play him well, and make him
earn everything. ... But yet they have a lot of complementary
pieces around him that can also do a lot of damage in (Peja)
Stojakovic and (Nick) Anderson and (Jason) Williams and (Corliss)
Williamson and (Vlade) Divac. All these players played very well
during the course of the year. They have (six) guys that have
averaged double figures. We have three. So that makes them a much
more diverse team than us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers don't generally rely on a lot of double-teaming, so
the majority of the burden falls to Horry and Green _ the former
using quickness and length to offset a lack of strength, the latter
using muscle and veteran savvy to offset an inch-height deficit,
20-pound weight deficit and advancing age (36).
</P>
<P>
   Green and Horry represent the latest version of the Lakers'
perpetual presumed Achilles' heel. It became a nonissue in playoff
series wins over the Sonics (1998) and Rockets (1999), but a
glaring weakness in sweeps by the Jazz (1998) and the Spurs (1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``Webber's a dominant power forward,'' the Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal said. ``We have some pretty good power forwards, but not
many power forwards with big size.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers' defensive philosophy is likely to mirror the
Kings' strategy against O'Neal: concede what you have to concede,
nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him score, you know?'' Green said. ``Just keep everybody
else down. It's one of those type of situations, really, more than
anything. The other guys, you know certain guys are going to score.
It's the other guys who can really put a nail in you. ... By and
large, you just want to try and keep him close to the averages of
what he had (during the season) and other than that, it's about
playing team defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Webber's success against the Lakers has come early
</P>
<P>
   in four games, he averaged 10 points in the first quarter, on
Green's watch. He averaged seven points in the second quarter,
primarily with Horry in the game. But in the fourth quarters,
against Horry, Webber averaged just 5.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we can just start on him and keep him at bay, don't
let him come out hot like he usually does, that makes it easier for
everybody else,'' Horry said, ``because they're more concentrated
on Webber and then everybody else gets involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever guarded, the Lakers won't hint at their game plan _ ``Just
play him hard, I don't want to say what we want to do,'' Horry said
_ but they like the contrasting styles they can use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do whatever. Sometimes I change it up, sometimes I
don't,'' Horry said, ``but I try to force him to Shaq as much as
possible, try to get a little help from him. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, (using different types of forwards) is a good style
going against Webber, but you never can tell. I think A.C. plays
him better than I do, because A.C.'s a lot stronger than I am. I
contest his shot a little bit better, but that doesn't help,
because he still makes it. So hopefully he'll just have an off
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Green, ``We've been very supportive of one another and
sort of have our own strategy going against whatever the opponent
might be for that night.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be a punishing postseason Duncan, Wallace and Malone
might appear here down the road but for Green, any postseason is
welcome. He won two championships with the Showtime Lakers but
hasn't seen the playoffs since 1996 with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just excited, I'm very thankful to God, just for the
opportunity,'' he said. ``Just playing my 15th year and playing on
a good team, a team that's in the playoffs. I have been out of the
playoffs the last couple years, and so it's a lot of little things
that I'm just appreciative of. And so I don't want to overlook
those things. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be on a very dominant team. But I know being a
paper team is nothing. That's what this team is used to being, good
on paper but not good at getting final results. So hopefully we can
change that now.'' &QL;

   The New York Times devoted approximately 3 pages to stories and
photos concerning the Elian Gonzalez affair in editions for Sunday,
April 23:
</P>
<P>
   The NYT News Service has moved the following stories:
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-2NDLD-WRITETHRU (Miami) _ Armed U.S. immigration
agents smashed their way into the Little Havana home of Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives before dawn Saturday, took the sobbing
6-year-old boy from a bedroom closet and flew him to a reunion with
his father outside Washington. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-JUSTICE-1STLD-WRITETHRU (Washington) _ Their
self-imposed deadline was 5 a.m. Saturday, and as the minutes
ticked away before federal law-enforcement officials had to decide
whether to seize Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint, Attorney General Janet
Reno was on the phone to the boy's Miami relatives, appealing to
them one last time to end the impasse. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo NYT4)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-REUNION (Washington) _ Moments after 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was taken from a bedroom closet and the arms of a
Cuban-American fisherman, a female voice cooed into his ear. ``This
may seem very scary,'' the woman, a U.S. immigration agent, told
him in Spanish. ``It will soon be better.'' With that modest
promise amid a burst of terror, Elian Gonzalez began a wild ride
Saturday morning that reunited him with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who had pressed for his son's return for nearly five
months. By Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-SCENE (Miami) _ In minutes, it seemed, the street in
front of the home where Elian Gonzalez had been sleeping awoke to a
loud and raucous protest, as neighbors spilled from their homes and
Cuban-Americans summoned by cell phone rushed to the scene. Their
little boy was gone _ taken by federal agents who stormed the house
at 5:15 a.m. _ and they were not going to keep quiet. By Juan
Forero.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-NJ-1STLD-WRITETHRU (New York) _ Chanting ``Libertad
para Elian!'' scores of angry protesters mounted raucous
demonstrations in New York City and in the Cuban-American
stronghold of Union City, N.J., Saturday against the forcible
removal of Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives in a
predawn raid by armed federal agents. By Robert D. McFadden.
</P>
<P>
   (With NYT Photos 3,5,6.)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-MEDIA (Undated) _ It was unintentional that a still
photograph became an instant icon of the television-driven saga of
Elian Gonzalez. The photograph of a federal agent in riot gear,
with a gun pointed in the direction of the little boy in the arms
of the man who had rescued him from the sea, was shown and
discussed all day, rarely mentioned without the words ``searing''
or ``chilling'' attached. And though the photograph demonstrates
the power of a single dramatic image, the Gonzalez family intended
the taking of Elian to be televised live. (A Critic's Notebook.) By
Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo NYT7)
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-NEWSPHOTO (Undated) _ Early television coverage of the
Elian Gonzalez situation relied heavily on a photograph by The
Associated Press that quickly became a focal point in the debate
over whether the Justice Department had used excessive force when
it removed the boy from the Miami home of his relatives early
Saturday morning. The photograph showed a federal agent in green
riot gear and goggles carrying a machine gun and facing off against
a frightened-looking man who was holding Elian. By Jim Rutenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-POLITICIANS (Washington) _ In harsh language laced
with outrage, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas criticized the Clinton
administration for its decision to use force when it transferred
custody of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father early Saturday.
Bush said the photograph of the frightened boy being ``removed from
his home at gunpoint'' was ``chilling'' and ``not an image a
freedom-loving nation wants to show the world.'' By Don van Natta
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-GIULIANI (New York) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lashed
out at the Clinton administration Saturday for the early-morning
raid that snatched Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami
relatives, saying that the government had sent ``storm troopers
using guns'' to do the bidding of Fidel Castro. By Thomas J. Lueck.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-HAVANA (Havana, Cuba) _ They are calling it the rescue
of Elian. ``Through a police operation, Elian Gonzalez was rescued
from his kidnappers in Miami,'' was how the excited commentator on
Cuban state radio described it 90 minutes after the raid, an
unusually swift delivery of news. But as this city awoke to the
news that U.S. agents had taken Elian from the Miami home where he
has stayed with relatives opposed to President Fidel Castro, the
streets appeared calm and normal. The government here had broadcast
warnings not to celebrate because ``that could negatively affect
the outcome of the case.''By Randal C. Archibold.
</P>
<P>
   EDIT-CUBAN-BOY _ The sight of heavily armed federal agents
breaking into Lazaro Gonzalez's Miami home before dawn Saturday to
take custody of Elian Gonzalez is a disturbing picture for all
Americans, and is likely to haunt the country for years to come.
Attorney General Janet Reno should have given the two branches of
the Gonzalez family more time to try to resolve the case amicably,
and she should have applied more legal pressure on the Miami
relatives before battering down their door to remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   (From a New York Times editorial appearing in editions for
Sunday, April 23.)
</P>
<P>
   From The Week in Review section:
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ If the Elian Gonzalez case
illustrates anything, other than the peculiarly overheated state of
Cuban-U.S. relations, it is that courts run on adult time, with
unhappy consequences for the children they are trying to help. By
Somini Sengupta.

LAKERS READY TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Kobe Bryant, model citizen and
ever-available for a quote, rushed out of the building. Coach Phil
Jackson made a brief appearance, then bolted. Ron Harper conducted
interviews from the driver's seat of his silver luxury sedan.
</P>
<P>
   It was not business as usual at the Lakers' practice site
Saturday, 24hours before they open the playoffs against the
Sacramento Kings at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxious,'' Rick Fox said of the team's mood. ``I think we've
worked on everything we could possibly work on, from the
understanding of what they do, to what we want to do ... but
knowing that it's the first round and you have to `come with your
best game,' as TNT says, `or go home,'we have to be prepared to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was displeased with his team's practice Friday, so how
about Saturday's? ``What did he say?'' Fox wondered. Told Jackson
left without being interviewed, Fox said, ``Well, that should tell
you.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Fox's third postseason in L.A., but as everyone has
noted, this one is unique the Lakers are the clear favorite to win
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it feel different? No, because we've felt it before,''
Fox said. ``It feels different than last year; I don't think we
were expected to do much last year after a season of such turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, yeah, since I've been here, we've never been the best
team record-wise and we've never been defending NBA champions, but
for some reason, we've become the hunted after obviously going out
and doing all the hunting during the regular season. So it's a
strange feeling to know that here you have the San Antonio Spurs,
who are defending NBA champions, and no one's even talking about
them defending their title.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are trying to maintain a sense of perspective, and
Harper who won three titles with the Chicago Bulls
</P>
<P>
   offered his teammates a final bit of wisdom Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron put it best when he said, `Don't believe the hype. We
haven't won anything yet. And no one's going to go handing us any
rings (today) atStaples Center.' And it's true,'' Fox said. ``It's
so true. We've had agreat regular season, but that means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   SILENT TREATMENT: Jackson, possibly tempting an NBA fine,
decided not to take questions from the media Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say,'' Jackson told a room full of
reporters. ``I've said everything I have to say the last two days,
and I just thought I'd come out here and just nod to you all and
say thank you for showing up today. It's a pleasure to see you. And
seeing that I have an appointment that's pressing, I will leave you
all here and see you again tomorrow before the game. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   PLEASED TO MEET YOU: This is only the second time the Lakers and
Kings have faced each other in the playoffs. The other meeting was
a first-round series in 1984, when the Kings were still based in
Kansas City. The Lakers swept 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   THE DRILL: Keep history in mind today: The winner of Game 1 has
gone on to win best-of-five series 83.3 percent of the time (130 of
156). The team with home-court advantage has won 114 of 156 series
(.731).
</P>
<P>
   TICKETS AVAILABLE: A limited number of tickets, to today'sgame
only, will be released this morning, the Lakers announced Saturday.
Tickets can be purchased through Ticketmaster and at the Staples
Center box office. &QL;

LAKERS COULD HELP L.A.'S IMAGE WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When L.A. looks into the mirror, it doesn't see
its fair weather, its mesmerizing shoreline, its mountainous
curves, its exotic features, its nose for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Like a bodybuilder who stares in the mirror and sees a 98-pound
weakling, L.A. suffers from a distorted self-image. It can't see
its many positive qualities because it is fixated on its muscles.
</P>
<P>
   They appear to have atrophied the past few years. In the 1980s
L.A.'s muscles commanded everybody's attention, but now L.A. flexes
them on the stage that is the professional sports scene and nobody
so much as blinks.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have even taken to laughing L.A. off the stage.
Don't think that hasn't worked on the city's psyche some.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that L.A. still has plenty to preen about. It simply
can't get over all that definition that has just disappeared
despite its best efforts to regenerate it. Where oh where did the
Pedro Martinezes, the Henry Rodriguezes, the Danny Mannings, the
Vlade Divaces, the Al Davises and the Georgia Frontieres go?
</P>
<P>
   It hurts L.A. deeply to see lesser rivals such as St. Louis
muscle their way past it on sport's biggest stages. Don't think
L.A. didn't notice the Rams' Super Bowl win this year or Jim
Edmonds' super start for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was just more salt applied to the open wound that is the
city's self-image.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A. visited Dr. Melfi's couch, you can be sure it wouldn't
take Lorraine Bracco's ``Sopranos'' character long to get the city
to own up to feelings of inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to play a psychiatrist on television to recognize
the root of the problem: The Dodgers, Clippers, Kings, Lakers,
Angels, Galaxy and Mighty Ducks haven't had a loving cup to spit in
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   After winning eight pro team championships in the 1980s (five by
the Lakers, two by the Dodgers and one by the Raiders), L.A. went
0-for-the-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Marty McSorley's illegal stick threw the Kings a curve in 1993
and it's almost as though all of L.A.'s muscles went into oxygen
debt after that. It really has been painful to watch L.A. stagger
to the finish line of the 20th century, what with the Clippers
stringing together 13 losing seasons and the Dodgers, Lakers and
Kings each having gotten swept off the road in their past two trips
to Playoffland.
</P>
<P>
   Lose Angeles, indeed. The city has been so busy picking broom
bristles out of its teeth it really hasn't joined the chorus of
people singing the praises of this year's Lakers squad.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Lakers under first-year coach Phil Jackson looked
impressive in compiling a league-best mark of 67-15. And yes, only
one time in NBA history, in 1973, has a team been as successful
during the regular season and not waltzed away with the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The city wants to stand as tall as the Riddler's Revenge at Six
Flags or the First Interstate World Center, but this thought keeps
weighing it down: If the Boston Celtics could lose in 1973, why not
the Lakers now?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, L.A.'s psyche these days is more fragile than Kobe
Bryant's sprained right wrist or Shaquille O'Neal's gimpy left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. doesn't want to have that beaten feeling. It wants to
scream ``Sacramento (Stinks)'' and have it not come off sounding
mickey mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The city desperately wants to believe Divac, the former Lakers
forward turned Sacramento stalwart, won't expose the Lakers's
low(ly)-post defense. The city wants to believe the Kings'
fast-break will crash and burn when it hits the Lakers' wall of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is trying to think positive. Which is why, everywhere
Bryant goes, he hears a familiar refrain. The city is telling him
to ``bring home a championship,'' and that ``the time is now'' for
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is only 21 years old, which is too young to understand
that what L.A. really is saying is it's high time L.A. got its
groove back.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, more of a stranger to L.A. than Bryant but infinitely
more familiar with the symbiosis between sporting success and a
city's psyche, said, ``The 90s haven't been a whole lot of fun for
us. (But) We're coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing is believing. Forget the mirror; for the next few weeks
the basketball court is where L.A. will see itself reflected. &QL;
