<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Dion Nash and Daniel Vettori
resurrected a sagging New Zealand innings to give the hosts a handy
lead over India on day two of the second test Sunday.
	   Nash had 56 and spinner Vettori made 35 as the pair guided New
Zealand from 208 for seven to 290-7 at stumps in reply to India's
208.
	   India, spurred by an unsettling spell of medium pace bowling by
Javagal Srinath, crawled back into the contest after lunch when the
Kiwis lost 4-46.
	   New Zealand was well set for a big first innings on 132 for
three at lunch, but gifted away a position of great strength.
	   India did will to break the backbone of the New Zealand innings
after a series of near misses and five dropped catches.
	   Vice captain Ajay Jadeja despite running out Fleming, dropped
three catches while Rahul Dravid grassed two.
	   Srinath extracted disconcerting bounce and peppered the New
Zealand middle order before leg-spinner Anil Kumble (3-67) grabbed
two of the four wickets to fall between lunch and tea.
	   Srinath triggered the middle order collapse with the wicket of
Craig McMillan, who was brilliantly caught by Rahul Dravid at short
leg for 24 runs.
	   McMillan who exchanged words with Srinath after the lanky fast
bowler hit him on the grill of his helmet, lobbed the previous
delivery in the air, but Saurav Ganguly was too deep and too slow
to react and was replaced under the helmet by Dravid.
	   McMillan and Nathan Astle, who hit 56 runs in over three hours,
put on a stubborn 50 runs for the fourth wicket after New Zealand
had lost the two overnight batsmen _ Matthew Horne and Stephen
Fleming _ in the morning.
	   New Zealand had resumed the day on 52 for the loss of test
debutant Matthew Bell's wicket on the first day.
	   Astle, who was bowled off a Srinath no-ball on 24 batted with
increasing confidence and hit six boundaries and deposited debutant
off spinner Harbhajan Singh for a huge six over long on before
playing on to Kumble.
	   Opener Horne and Fleming figured in a forceful 72-run stand in
the morning before disaster struck.
	   Fleming, who had batted faultlessly for almost two hours for his
42 runs was needlessly run out going for a second run which was
never on.
	   Horne, dropped on 22 and 27, was finally beaten by a Kumble top
spinner that hurried on the opener and bowled him. Horne batted
obdurately for 190 minutes for his 38, which included four
boundaries.

 &UR; Defecting Khmer Rouge leaders in seclusion in former stronghold
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with defectors under wraps,
will see Hun Sen on Tuesday, other details. Adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Two main leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge regime who are defecting to the government stayed under wraps
Sunday in this frontier town, a former stronghold of their
once-feared guerrilla army.
	   Keut Kan, third deputy governor of Pailin, confirmed that Khieu
Samphan, the official leader of the bloodstained revolutionary
group though others held real power, and political chief Nuon Chea
were staying at ``guesthouses'' with their families.
	   They were to travel to the capital, Phnom Penh, to meet Prime
Minister Hun Sen on Tuesday, Keut Kan said. Government officials
could not confirm the meeting.
	   ``I met them on Dec. 25 at a border point,'' Keut Kan said. ``I
was told to go there to wait for guests. They came in a car with
their wives and their children.''
	   The rendezvous indicated that the pair had been in Thailand,
which has nurtured close links with the Khmer Rouge. Thai officials
repeated standing denials over the weekend of hosting Khmer Rouge
leaders.
	   Hun Sen said Saturday that the defection was sealed in a
telephone conversation Christmas night _ 20 years to the day after
Vietnam invaded to topple the Khmer Rouge government.
	   Keut Kan said that he did not have authority to let journalists
descending on Pailin meet the defectors. The town's top leaders
were at a wedding in the capital, he claimed.
	   Keut Kan speculated that the health of the defectors may have
deteriorated during months on the run, but they generally were
fine.
	   Keut Kan said that Khieu Samphan ``looked happy when I met him,
but I think he might be a little worried whether he can live in
peace or not.''
	   Pailin is under the control of former Khmer Rouge chieftain Ieng
Sary, once the brother-in-law and right-hand man of Pol Pot, who
led the regime that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians after the group seized power in 1975.
	   Ieng Sary was the first key leader to defect to the government
in 1996, receiving amnesty in return. He led thousands of
guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war, the beginning of the end
of the movement.
	   The latest defections leave at large only one major figure, the
one-legged general Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher'' for his
brutality.
	   Thai army Maj. Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, whose troops monitor the
Cambodian border, has estimated that Ta Mok has no more than 100
die-hard guerrillas with him.
	   Wiwat said that the defections had been in the works for a month
and that the Cambodian government was prepared to let Ta Mok ``grow
old and die'' in the jungle.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who is receiving medical treatment in
Beijing, has approved of the defections. The Cambodian monarch was
held prisoner in his palace during the Khmer Rouge regime and lost
a dozen family members.
	   Sihanouk expressed ``deep gratitude about this good news,''
echoing conciliatory language used by Hun Sen that indicated the
pair had surrendered in exchange for guarantees they would not be
harmed.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said in the
past that they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok captured
and tried by either Cambodian courts or an international tribunal
for crimes against humanity.
	   Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power struggle last year _ died of
a purported heart attack in April.
	   Legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited Cambodia
last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. Local U.N. officials said the report was due to reach
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a few weeks.
	   Om Yentieng, a Hun Sen aide, said the prime minister supports a
trial but it should be left to the woefully unequipped local
courts.
	   Over the past two years, the government has adopted a policy of
negotiating de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge leaders to persuade
them to end nearly two decades of civil war since they were
overthrown.
	   The strategy brought peace to large areas of Cambodia for the
first time in a generation, but means that none of the group's most
bloodstained leaders has been arrested.

 &UR; Rights group: China sentences dissident to 10 years imprisonment
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with report of dissident sentenced; ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident was sentenced Sunday to 10
years imprisonment for giving interviews to the U.S.
government-funded Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
	   Zhang Shanguang was sentenced following a 2 hour 20 minute
hearing from which his wife and other relatives were barred, Human
Rights in China said.
	   Zhang, who earlier had spent seven years in jail for labor
rights campaigning, was the fourth dissident given a lengthy jail
term in a week as part of a decisive crackdown on dissident by the
ruling Communist Party.
	   The court in southern China's Hunan province ruled that by
telling Radio Free Asia about farmers' protests, Zhang violated an
article of China's criminal law that bars people from providing
``intelligence'' to people overseas, Human Rights in China, based
in New York, said.
	   The crime carries a maximum penalty of death. Apart from
sentencing Zhang to 10 years imprisonment, the court also stripped
him of his political rights for five years, Human Rights in China
said.
	   The group said police in Hunan had mobilized ``a large number''
of officers to watch other dissidents at home and prevent them from
going to the court in Huaihua city to show support for Zhang.
	   Police even watched people in Changsha, the provincial capital
300 kilometers (180 miles) to the east of Huiahua, the group said.
	   Despite the tight security, it said some people from as far away
as Beijing, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to the north, had given
police the slip and were in Huaihua to show support for Zhang.
	   Zhang was arrested in July, following U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to China, as he was preparing to set up an
association to protect laid-off workers' rights.
	   His trial came amid a crackdown that last week saw three
prominent dissidents given heavy jail terms. Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin
and Wang Youcai were charged with endangering state security and
sentenced to 13 years, 12 years and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Chinese leaders have declared they will destroy challengers to
Communist Party rule and have ordered law enforcers to eliminate
any threats to social stability.
	   Despite the crackdown, 274 people in more than 20 provinces and
major cities signed an open letter calling on Chinese leaders to
release Zhang, Human Rights in China said.
	   The letter was addressed to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Mary Robinson, the U.N.'s top human rights official who
visited China in September.

Report: Singapore port handling charges to fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Freight handling and storage charges in
Singapore, one of the world's busiest ports, are likely to fall in
line with government initiatives to lower port costs, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   Private freight forwarders will probably lower labor, transport
and warehousing fees as soon as the government-linked port
operator, PSA Corp., unveils further details of the latest round of
rebates, said The Sunday Times.
	   Last month, the government announced a 20 percent cut in port
dues for 1999 as part of wide-ranging measures to lower business
costs to boost competitiveness.
	   Together with a similar move in July, the government rebates
total 46 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 28 million).
	   The Singapore Freight Forwarding Association, which represents
more than 210 members, will review its price guidelines shortly,
said the report.
	   The imminent reduction of port-related costs by government and
private handlers comes after shipping charges for smaller
quantities of goods have dropped below the cost of local handling
and storage charges, the report said.
	   While many port charges in Singapore have been traditionally
higher than its regional competitors, the small city-state has
continued to attract customers to its efficient, perennially busy
port.

Yachts in trouble as wild weather hits fleet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with some yachts in trouble, rescue mission underway,
changes headline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ At least 12 people were injured aboard
one of the yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race and four other race
boats are in trouble, police said Sunday.
	   A Victorian state police spokeswoman in Melbourne said aircraft
were en route to the scene off Mallacoota, in Victoria state's far
east, in a rescue operation being coordinated by the national
search and rescue center in Canberra.
	   The area is near the border with New South Wales state and where
the yachts enter Bass Strait.
	   The police spokeswoman said several emergency distress calls had
been picked up from yachts in the race.
	   ``At this stage we believe that 12 people on one boat have been
injured, while four other boats are in trouble. They're believed to
be taking water, while a couple of others have got broken masts.''
	   No further information was available, with names of the boats in
trouble not yet known.
	   The injuries came as race leaders Sayonara and Brindabella were
encountering heavy seas and winds of up to 45 knots in Bass Strait
as they led the fleet toward Flinders Island, with American yacht
Sayonara 3.1 nautical miles ahead.
	   Further back in the fleet the South Australian yacht Doctor
Rager reported winds of 50 to 60 knots and gusting to 70 knots.
	   Organizers said they were the worst conditions the race had
struck since the gale-swept 1993 event.
	   The destination in the 630-nautical mile race is Hobart, capital
of the island state of Tasmania.
	   Nine yachts in the original 115-boat fleet had retired, the
latest being the Sydney pocket maxi Innkeeper. Others out of the
race were Wild Thing, Sydney, ABN AMRO Challenge, Sledgehammer,
King Billy, Marchioness, Assassin and Red Jacket.
	   Sayonara and Brindabella remained many miles ahead of the
position reached by German maxi Morning Glory in the same time when
she set the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10
seconds in 1996. (djp)

Wary Cambodians hope Khmer Rouge leaders will be tried
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ordinary Cambodians weary of decades
of war and terror Sunday cautiously welcomed the de facto surrender
of two Khmer Rouge leaders and hoped they could still be put on
trial for genocide.
	   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to the government
leaves only one major Khmer Rouge leader, the one-legged general Ta
Mok, fighting in the jungles of northern Cambodia with no more than
an estimated 100 loyalists at his side.
	   In Phnom Penh, Cambodians who lost parents, siblings, children
and friends among as many as 2 million people who perished under
the Khmer Rouge regime between 1975 and 1979 said the defections
were a vital step in building a lasting peace.
	   ``I hope that these two joining the government will finish the
fighting in Cambodia,'' said Hing Ning, 56, an eyeglass shop owner
who lost five brothers and sisters.
	   But actually seeing them face trial seemed a remote hope, since
other, equally bloodstained leaders have negotiated amnesty in
recent years in exchange for making peace to end decades of
stalemated civil war.
	   The Khmer Rouge were once referred to as ``the contemptible Pol
Pot/Ieng Sary clique'' by Cambodian officials _ many themselves
former Khmer Rouge who fled the group to escape bloody purges and
returned with the Vietnamese army in 1979 to topple their
ex-comrades.
	   Ieng Sary received amnesty two years ago, his defection at the
head of thousands of guerrillas leading to a steady loss of Khmer
Rouge territory and fighters.
	   Pol Pot, ousted by Ta Mok in a purge last year, died under house
arrest by his ex-comrades in April.
	   The United Nations sent three legal experts to Cambodia last
month to study the possibility of trying senior Khmer Rouge
leaders, raising hopes among average Cambodians that at least
someone will stand trial.
	   ``If the international community or the United Nations
investigates and determines who is guilty, then we can really make
sure these people are punished,'' said So Serei, 45, a grocer.
	   But Prime Minister Hun Sen has brushed aside questions about a
trial for the new defectors.
	   Hun Sen is Cambodia's most powerful politician and no
prosecution will take place without his involvement. Researchers of
the Cambodian genocide are currently giving him the benefit of the
doubt.
	   ``I don't think he can talk about a trial now,'' said Youk
Chhang, director of a center that has compiled evidence against
Khmer Rouge leaders. ``One hand cannot receive these two while the
other talks about killing them.''
	   Blocking a trial could darken Hun Sen's reputation with the
international community at a time he seems about to regain foreign
aid and legitimacy after forming a new coalition government a month
ago.
	   Hun Sen lost much international standing when he deposed his
then co-prime minister in a bloody coup in July 1997.
	   The legal experts are due to submit a report to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan in the next few weeks, an event that Youk Chhang
said should greatly hasten efforts to convene a trial.
	   ``Right now, Hun Sen needs some time to decide what to do, but I
think by the end of January we will see what he will do with these
guys,'' Youk Chhang said.

	   MEW YORK (AP) _ James Jones died in 1977 and was largely
forgotten. Critics rarely bring him up anymore and few readers seem
to care; most of his books are out of print. Once thought of as a
major American novelist, the author of ``From Here to Eternity''
now seems to have written for a different world, a world where a
major American novelist was supposedly white and male and tempered
by war.
	   Terrence Malick, still very much alive, last made a movie not
long after Jones died. Time has been kind to Malick. The director
of ``Days of Heaven'' and ``Badlands'' has been transformed from an
interesting young filmmaker to a near-legendary middle-aged
filmmaker. His movies are cult favorites, his long absence accepted
as a sign of the director's high standards.
	   Malick's comeback project is a nearly three-hour adaptation of
Jones' World War II novel, ``The Thin Red Line.'' It has attracted
the strongest Hollywood cast in years: Sean Penn, John Travolta,
Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, John Cusack and George Clooney. It's
been cited as a certain Academy Award contender _ cited, certainly,
by some who have never heard of Jones' book.
	   But art is often like war; it is simply unfair. A major director
has brought in some major actors for a major production of a
long-ignored writer and the results help no one. Overdone and
undertold, ``The Thin Red Line'' is a film much harder to remember
than it is to sit through.
	   The novel, published in 1962, is a good example of mid-century
American fiction: long and earnest, but also vividly written and
honorable in its intentions. It's a book determined to say
something about war and what it does to men. Jones does that well,
although he writes as if that were the only story worth telling.
	   Set in Guadalcanal in 1943, ``The Thin Red Line'' follows an
Army Rifle Company, C-for-Charlie, as it fights the Japanese for
control of the island. There are many battle scenes from this
historic turning point of the war, but the story is primarily
psychological. The soldiers come to believe their lives are not
only expandable, but, as Jones puts it, ``spendable, like dollar
bills.''
	   In a brief introduction, Jones admitted that the terrain for his
novel was imaginary, that he was interested in Guadalcanal as myth.
Malick, in turn, wants to make Guadalcanal real _ although filming
took place in Australia. He adds segments of chanting natives and
frequent shots of wildlife. The war, he is trying to say, damages
not only soldiers, but the very balance of nature.
	   Less sentimental and more consistent than this year's other big
World War II movie, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Malick's film offers
no moral consolation. It's as if the war were Vietnam. The soldiers
are stuck with an awful mission and no medals can convince them
otherwise. ``Property,'' Penn's character observes, is as likely
any reason for why they're there.
	   ``Thin Red Line'' has its moments, truly affecting moments, but
it's never the great film it pretends to be. In condensing Jones'
510-page novel, Malick leaves us with little sense of who these
soldiers are. Instead of sustained interaction, we get ponderous
voice-overs. And the film feels disjointed, a series of
well-produced episodes that never come together. It's the kind of
movie that leaves you struggling to recall the characters' names.
	   Malick, who wrote the screenplay, shuffles his cast on and off
like a high-priced variety show. Nolte, as a hotheaded battalion
leader, is most memorable, although that may be because he has the
loudest voice. Penn, Travolta, Harrelson and Cusack, all gifted
actors who can carry a movie, hardly make an impression. There
seems no explanation for Clooney's brief appearance as a field
commander expect for the sake of having Clooney play a field
commander.
	   Two decades have not cured Malick of some bad habits. As in
``Days of Heaven,'' the cinematography is beautiful, but ultimately
pointless; Malick cannot stop cutting away to animals, tree tops
and that high, silent sky. And the voice-overs! Few writers could
live down passages such as this: ``Can the wind gather up the
leaves it scattered?'' Or this: ``One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain. Another man sees the
same bird, feels the glory.''
	   With the steady, heavy pace of a soldier's step (or of an
acceptance speech at the Oscars), ``Thin Red Line'' treats war as
spiritual discovery, as if killing turns all men into poets. ``The
only things that are permanent are death and the Lord'' is the
film's idea of wisdom. Sounds impressive, but isn't that just a
fancy way of saying life is like a box of chocolates?
	   A 20th Century Fox release, ``The Thin Red Line'' was produced
by Robert Michael Geisler, John Roberdeau and Grant Hill, with
George Stevens, Jr. serving as executive producer.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jane is a lovely, erratic, sharp-tongued
woman of 25 who knows her own mind. She also knows that her life
will soon end. She has reached an advanced stage of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
She has one desire in the little time she has left: to lose her
virginity.
	   Richard is a brilliant though unsuccessful artist with his own
disability: He exhibits tendencies of manic-depression. He also is
obsessed by the desire to fly. One such attempt gets him in trouble
with the authorities, and he is required to perform hours of
community service. He is assigned to give assistance to the
disabled, and one of them is Jane.
	   Thus begins the most unusual love match since ``Harold and
Maude.'' Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh, two of England's
premier actors, play the odd twosome in ``The Theory of Flight,''
another prestige item reaching theaters in time for Oscar
consideration.
	   Like most bonding movies, this one starts with the two figures
at dagger points. She is acerbic and demanding, he has his own
hang-ups to deal with and doesn't respond to her bullying. They
part amid a flurry of name calling.
	   Stricken with guilt, Richard returns to pushing Jane's
wheelchair and sparring with her flashes of temper. Apart from his
court-ordered duty, he lives a solitary life in a barn on a
windswept hill.
	   Jane refuses to abandon her hope for a sexual encounter. Richard
agrees to help, and he lines up a high-priced gigolo to perform the
deed. It results in a hilarious fiasco.
	   The relationship between Jane and Richard deepens, especially
when he reveals what he has been building in the barn with pieces
of junk and scrap: an airplane. But will it fly? That's where the
title comes in.
	   If produced as a disease-of-the-month TV movie, ``The Theory of
Flight'' could have resulted in a maudlin tearjerker. Two superior
performers make it rise above that.
	   Richard Hawkins' script skirts around sentimentality, and Paul
Greengrass' direction stresses the humor as well as the developing
affection between the two lost souls.
	   Cynics will claim that the sure route to acting Academy Awards
is to play the disabled. No one can discount the power of Miss
Bonham Carter's performance. The cropped hair, the slurred speech,
the slanted head contribute the external aspects. Jane's
intelligence is unimpaired, and that is what makes her so
compelling.
	   Branagh, who has been inclined to overawe his audience, reduces
Richard to human terms, and he gives his best screen performance.
Gemma Jones provides sympathy as Jane's suffering mother.
	   ``The Theory of Flight'' is a Fine Line Features release
produced by David M. Thompson and Anant Singh.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Like the late Norman Cousins, Hunter (Patch)
Adams was convinced of the healing power of laughter. Cousins wrote
a popular book describing how he overcame a crippling illness by
watching movies of the Marx Brothers and other comedians.
	   Adams wrote his own book telling of his adventures in trying to
bring mirth to seriously ill patients while he was a medical
student at the Medical College of Virginia. His use of bulbous red
noses and bizarre costumes brought the censure of the school's head
doctor, who accused him of ``excessive happiness.''
	   ``Patch Adams'' is one of the growing number of films bearing
what has become a cliche: ``Based on a true story.'' However true
it is, the movie provides an ideal vehicle for Robin Williams, who
returns to form after his last outing, the dismal ``What Dreams May
Come.''
	   The film opens in a mental hospital where Adams is a patient. He
doesn't seem deranged, but he is tossed into what resembles a
prison cell occupied by a wild-eyed man who fears he is being
attacked by animals. Desperate, Adams gets his roommate to laugh
away his besiegers.
	   That experience inspires Adams to become a doctor so he can
practice his healing methods professionally. At 46, Robin Williams
does seem a bit long in the tooth to portray a premed student, but
let's face it, he can pull off almost anything.
	   Rebelling at the by-the-book teachings of his instructors, Adams
tries out his comic shtick on severely ill patients. These are the
most appealing scenes in the film, especially his efforts to reach
a ward full of ailing children and a dying misanthrope (Peter
Coyote). His stunts draw the wrath of the hard-nosed dean (Bob
Gunton).
	   ``If you want to be a clown, join the circus,'' Adams is warned.
	   Despite threat of expulsion, Adams continues his campaign. He is
joined by his roommate Truman (Daniel London). More difficult to
enlist is fellow student Carin (Monica Potter), an aloof beauty who
has been abused by men. Adams uses his intense persuasiveness to
win her over, romantically as well.
	   Along with his studies, Adams establishes a mountaintop refuge
where he applies his theories to despondent patients. The avenging
dean seeks to terminate Adams' experiments and his education by
legal means.
	   Basing the script on Adams' own book, ``Gesundheit: Good Health
Is a Laughing Matter,'' Steve Oedekerk has fashioned a surefire
character for Robin Williams' Olympian talents. Tom Shadyac's
direction lets the humanity as well as the comedy shine through.
	   One Scrooge-like comment: Too bad the filmmakers had to resort
to a Capraesque finale for an extra dose of feel-goodness.
	   Nonetheless, Williams continues to astonish with his protean
brilliance. Good work also is contributed by newcomers Potter and
London, as well as a cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman,
Harold Gould, Harve Presnell and Richard Kiley.
	   ``Patch Adams'' is a Universal Pictures release produced by
Barry Kemp, Mike Farrell, Marvin Minoff and Charles Newirth.
Running time: 112 minutes.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The trailers make it out to be a farce, or at
least a she-said/she-said comedy _ cranky Susan Sarandon vs. uppity
Julia Roberts. But the truth about ``Stepmom,'' Chris Columbus' new
family movie, is far more substantial.
	   Like ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' a previous Columbus film, ``Stepmom''
offers many layers. Yes, it's a comedy. Yes, it's a fast-paced
drama with some really good lines. In the end, though, it's a
serious _ even somber _ attempt to understand the modern family.
	   Isabel (Roberts) is a sleek, self-possessed New York fashion
photographer who cohabits with Luke (Ed Harris), the divorced
father of two children. For Isabel, it's a harried existence. She
does her best to build a relationship with the kids, but they are
reluctant, sassy and often downright rude.
	   Jackie (Sarandon), the kids' mom and Luke's ex-wife, is bitter
about her divorce and possessive of her children. She sees Isabel
as a brash, irresponsible mommy-come-lately. Jackie is a doting
mother, but she's not pleasant to be around if you happen to be
Isabel.
	   Luke is one of those wishy-washy nice guys who means well and
loves deeply but lacks the resolve to tackle the family problem.
His attempts at relationships _ with Isabel, Jackie and his kids _
are affectionate but ineffectual.
	   This sort of setup could easily descend into two hours of
character cliches. But it doesn't. Here's why.
	   First, the interactions between Roberts and the always engaging
Sarandon are believable. At first, theirs is a contentious
relationship full of barbs and rancor. But slowly, as each woman
begins to consider the other's position, their contemplations
leaven their interactions. Much distaste remains, but the two
actresses do a fine job taking gradual steps forward in their
dealings with one another.
	   Second, the two children are wonderful. As 7-year-old Ben, Liam
Aiken straddles the line between cute and tormented with a blend of
innocence and wisdom unusual in an actor his age. It's trendy today
for movie children to be precocious, and it often comes across as
fake. Not so this boy.
	   Even better is 14-year-old Jena Malone as Anna. She faces not
only a riven family but _ yikes! _ puberty and dating. Her
struggles carry the film. Look especially for a schoolyard scene
involving a rude boy who has unceremoniously dumped Anna. Malone's
body language and expressions are priceless.
	   When fate deals this family a real, external obstacle, things
really get going. To give away details would be unfair; but, like
most cataclysmic events in human lives, it helps the characters
sort out what's important.
	   For two-thirds of the movie, Columbus uses self-restraint to his
and the movie's advantage, making it sort of a ``Kramer vs.
Kramer'' of the late 1990s.
	   ``Stepmom'' is full of quiet, intimate moments that speak to the
difficulty of the family structure in the late 20th century: How
does a mother deal with a stepmother? What does the stepmother do
to be accepted? And, most importantly, how can kids cope with a
bifurcated family?
	   As ``Stepmom'' winds to its close, the restraint evaporates and
the movie turns maudlin. Cameras linger on tears, dialogue becomes
wooden and facial expressions are overwrought. It's too bad,
because the inevitable conclusion _ the mutual acceptance of Isabel
and Jackie _ could have been powerful. Instead, it's pure Hollywood
schmaltz.
	   Columbus deserves praise and tolerance for creating a moving
film, which he dedicated to his late mother. It's a worthwhile way
to spend an evening, but its excesses ultimately doom it to a level
above mediocrity but below true excellence.
	   ``Stepmom'' is rated PG-13.

	   ``Galore'' (Rykodisc) _ Jeffrey Gaines
	   He's the quintessential sensitive guy with a buttery voice,
confessional lyrics and acoustic accompaniment _ he's even pictured
barefoot on his latest release, ``Galore.''
	   In his third full-length release, Jeffrey Gaines, thankfully,
doesn't venture far afield. His lyrics are poetic, strong and
self-revealing. His music is richly layered with violins, 12-string
guitar, viola and cello.
	   ``Galore'' offers a bonus disc with four tracks, including
remakes by Gaines' personal favorites David Bowie and Elvis
Costello plus a pared down, live version of Peter Gabriel's ``In
Your Eyes.''

	   ``No Mermaid'' (Interscope) _ Sinead Lohan
	   In Sinead Lohan's native Ireland, her first name is about as
common as Amy or Lisa, but Americans know only one singing Sinead _
O'Connor, that is _ and Lohan will, inevitably, draw comparisons.
	   Both rely on their pasts to create intensely feminist lyrics,
but Lohan hails from County Cork not scrappy, working-class Dublin
and appears not to share O'Connor's tough, hardscrabble youth.
Where O'Connor's early work was angry, reactionary and musically
fierce, Lohan shows us a kinder, gentler, more melodic Irish
singer..
	   ``No Mermaid,'' Lohan's first major label release, was produced
by Malcolm Burn, a longtime collaborator with Daniel Lanois who
also has worked with Peter Gabriel and Shawn Colvin, and his
experience shows.
	   The album, an accessible blend of Celtic, folk and trip-hop,
showcases Lohan's crisp, clear, lilting vocals.
	   The first and final tracks effectively anchor the album. The
title track already enjoys some well-deserved airplay and the final
track, the catchy ``Diving to Be Deeper,'' is its strongest.

	   ``New York Philharmonic: The Mahler Broadcasts, 1948-82'' (New
York Philharmonic)
	   In one of the finest compilations of classical radio broadcasts
ever released, the New York Philharmonic has issued a 12-disc set
devoted to the music of Gustav Mahler, the orchestra's music
director from 1909 until his death two years later.
	   The largest omission is Leonard Bernstein, who a half-century
later took over the Philharmonic and did more than anyone else to
popularize the conductor. But Bernstein's Mahler is represented in
a complete set issued commercially by Deutsche Grammophon and an
earlier near-complete set on Columbia.
	   This set is filled with gems. Sir John Barbirolli leads an
expansive, elegant First in 1959 and a tense, explosive Ninth three
years later. Zubin Mehta, in one of the finest performances of his
often-dismal tenure, conducts an electric Second in 1982 with
Kathleen Battle and Maureen Forrester.
	   Sir Georg Solti leads a creamy, flowing Fourth in 1962 and Bruno
Walter, like Bernstein a Mahler champion, conducts a dreamy ``Das
Lied von der Erde'' with Kathleen Ferrier in 1948.
	   Also in the set are a Third with Pierre Boulez, a Fifth with
Klaus Tennstedt, a Sixth and a Tenth with Dmitri Mitropoulos, a
Seventh with Rafael Kubelik and an Eighth with Leopold Stokowski.
Mixed with the symphonies are ``Songs of a Wayfarer'' with Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau, discussions with Walter, Stokowski and Barbirolli,
and interviews with musicians who played under Mahler.
	   Unlike the Bernstein set, which for the most part features slow
tempi, anguished passages and cathartic crescendi, this set
displays the different points of view conductors have of the
neurotic composer/conductor, who dominated the New York and
Viennese music worlds for a brief period at the start of the
century. All in all, a remarkable collection.

Defecting Khmer Rouge leader was moderate front-man for killers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 8th graf to show Khieu Samphan instrumental in party
purges, Nuon Chea's involvement &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The defection of Khmer Rouge
intellectual Khieu Samphan to the Cambodian government brings an
end to decades of posturing in which he played the moderate, public
front-man for a gang of history's worst killers.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the mysterious ideologue who was
second-in-command behind longtime leader Pol Pot, hammered two of
the final nails in the coffin of their movement Saturday by
defecting _ in reality, surrendering _ to the Phnom Penh
government.
	   After two years of ruptures in which the once-feared guerrilla
group dwindled to almost nothing, the defections leave only the
brutal one-legged general, Ta Mok, still holding out in the
Cambodian jungles with perhaps 100 loyalists.
	   The death knell comes eight months after Pol Pot, the supreme
Khmer Rouge leader until he was purged in a power struggle in 1997,
succumbed to a purported heart attack.
	   The faces of Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok were hardly known to
the world during the Khmer Rouge's secretive, bloody reign of
terror from 1975 to 1979, when as many as 2 million Cambodians
perished.
	   Instead, Khieu Samphan was the smiling, polite figurehead put
forward as head of state of what was called Democratic Kampuchea.
	   But researchers who have studied Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge
say that Khieu Samphan bore much more responsibility for the deaths
of his countrymen than is often attributed to him.
	   In particular, Khieu Samphan was used by Pol Pot to carry out
internal purges. As for Nuon Chea, evidence shows he was more
deeply involved in blood-letting than Pol Pot himself.
	   ``Khieu Samphan's political star rose literally on heaps of
corpses,'' said Steven Heder, an expert on the Khmer Rouge who
lectures at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.
	   Born in 1931 and the son of a provincial judge, Khieu Samphan
won a government scholarship to study in Cambodia's colonial-ruler
France, where he became involved in communist politics. So did Pol
Pot and other top leaders of what became the Khmer Rouge.
	   The doctoral thesis he submitted at the University of Paris in
1959 is seen as a blueprint of Khmer Rouge economic policy once it
seized power in 1975 _ economic self-reliance and the
collectivization of agriculture.
	   On his return to Cambodia, Khieu Samphan became a professor and
helped establish a left-wing newspaper. He established a reputation
as a principled, honest intellectual and built up a student
following.
	   His activities and popularity alienated then-ruler Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, whose police stripped and beat Khieu Samphan on
the streets of the capital in July 1960 and detained him for a
month.
	   In 1962, Khieu Samphan won a seat in the National Assembly.
	   Sihanouk, hoping to corrupt him and dent his reputation,
appointed Khieu Samphan secretary of state for commerce. He lost
his position for refusing to accept a bribe to overlook illegal
meat trading.
	   Khieu Samphan was re-elected in 1966 but worsening repression
drove him underground into the jungle. Most Cambodians believed
Sihanouk had had him killed.
	   After Sihanouk was overthrown by a U.S.-backed coup in 1970, the
prince formed an alliance with the Khmer Rouge.
	   Khieu Samphan surfaced in 1973 when, as the guerrillas' military
commander-in-chief _ one of his first front-man roles _ he hosted a
visit by the prince to the guerrilla zone.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and cut
Cambodia off from the world. All forms of a market economy were
banned and the cities emptied. Residents were force-marched to the
countryside to labor on agricultural collectives.
	   A year later, they dispensed with Sihanouk _ who was kept
prisoner in his palace _ as figurehead and made Khieu Samphan head
of state to preside over the deaths of as many as 2 million of his
countrymen.
	   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day, 1978, and toppled the
Khmer Rouge two weeks later. Khieu Samphan became chief spokesman
and representative in the decade of maneuverings that followed.
	   The Khmer Rouge joined royalist and republican factions in an
alliance to drive out the Vietnamese, Cambodia's traditional enemy.
Under international pressure, Hanoi pulled out its troops in 1989.
	   Khieu Samphan negotiated multilateral peace accords reached in
1991. But he was attacked by a government-orchestrated mob in Phnom
Penh that year and withdrew to the jungles. The Khmer Rouge
boycotted U.N.-organized elections in 1993.
	   The movement began breaking up in 1996, but Khieu Samphan stayed
with the hard-liners _ against his will, some believed. He remained
the most authoritative voice on clandestine radio broadcasts.
	   Sihanouk, Prime Minister Hun Sen and other leaders often drew a
distinction between Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge chieftains.
	   A small number of younger Cambodians fed up with corruption even
to this day voice admiration for his perceived personal honesty.

Yachts in trouble as wild weather hits fleet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with additional information on stricken yachts, trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Helicopters were on their way Sunday to
attempt to rescue injured crew members from a yacht badly damaged
by gales during the Sydney to Hobart race.
	   Race director Biddy Badenach said the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority was sending helicopters to the South Australian yacht, VC
Offshore Stand Aside.
	   He said the yacht, in northern Bass Strait, had been dismasted,
had lost part of its cabin and was taking water. Some of its 12
crew had been injured but the extent of their injuries was not
known.
	   A crew member had also been injured on Secret Mens Business and
the yacht was making its way to Eden, New South Wales, while
another yacht, Team Jaguar, had been dismasted and a rope had
fouled its propeller.
	   The weather, with winds gusting to 70 knots, was taking a heavy
toll and 20 from the original fleet of 115 had retired and others
were making for Eden to seek shelter until the weather improved.
	   Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara and Brindabella were
continuing their duel in the lead. Around the northern tip of
Flinders Island, Sayonara was about three nautical miles ahead of
its rival.
	   Organizers said they were the worst conditions the race had
struck since the gale-swept 1993 event.
	   The destination in the 630-nautical mile race is Hobart, capital
of the island state of Tasmania.
	   Sayonara and Brindabella remained many miles ahead of the
position reached by German maxi Morning Glory in the same time when
she set the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10
seconds in 1996. (djp)

Weather could help bamboo raft reach Darwin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Favorable weather could help a
16-meter (50-foot) bamboo raft _ retracing what organizers say was
man's first ocean voyage 100,000 years ago _ reach Darwin in
northern Australia by Dec. 31.
	   The raft, Nale Tasih, is the project of Australian maritime
historian Bob Hobman, who is re-enacting the arrival of the
ancestors of Australian aborigines from Kupang on the Indonesian
island of Timor.
	   Early Sunday, the Nale Tasih was 160 nautical miles from its
destination after setting out on Dec. 17, and crossing into
Australian waters on Dec. 26.
	   Hobman said forecasts of freshening winds linked to a
strengthening monsoonal trough across northern Australia could push
the raft to the mainland by Thursday.
	   On board with Hobman is a crew of four, including
Melbourne-based scientist Robert Bednarik, Australian documentary
film maker Peter Rogers, and two Indonesian crew members.
	   Food supplies are being supplemented by fresh fish speared by
the Indonesian sailors.
	   Hobman said the raft's first attempt to cross the Timor Sea
earlier this year was thwarted by the El Nino phenomenon which held
back the annual monsoons in the region.

Stewart scores first century against Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart scored
a stirring maiden Ashes century Sunday but his team collapsed
around him on a tense second day of the fourth test against
Australia at the MCG.
	   England lost its last seven wickets for 70 to be bowled out for
270 after tea on a day extended by an hour because the opening day
was washed out.
	   Australia, having already retained the Ashes with a 2-0 lead
with two to play, reached 59 for two when play was stopped because
of bad light with nine overs to play Sunday. Justin Langer was 26
and Mark Waugh had 12.
	   Stewart, opening the batting for the first time in the series,
watched England slump to 4-2 before guiding it to 200-3. But his
dismissal for 107, with the total at 200, sparked another
disastrous collapse by England's batsmen, who have totaled 25 ducks
in seven innings.
	   Stewart, who averages 41.50 in all tests but just 27.87 against
Australia, played a positive innings for his 12th test hundred
before his dismissal started a slump of three wickets for six runs.
	   With England looking for two wins to level the series, Stewart
abandoned the wicketkeeping gloves to give a debut to Warren Hegg.
The decision allowed him to move out of the middle order, where he
has struggled, to reunite with Mike Atherton at the top of the
order.
	   Their union lasted just five balls before Atherton (0) fell to
Glenn McGrath for the 10th time in his past 19 innings against the
Australians. Atherton was clearly upset by the decision after he
was given out edging through to Ian Healy.
	   McGrath struck again in his next over when No. 3 Mark Butcher
(0) played forward and nicked an inside edge onto his front pad and
Justin Langer snared a superb diving catch at short leg.
	   Stewart put on 77 with Nasser Hussain (19) before the No.4 gave
Matthew Nicholson a first test wicket on debut.
	   Nicholson was smashed for 11 off his opening over but recovered
in his fifth to get an edge from Hussain which gave world
record-holder Healy his 350th test dismissal.
	   Stewart reached his 100, in his 23rd test and 45th innings
against Australia, from 142 balls, getting back to cut an all-run
four off leg-spinner Stuart MacGill.
	   He kissed the three lions emblem on the chest of his shirt and
the spirited partnership with Mark Ramprakash (63) had England in a
rare moment of control.
	   But after the pair compiled a 119-run stand, MacGill started the
collapse by bowling Stewart behind his legs.
	   Ramprakash followed soon after when he spooned a catch off Steve
Waugh to mid-on and Hegg made just three before edging Waugh to
Healy.
	   Graeme Hick and Dean Headley held up the Australian charge,
taking the total to 244-7 after Headley had a bitter battle with
McGrath.
	   Headley twice survived close appeals for catches and the second,
fending away a vicious McGrath bouncer, incensed the paceman. The
pair traded insults and were told to calm down by the umpires.
	   McGrath finally got Headley to a catch at first slip and Hick
picked up the tempo. He moved to 37 with a massive six over
midwicket off MacGill but after adding two more off a mistimed
drive he played a poor shot to give MacGill his wicket.
	   MacGill had Darren Gough bowled behind his pads and Alan
Mullally's fifth duck in six innings gave Shane Warne's stand-in a
fourth wicket.
	   Australia started poorly in reply with Michael Slater trapped
lbw by Gough for one with the total 13. Taylor followed for seven
with the total 26, giving Gough a second wicket when he sliced an
edge to Hick in the slips.

Military govt accuses Suu Kyi of playing politics over expulsion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime accused
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi of ``playing politics''
Sunday by telling her party she won't let herself be deported.
	   Rumors that Suu Kyi would be deported after the New Year have
been spurred by commentaries in the official press and mass rallies
by pro-government organizations calling for her expulsion.
	   The government issued a news release Sunday taking note of a
statement by Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy
that she had urged members not to worry.
	   The government urged the party to engage in a ``more
responsible, constructive cooperation rather than resorting to
whimsical and symbolic gestures designed merely to attract
attention and create seasonal sensational headlines.''
	   The issue of deportation was not squarely addressed. The ruling
State Peace and Development Council often refers to Suu Kyi as a
tool of foreign powers, noting she is married to a Briton, Michael
Aris.
	   Suu Kyi told party members that she is not, however, a British
citizen and could not be deported there.
	   The government statement said that ``the regional economic
crisis is not improving and this is no time to be playing politics.
	   ``As a nation, we need to work together to develop strong
policies on economic development, counter-narcotics ... and the
establishment of national security.''
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, has spent most
of the past decade under house arrest or had her movements
restricted in a struggle with the military rulers for more
democracy.
	   Her party won parliamentary elections in 1990, but the military
never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   The party launched a campaign earlier this year to convene the
parliament unilaterally, triggering a roundup of hundreds of
members. Only those promising to quit her party have been freed.

Tonga mops up after Cyclone Cora
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Tonga on Sunday faced food
shortages and a massive cleanup after Cyclone Cora blasted through
the Pacific Island nation, causing extensive wind and flood damage.
	   Not a single banana tree was left standing on the affected
Tongan islands, a Radio Tonga spokesman told New Zealand's National
Radio on Sunday.
	   ``I don't think any of the crops will be still standing,'' the
spokesman said, adding that crops that survived could die in the
next few days from flooding seawater.
	   There were no reports of injuries, he said, but the whereabouts
of a seven-meter (23-foot) fishing boat with six people on board
was not known.
	   Police said it went missing in high seas off the central Ha'apai
group of islands.
	   About 70,000 people on Tonga's main island of Tongatapu, about
2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) northeast of Wellington, were
without electricity or phone lines.
	   Winds reached up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) during the
cyclone.
	   Weather forecaster Chris Webster said winds on the island had
dropped considerably and the cyclone was well to the southeast of
Tonga.
	   ``It's pretty much open ocean now around that area, but its
still of considerable interest for shipping because anyone who's
around there still obviously needs to know about it,'' Webster
said.

Khmer Rouge defectors secluded as trial urged

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Two main leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge regime who are defecting to the government stayed under wraps
Sunday in a former stronghold of their once-feared guerrilla army.
	   Keut Kan, a deputy governor of Pailin, confirmed that Khieu
Samphan, the official leader of the bloodstained revolutionaries,
and political chief Nuon Chea were staying at ``guesthouses.''
	   They were to travel to the capital, Phnom Penh, to meet Prime
Minister Hun Sen on Tuesday, Keut Kan said.
	   Central government officials could not immediately confirm the
meeting. Though Pailin is technically under government control, its
leaders are all former high-ranking Khmer Rouge.
	   Pailin's top leaders were in the capital at a wedding, Keut Kan
said. There were rumors they were in fact negotiating guarantees of
safety for the newest defectors.
	   ``I met them on Dec. 25 at a border point,'' Keut Kan said. ``I
was told to go there to wait for guests. They came in a car with
their wives and their children.''
	   The rendezvous indicated the pair had been in Thailand, which
has close contacts with the Khmer Rouge. Thai officials repeated
standing denials over the weekend of hosting Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   In New York, the group Human Rights Watch issued a statement
urging that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea be tried and convicted
before any talk of pardoning them.
	   Hun Sen said Saturday that the defection was sealed in a
telephone call Christmas night _ 20 years after Vietnam invaded
Cambodia to topple the Khmer Rouge government.
	   Keut Kan said that he did not have authority to let journalists
meet the defectors but said their health was fine.
	   Khieu Samphan ``looked happy when I met him, but I think he
might be a little worried whether he can live in peace or not,''
Keut Kan said.
	   Pailin is controlled by Ieng Sary, once brother-in-law and
right-hand man of Pol Pot, leader of the regime that caused the
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians after the group seized
power in 1975.
	   Ieng Sary was the first leader to defect to the government in
1996, receiving amnesty in return. He led thousands of guerrillas
out of a stalemated civil war, the beginning of the end of the
movement.
	   The defections leave at large only one major figure, the
one-legged general Ta Mok, at the head of an estimated 100 die-hard
loyalists. They pose no threat to the government.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who is receiving medical treatment in
Beijing, has approved the defections. The monarch was held prisoner
in his palace under the Khmer Rouge regime and lost a dozen family
members.
	   Sihanouk expressed ``deep gratitude about this good news,''
echoing conciliatory language used by Hun Sen that indicated the
pair had surrendered in exchange for guarantees they would not be
harmed.
	   The government and the United States have said in the past that
they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok tried by Cambodian
courts or an international tribunal for crimes against humanity.
	   Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power struggle last year _ died of
a purported heart attack in April.
	   Legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited Cambodia
last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. The report should reach Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a
few weeks.
	   Om Yentieng, a Hun Sen aide, said the prime minister supports a
trial, but only in woefully unequipped local courts.
	   Granting de facto amnesty to Khmer Rouge leaders has brought
peace to nearly all of Cambodia for the first time in a generation,
but at the price of holding none of the guerrillas accountable for
their crimes.

In new challenge, Iraq says it will fire on planes in no-fly zone

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In its latest challenge to the United
States and Britain, Iraq declared that it will fire on warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones that Washington and its allies imposed
after the Gulf War.
	   The United States and Britain said their aircraft would continue
to enforce the no-fly zones and pilots would respond to any
threats.
	   ``Iraq knows that it should not interfere with those flights,
and our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel threatened at
any time,'' National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley said
in Washington.
	   A Ministry of Defense spokesman in London said all British and
American aircraft ``operate to a very strict set of rules of
engagement. If aircraft are threatened those rules of engagement do
allow the return of fire.''
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. French aircraft no longer patrol
the northern zone, but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   A week after a U.S.-British bombing campaign against Iraq ended,
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said his government would
not allow flights over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera television
Saturday.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``When you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of
violations of the country's airspace since the United States and
Britain ended four days of airstrikes on Dec. 19.
	   State-run television has been showing footage in recent days of
pro-Iraq demonstrations in several Arab capitals. A commentator on
Saturday night warned Arab rulers who do not support Baghdad that
their citizens will have the final say.
	   Babil, published by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai,
echoed the warning in a front-page editorial Sunday.
	   ``Arab masses have denounced and rejected the stand ... of some
Arab governments who endorsed strikes on Iraq,'' the paper said.
	   The paper published by Saddam's ruling Baath Party criticized
Saudi Arabia, charging it showed ``flagrant hostility'' against
Iraq by ``putting its airports and territorial waters in the
service of the forces of aggression.''
	   Ramadan's interview was conducted in Baghdad hours after Iraq
said its anti-aircraft gunners had driven off an attack by
``enemy'' warplanes trying to hit an air defense site.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said the planes flew in from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but it did not identify their nationality.
	   Iraq usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe warplanes from
the United States and Britain. The United States and Britain base
aircraft in Kuwait and the United States also has aircraft in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Washington and London denied any attacks on Iraq.
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman speaking with customary
anonymity said a British pilot Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft
fire but he did not consider it hostile.''
	   The United States and Britain launched the attacks after U.N.
weapons inspectors released a report saying Baghdad had not fully
cooperated as it promised in November when airstrikes were called
off.
	   Iraq has said the inspectors will not be allowed to return.

Human-rights group urges trial of Khmer Rouge leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A leading human-rights group urged
the Cambodian government Sunday to arrest and put two defecting
leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial for mass murder before
discussing a pardon.
	   In a statement from New York, Human Rights Watch noted that
Prime Minister Hun Sen has hinted that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
might be allowed to live as ordinary citizens in exchange for
making peace.
	   Sidney Jones, Asia director for the group, said it was the right
of the Cambodian government to decide whether to pardon the men if
they are first tried and convicted by an international court for
crimes against humanity.
	   ``But to allow these men to return to society as if one of the
worst massacres of the 20th century never took place _ that's
unthinkable,'' Jones said.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were key figures in the
Maoist-inspired Khmer Rouge regime, which caused the deaths of as
many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.
	   Their government was toppled by a Vietnamese invasion, but the
group fought a civil war to a stalemate until fatally weakened by
defections in 1996.
	   The latest defections leave just one major Khmer Rouge
chieftain, the brutal one-legged general, Ta Mok, at large with no
more than an estimated 100 followers. They pose no threat to the
government.
	   Human Rights Watch said that in other countries where there has
been massive human-rights abuses and a desire for reconciliation, a
consensus was reached to first identify those responsible and make
the full extent of their crimes known.
	   Jones identified South Africa, Argentina, Rwanda and Chile.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police and soldiers patrolled an
Indonesian port town on Sunday after mobs led by Muslim clerics
attacked brothels, throwing stones and injuring several people.
	   The violence broke out Friday in a red-light district in the
town of Belawan on Sumatra island, about 1,400 kilometers (870
miles) northwest of capital.
	   Several thousand people had staged a protest to demand that the
local government curb prostitution during the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan, which began a week ago. Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200
million people are Muslim.
	   The rally soon turned into a riot, and buildings were damaged.
There were no arrests.
	   Belawan was peaceful on Sunday, police Lt. Siregar said by
telephone. Some shops were open and security forces patrolled on
foot and in trucks.
	   Prostitution is illegal in Indonesia, but is widely condoned.
	   In a separate incident, the daily Kompas newspaper reported
Sunday that angry residents in the Sulawesi island town of
Jeneponto set afire the local parliament building.
	   The protesters, who attacked the government building on Friday,
alleged that the new mayor had bribed legislators to award him the
job.
	   Plagued by political uncertainty and an economic crisis,
Indonesia endured sporadic riots this year that reached a peak in
May just before the ouster of its longtime authoritarian leader,
President Suharto.
	   Religious and ethnic tensions have been rising and many people
fear more turbulence ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for
June.

Stewart scores first century against Australia

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart scored
a stirring maiden Ashes century Sunday but his team collapsed
around him on a tense second day of the fourth test against
Australia at the MCG.
	   England lost its last seven wickets for 70 to be bowled out for
270 after tea after Saturday's opening day was washed out.
	   Australia, having already retained the Ashes with a 2-0 lead
with two to play, reached 59 for two when play was stopped because
of bad light with nine overs to go Sunday. Justin Langer was 26 and
Mark Waugh had 12.
	   Stewart, opening the batting for the first time in the series,
watched England slump to 4-2 before guiding it to 200-3. But his
dismissal for 107, with the total at 200, sparked another
disastrous collapse by England's batsmen.
	   Stewart, who before Sunday's innings averaged 41.50 in all tests
but just 27.87 against Australia, played a positive innings for his
12th test hundred.
	   With England looking for two wins to level the series, Stewart
abandoned the wicketkeeping gloves to give a debut to Warren Hegg.
The decision allowed him to move out of the middle order, where he
has struggled, to reunite with Mike Atherton at the top of the
order.
	   Stewart said he opened the batting because an injury to paceman
Alex Tudor fforced him to recast the side.
	   ``I can't say I'm never going to keep wicket again and I can't
say I'm not going to open the batting again,'' Stewart said. ``By
choice I would always open, but if the side needs me keeping and
batting down the order than that's what will happen.''
	   His reunion with Atherton lasted just five balls before Atherton
(0) fell to Glenn McGrath for the 10th time in his past 19 innings
against the Australians. Atherton was clearly upset by the decision
after he was given out edging through to Ian Healy.
	   McGrath struck again in his next over when No.3 Mark Butcher (0)
played forward and nicked an inside edge onto his front pad and
Justin Langer snared a superb diving catch at short leg.
	   Stewart put on 77 with Nasser Hussain (19) before the No.4 gave
Matthew Nicholson a first test wicket on debut.
	   Nicholson was smashed for 11 off his opening over but recovered
in his fifth to get an edge from Hussain which gave world
record-holder Healy his 350th test dismissal.
	   Stewart reached his 100, in his 23rd test and 45th innings
against Australia, from 142 balls, getting back to cut an all-run
four off leg-spinner Stuart MacGill.
	   He kissed the three lions emblem on the chest of his shirt and
the spirited partnership with Mark Ramprakash (63) had England in a
rare moment of control.
	   But after the pair compiled a 119-run stand, MacGill started the
collapse by bowling Stewart behind his legs.
	   Ramprakash followed soon after when he spooned a catch off Steve
Waugh to mid-on and Hegg made just three before edging Waugh to
Healy.
	   Graeme Hick and Dean Headley held up the Australian charge,
taking the total to 244-7 after Headley had a bitter battle with
McGrath.
	   Headley twice survived close appeals for catches and the second,
fending away a vicious McGrath bouncer, incensed the paceman. The
pair traded insults and were told to calm down by the umpires.
	   McGrath finally got Headley out to a catch at first slip and
Hick picked up the tempo. He moved to 37 with a massive six over
midwicket off MacGill but after adding two more off a mistimed
drive he played a poor shot to give MacGill his wicket.
	   MacGill had Darren Gough bowled behind his pads and Alan
Mullally's fifth duck in six innings gave Shane Warne's stand-in a
fourth wicket.
	   Australia started poorly in reply with Michael Slater trapped
lbw by Gough for one with the total 13. Taylor followed for seven
with the score 26, giving Gough a second wicket when he sliced an
edge to Hick in the slips.

Russia puts newest nuclear missile generation online.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The military put 10 new Topol-M nuclear missiles
on full combat readiness Sunday, the first time the missile has
been deployed. The missile was developed to sustain Russia as a
global nuclear power.
	   The single-warhead Topol-M's were commissioned in the Saratov
region, about 700 kilometers (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The deployment was a major step for Russia's cash-strapped
military. The government doesn't have enough money to maintain all
its armed forces, and decided to concentrate defense spending on
developing the Topol-M.
	   ``This is a very important event, because even in the difficult
financial conditions of 1998 we have managed to find funds for
financing this top priority area,'' said Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   The intercontinental Topol-M will be the new heart of Russia's
missile forces. Forty are expected to be built by the end of 2000,
taking the place of heavier, multiple-warhead missiles.
	   The Topol-M is a lightweight, rugged missile designed to be
fired from a vehicle. It's mobility increases its safety from
preemptive enemy first strikes, unlike silo-based warheads.

Rights groups: China sentences dissident to 10 years imprisonment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with more details, another human rights
group's report
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Broadening a crackdown on dissent, China
sentenced a labor activist Sunday to 10 years imprisonment for
giving interviews to the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia, a
human rights group said.
	   Zhang Shanguang was the fourth dissident given a lengthy jail
term in a week. He was sentenced following a 2-hour, 20-minute
hearing from which his wife and relatives were barred, said Human
Rights in China, a New York-based group.
	   The harsh sentence underscored a renewed determination by the
ruling Communist Party to keep a tight grip on power as it grapples
with mounting unemployment and economic difficulties, and heads
into a politically charged year.
	   The 10th anniversary of the government's crackdown on democracy
protests on Tiananmen Square falls in June. A few months later, in
October, the Communist Party will fete the 50th anniversary of its
rule over China, and in December China takes back control of the
Portuguese colony of Macau.
	   Officials are anxious to ensure that no one seizes upon these
events to push for change or vent grievances.
	   In a strident speech last week, President Jiang Zemin vowed to
crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and ordered that
threats to stability be ``resolutely nipped in the bud.''
	   Zhang's summary trial follows heavy sentences given last week to
three of China's most prominent dissidents: Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin
and Wang Youcai. They were charged with endangering state security
and sentenced to 13 years, 12 years and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Zhang, however, was not a member of the would-be opposition
group and his sentence suggested a broadening of the government's
efforts to crush dissent.
	   Zhang had been working on setting up an association to protect
the rights of laid-off workers when he was arrested in July, after
the visit to China by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In convicting Zhang, the court in southern China's Hunan
province ruled that by telling Radio Free Asia about farmers'
protests, he violated an article of China's criminal code that bars
people from providing ``intelligence'' to people overseas, Human
Rights in China said.
	   The crime carries a maximum penalty of death. Human Rights in
China said that apart from a 10-year sentence Zhang also was
stripped of his political rights for five years, meaning he will be
under close official supervision after his release.
	   A Hong Kong-based group, the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China, also reported that Zhang received
a 10-year-sentence for releasing intelligence abroad, although it
did not mention Radio Free Asia.
	   Zhang had already served a seven-year jail term for labor
activism and prosecutors had reportedly called on the court to
strictly punish him at his trial Sunday as a repeat offender.
	   Hunan police mobilized ``a large number'' of officers to watch
other dissidents at home and prevent them from going to the court
in Huaihua city to show support for Zhang, Human Rights in China
said.
	   Despite the tight security, it said some people from as far away
as Beijing, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to the north, had given
police the slip and were in Huaihua to show support for Zhang.
	   It also said that 274 people in more than 20 provinces and major
cities had signed an open letter calling for Zhang's release.
	   The letter was addressed to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Mary Robinson, the U.N.'s top human rights official who
visited China in September, it said.

Police investigating suicides after poison ordered on Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to CLARIFY that two suicides were among the
seven who ordered cyanide; EDITS throughout; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By KELLY OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man who reportedly ran a ``suicide clinic'' on
the Internet is suspected of providing cyanide to seven customers,
including at least one woman who killed herself with the poison,
police said Sunday.
	   The man reportedly called himself ``Dr. Kiriko'' _ a Japanese
comic book character who practices euthanasia _ and killed himself
earlier this month. A second of his customers also killed herself,
but with sleeping pills.
	   A police spokesman in Tokyo who gave only his surname, Fujii,
said on Sunday that the seven people who ordered cyanide
transferred money to the bank account of the man.
	   His body was discovered at his home in the city of Sapporo on
Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido on Dec. 15. Quoting
unidentified police sources, Kyodo News agency said he was a
27-year-old pharmacist with a history of mental illness. Media
reports said he committed suicide.
	   The cyanide suicides are the latest in a year of bizarre
poisoning cases that have troubled Japan, which once prided itself
on relative freedom from indiscriminate crime.
	   ``At the close of a dark year yet another poisoning incident
symbolic of it has occurred,'' lamented the Yomiuri newspaper,
Japan's largest, in a Sunday editorial.
	   Fujii said police are investigating the suicides of two of ``Dr.
Kiriko's'' customers, a 21-year-old Tokyo woman who died from an
apparent overdose of sleeping pills and another person who died
after taking cyanide.
	   The Asahi newspaper reported the woman who used cyanide was a
24-year-old Tokyo resident and committed suicide on Dec. 15.
Yomiuri reported Sunday that another Tokyo woman has confessed to
acting as an intermediary between the suicide victim and the
cyanide provider.
	   Fujii said three others who made cash transfers have been
confirmed alive, while two remain unaccounted for. Media reports,
however, said four have been confirmed alive.
	   Kyodo reported that the man's Internet site was called ``Dr.
Kiriko's consultation room,'' featured information on suicide by
poisoning and offered advice via e-mail for those who wanted to
kill themselves.
	   The suicides were the latest in a string of poison deaths this
year in Japan.
	   In July, four people died and 63 became ill after eating curry
rice laced with arsenic at a summer festival in southwestern Japan.
A former insurance saleswoman was arrested earlier this month on
murder and attempted murder charges in those deaths.
	   The poisoning set off a spate of copycat crimes with drinks at
stores and in vending machines, including a man who died after
drinking a can of tainted tea.

Muslim rebels say they will pursue fight for separate Islamic state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) _ The country's largest Muslim
rebel group said Sunday it would keep fighting for a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines despite a government
peace plan.
	   ``We will not compromise our demand for independence,'' said
Ghazali Jaafar, deputy chairman of the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, which is waging an insurrection in the southern
island of Mindanao.
	   Jaafar said their demand for an independent Muslim state is
``non-negotiable.''
	   The statement came after government officials said Saturday they
would speed up peace talks with Muslim and communist rebels and try
to forge peace accords with both groups next year.
	   President Joseph Estrada, however, said any such accord should
be consistent with the Philippine constitution _ a requirement that
often has stalled the talks in past years.
	   Philippine officials have said the establishment of a separate
state is unconstitutional and unacceptable. The government also has
turned down a demand by the Muslim rebels for the government to
recognize 46 MILF camps in Mindanao as rebel-held territories.
	   The Manila government's talks with communist rebels also have
stalled after the government rejected the rebels' demand to
implement a human rights accord as they _ and not the government _
see fit.
	   The Philippine government has initiated talks with rebel groups
to end decades-old strife that has taken the country's attention
away from pressing economic problems.
	   In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement with a Muslim
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, ending a
quarter-century separatist uprising in Mindanao that killed more
than 120,000 people. A year after, the government began peace talks
with the MILF.
	   The government has been holding on-and-off peace talks with
communist rebels since 1992 in the Netherlands, where rebel leaders
live.

President's office threatens penalties against LG Semicon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks will meet this week to
discuss calling in loans from LG Semicon Co. accused of resisting
President Kim Dae-jung's attempt to reform big businesses, an
official said Sunday.
	   Kim's government wants LG Semicon to merge with Hyundai
Electronics Industry Co. to cut down overlapping investments in the
country's computer chip makers and boost their competitiveness.
	   But LG is resisting a recommendation that Hyundai should take
control of the merged company.
	   ``The merge should take place no matter what,'' said
presidential spokesman Park Jie-won on Sunday. ``Financial
sanctions will become inevitable and creditor banks will call in
maturing loans if LG continues to resist the reform.''
	   Officials said creditor banks of LG Semicon, most of them
state-controlled, will meet Monday to discuss calling in loans and
denying new funds for the company, which is already hevily in debt.
	   The government has increased pressure on LG Semicon since
Thursday when U.S. consulting company Arthur D. Little Inc.
recommended that Hyundai become a majority shareholder in the
merged company.
	   Earlier Sunday, LG Semicon reiterated it can not accept the
recommendation and said it would file a lawsuit against Arthur D.
Little in a U.S. court next month, accusing it of damaging the
South Korean company's reputation.
	   Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest
conglomerates, agreed in principle in September to merge their
chip-making subsidiaries.
	   After failing in November to work out details of the proposed
merger on their own, Hyundai and LG agreed to a government
suggestion that they hire Arthur D. Little to study who should take
control of the new company.
	   But LG Semicon later accused the Massachusetts-based consultants
firm of being biased in favor of Hyundai and failing to take into
consideration LG's opinions during its month-long research.
	   Government officials regarded LG's position as threatening to
derail President Kim's efforts to restructure the country's
debt-ridden industries through mergers.
	   The LG-Hyundai merger, if realized, would create the world's
second largest memory chip maker with 17 percent of the world
market. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. would remain the
biggest with a 20 percent global share.
	   Both Hyundai LG have borrowed heavily to expand their
semiconductor facilities. Hyundai Electronics is dlrs 8.2 billion
in debt, or 9.3 times its equity, while LG Semicon's debt totals
dlrs 5 billion, or six times its equity.
	   South Korean conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding
during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the current
financial crisis. A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50
subsidiaries.

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Gales caused havoc in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Sunday, with crew washed overboard,
yachts abandoned and a helicopter winching injured crew members
from mountainous seas.
	   A crew member from the Sydney yacht Sword of Orion was still
missing Sunday evening as the Australian Navy deployed helicopters
with night vision.
	   With westerlies gusting to more than 70 knots off the southern
New South Wales coast and in Bass Strait, several yachts reported
injuries and serious damage. One rolled in 10-meter (34-foot) seas.
	   At least 20 yachts in the field of 115 which set out from Sydney
on Saturday had retired before sunset Sunday and others went to
port at Eden, New South Wales, to wait for better weather.
	   Through it all, giant American maxi Sayonara and last year's
line honors winner Brindabella continued their duel through Bass
Strait.
	   Sayonara was about four nautical miles ahead off the northern
tip of Flinders Island.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile
race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by
German maxi Morning Glory in 1996.
	   Tasmanian race director Biddy Badenoch said conditions were
extremely severe, the worst since the 1993 race when 66 of the 104
starters had to retire.
	   The Navy deployed Sea King and Sea Hawk helicopters with night
vision capability and put its frigate Newcastle on standby in
Sydney.
	   Crew members were lost overboard from Victorian yacht Kingurra
and Sydney yacht Sword of Orion. A helicopter plucked the Kingurra
crew member to safety.
	   The South Australian yacht VC Offshore Stand Aside was abandoned
after being dismasted, some of its cabin washed away and three crew
injured.
	   Helicopters winched the 12 crew to safety and they were flown to
Malacoota in Victoria state. Search and rescue officials said one
person had a badly injured hand, another a suspected dislocated
knee and a third face lacerations. (djp)

Cease-fire monitors condemn attacks on civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAQOURA, Lebanon (AP) _ A multinational committee that monitors
a cease-fire in southern Lebanon on Sunday condemned the killing of
seven Lebanese civilians and injuries to 16 Israelis in last week's
hostilities.
	   The group _ with representatives from the United States, France,
Lebanon, Israel and Syria _ accused Israel and Lebanese guerrillas
of violating the 1996 truce and renewed their call to both sides
not to target civilians, according to a statement.
	   The group met Saturday night to discuss a Lebanese complaint
that was filed after an Israeli air strike killed a Lebanese woman
and six of her children in the Bekaa Valley on Dec. 22. Israel
called the civilian deaths an accident.
	   It also took up an Israeli complaint that Hezbollah guerrillas
retaliated by firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. An
Israeli civilian was treated for injuries and 15 others for shock.
	   The statement, issued after a 12-hour meeting, said of the
attack on Lebanon that ``the monitoring group condemned this grave
incident, which led to such tragic and unacceptable consequences.''
	   The committee urged Israel to take ``effective measures'' to
ensure that its military operations do not result in civilian
casualties.
	   It also condemned Hezbollah's retaliation and ``called upon
Lebanon to ensure that Lebanese armed groups do no carry out such
attacks,'' the statement said.
	   The monitoring group was created as part of a U.S.-brokered
cease-fire in April 1996 after a 16-day Israeli bombardment that
killed at least 175 people, mostly Lebanese civilians.
	   The understanding, which prohibits targeting civilians or firing
from civilian areas, has been violated frequently. But the
monitoring group has succeeded in containing hostilities.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their
2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from southern Lebanon.
	   Israel set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in southern
Lebanon in 1985 to try to shield its northern towns from
cross-border attacks.

Australia will resist life bans for Warne, Mark Waugh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia will resist calls for life
bans on test stars Shane Warne and Mark Waugh when cricket's
governing body meets next month to discuss gambling in the sport.
	   Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Khalid Mahmood was Sunday
reported as saying that Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka would lobby
the International Cricket Council (ICC) at its meeting in New
Zealand to slap life bans on Warne and Waugh.
	   The Australian pair apologized earlier this month for providing
pitch and weather information to an illegal Indian bookmaker while
on tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   The duo were fined by the Australian Cricket Board in February
1995 in action kept secret until early December.
	   The bookmaker scandal and the impact of gambling on cricket is
on the agenda of the ICC meeting on Jan. 10-11 in Christchurch.
	   Mahmood said ICC member nations from the subcontinent were set
to turn up the heat over Waugh and Warne.
	   ``The subcontinent was unanimous that the guilty players should
be banned for life when we met at New Delhi 10 days ago,'' Mahmood
said.
	   ``At least three countries (Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka) will
be pressing the ICC to step in, investigate the charges and clamp
life bans on those found guilty.''
	   Any ban would have to be approved by a majority of the nine ICC
executive board members with Australia certain to resist.
	   ACB chairman Denis Rogers and chief executive officer Malcolm
Speed could not be contacted Sunday but both have said the board
considers the Waugh and Warne controversy closed.
	   They have declined to supply documents relating to the ACB's
investigation in 1994-95 into Waugh and Warne to a Pakistan
judicial inquiry into match fixing.
	   Two days before the ICC meeting, Waugh and Warne will give
testimony before the Pakistan inquiry sitting in Melbourne.
	   PCB legal adviser Ali Sibtain Fazli and Lahore High Court
Registrar Abdus Salam Khawar will travel to Australia to hear the
testimony because Waugh and Warne were reluctant to travel to
Pakistan, and attempts to set up a live video link failed.
	   Waugh, Warne and former test spinner Tim May have accused former
Pakistan captain Salim Malik of offering them bribes to play poorly
during Australia's tour of Pakistan in 1994, which followed the Sri
Lankan tour.
	   Waugh testified before the inquiry in October when Australia was
touring Pakistan but investigating judge Malik Qayyum said the
batsman, currently playing against England in the fourth test in
Melbourne, needed to be interviewed again following his admission
of accepting money from an illegal bookmaker.
	   Warne did not testify in Lahore as he missed the recent tour of
Pakistan because of shoulder injury.
	   Malik has denied the charges against him and says Warne's and
Waugh's admission over the Indian bookmaker proves his innocence.

 &UR; Stewart finally cracks 100 against Australia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ It took 23 tests and nearly 10 years
of trying, but England cricket captain Alec Stewart finally scored
a century against Australia on Sunday.
	   Stewart's record against Australia has been the one blot on an
otherwise impressive record. He came into the series averaging over
41 in his test career but just 26 against Australia.
	   In 22 previous tests he'd managed just seven half-centuries
against Australia before finally cracking it for the three figures
Sunday, smashing 107 out of England's total of 270 as the fourth
Ashes test got underway.
	   ``It's nice to get any hundred but this one was very special,''
said Stewart.
	   ``I've played 20-odd test matches against Australia and most of
those I've been on the wrong end of, so it was a very good feeling
to chalk up a personal milestone and to do it on the MCG was very
special.''
	   Stewart's 107 included 16 fours, came off 160 balls and was even
more impressive considering his side had collapsed to 4-2 after he
lost both opening partner Michael Atherton and No. 3 Mark Butcher
without scoring.
	   The England skipper remained positive throughout and continued
to play his shots with his hooking and pulling particularly
impressive.
	   He brought up his hundred with an all-run four off leg spinner
Stuart MacGill and his joy and relief was instantly obvious.
	   It was no coincidence that Stewart's return to form came after
he decided to dispense with the wicketkeeping duties and promote
himself back to the top of the order, where he averages 48 in test
cricket.
	   But the England skipper could not guarantee he would concentrate
on opening the batting and shun keeping wickets in future, saying
he only made the decision to open in this game and hand the
wicketkeeping gloves to debutant Warren Hegg 10 minutes before the
scheduled starting time Saturday.
	   ``I decided at 10:20 on Boxing Day once Alex Tudor was not fit,
and when he wasn't available to play I wanted to do something that
appeared attacking and to do that I moved up from four or five to
open and gave Warren Hegg the gloves,'' Stewart said.
	   ``It all depends on how we are playing. Normally when I've kept
wicket it's been to enable us to play five bowlers but on this tour
it's been so we could play seven batsman because we have been
playing so poorly.
	   ``I've always said my preference is to open but I'll do whatever
is best for the team.'' (djp)

Museveni in Libya for talks on Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni flew to
Libya, apparently violating U.N. sanctions, for talks with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, the official JANA news agency said Sunday.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the two met Sunday morning.
	   The JANA report, monitored by the BBC, said the two leaders
would discuss the peace process in the Great Lakes region of
Africa.
	   Museveni told reporters on arrival in the Libyan capital Tripoli
on Saturday that he and Gadhafi also would discuss ``new issues in
order to contribute to the solution of the continent's problems,''
the BBC quoted JANA as saying.
	   African leaders have been flying into Libya since the
Organization of African Unity announced in June that it would no
longer abide by the air embargo against Libya when the trips
involved official business or humanitarian projects.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed an air travel ban and other
sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.

Report: Expert says North Korean food shortage related to rice
</HEADLINE>
type &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Food shortages in North Korea may be due in part to
the type of rice that is planted in the country, according to
findings of test cultivation in Japan by an agricultural expert,
Kyodo News reported Sunday.
	   The rice planted in North Korea has smaller yields and is less
resistant to disease than the popular Japanese variety, Shoichi
Ishii, president of an agricultural firm in northern Japan, was
quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   Ishii planted the North Korean rice and Japanese ``Koshihikari''
rice in a 100-square-meter (yard) paddy field he owns in Shibata,
in northern Japan, and grew the two varieties under identical
conditions.
	   The North Korean rice yielded less than 80 percent the harvest
of the Koshihikari, he said. Ishii said diseases attacked the North
Korean rice but had almost no effect on the Japanese rice.
	   ``North Korea plants the same type of rice over and over
again,'' he was quoted as saying, adding that may have caused its
tolerance to weaken.
	   Ishii said the comparative test proved his suspicion that the
type of rice planted in North Korea may be a cause of the country's
food shortages, and suggests that food conditions there ``may not
improve as long as they continue to use the same kind of rice.''
	   He began the experiment after receiving inquiries from
institutions including the Foreign Ministry. Ishii personally
brought the North Korean rice seeds back to Japan after a visit to
Pyongyang in 1996, Kyodo said.

In new challenge, Iraq says it will fire on planes in no-fly zone

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In its latest challenge to the United
States and Britain, Iraq declared that it will fire on warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones that Washington and its allies imposed
after the Gulf War.
	   The United States and Britain said their aircraft would continue
to enforce the no-fly zones and pilots would respond to any
threats.
	   ``Iraq knows that it should not interfere with those flights,
and our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel threatened at
any time,'' National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley said
in Washington.
	   A Ministry of Defense spokesman in London said all British and
American aircraft ``operate to a very strict set of rules of
engagement. If aircraft are threatened those rules of engagement do
allow the return of fire.''
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. French aircraft no longer patrol
the northern zone, but still help to maintain the southern zone.
	   A week after a U.S.-British bombing campaign against Iraq ended,
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said his government would
not allow flights over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi airspace will
be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera television
Saturday.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the area.
	   Asked why Iraq had not fired previously on planes enforcing the
no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``When you want to restore your rights,
you choose the suitable time and circumstances.''
	   Ramadan repeated Iraq's hardened stance in an interview with
Associated Press Television News on Sunday, saying: ``The so-called
farce of no-fly zones must end. ... The so-called no-fly zones only
exist in the British and American imagination.''
	   Ramadan also said it was not imperative that Iraq be invited to
a summit some Arab nations are seeking to convene.
	   But he said that if the summit does not denounce the U.S. and
British airstrikes and call for lifting sanctions, it will be
viewed by Baghdad as ``a new conspiracy.''

Rights groups: China sentences dissident to 10 years imprisonment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with U.S. embassy comment; Picks
up 10th graf, ``Zhang had.'' &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Broadening a crackdown on dissent, China swiftly
tried and sentenced a labor activist Sunday to 10 years
imprisonment for giving interviews to the U.S. government-funded
Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
	   Zhang Shanguang was the fourth dissident given a lengthy jail
term in a week. He was sentenced following a 2-hour, 20-minute
hearing from which his wife and relatives were barred, said Human
Rights in China, a New York-based group.
	   The harsh sentence underscored a renewed determination by the
ruling Communist Party to keep a tight grip on power as it grapples
with mounting unemployment and economic difficulties, and heads
into a politically charged year.
	   The 10th anniversary of the government's crackdown on democracy
protests on Tiananmen Square falls in June. A few months later, in
October, the Communist Party will fete the 50th anniversary of its
rule over China, and in December China takes back control of the
Portuguese colony of Macau.
	   Officials are anxious to ensure that no one seizes upon these
events to push for change or vent grievances.
	   In a strident speech last week, President Jiang Zemin vowed to
crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and ordered that
threats to stability be ``resolutely nipped in the bud.''
	   Zhang's summary trial follows heavy sentences given last week to
three of China's most prominent dissidents: Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin
and Wang Youcai. They were charged with endangering state security
and sentenced to 13 years, 12 years and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Zhang, however, was not a member of the would-be opposition
group and his sentence suggested a broadening of the government's
efforts to crush dissent.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing, through its spokesman, Bill Palmer,
said Sunday it was ``deeply disappointed with the guilty verdicts
and the extremely harsh sentences'' handed down in the past week.
	   Zhang had been working on setting up an association to protect
the rights of laid-off workers when he was arrested in July, after
the visit to China by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Millions of
workers have been laid-off as state factories are shut down or
restructured, making officials fearful of labor unrest.
	   In convicting Zhang, the court in southern China's Hunan
province ruled that by telling Radio Free Asia about farmers'
protests, he violated an article of China's criminal code that bars
people from providing ``intelligence'' to people overseas, Human
Rights in China said.
	   The crime carries a maximum penalty of death. Human Rights in
China said that apart from a 10-year sentence Zhang also was
stripped of his political rights for five years, meaning he will be
under close official supervision after his release.
	   A Hong Kong-based group, the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China, also said Zhang received a
10-year sentence for releasing intelligence abroad, although it did
not mention Radio Free Asia.
	   Zhang had already served a seven-year jail term for labor
activism and prosecutors had reportedly called on the court to
strictly punish him at his trial Sunday as a repeat offender.
	   Hunan police mobilized ``a large number'' of officers to watch
other dissidents at home and prevent them from going to the court
in Huaihua city to show support for Zhang, Human Rights in China
said.
	   Despite the tight security, it said some people from as far away
as Beijing, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to the north, had given
police the slip and were in Huaihua to show their support.
	   It also said that 274 people in more than 20 provinces and major
cities had signed an open letter calling for Zhang's release.
	   The letter was addressed to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Mary Robinson, the U.N.'s top human rights official who
visited China in September, it said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Frustrated filmmakers have criticized
Thai authorities for refusing permit a remake of ``The King and I''
_ a Hollywood classic many Thais feel insults a former monarch _ to
be shot on location.
	   The Thai Film Board has said that 20th Century Fox has not done
enough to ensure the monarchy would be respected in ``Anna and The
King,'' starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat.
	   Thai coordinators for the project and the screenwriter who tried
to make a fifth version of the script palatable to Thai
sensibilities called the board ``paranoid'' in a weekend news
conference.
	   ``There can be only one reason why the board didn't approve the
fifth script, and that is fear,'' coordinator Malinee Chakraband
was quoted as saying in Sunday's Bangkok Post. ``If it was so
afraid that errors might happen, it should allow the filming
here.''
	   Chakraband and her sister, both royal family members, said that
Fox had invited unprecedented participation by Thai officialdom to
get permission to film on location.
	   After several script rejections, the studio announced last month
it would shoot instead in neighboring Malaysia. The Thai
coordinators and screenwriter Stanley Harper gave it one last try.
	   ``Fox has never before offered anyone to take part in its
post-production,'' Harper was quoted as saying. ``This was enormous
for them.''
	   The films ``The King and I'' and the earlier ``Anna and The King
of Siam,'' as Thailand was once known, were based on the memoirs of
Anna Leonowens, a 19th century governess hired by King Mongkut to
teach English to his children.
	   Thais contend that Leonowens repeated unsubstantiated gossip and
greatly exaggerated her own importance. Historians note that
Mongkut _ a respected linguist and Buddhist scholar _ probably met
her only once, if at all.
	   Thais revere their monarchy. Insulting the king carries a prison
term of up to 15 years. Though Mongkut's great-grandson, King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, has seen ``The King and I'' and professes to
enjoy it, the film is banned in Thailand.

Iraq urges Arabs to lift U.N. embargo on the country

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraq on Sunday submitted a draft resolution
to a meeting of Arab legislators urging Arab nations to ignore U.N.
sanctions on Iraq and demanding that all foreign troops be pulled
out of the Gulf.
	   The resolution was put before the Arab Parliamentary Union by a
delegation headed by Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as
about 200 members of Jordanian political parties and unions held a
sit-in to demand an end to the sanctions.
	   Outside Amman's Royal Theater where the lawmakers are meeting,
the demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and waved banner
saying any aggression on Iraq amounts to an attack on the entire
Arab world.
	   Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq that ended Dec. 19
brought demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support of
Iraq, but until now all Arab governments have adhered to the trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   When Hammadi arrived Saturday in Amman, he said Sunday's
emergency meeting of Arab lawmakers should be a ``reflection of
Arab masses' condemnation of the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq
and a demand for governments to break the embargo.''
	   Eighteen out of the Parliamentary Union's 19 member states are
due to send delegations to the meeting. Kuwait _ which has resisted
all efforts to ease sanctions on Iraq _ has said it will not take
part.
	   The Iraqi resolution urges Arabs to condemn the American and
British governments for their disrespect to Muslims since the air
attacks spilled over into the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim
month of fasting and prayer.
	   It called the attack ``a racial aggression ... against Islam.''
	   The resolution urges that ``Arab governments lift the embargo on
Iraq and impose sanctions on the U.S.-U.K. interests in the Arab
World.''
	   The United States and Britain have been the strongest advocates
of maintaining the sanctions, which limit Iraq's oil exports and
cannot be lifted until U.N. experts certify the county has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. and British officials said the attacks were aimed at
degrading the ability of President Saddam Hussein's government to
make prohibited weapons and at demanding the Iraq reverse its
pledge not to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   The Iraqi resolution submitted Sunday also calls on Arab
parliaments to demand foreign troops be pulled out of the Arab Gulf
states and that those states stop providing facilities and services
to foreign armies.
	   The United States has some 17,000 troops in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia
and Bahrain and on ships offshore. Britain also has troops and
warplanes in Kuwait and several ships in the Gulf.
	   In the past, Iraqi Cabinet ministers have toured Middle Eastern
capitals to encourage Arab governments to defy the sanctions. But
none of the governments has done more than turn a blind eye to
smuggling into Iraq.

Prime minister to meet Khmer Rouge defectors; snags dismissed

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Two main leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge regime who are defecting to the government stayed under wraps
Sunday in a former stronghold of their once-feared guerrilla army.
	   Keut Kan, a deputy governor of Pailin, confirmed that Khieu
Samphan, the official leader of the bloodstained revolutionaries,
and political chief Nuon Chea were staying at ``guesthouses.''
	   They were to travel to the capital, Phnom Penh, to meet Prime
Minister Hun Sen on Tuesday, Keut Kan said.
	   An official in Hun Sen's Cabinet, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed a helicopter would fetch the pair and
dismissed speculation of last-minute snags over their reported
fears of being sent abroad to face an international tribunal.
	   Though Pailin is technically under government control, its
leaders are all former high-ranking Khmer Rouge.
	   Pailin's top leaders were in the capital at a wedding, Keut Kan
said. There were rumors they were in fact negotiating guarantees
for the newest defectors that they would only face trial in
Cambodian courts _ if at all _ and then be pardoned.
	   ``I met them on Dec. 25 at a border point,'' Keut Kan said. ``I
was told to go there to wait for guests. They came in a car with
their wives and their children.''
	   The rendezvous indicated the pair had been in Thailand, which
has close contacts with the Khmer Rouge. Thai officials repeated
standing denials over the weekend of hosting Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   In New York, the group Human Rights Watch issued a statement
urging that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea be tried and convicted
before any talk of pardoning them.
	   Hun Sen said Saturday that the defection was sealed in a
telephone call Christmas night _ 20 years after Vietnam invaded to
topple the Khmer Rouge government.
	   Keut Kan said that he did not have authority to let journalists
meet the defectors but said their health was fine.
	   Khieu Samphan ``looked happy when I met him, but I think he
might be a little worried whether he can live in peace or not,''
Keut Kan said.
	   Pailin is controlled by Ieng Sary, once brother-in-law and
right-hand man of Pol Pot, leader of the regime that caused the
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians after the group seized
power in 1975.
	   Ieng Sary was the first leader to defect to the government in
1996, receiving amnesty in return. He led thousands of guerrillas
out of a stalemated civil war, the beginning of the end of the
movement.
	   The defections leave at large only one major figure, the
one-legged general Ta Mok, at the head of an estimated 100 die-hard
loyalists. They pose no threat to the government.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who is receiving medical treatment in
Beijing, has approved the defections. The monarch was held prisoner
in his palace under the Khmer Rouge and lost a dozen family
members.
	   Sihanouk expressed ``deep gratitude about this good news,''
echoing conciliatory language used by Hun Sen that indicated the
pair had surrendered in exchange for guarantees they would not be
harmed.
	   The government and the United States have said in the past that
they wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok tried by Cambodian
courts or an international tribunal for crimes against humanity.
	   Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power struggle last year _ died of
a purported heart attack in April.
	   Legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited Cambodia
last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal. The report should reach Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a
few weeks.
	   Om Yentieng, a Hun Sen aide, said the prime minister supports a
trial, but only in woefully unequipped local courts.
	   Granting de facto amnesty to Khmer Rouge leaders has brought
peace to nearly all of Cambodia for the first time in a generation,
but at the price of holding none of the guerrillas accountable for
their crimes.

Appeals court upholds jailing of woman who killed maid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ An appeals court has upheld the conviction of a
Kuwaiti woman sentenced to 10 years in jail for beating her Asian
maid to death with a tennis racket, the Arab Times reported Sunday.
	   In June, a criminal court found the woman guilty of causing
severe injuries that led to the death of her helper, the
English-language daily said.
	   The Kuwaiti woman was identified only by her first name, Manar.
The victim was Fatima Sethi, the paper said. It did not give her
nationality.
	   The woman's husband and brother testified that she severely beat
the maid in October 1997 to punish her for not doing the housework
properly, the paper said.
	   She can make a final appeal to the Cassation Court.
	   Complaints of physical abuse and non-payment of wages are common
among domestic helpers in this oil-rich Gulf state. Maids, many of
them from Asia and the Indian subcontinent, earn about 35 dinars
(dlrs 115) a month.

Defecting Khmer Rouge leader was moderate front-man for killers

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The defection of Khmer Rouge
intellectual Khieu Samphan to the Cambodian government brings an
end to decades of posturing in which he played the moderate, public
front-man for a gang of history's worst killers.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the mysterious ideologue who was
second-in-command behind longtime leader Pol Pot, hammered two of
the final nails in the coffin of their movement Saturday by
defecting _ in reality, surrendering _ to the Phnom Penh
government.
	   After two years of ruptures in which the once-feared guerrilla
group dwindled to almost nothing, the defections leave only the
brutal one-legged general, Ta Mok, still holding out in the
Cambodian jungles with perhaps 100 loyalists.
	   The death knell comes eight months after Pol Pot, the supreme
Khmer Rouge leader until he was purged in a power struggle in 1997,
succumbed to a purported heart attack.
	   The faces of Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok were hardly known to
the world during the Khmer Rouge's secretive, bloody reign of
terror from 1975 to 1979, when as many as 2 million Cambodians
perished.
	   Instead, Khieu Samphan was the smiling, polite figurehead put
forward as head of state of what was called Democratic Kampuchea.
	   But researchers who have studied Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge
say that Khieu Samphan bore much more responsibility for the deaths
of his countrymen than is often attributed to him.
	   In particular, Khieu Samphan was used by Pol Pot to carry out
internal purges. As for Nuon Chea, evidence shows he was more
deeply involved in blood-letting than Pol Pot himself.
	   ``Khieu Samphan's political star rose literally on heaps of
corpses,'' said Steven Heder, an expert on the Khmer Rouge who
lectures at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.
	   Born in 1931 and the son of a provincial judge, Khieu Samphan
won a government scholarship to study in Cambodia's colonial-ruler
France, where he became involved in communist politics. So did Pol
Pot and other top leaders of what became the Khmer Rouge.
	   The doctoral thesis he submitted at the University of Paris in
1959 is seen as a blueprint of Khmer Rouge economic policy once it
seized power in 1975 _ economic self-reliance and the
collectivization of agriculture.
	   On his return to Cambodia, Khieu Samphan became a professor and
helped establish a left-wing newspaper. He established a reputation
as a principled, honest intellectual and built up a student
following.
	   His activities and popularity alienated then-ruler Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, whose police stripped and beat Khieu Samphan on
the streets of the capital in July 1960 and detained him for a
month.
	   In 1962, Khieu Samphan won a seat in the National Assembly.
	   Sihanouk, hoping to corrupt him and dent his reputation,
appointed Khieu Samphan secretary of state for commerce. He lost
his position for refusing to accept a bribe to overlook illegal
meat trading.
	   Khieu Samphan was re-elected in 1966 but worsening repression
drove him underground into the jungle. Most Cambodians believed
Sihanouk had had him killed.
	   After Sihanouk was overthrown by a U.S.-backed coup in 1970, the
prince formed an alliance with the Khmer Rouge.
	   Khieu Samphan surfaced in 1973 when, as the guerrillas' military
commander-in-chief _ one of his first front-man roles _ he hosted a
visit by the prince to the guerrilla zone.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and cut
Cambodia off from the world. All forms of a market economy were
banned and the cities emptied. Residents were force-marched to the
countryside to labor on agricultural collectives.
	   A year later, they dispensed with Sihanouk _ who was kept
prisoner in his palace _ as figurehead and made Khieu Samphan head
of state to preside over the deaths of as many as 2 million of his
countrymen.
	   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day, 1978, and toppled the
Khmer Rouge two weeks later. Khieu Samphan became chief spokesman
and representative in the decade of maneuverings that followed.
	   The Khmer Rouge joined royalist and republican factions in an
alliance to drive out the Vietnamese, Cambodia's traditional enemy.
Under international pressure, Hanoi pulled out its troops in 1989.
	   Khieu Samphan negotiated multilateral peace accords reached in
1991. But he was attacked by a government-orchestrated mob in Phnom
Penh that year and withdrew to the jungles. The Khmer Rouge
boycotted U.N.-organized elections in 1993.
	   The movement began breaking up in 1996, but Khieu Samphan stayed
with the hard-liners _ against his will, some believed. He remained
the most authoritative voice on clandestine radio broadcasts.
	   Sihanouk, Prime Minister Hun Sen and other leaders often drew a
distinction between Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge chieftains.
	   A small number of younger Cambodians fed up with corruption even
to this day voice admiration for his perceived personal honesty.

Poles complain new penal code is too lenient

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ When legislators began rewriting Poland's
penal code to replace a 1969 communist-era law, Poles thought the
result would be less crime and speedier justice.
	   But the new system that took effect in September has raised
complaints among judges, police, the news media and the public that
it favors criminals by reducing prison terms and eliminating
capital punishment.
	   ``The defenders of the new code assure they want to fight the
rising crime, but they promote provisions that allow criminals to
leave prison early,'' said Robert Sichulski, a construction
engineer.
	   Opinion polls find increasing support for bringing back the
death penalty, which was suspended in 1989 and left out of the new
code.
	   ``Can our strapped state afford to board convicts for a
lifetime?'' asked Alicja Frackiewicz, a housewife.
	   The unhappiness reflects the general difficulties of the
economic and social changes in the nine years since communist rule
was toppled and Poland shifted to a multiparty democracy and market
economy.
	   Gone are the staples of the communist system, including
guaranteed employment, free education and health care, along with
the pervasive police and military presence that limited personal
freedom while preventing much street crime.
	   With high unemployment, rising costs and fewer police patrols,
crime has increased in recent years in most categories. Police say
1,038 murders were recorded in the first 11 months of 1998,
compared to 971 in all of 1991.
	   The old penal code enacted by communist rulers targeted
political dissenters and secured a surface stability by banning
demonstrations and rallies, except for official May Day parades.
	   New freedom and opportunity have produced new kinds of crime _
gangs that require new members to murder for their initiation;
widespread auto theft; robberies; burglaries.
	   The new law, drawn up by criminal justice professors and legal
experts, was intended to reduce police bureaucracy and simplify
judicial procedures in a country where an average case takes 2 1/2
years to complete.
	   One change avoids a trial if the defendant confesses and agrees
to a penalty chosen by the judge. Crimes have been subdivided into
categories, according to the circumstances of the case, with
precise penalties for conviction.
	   ``The sanctions are more flexible. There is a choice between a
fine or prison in many cases,'' said Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska,
spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry. ``The judges are given wide
possibilities and a greater credit of trust.''
	   But Judge Barbara Piwnik, a 16-year veteran, called the system
too rigid and said it ``strikes with a lack of trust in the
judges,'' who know what works and what doesn't.
	   ``If I am told that homicide is from eight years to life
imprisonment, but when a dangerous tool was used it is from 12
years up, is that a sign of trust in my knowledge and life
experience?'' she asked.
	   Piwnik complains that maximum sentences for some serious crimes
were reduced, such as the new 12-year limit for a gang rape,
compared to 15 years previously. She also dislikes the new
obligation to reduce the sentence of convicts who aid
investigators.
	   In a recent case, Judge Malgorzata Mojkowska expressed
frustration in giving a 15-year sentence to one member of a group
of young people who killed a teen-ager, while the others got life
terms. The one with the shorter sentence helped police.
	   She was required to be lenient, but realized that ``cooperation
with the police will not atone for the injuries,'' the judge said
in handing down the sentence.
	   Makosa-Stepkowska, the Justice Ministry spokeswoman, said lesser
penalties like that will result in more criminals being brought to
justice by turning criminals against each other.
	   Tadeusz de Virion, a lawyer who defended opposition figures
during the communist era, considers the new penal code a ``return
to normalcy.''
	   ``The judge's heart, intellect and knowledge are the foundations
of a good justice system,'' he said. ``A wise, compassionate judge
will hand just verdicts even if the code is not of prime quality.''
	   De Virion said police presence, not a penal code, is the best
weapon against street crime.
	   But police spokesman Pawel Biedziak argued the opposite.
	   ``Why are perpetrators hiding from us?'' he asked. ``Because
they fear long prison terms.''

China frets over crime and suicide among its `little emperors'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The appeals from the ``rotten kid'' struck a
nerve among Chinese fretful over the rise in problem juveniles,
prompting a flood of letters to the Beijing Evening News from
worried parents and anguished children.
	   ``I'm one of those so-called good kids, because my schoolwork is
pretty good,'' wrote one youngster. ``After school, I smoke, drink
and get into fights, but nobody punishes me because I'm a good
student. I know I'm a bad kid, but my parents are blinded by my
good grades. I hope someone will come save us.''
	   Rising juvenile crime, suicides and other behavioral problems
have many Chinese questioning the wisdom of the government's policy
of controlling population growth by limiting urban families to one
child.
	   In just a single generation, five-child extended families have
shrunk to single-child nuclear families in the cities.
	   Some ``little emperors'' end up smothered by the attentions of
their well-meaning parents. Others are left on their own with
little supervision or emotional support.
	   ``The one-child policy is a method, but it is a hopeless method.
The cost is very high,'' said Chen Yiyun, an expert on families at
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``But we are also having
the same problems as in the West, so we can't blame everything on
the one-child policy.''
	   The rising juvenile crime rate _ minors account for at least
two-thirds of all those arrested _ and the gravity of crimes
committed by children barely into their teens has shocked many
Chinese.
	   The problem was considered serious enough for the National
People's Congress to pass a law last April on juvenile delinquency.
	   The tendency of parents and grandparents to pamper and
overprotect their single offspring has long prompted jokes about
teen-agers who don't know how to wash their own backs, let alone do
laundry.
	   Reports in the official media reflect more alarming trends.
	   A gang of more than 30 teen-agers in the northern city of Xi'an
committed dozens of armed robberies and rapes over the past few
years. The youngest, an 11-year-old, participated in four gang
rapes, police said.
	   The boy was ``cute and lovable, with a very sweet smile,''
according to a report in the official newspaper Legal Daily. He
also belonged to the gang's core, partly because he had access to a
car and often drove his cohorts around town.
	   Another gang member was the son of a government official and a
student with excellent grades who extorted money from his
classmates.
	   The gang members' status as only children was only one factor
behind their behavior, Gao Chengge, a psychologist at the Yifu
Hospital in Xi'an, said in a telephone interview. Rising divorce
rates and intensifying economic pressures that keep many parents
too busy with work to spend time with their children are also to
blame, he said.
	   China's ban on private gun ownership has helped prevent the
widespread firearms use like that which has plagued American
cities, but state media report killings by children.
	   In one case, a 14-year-old was charged with strangling his
10-year-old cousin after kidnapping the boy to demand ransom from
his uncle in order to pay a debt of 12,000 yuan, or about dlrs
1,450.
	   In another, a 15-year-old slammed a brick on the head of an
11-year-old, dragged her into his house and beat her before dumping
her in a manure pile, where she suffocated.
	   A 16-year-old was beaten to death by five boys after an argument
over 10 cents worth of soda and gum. The chief suspect is a
13-year-old who had dropped out of elementary school.
	   The ``rotten kid'' letters drew hundreds of responses from
alienated youths, Chinese parents and educators during the two
months the Evening News ran the weekly series earlier this year.
	   Parents expressed their frustrations at not knowing how to
communicate with their children, or how to get them to study.
	   Children poured out their own troubles: Parents with no time to
talk to their children or so preoccupied with school performance
they disregard the youngsters' feelings.
	   ``I never go home a minute earlier than I have to, because I
feel I have nothing to say to my family. Our views and thoughts are
totally different,'' wrote a 16-year-old named Lingling. ``I may
seem well behaved, but I'm not.''
	   Schools are trying to counter the problem with ethics and
morality classes for children and by promoting awareness of mental
health issues among parents.
	   Children need more than just book learning, said Fang Ge, an
education psychologist.
	   ``People need to pay attention not only to intelligence but to
other qualities, such as a sense of responsibility, confidence and
independence. Children need social skills as well as education,''
Fang said.
	   In many cases, problems arise not because of a lack of
attention, but because parents tend to be overprotective, said Fang
Liluo, a psychiatrist who often counsels families.
	   ``The children are too cherished. Each parent believes, `My
child must be the best,' and loads too many expectations on the
child,'' Fang said.
	   Such children are perpetually immature, she said. ``They can't
endure mistakes, are easily frustrated and unable to deal with
problems.''
	   Reports from around the country indicate a surge in the use of
tranquilizers by adolescents unable to sleep due to anxiety over
school.
	   The Beijing Youth Daily surveyed middle school students and said
one-third of those questioned admitted to having thought about
suicide at least once or twice. One-tenth had thought about it
often.

<TEXT>
	   HUAMBO, Angola (AP) _ The World Food Program on Sunday said it
grounded food delivery flights throughout Angola as a precautionary
move after a U.N. aircraft crashed on Saturday with 14 people on
board.
	   The WFP suspended its flights until Wednesday, pending more
information regarding the plane crash, said Brenda Barton, a
spokeswoman for the organization in Nairobi.
	   The C-130 aircraft reportedly crashed in an area where the
government's army has been fighting UNITA rebels, a U.N. spokesman
said Saturday.
	   There was no word on whether any of the four crew members and 10
passengers had survived. There also was no immediate information on
the cause of the crash.
	   Most of the passengers were members of the U.N. Observer
Mission, said deputy U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida E Silva. The
military observers are charged with monitoring a 1994 peace accord
that is severely threatened by the current fighting.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the aircraft burst into
flames shortly after take-off from Huambo, 310 miles southeast of
the capital Luanda, and crashed 25 miles away in Vila Nova.
	   Barton said that food delivery to approximately 400,000 Angolans
displaced by the civil war would not be interrupted by the grounded
flights.
	   But she said the situation was ``grave'' because air cargo is
the only way to replenish supplies. Commercial food supplies via
roads have been shut down by the fighting.
	   ``We wanted to use every day we can to replenish supplies,
knowing that supplies cannot move by road,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
	   As of Tuesday, Huambo's refugee population had swollen to
100,000, where WFP officials saw many malnourished people seeking
protection in the government-held town, Barton said.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to the Angolan government
and UNITA to enable members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola
to go to the crash site and assist in search and rescue operations,
and asked their cooperation in a full investigation of the crash, a
spokesman said in a statement.
	   According to preliminary information from government sources in
Huambo, the plane probably went down in an area east of Vila Nova,
the spokesman said.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric and chartered by the United
Nations, was headed for Saurimo, in the province of Lunda Sul,
about 390 miles east of Huambo, according to the news agency. The
four-engine C-130, one of the most widely used military transport
planes, can carry up to 92 people.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay that Angola
appears headed back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern
African nation for most of its nearly quarter-century of
independence.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get both sides to adhere to a 1994
peace accord. It called for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola, to hand areas
under its control to the government. However, lingering hostility
between the two sides has hindered implementation of the deal.
	   The council on Wednesday again accused Angolan rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.

Netanyahu critic drops out, right-wing lawmaker announces bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
cleared a major political hurdle in his bid for re-election when a
top contender within the Likud party dropped out of the race.
	   However, a challenge to Netanyahu's leadership from within was
announced by Uzi Landau, 55, chairman of the powerful Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   Landau is unlikely to unseat Netanyahu, and the Netanyahu critic
in Likud rated as having the best chance, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert, took himself out of the race Sunday.
	   Olmert, a hawk who has campaigned for building the controversial
Har Homa neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, was the
only party member with enough stature and following in Likud to
have a fighting chance against Netanyahu.
	   However, Olmert reportedly took the decision to bow out after
failing to enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who is popular among the Sephardim, or Jews from Middle
East countries.
	   The lack of a serious challenge so far strengthened Netanyahu's
chances to again be the party's candidate for re-election.
	   The announcements came in advance of the Likud Central Committee
meeting later Sunday. The panel is to set the stage for selecting a
party leader and begin the process of choosing the a list of
candidates for the Knesset.
	   The Likud candidate is expected to face Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in elections, the date for which is expected to be set by
parliament soon. But there are also several candidates forming
centrist parties that could complicate the picture.
	   Landau represents the right wing within Likud that has been
dismayed by Netanyahu's flip-flops on policy issues and political
maneuvering designed to keep his six-party coalition in power.
	   ``Likud has become the party of the moment with a leader who
changes course according to the direction of the wind. Such victory
is not a genuine victory,'' Landau told a Tel Aviv press conference
where he announced his candidacy.
	   The hard liners were also deeply disappointed by Netanyahu's
signing of the Wye accord, which set the stage for three further
withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   The hardliners feel that Netanyahu agreed to territorial
concessions without secure enough guarantees that the Palestinians
would crack down hard enough against terrorism.
	   Landau, a Likud veteran with a Ph.d in systems analysis from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that although he knew
his chances of overtaking Netanyahu in the party's primaries were
slim, he felt duty-bound to put the party back on the ideological
course he says it has strayed from under the current premier's
two-and-a-half year rule.
	   By Landau's side Sunday was former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who has severely criticized Netanyahu in recent interviews
for destroying the Likud party. Shamir, who left office in 1992
after losing to the late Yitzhak Rabin of Labor, threw his weight
behind Landau, saying he was the most suitable candidate to lead
the party and the country.
	   ``Benjamin Netanyahu should be replaced,'' Shamir was quoted as
saying in an interview with the daily Yediot Ahronot. ``This isn't
the Likud I knew as prime minister.''
	   Landau, son of one of the founding fathers of the right-wing
movement that gave birth to the Likud, said ``no one says this
party belongs to just one man.'' He alluded to criticism that
Netanyahu was too high-handed and had strayed from traditional
party ideology.
	   Likud, one of two main parties in Israeli politics, has been
splintering.
	   Both Landau and Shamir made an appeal to Likud veterans - Dan
Meridor and Benny Begin who have broken away from the party to form
their own factions against Netanyahu - to fight from within the
fold.
	   Leaving a lengthy meeting with Meridor, who announced last week
his candidacy as head of a new centrist party, Communications
Minister Limor Livnat refused to state publicly whether or not she
has decided to leave Netanyahu's coalition for Meridor's camp.

Japan's government blames current recession on past mistakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a striking admission of error, the Japanese
government released a report on Sunday blaming official inaction
and delay over the past decade for triggering the country's deepest
recession since World War II.
	   The year-end report by the Economic Planning Agency detailed the
government's and private companies' failure to quickly come to
grips with the collapse of the speculative ``bubble'' economy of
the 1980s.
	   The troubles left over from the bubble, when real estate and
stock markets soared to dizzying heights only to crash in the early
1990s, have plagued the Japanese economy ``more than expected,''
the EPA wrote.
	   The collapse in asset prices left behind a massive debt problem
that has hobbled the Japanese financial system. But instead of
moving quickly to resolve the bad loans, government and bank
officials decided to ``leave the embarrassing problem untouched''
and hope for a recovery in prices, the report said.
	   That recovery never came.
	   Instead, the burst of the bubble brought a combined capital loss
of 840 trillion yen (dlrs 7.2 trillion) between 1990 and 1996 to
businesses and households, about 1.7 times the nation's gross
domestic product in 1996, the EPA said.
	   Altogether, the capital loss pulled down Japan's GDP growth rate
by an average of around 2 percentage points each year between 1991
and 1993, the report said. The negative effect on the GDP growth
rate diminished to about 0.8 point per year from 1994 to 1996, it
said.
	   The losses strangled consumption and triggering Japan's worst
recession since the end of World War II. The economy shrank for the
first time in two decades last year, and unemployment in November
was at a record high of 4.4 percent.
	   ``The slow handling of the bad loans problem has caused various
serious problems,'' a summary of the report said, including the
credit crunch which still troubles many private companies.
	   The EPA pointed to several reasons for the failure to act more
quickly: optimism that prices would recover; uniform delay by banks
in dealing with bad loans; lack of a system for bad-loan disposal;
and lack of transparency in the financial system.
	   In order to overcome the current economic slump, the EPA said
Japan must get purge itself of the ``aftermath of bubble economy.''

Netanyahu critic drops out, right-wing lawmaker announces bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
cleared a major political hurdle in his bid for re-election when a
top contender within the Likud party dropped out of the race.
	   However, a challenge to Netanyahu's leadership from within was
announced by Uzi Landau, 55, chairman of the powerful Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   Landau is unlikely to unseat Netanyahu, and the Netanyahu critic
in Likud rated as having the best chance, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert, took himself out of the race Sunday.
	   Olmert, a hawk who has campaigned for building the controversial
Har Homa neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, was the
only party member with enough stature in Likud to have a fighting
chance against Netanyahu.
	   However, Olmert reportedly made the decision to bow out after
failing to enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who is popular among the Sephardim, or Jews from Middle
East countries.
	   The lack of a serious challenger has strengthened Netanyahu's
chances to again be the party's candidate.
	   The announcements came in advance of the Likud Central Committee
meeting later Sunday. The panel is to set the stage for selecting a
party leader and begin the process of choosing the a list of
candidates for the Knesset.
	   The Likud candidate is expected to face Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in elections, the date for which is expected to be set by
parliament soon. But there are also several candidates forming
centrist parties that could complicate the picture.
	   Landau represents the right wing within Likud that has been
dismayed by Netanyahu's flip-flops on policy issues.
	   ``Likud has become the party of the moment with a leader who
changes course according to the direction of the wind. Such victory
is not a genuine victory,'' Landau told a Tel Aviv press conference
where he announced his candidacy.
	   The hard liners were also deeply disappointed by Netanyahu's
signing of the Wye accord, which set the stage for three further
withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   By Landau's side Sunday was former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who has severely criticized Netanyahu in recent interviews
for destroying the Likud party. Shamir, who left office in 1992
after losing to the late Yitzhak Rabin of Labor, threw his weight
behind Landau, saying he was the most suitable candidate to lead
the party and the country.
	   ``Benjamin Netanyahu should be replaced,'' Shamir was quoted as
saying in an interview with the daily Yediot Ahronot. ``This isn't
the Likud I knew as prime minister.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraq on Sunday submitted a draft resolution
to a meeting of Arab legislators urging Arab nations to ignore U.N.
sanctions on Iraq and demanding that all foreign troops be pulled
out of the Gulf.
	   The resolution was put before the Arab Parliamentary Union by a
delegation headed by Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as
about 200 members of Jordanian political parties and unions held a
sit-in to demand an end to the sanctions.
	   Outside Amman's Royal Theater where the lawmakers are meeting,
the demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and waved banner
saying any aggression on Iraq amounts to an attack on the entire
Arab world.
	   Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq that ended Dec. 19
brought demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support of
Iraq, but until now all Arab governments have adhered to the trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   After Jordan's Prince Hassan opened Sunday's emergency meeting,
urging solidarity with Iraq's people and a search for ways to end
their suffering, an Iraqi delegate shouted complaints that no
mention was made of the American-British aggression.
	   ``The Iraqi people do not need humanitarian aid,'' said Khalid
al-Douri. ``We are here to see the Arab nation unite in one stand,
condemn the aggression and call for the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``We were expecting at least words of condemnation to the
barbaric assault. Not even that was mentioned,'' shouted al-Douri,
head of the Iraqi Parliament's Arab and international affairs
committee.
	   When Hammadi arrived Saturday in Amman, he said Sunday's meeting
of Arab lawmakers should be a ``reflection of Arab masses'
condemnation of the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq and a demand
for governments to break the embargo.''
	   Delegations from 16 of the Parliamentary Union's 19 member
states had arrived for the meeting's opening; eighteen had been
expected. Kuwait _ which has resisted all efforts to ease sanctions
on Iraq _ had announced it would not take part.

	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Holding up well despite a
demanding holiday schedule, a smiling Pope John Paul II lingered on
the balcony of his vacation retreat Sunday to listen to the
Christmas hymns and greetings of pilgrims gathered below.
	   ``Long live the Pope,'' one man chanted in the courtyard of his
palace at Castel Gandolfo _ a wish picked up and applauded by
others in the crowd.
	   John Paul, 78, delivered his weekly Sunday address from the
balcony, cloaked in a red cape against the chill. Earlier in the
month, a flu and fever had forced him to cancel some events.
	   His voice stayed strong Sunday throughout what was only the
latest in days of long public appearances, including a midnight
Mass Christmas Eve that had kept him up until the early hours of
the morning.
	   On Saturday, he came to his vacation retreat outside Rome for a
few days of rest.
	   Urging Catholics on Sunday to think of both their families and
the homeless throughout the remainder of the holidays, he became
animated only after he finished his scripted remarks _ when the
faithful burst into applause.
	   He smiled, leaned forward and nodded, staying outside for a few
minutes while the crowd of Catholics from around the world clapped,
cheered and sang.
	   Wishing them a good rest of the holiday, and a happy last Sunday
of the year, he finally disappeared back inside.

Saudi Arabia denies it tried to assassinate Bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia on Sunday denied
reports that a senior government official had plotted to
assassinate Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden.
	   ``These accusations are false and have no basis in reality,''
the Saudi Press Agency quoted an official as saying. The official's
name was not given.
	   Bin Laden accused the governor of the Saudi capital of Riyadh,
Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz, of plotting his assassination, the
independent Pakistani newspaper The News reported Saturday.
	   Bin Laden said the governor offered about dlrs 267,000 for his
death, according to the English-language newspaper.
	   ``Thanks to Allah, the assassination attempt by one Siddiq Ahmad
and his two accomplices failed,'' the report quoted bin Laden as
saying.
	   The newspaper said that bin Laden's would-be assassin confessed.
	   The official Saudi agency on Sunday said Prince Salman did not
know a Siddiq Ahmad.
	   Bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994. He had
been at odds with the ruling family since 1991 when foreign troops
were allowed into Saudi Arabia, home to two of Islam's holiest
sites, Mecca and Medina.
	   Saudi Arabia downgraded ties with Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia in September because they are harboring Bin Laden, a
Taliban diplomat said.
	   Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries, including Pakistan
and the United Arab Emirates, that had recognized the Taliban as
the legitimate government of the war-torn country.
	   Bin Laden is wanted by American authorities for allegedly
directing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in
August. The blasts killed 259 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded thousands.

Report: Japanese coalition talks hit snag; meeting with PM delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Talks on forming a coalition between Japan's ruling
party and an opposition group hit a snag Sunday, delaying a planned
meeting between the prime minister and his proposed ally, news
reports said.
	   National broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News service reported the two
sides _ the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition
Liberal Party _ failed on Sunday to finalize details for the
planned coalition government.
	   The delay scuttled a meeting planned for Monday between Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and opposition leader Ichiro Ozawa, the
reports said, citing unidentified LDP officials.
	   A key dispute appeared to be over the extent to which Japanese
troops should participate in U.N. operations. Ozawa wants
participation for Japan in multinational forces, but the LDP wants
to keep Japanese troops limited to logistical support and away from
combat.
	   The snag put a wrinkle in the LDP plans to bolster its strength
in parliament, weakened in elections earlier this year, by forming
a voting block with the Liberals.
	   So far, the two sides have agreed to reduce the number of
cabinet posts from 20 to 18 and abolish the system in which senior
bureaucrats speak on behalf of ministers during Diet debates, Kyodo
reported.
	   Obuchi plans to offer one cabinet post to the LP in the planned
coalition and ask Ozawa himself to take it, the report quoted aides
to Obuchi as saying.

Ferry capsizes, nine missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A barge carrying supplies to a border guard post
in Russia's Far East capsized and sank Sunday, and nine of the 11
people aboard were missing, a military spokesman said.
	   The two people rescued from the barge were hospitalized in
stable condition, according to a Federal Border Guard spokesman in
Moscow.
	   The Vostok-type barge flipped over and sank as it traveled up a
narrow, hard-to-navigate section of the Kamchatka River, located on
the Kamchatka peninsula, about 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) east
of Moscow.
	   Search parties were still looking for the nine missing people,
but poor weather impeded their efforts, the spokesman said.
Kamchatka, which juts out into the Bering Sea, has been buried in
snow since early fall.
	   The barge was carrying fuel, coal, and foodstuffs to the
outpost.

Defense minister releases more than 160 soldiers from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's defense minister has pardoned 163
military men who have been serving various prison terms for
non-political reasons, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The independent daily Al-Rai Alaam said Lt. Gen. Ibrahim
Sulieman has dropped the remaining prison terms of those army men
following an ``appeal by their families ... on the occasion of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.''
	   It said the released men, some of them army officers, were
imprisoned for ``committing malpractice or corruption while in
service.''
	   Under Arab traditions, those released cannot return to military
service as they have already been discharged for crimes.
	   Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting and prayer, is often used
by Islamic countries to free prisoners.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Shooting was reported in northern
Kosovo Sunday and the boom of distant gunfire was audible in the
capital for the first time in months, defying international
monitors' efforts to prevent a return to all-out war.
	   It appeared to signify a fourth straight day of fighting since
Serbian forces launched a crackdown on Kosovo Albanian rebels in
the area around the town of Podujevo, triggering the most serious
clashes since an October truce.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of the
shooting in a rebel-controlled area between Obranca and Lapastica,
some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, said spokesman
Jorgen Grunnet of the Kosovo Verification Mission.
	   Clashes have been sporadic since Thursday's start of the
offensive, which is reported to have claimed at least nine ethnic
Albanians' lives.
	   Efforts by the monitors, led by American diplomat William
Walker, to talk to both sides and visit the fighting areas appear
to have helped prevent a complete breakdown of the shaky truce.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area. International officials, who still hold both the
Serbs and the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army responsible
for worsening violence, are aiming increasing criticism at the Serb
side for a harsh response to alleged provocations by the KLA.
	   Serb police said they would stay put in Obranca until at least
after the funeral later Sunday of a Serb farmer killed the previous
day. The farmer was one of the last Serb civilians in the
predominantly ethnic Albanian village.
	   KLA guerrillas, who control much of the province's north, gunned
down 65-year-old Milovan Radojevic in his home in Obranca, the
Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The rebels have acknowledged they are rearming and preparing for
sustained fighting in order to gain freedom for Kosovo, an
Albanian-dominated province in Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   International diplomacy that produced an October peace agreement
has failed to achieve an agreement on Kosovo's political status
aimed at ending the conflict. More than 1,000 people have been
killed since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began an
offensive against the rebels last February.
	   Hundreds of refugees have fled several villages targeted in the
recent fighting, walking for kilometers (miles) in sub-freezing
temperatures and packing into houses already cramped with other
refugees, sometimes dozens to the room.

Three Syrians killed in collapse of war-damaged building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) _ Three Syrian workers were killed when
the building they lived in collapsed in this northern Lebanese
town, police said Sunday.
	   The three-story building _ which was abandoned after it was
damaged in the 1975-90 civil war _ collapsed Saturday night.
	   Civil defense workers and firemen struggled until dawn Sunday to
try to reach the men.
	   A Lebanese man, who was visiting at the time, was injured,
police said.
	   Heavy rains that fell in recent days may have weakened the
structure, residents said.
	   There are about one million Syrians who work mainly in
construction and agriculture in Lebanon, which has an estimated
population of 3.2 million.

Politician criticizes Hong Kong leader over tycoon's remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa should have
refuted a tycoon's statement that the territory's political
situation had become too unstable for business, a top opposition
leader said Sunday.
	   Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party, said on Radio Hong
Kong that Tung's response to businessman Li Ka-shing was so
``wishy-washy'' that it seemed Tung actually agreed with the mogul.
	   Li, chairman of the property company, Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd.,
said last week that he had dropped a 10-billion Hong Kong dollar
(U.S. 1.28 billion) investment plan with a foreign company because
of political uncertainties in the territory.
	   Li's statement was apparently a swipe at pro-democracy
politicians, who recently called large property developers greedy
for demanding that would-be home-buyers who defaulted on
pre-payments for homes honor their purchase agreements.
	   In his response, Tung said a good environment which is conducive
to business and investment is very important to Hong Kong.
	   But Lee said it was necessary for Tung and other government
officials to refute Li's statement ``in no uncertain terms.''
	   Otherwise, how could the Hong Kong government expect that a
foreign investor will invest in Hong Kong if a local tycoon is
``not going to do so,'' Lee added.
	   Members of the Democratic Party have been pushing the government
to speed up democratic reforms in the territory following its
reversion to Chinese rule last year.
	   The government believes political reforms should be gradual to
maintain political and economic stability.

No immediate health threat from dumped waste, WHO says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Mercury-laced waste dumped in
Cambodia by a Taiwanese plastics giant poses no immediate health
threat but should be moved quickly to avoid one, a World Health
Organization official said Sunday.
	   George Petersen, a WHO representative, confirmed that initial
tests of the 3,000 tons of waste dumped on the outskirts of the
port town of Sihanoukville indicated extremely high concentrations
of mercury, but more verification was needed.
	   Petersen said that water samples taken as close as 300 meters
(yards) from the site showed no detectable levels of mercury,
meaning that residents had nothing to fear as long the waste is
moved soon.
	   Five deaths have been blamed on the waste: a dock worker who
died a day after cleaning the hold of the ship that brought it from
Taiwan, and four people killed in road accidents in a
panic-stricken exodus from the city.
	   Reports that a protester died in riots last weekend against
officials who allowed the waste into the country were never
confirmed.
	   ``The waste site as stands today does not pose any immediate
threat to Sihanoukville in the short term,'' Petersen said. ``This
is a problem that must dealt with, but it is not a big emergency.''
	   Highly toxic or not, the waste was not deposited in a proper
landfill and must be moved immediately to ensure there are no
long-term health risks, Petersen said.
	   Soldiers wearing protective clothing have been packing the
waste, which appears to be compressed industrial ash, into
plastic-lined oil drums since Wednesday in a clean-up expected to
take three to four weeks.
	   Formosa Plastics Corp., the firm that generated the waste,
claims it was properly treated before being shipped to Cambodia and
offers to take it back if proven unsafe.
	   The company denies government assertions that dlrs 3 million in
bribes were paid to ensure the waste was allowed into Cambodia. The
Cambodian agent who arranged it was paid dlrs 300,000, the firm
says.
	   The World Health Organization and a representative from Japan's
Minamata Institute examined the dump this weekend and took samples.
They also gathered hair, blood and urine samples from dock workers.
	   The death of dock worker Pich Sovan and the hospitalization of
five of his co-workers has the World Health Organization concerned
because symptoms reported by local doctors match those of mercury
poisoning.
	   ``The symptoms indicate poisoning and there may be a connection
here, but we don't have any proof,'' Petersen said.
	   The samples were sent to Japan on Sunday for analysis at the
Minamata Institute, established after a mercury-poisoning disaster
at Minamata Bay in the late 1950s. Results are expected at the end
of the week.

West Indies hold South Africa to 111 for three wickets at lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies on Sunday kept
themselves in the match by holding South Africa to 111 for three
wickets at lunch on the second day of the third Test at Kingsmead.
	   Franklyn Rose removed South Africa's top three batsmen for just
23 runs, improving the team's position after their batsmen failed
on the first day.
	   Rose's victims were Hershelle Gibbs, who had looked in wonderful
form, for 35, Gary Kirsten for 26, and a flu-stricken Jacques
Kallis for 11.
	   Kirsten and Kallis fell to catches behind the wicket, and Gibbs
to a fine effort by Philo Wallace at short midwicket.
	   Captain Hansie Cronje and Darryll Cullinan set about repairing
the innings, and were undefeated on 14 and 16 respectively at
lunch, and neither looked in any particular difficulty against the
three-pronged pace attack, and the leg spin of Rawl Lewis.
	   West Indies are facing their decisive Test in the five-match
Test against South Africa, whose dominant bowling has held them to
2-0.

Government allows imprisoned opposition leader to fly abroad for
</HEADLINE>
treatment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The government has granted the
imprisoned head of a major opposition group permission to fly to
the United States for medical treatment after several months of
deteriorating health, the Ethiopian News Agency said Sunday.
	   Asrat Woldeyes, president of the All-Amhara Peoples
Organizaiton, is serving a five-year sentence at Addis Ababa's main
prison on charges of having encouraged armed insurrection in two
speeches, and was being tried on a third similar charge.
	   But the government said Sunday it was temporarily dropping the
third charge against Asrat Woldeyes because of his poor health.
	   The 69-year-old British-educated surgeon suffers from high blood
pressure and diabetes that is severely affecting his eyes.
	   The personal physician of the late Emperor Haile Selassie is a
strong critic of the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. He
is particularly critical of policies that have led to the creation
of new autonomous regions along linguistic and ethnic lines.
	   Asrat collapsed on his way to court earlier this year, and after
a week of insistent appeals by his supporters, the government
allowed him to be put in hospital.
	   His doctors have appealed to the government to alow him to
travel overseas for treatment.
	   The news agency carried a statement Sunday from the office of
the federal prosecutor, saying ``the condition of the professor,
who has been under medical treatment at the Black Lion Hospital,
has deteriorated and he is not fit to stand trial because of his
worsening condition.''
	   The charge filed against Asrat ``will be temporarily
withdrawn,'' it said.
	   No information was immediately available on Asrat's date of
departure or destination in the United States.

	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Holding up well despite a
demanding holiday schedule, a smiling Pope John Paul II lingered on
the balcony of his vacation retreat Sunday to listen to the
Christmas hymns and greetings of pilgrims gathered below.
	   ``Long live the Pope,'' one man chanted in the courtyard of his
palace at Castel Gandolfo _ a wish picked up and applauded by
others in the crowd.
	   John Paul, 78, delivered his weekly Sunday address from the
balcony, cloaked in a red cape against the chill. Earlier in the
month, a flu and fever had forced him to cancel some events.
	   His voice stayed strong Sunday throughout what was only the
latest in days of long public appearances, including a midnight
Mass Christmas Eve that had kept him up until the early hours.
	   On Saturday, he came to his vacation retreat outside Rome for a
few days of rest.
	   Urging Catholics on Sunday to think of both their families and
the homeless throughout the remainder of the holidays, he became
animated only when he finished his scripted remarks _ and the
faithful burst into applause.
	   He smiled, leaned forward and nodded, staying outside for a few
minutes while the crowd of Catholics from around the globe clapped,
cheered and sang.
	   ``Best wishes to the families of Castel Gandolfo, of Rome, and
all the world,'' he said.
	   After a final reminder from the pope that it was the last
Sabbath of the year, unseen hands opened the balcony doors behind
him, and John Paul disappeared back inside.

Strikes and protests threatened over Nigerian fuel prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Unions, students and activists on Sunday
were threatening street demonstrations and general strikes to
protest a gasoline price hike imposed last week by Nigeria's
military government.
	   The Nigeria Labor Congress, the West African country's largest
union grouping, warned a general strike would begin Jan. 4 unless
the price increase was reversed. Lagos university students and the
Joint Action Committee for Nigeria human rights group announced
various public protests from Jan. 1 to 14.
	   With the move, the official gasoline price rose more than 130
percent from 11 naira (13 cents) a liter to around 25 naira (29
cents).
	   Prices for diesel and kerosene also went up as Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar's government deregulated petroleum products in an effort
to cut recent chronic fuel shortages and prevent blackmarket
stockpiling in the country.
	   The labor congress has argued the price increase will wipe out
gains from a recent wage increase for government workers and render
irrelevant the government's poverty alleviation programs.
	   The increase in official prices at the pump have more than
doubled fares on public transport in Nigeria, which despite being
the world's sixth largest oil producer is plagued by corruption and
mismanagement that has crippled its ability to refine and
distribute fuel.
	   Gasoline price hikes in the past have sparked mass protests and
new protests test Abubakar's promise for a peaceful transition to
democracy next year following Feb. 15 presidential elections.

<TEXT>
	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in a fourth
straight day of fighting in northern Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said the clash
erupted when Serb forces opened fire on the village of Lapastica _
the Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that appears to be the main
target of their four-day-old offensive.
	   The crackdown has resulted in the most serious clashes in the
secessionist province since an October truce, despite the efforts
of international monitors determined to prevent a return to
full-scale war.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
latest offensive. The body of the latest victim, a 44-year-old man,
was discovered Saturday night, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in a rebel-controlled area between Obranca and
Lapastica, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, said
spokesman Jorgen Grunnet of the Kosovo Verification Mission.
	   Clashes have been sporadic since Thursday's intense exchange of
fire.

Bodies of foreigners to be returned 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The bodies of four foreigners, who were
beheaded earlier this month in Chechnya, will be sent to Britain
and New Zealand as early as Monday, officials said Sunday.
	   The bodies of the four men were found on Saturday evening in the
village of Chernorechiye, located on the outskirts of the Chechen
capital Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identity of the bodies
Sunday, according to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   British officials would not confirm that the bodies found were
those of the four foreigners.
	   ``There are so many rumors flying about that we cannot comment
on anything until we have checked on the report ourselves,'' a
Foreign Office spokesman in London said.
	   Chechen Presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev said the heads
and the bodies would be sent back to Britain and New Zealand within
the next few days.
	   Chechnya fought a 1994-96 independence war with Russia. It now
runs its own affairs, though no country recognizes its claims of
sovereignty.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since the war ended.

	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodians whose families and friends
died under the Khmer Rouge reign of terror said Sunday they hoped
that two main leaders defecting to the government are tried and
punished for crimes against humanity.
	   ``I hope that these two joining the government will finish the
fighting in Cambodia,'' said Hing Ning, 56, an eyeglass shop owner
in Phnom Penh who lost five brothers and sisters.
	   But there were signs the government had reached an understanding
with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea that in exchange for pulling the
plug on their dying guerrilla struggle, they would be allowed to
avoid at least facing an international tribunal overseas.
	   Both were key figures in the Khmer Rouge regime that caused the
deaths of as many as 2 million people from overwork, starvation and
executions after seizing power in 1975 and turning the nation into
a giant slave labor camp.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen has brushed aside questions of a trial so
far, but favors one held in Cambodia _ if at all, aides said.
	   As Cambodia's most powerful man, Hun Sen has exercised influence
over the judicial process in the past. King Norodom Sihanouk can
also grant pardons and has done so for Khmer Rouge leaders when
deemed necessary for peace.
	   Both have welcomed the defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
in conciliatory terms suggesting a deal has been struck.
	   The defectors were kept under wraps Sunday in Pailin, a former
Khmer Rouge stronghold on the border with Thailand controlled by
one-time guerrillas who made peace with the government in 1996.
	   The 1996 deals marked the beginning of the end of the group's
long guerrilla war after losing power in 1979 to a Vietnamese
invasion.
	   In the past two years, the once-feared guerrilla forces have
dwindled to almost nothing and pose no threat. The last leader
still at large, the brutal one-legged general Ta Mok, is estimated
to have no more than 100 loyalists.
	   Longtime leader Pol Pot was purged in 1997 and died of a heart
attack in April. Ieng Sary, his right-hand man and his former
brother-in-law, received amnesty for leading the defections in
1996.
	   The United Nations sent three legal experts to Cambodia last
month to study the possibility of trying senior Khmer Rouge
leaders, raising hopes among average Cambodians that someone will
be held accountable.
	   ``If the international community or the United Nations
investigates and determines who is guilty, then we can really make
sure these people are punished,'' said So Serei, 45, a grocer.
	   The director of a center compiling evidence against the Khmer
Rouge is currently giving Hun Sen the benefit of the doubt.
	   ``I don't think he can talk about a trial now,'' Youk Chhang
said. ``One hand cannot receive these two while the other talks
about killing them.''
	   In Pailin, Keut Kan, a deputy governor, said the pair were
staying at ``guesthouses'' and would travel to Phnom Penh on
Tuesday to meet Hun Sen. Journalists were not allowed to see them.
	   An official in Hun Sen's Cabinet, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the meeting and dismissed speculation of snags
over the pair's reported fears of facing a tribunal overseas.
	   Though Pailin is technically under government control, its
leaders are all former high-ranking Khmer Rouge.
	   They were all in the capital at a wedding, Keut Kan said. There
were rumors they were seeking guarantees for the newest defectors
that they would only face trial in Cambodian courts _ if at all _
and then be pardoned.
	   ``I met them on Dec. 25 at a border point,'' Keut Kan said.
Khieu Samphan ``looked happy when I met him, but I think he might
be a little worried whether he can live in peace or not.''
	   The rendezvous indicated the pair had been in Thailand, which
has close contacts with the Khmer Rouge. Thai officials repeated
standing denials over the weekend of hosting Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   Granting amnesty to the Khmer Rouge has brought peace to nearly
all of Cambodia for the first time in a generation, but at the
price of holding no leaders accountable so far.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch urged that Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea be tried and convicted before an international tribunal
before any talk of pardons.
	   ``But to allow these men to return to society as if one of the
worst massacres of the 20th century never took place _ that's
unthinkable,'' said Sidney Jones, the group's Asia director.

Arafat renews call for Israeli compliance with Wye accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday
accused the Israeli government of using the call for early
elections as an excuse not to implement the American-brokered Wye
River accord.
	   Arafat also said any Israeli government was bound by the deal
and must implement it, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted
Arafat as saying.
	   He made the remarks after a meeting with Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, MENA said.
	   Arafat asked rhetorically whether Israel would freeze its
dealings with the United States, Egypt, Jordan, Europe and other
countries because of the upcoming elections, as it has said it will
do with the Palestinians, MENA reported.
	   On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied
statements by other Palestinians that he suspended the Wye River
accord because of the elections, saying that Palestinian
noncompliance was responsible for the freeze.
	   Israel has refused to go ahead with promised troop pull backs
from the West Bank unless the Palestinians meet a series of
conditions. They include a renunciation of Palestinian claims to
the right to declare statehood in May 1999 whether or not terms
have been agreed on with Israel.
	   MENA said Arafat called on the United States to work toward
ensuring Israeli compliance and said Russia, Japan, the European
Union and China also could play constructive roles.
	   The Israeli elections are expected by late April.
	   Arafat arrived in Cairo on Saturday to meet Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
	   Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after the meeting
that ``the Israeli government is supposed to implement the Wye
River accord because it is the government that signed the
agreement.'' He said Israel's failure to do so would ``disturb''
the peace process.

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in a fourth
day of fighting in northern Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said the clash
erupted when Serb forces opened fire on the village of Lapastica _
the Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that appears to be the main
target of their four-day-old offensive.
	   The crackdown has resulted in the most serious clashes in the
secessionist province since an October truce, despite the efforts
of international monitors determined to prevent a return to
full-scale war.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
latest offensive. The body of the latest victim, a 44-year-old man,
was discovered Saturday night, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in a rebel-controlled area between Obranca and
Lapastica, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, said
spokesman Jorgen Grunnet of the Kosovo Verification Mission.
	   Clashes have been sporadic since Thursday's intense exchange of
fire.
	   International monitors have talked to both sides in the fight
over the ethnic Albanian-dominated province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia. Those efforts, and visits to the areas of
conflict, appear to have helped prevent a complete breakdown of the
shaky truce.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area.
	   International officials, who still hold both the Serbs and the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army responsible for worsening violence,
are aiming increasing criticism at the Serb side for a harsh
response to alleged provocations by the KLA.
	   Serb police said they would stay put in Obranca until at least
after the funeral later Sunday of a Serb farmer killed the previous
day. The farmer was one of the last Serb civilians in the
predominantly ethnic Albanian village.
	   KLA guerrillas, who control much of Kosovo's north, gunned down
65-year-old Milovan Radojevic in his home in Obranca, the Serb-run
Media Center reported.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The rebels have acknowledged they are rearming and preparing for
sustained fighting in order to gain freedom for Kosovo.
	   International diplomacy, which produced an October peace
agreement, has failed to achieve an agreement on Kosovo's political
status aimed at ending the conflict. More than 1,000 people have
been killed since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began an
offensive against the rebels last February.
	   Hundreds of refugees have fled several villages targeted in the
recent fighting, walking for kilometers (miles) in sub-freezing
temperatures and packing into houses already cramped with other
refugees, sometimes dozens to the room.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday
cleared a major political hurdle in his bid for re-election when a
top contender within the Likud party dropped out of the race.
	   However, a challenge to Netanyahu's leadership from within was
announced by Uzi Landau, 55, chairman of the powerful Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   In addition, Benny Begin, the son of former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, and one of the Likud's most staunchly right-wing
members, has decided to leave the party and run as prime minister,
heading a new rightist party. Begin is set to announce his
candidacy on Monday.
	   Neither Begin nor Landau is unlikely to unseat Netanyahu, and
the Netanyahu critic in Likud rated as having the best chance,
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, took himself out of the race Sunday.
	   Olmert, a hawk who has campaigned for building the controversial
Har Homa neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, was the
only party member with enough stature in Likud to have a fighting
chance against Netanyahu.
	   However, Olmert reportedly made the decision to bow out after
failing to enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who is popular among the Sephardim, or Jews from Middle
East countries.
	   Mordechai, a moderate who has urged Netanyahu to accelerate the
peace process with the Palestinians, has said he will not bail out
of the Likud party and is sticking by Netanyahu, Israel Radio said.
	   Although he said he would not interfere in Israel's political
battles, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained Sunday that
Netanyahu's government had halted implementation of the Wye accord.
	   ``The Israeli side has frozen completely everything,'' said
Arafat.
	   The lack of a serious challenger has strengthened Netanyahu's
chances to again be named the party's candidate.
	   The announcements came in advance of the Likud Central Committee
meeting later Sunday. The panel is to set the stage for selecting a
party leader and begin the process of choosing the a list of
candidates for the Knesset.
	   The Likud candidate is expected to face Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in elections, the date for which is expected to be set by
parliament soon. But there are also several candidates forming
centrist parties that could complicate the picture.
	   Recently retired chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
is expected to run in a centrist party. Both Shahak and Barak were
proteges of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and according to
Eitan Haber, a former Rabin aide, if the two both run, Netanayhu
will win.
	   ``If the shoe drops and the heavens deem it so that Barak and
Shahak run separately, with the support of fallen angels and an
overload of ego, than even today I can tell you who will become the
next prime minister of Israel: Benjamin Netanyahu. He and no other
and in a word, we would deserve it,'' Haber wrote in the daily
Yediot Ahronot.
	   Landau, meanwhile represents the right wing within Likud that
has been dismayed by Netanyahu's flip-flops on policy issues.
	   ``Likud has become the party of the moment with a leader who
changes course according to the direction of the wind. Such victory
is not a genuine victory,'' Landau told a Tel Aviv press conference
where he announced his candidacy.
	   The hard liners were also deeply disappointed by Netanyahu's
signing of the Wye accord, which set the stage for three further
withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   By Landau's side Sunday was former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who has severely criticized Netanyahu in recent interviews
for destroying the Likud party. Shamir, who left office in 1992
after losing to the late Yitzhak Rabin of Labor, threw his weight
behind Landau, saying he was the most suitable candidate to lead
the party and the country.
	   ``Benjamin Netanyahu should be replaced,'' Shamir was quoted as
saying in an interview with Yediot Ahronot. ``This isn't the Likud
I knew as prime minister.''

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in a fourth

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraq on Sunday submitted a draft resolution
to a meeting of Arab legislators urging Arab nations to ignore U.N.
sanctions on Iraq and demanding that all foreign troops be pulled
out of the Gulf. The resolution was put before the Arab
Parliamentary Union by a delegation headed by Iraq's parliament
speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as about 200 members of Jordanian
political parties and unions held a sit-in to demand an end to the
sanctions. Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq that ended
Dec. 19 brought demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support
of Iraq, but all Arab governments have adhered to the trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
(IRAQ-ARABS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Broadening a crackdown on dissent, China swiftly
tried and sentenced a labor activist Sunday to 10 years
imprisonment for giving interviews to the U.S. government-funded
Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said. Zhang Shanguang was the
fourth dissident given a lengthy jail term in a week. He was
sentenced following a 2-hour, 20-minute hearing from which his wife
and relatives were barred, said Human Rights in China, a New
York-based group. The harsh sentence underscored a renewed
determination by the ruling Communist Party to keep a tight grip on
power as it grapples with mounting unemployment and economic
difficulties, and heads into a politically charged year.
(CHINA-DISSIDENT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a striking admission of error, the Japanese
government released a report on Sunday blaming official inaction
and delay over the past decade for triggering the country's deepest
recession since World War II. The year-end report by the Economic
Planning Agency detailed the government's and private companies'
failure to quickly come to grips with the collapse of the
speculative ``bubble'' economy of the 1980s. The troubles left over
from the bubble, when real estate and stock markets soared to
dizzying heights only to crash in the early 1990s, have plagued the
Japanese economy ``more than expected,'' the EPA wrote.
(JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodians whose families and friends
died under the Khmer Rouge reign of terror said Sunday they hoped
that two main leaders defecting to the government are tried and
punished for crimes against humanity. ``I hope that these two
joining the government will finish the fighting in Cambodia,'' said
Hing Ning, 56, an eyeglass shop owner in Phnom Penh who lost five
brothers and sisters. But there were signs the government had
reached an understanding with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea that in
exchange for pulling the plug on their dying guerrilla struggle,
they would be allowed to avoid at least facing an international
tribunal overseas. Prime Minister Hun Sen has brushed aside
questions of a trial so far, but favors one held in Cambodia _ if
at all, aides said. (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ More than 500 air travelers were
rerouted to Rotterdam after heavy winds made it unsafe for jets to
land at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
	   Two runways were closed at the airport, a major European hub, on
Saturday night as a storm shipped up gale-force winds across the
continent.
	   Three jets of Transavia, an Amsterdam-based charter carrier,
landed instead at Rotterdam, temporarily stranding 500-plus
passengers. The travelers later were brought by bus to the Dutch
capital.
	   The storm also resulted in delays of several hours for
passengers aboard several KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flights Saturday
evening.

Wachter beats Meissnitzer, clinches first victory of season

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) _ Austrian veteran Anita Wachter
clinched her first World Cup victory of the season Sunday, beating
teammate Alexandra Meissnitzer in the giant slalom.
	   Wachter stormed down the fast, perfectly prepared Hirschenkogel
course in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 7.90 seconds,
beating the overall World Cup leader by a clear margin of 0.74
seconds.
	   ``This result is just incredible for me,'' an emotional Wachter
said.
	   Norway's Andrine Flemmen came home third in 2:09.33, edging
Birgit Heeb from Liechtenstein by 0.22 seconds.
	   A mistake resulting in a crash threw Switzerland's Corinne Ray
Bellet off the course midway down the first run, shortly after she
clocked the fourth best intermediate time.
	   Starting third, Meissnitzer led after the first run by 0.17
seconds over Wachter but made several mistakes in the second leg,
in which she finished tenth.
	   Former overall World Cup champion Wachter clinched her best
result in two years after two aggresive, faultless runs.
	   The 31-year old Austrian, on the women's alpine skiing circuit
since 1985, severely injured her knees in a crash in Cortina, Italy
last season and her career seemed to be over.
	   But she's made a successful comeback, finishing third in a giant
slalom at Val d'Isere earlier this month.
	   Despite being beaten Sunday, Meissnitzer has reinforced her lead
atop the overall World Cup standings, where she sits with 891
points.

German Economics Minister calls for moderation in wage talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Economics Minister Werner Mueller
appealed Sunday for German unions to help fight unemployment by
showing restraint in wage demands next year, angering labor leaders
who have already demanded hefty increases for workers.
	   Mueller told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung
newspaper that big pay raises were not needed because the new
center-left government is cutting income taxes and raising grants
for families with children.
	   Therefore, the state ``has already put a bit more in the wage
packet,'' he said.
	   Roland Issen, head of the DAG clerical worker's union, rejected
Mueller's ``instructions'' as inappropriate, noting the government
is not supposed to interfere in private industry contract talks.
	   Union leaders are demanding wage hikes as high as 6.5 percent in
the current round of talks, arguing that past years of restraint
have led only to higher company profits while failing to create
jobs.
	   Industry leaders say big pay increases would only kill more jobs
and damage Germany's economy.
	   With inflation running below 1 percent, most analysts say a wage
hike of 3 percent to 4 percent would be realistic.
	   Mueller's call received backing from the head of the German
Federation of Industry, Hans-Olaf Henkel, and German central bank
president Hans Tietmeyer. In separate weekend interviews, both
called wage restraint the key to cutting Germany's stubborn 10
percent unemployment rate.

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Soldiers patrolled the streets of a
northern Pakistani city Sunday after armed mobs exchanged heavy
gunfire with security forces, leaving several people dead, police
said.
	   Police ran for cover as rampaging armed mobs attacked police
stations and government buildings in Bannu city, some 120

people to avenge the police killing of a youngster during the

Saudi Arabia denies it tried to assassinate Bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia on Sunday denied
reports that a senior government official had plotted to
assassinate Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden.
	   ``These accusations are false and have no basis in reality,''
the Saudi Press Agency quoted an official as saying. The official's
name was not given.
	   Bin Laden accused the governor of the Saudi capital of Riyadh,
Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz, of plotting his assassination, the
independent Pakistani newspaper The News reported Saturday.
	   Bin Laden said the governor offered about dlrs 267,000 for his
death, according to the English-language newspaper.
	   ``Thanks to Allah, the assassination attempt by one Siddiq Ahmad
and his two accomplices failed,'' the report quoted bin Laden as
saying.
	   The newspaper said that bin Laden's would-be assassin confessed.
	   The official Saudi agency on Sunday said Prince Salman did not
know anyone named Siddiq Ahmad.
	   Bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994. He had
been at odds with the ruling family since 1991 when foreign troops
were allowed into Saudi Arabia, home to two of Islam's holiest
sites, Mecca and Medina.
	   Saudi Arabia downgraded ties with Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia in September because they are harboring Bin Laden, a
Taliban diplomat said.
	   Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries, including Pakistan
and the United Arab Emirates, that had recognized the Taliban as
the legitimate government of the war-torn country.
	   Bin Laden is wanted by American authorities for allegedly
directing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in
August. The blasts killed 259 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded thousands.

Frustrated Jayasinghe wants to leave Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's best known woman athlete
Susantika Jayasinghe says she wants to leave her homeland, live and
train abroad because she can no longer bear harassment by local
officials.
	   ``I have reached the dead end, I cant bear it any more,''
Jayasinghe, 23, told The Associated Press Sunday.
	   She said she was yet to decide where she would go.
	   ``I have decided to go abroad. More than training, it is to get
away from these officials who are harassing me, and get into a
better frame of mind,'' she said.
	   The world's 200 meters silver medalist, Jayasinghe is this
Indian Ocean island country's most controversial athlete. She hit
the headline again earlier this month after she pulled out of the
Asian Games in Bangkok, pleading injury.
	   She has twice tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.
But, she says, that is because she has often taken medication to
control her menstrual cycle which can leave traces of organic
compounds found in Nandralone-19, a performance enhancing drug. A
ban on her was lifted after medical evidence proved her correct.
	   After she returned from Bangkok, midway during the Dec. 6-20
Asian Games, the Island newspaper in Colombo quoted her as saying
that she was being harassed by local sports officials and could not
concentrate on her training.
	   Jayasinghe has not named any officials, but in the past she had
accused sports ministry officials of harassment, including sexual
advances which she says she resisted. She has also said that
powerful politicians were plotting to kill her husband.
	   ``I have been subjected to many urine tests in my rather short
athletic career, but this latest test has much more than the eye
would fathom or see,'' she said in an earlier interview after an
out-of-turn test following her Athens triumph.
	   Her accusations, the first to get wide publicity in conservative
Sri Lanka, have even reached parliament, with deputies and
ministers making wild statements, charges and counter-charges.
	   The village girl who practiced running barefoot among rubber
trees in central Sri Lanka won a silver medal in the women's 200
meter sprint at the World Track Championship in Athens in August
last year.
	   Jayasinghe became only the second Sri Lankan athlete to win a
medal at a top international meet in 49 years. Duncan White won a
silver in the 400 meter hurdles at the 1948 Olympics.
	   ``I am from a poor family, my father is a laborer in a rubber
estate. My request is please let me run and please don't bother
me.''

Search continues for missing yachtsman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds search details, confirms rescued sailor an American,
updates dropouts from race, changes headline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ A major search was under way in Bass
Strait off Australia's southeast coast on Sunday night for an
injured crewman swept overboard during the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht
race.
	   The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said it had
alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds and huge seas
smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet.
	   The Australian Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with
night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and may
send the frigate HMAS Newcastle into the area Monday morning
morning from Sydney.
	   An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 13-meter
Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had been rolled in the heavy seas, with
several crewmen being injured, including the unidentified man lost
overboard.
	   Another crewman has a broken leg.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait heading towards Hobart, capital of the island state of
Tasmania and the finish line in the annual race.
	   The ANSA spokesman said search conditions were ``atrocious.''
	   Earlier, as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused
havoc to the fleet, several rescues took place.
	   A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the
Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical
miles south of Gabo Island.
	   John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40
minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to
safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into 20-foot
seas to secure Campbell.
	   The Victorian state police Air Wing used an infra-red night
vision system to find Campbell and the Navy Sea King is using the
same equipment to try to find the man lost from Sword of Orion.
	   Another helicopter lifted the entire crew of 12 from the
dismasted VC Offshore Stand Aside.
	   Several crew members were injured in the dismasting, with one
losing several fingers and another suffering head injuries.
	   A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the
630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering
injuries to crew.
	   Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara is narrowly ahead of last
year's line winner Brindabella.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile
race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by
German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. (djp)

Swiss move to protect Alpine rail route after bomb threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELLINZONA, Switzerland (AP) _ Security has been tightened on
Switzerland's main Alpine rail crossing following three bomb
threats from an anonymous caller demanding a large payment, state
police said Sunday.
	   The 15-kilometer (9 1/2-mile) Gotthard tunnel, on a key
north-south route between Germany and Italy, was closed for two
hours Friday and searched following the first threat.
	   Ticino state police confirmed a report in Zurich's SonntagsBlick
weekly that the caller, who spoke in Italian, demanded 1 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 730,000) from Swiss Federal Railways.
	   The route remained open following two further telephone threats
Saturday, after police in the states of Ticino and Uri reinforced
security.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The prematurely-born baby daughter of
Albanian Premier Pandeli Majko was recovering from breathing
problems at an Athens hospital, doctors said Sunday.
	   The baby, born one month premature on Christmas Day, was brought

Majko's family.
	   The newborn was admitted to Elena maternity hospital, where the
mother is also being kept for observation.

Netanyahu opponent drops out, right-wing lawmakers announces bids

 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ One major obstacle to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's re-election was removed Sunday when a top contender
within his Likud party dropped out of the race.
	   However, a challenge to Netanyahu's leadership from within was
announced by Uzi Landau, 55, chairman of the powerful Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   In addition, Benny Begin, the son of former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, and one of the Likud's most staunchly right-wing
members, has decided to form a new rightist party and run for prime
minister. Begin is set to announce his candidacy on Monday.
	   But the Likud candidate seen as having the best chance of
unseating Netanyahu, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, took himself out
of the race for Likud leader Sunday.
	   Olmert, a hawk who has campaigned for building the controversial
Har Homa neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, was the
only party member with enough stature in Likud to have a fighting
chance against Netanyahu.
	   However, Olmert reportedly decided to bow out after failing to
enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is
popular among the Sephardim, or Jews from Middle East countries.
	   Mordechai, a moderate who has urged Netanyahu to accelerate the
peace process with the Palestinians, has said he will not bail out
of the Likud party and is sticking by Netanyahu, Israel Radio said.
	   Although he said he would not interfere in Israel's political
battles, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained Sunday that
Netanyahu's government had halted implementation of the Wye peace
accord.
	   ``The Israeli side has frozen completely everything,'' said
Arafat.
	   The string of political announcements came in advance of the
Likud Central Committee meeting later Sunday. The panel is to set
the stage for selecting a party leader and begin the process of
choosing the candidates for the Knesset.
	   The Likud candidate is expected to face Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in elections, the date for which is expected to be set by
parliament soon. But there are also several candidates forming
centrist parties that could complicate the picture.
	   Recently retired chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
is expected to run in a centrist party.
	   Landau, meanwhile represents the right wing within Likud that
has been dismayed by Netanyahu's flip-flops on policy issues.
	   ``Likud has become the party of the moment with a leader who
changes course according to the direction of the wind. Such victory
is not a genuine victory,'' Landau told a Tel Aviv news conference
where he announced his candidacy.
	   The hard-liners were also deeply disappointed by Netanyahu's
signing of the Wye accord, which set the stage for three further
withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has accused Netanyahu
of destroying Likud, threw his weight behind Landau.
	   ``Benjamin Netanyahu should be replaced,'' Shamir was quoted as
saying in an interview with the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. ``This
isn't the Likud I knew as prime minister.''

Strikes and protests threatened over Nigerian fuel prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Unions, students and activists on Sunday
were threatening street demonstrations and general strikes to
protest a gasoline price hike imposed last week by Nigeria's
military government.
	   The Nigeria Labor Congress, the West African country's largest
union group, warned a general strike would begin Jan. 4 unless the
price increase was reversed. Lagos university students and the
Joint Action Committee for Nigeria human rights group announced
various public protests from Jan. 1 to 14.
	   The official gasoline price rose more than 130 percent from 11
naira (13 cents) a liter to around 25 naira (29 cents).

to cut recent chronic fuel shortages and to prevent blackmarket
stockpiling.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations called for a 48-hour
cease-fire between the Angolan government and UNITA rebels Sunday
to allow an investigation team reach the site of a U.N. aircraft
that crashed with 14 people on board this weekend.
	   The C-130 aircraft went down in an area 500 kilometers (310
miles) southeast of the capital Luanda where the government army
has been fighting UNITA rebels for nearly a month.
	   It was not known if there were any survivors.
	   In Luanda, U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said so far there had
been no reply from either side yet to the call for a halt in
fighting.
	   The passengers aboard the plane included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, one Egyptian, one Cameroonian, a Zambian
and a Namibian.
	   Eight were members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola and
two were employed by a private communications company, Dinacom,
operating with the U.N., Toure said.
	   The crew included a South African, an Angolan, a Bolivian and a
Filipino.
	   The World Food Program reacted by suspending food delivery
flights throughout Angola until Wednesday, pending more information
on the crash, according to Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman for the
organization in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
	   U.N. spokesman Toure said there was no immediate information on
the cause of the crash. He cited government sources in the central
highland city of Huambo as saying they had seen a plane go down in
flames shortly after takeoff from there and that it had crashed 25
miles (40 kilometers) away in Vila Nova.
	   The U.N. military observers are charged with monitoring a 1994
peace accord that is severely threatened by fighting between the
government and UNITA rebels that flared up again three weeks ago.
	   An Angolan government plane was shot down Dec. 14, just north of
another central highland city of Kuito, killing 10 people. It was
not clear who had fired at the aircraft.
	   Kuito and Huambo, which lie some 130 kilometers (80 miles)
apart, have served as a stage for heavy battles between UNITA and
the government for nearly a month.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to the Angolan government
and UNITA to enable members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola
to go to the site of Saturday's crash and assist in search and
rescue operations, and asked for their cooperation in the
investigation, a spokesman said in a statement.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric and chartered by the United
Nations, was headed for Saurimo, in the province of Lunda Sul,
about 390 miles (625 kilometers) east of Huambo, Toure said. The
four-engine C-130, one of the most widely used military transport
planes, can carry up to 92 people.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay that Angola
appears headed back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern
African nation since the country's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get both sides to adhere to a 1994
peace accord. It called for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola, to disarm and
hand areas under its control to the government. However, lingering
hostility between the two sides has hindered implementation of the
deal.
	   The council on Wednesday again accused Angolan rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.
	   WFP's Barton said that food distribution to approximately
400,000 Angolans displaced by the conflict would not be interrupted
by the group grounding flights.
	   But she said the situation was ``grave'' because air cargo is
the only way to replenish supplies. Commercial food supplies via
roads have been shut down by the fighting.
	   As of Tuesday, Huambo's refugee population had swollen to
100,000 and WFP officials saw many malnourished people seeking
protection in the government-held town, Barton said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Syria are holding talks on the
possibility of reopening a joint pipeline that has been shut since
1982, a state-run weekly reported Sunday.
	   ``Talks between Iraq and Syria are under way,'' Al-Musawir
reported. It did not say where the talks were being held or who was
taking part.
	   Iraq and Syria signed an agreement in principle last August to
reopen the pipeline that links Iraqi oil fields around the northern
city of Kirkuk to the Syrian terminal at Banias on the
Mediterranean. A spur leads to the Lebanese port of Tripoli.
	   Iraq, which is under sweeping U.N. trade sanctions, must get
U.N. Security Council approval for such a project. Iraq now has two
outlets for its oil _ Mina al-Bakr on the Gulf and the Turkish
terminal of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
	   The pipeline has an estimated capacity of about a million
barrels a day.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Royal Wings, a subsidiary of Jordan's
national carrier Royal Jordanian, plans weekly flights to the
southern port of Aqaba, Tel Aviv, Haifa and Gaza next year, a
company official said Sunday.
	   Director General Ahed Quntar said the airline expects to carry
47,000 passengers to Aqaba, 32,000 to Tel Aviv, 5,000 to Haifa and
17,000 to Gaza.
	   He added that the company, which began operations two years ago,
also will fly regularly to Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt as
well as to Turkey, Cyprus and the Greek island of Rhodes.
	   Over the past two years, Royal Wings has carried some 142,499
passengers on its Canadian-made Dash planes.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Some 130 megawatts of electricity are being
exported to three neighboring countries via the regional Azerbaijan
Electricity Co., the company's managing director said Sunday.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Ali Asghar
Amjadi, the director, as saying the electricity is going to Turkey,
Azerbaijan and Armenia. The agreement with Turkey is a decade old,
but service to the others began in 1996-97.

Frustrated Jayasinghe wants to leave Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's best known woman athlete,
Susantika Jayasinghe, says she wants to leave her homeland and
train abroad because of what she says is harassment by local
officials.
	   ``I have reached the dead end. I can't bear it any more,''
Jayasinghe, 23, told The Associated Press on Sunday.
	   She said she hasn't decided where she would go.
	   ``I have decided to go abroad. More than training, it is to get
away from these officials who are harassing me, and get into a
better frame of mind,'' she said.
	   The world's 200-meter silver medalist, Jayasinghe is this Indian
Ocean island country's most controversial athlete. She made
headlines earlier this month after she pulled out of the Asian
Games in Bangkok pleading injury.
	   She has twice tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.
But, she says, that is because she has often taken medication to
control her menstrual cycle which can leave traces of organic
compounds found in Nandralone-19, a performance enhancing drug. A
ban on her was lifted after medical evidence proved her correct.
	   After she returned from Bangkok, the Island newspaper in Colombo
quoted her as saying that she was being harassed by local sports
officials and couldn't concentrate on her training.
	   Jayasinghe has not named any officials, but in the past she has
accused sports ministry officials of harassment, including sexual
advances which she says she resisted. She has also said that
powerful politicians were plotting to kill her husband.
	   Her accusations reached parliament in this conservative island
country, with deputies and ministers making wild statements,
charges and counter-charges.
	   Jayasinghe, who practiced running barefoot among rubber trees in
central Sri Lanka, won a silver medal in the women's 200 meter
sprint at the World Track Championship in Athens in August last
year.
	   She became only the second Sri Lankan athlete to win a medal at
a top international meet in 49 years. Duncan White won a silver in
the 400 meter hurdles at the 1948 Olympics.
	   ``I am from a poor family, my father is a laborer in a rubber
estate. My request is please let me run and please don't bother
me.''

Heavy fighting erupts in northern Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with verifier calling clash serious, color, Albanians
say Serbs handing out arms to Serb civilians, Serbs say border
guards drove back armed rebels entering from Albania, separate
shooting incident &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in a fourth
straight day of fighting in northern Kosovo.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica _ the
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that appears to be the main
target of their four-day-old offensive.
	   The ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire first on
Sunday morning, but rebels were shooting back heavily.
	   The crackdown has resulted in the most serious clashes in the
secessionist province since an October truce, despite the efforts
of international monitors determined to prevent a return to
full-scale war.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
latest offensive. The body of the latest victim, a 44-year-old man,
was discovered Saturday night, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in rebel-controlled territory between Obranca and
Lapastica, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina. The
unarmed patrols generally keep clear of the combat.
	   One verifier near the scene of Sunday's clash characterized it
as ``serious fighting.''
	   Efforts by the monitors, led by American diplomat William
Walker, to talk to both sides and visit the fighting areas appear
to have helped prevent a complete breakdown of the shaky truce.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area. International officials, who still hold both the
Serbs and the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army responsible
for worsening violence, are aiming increasing criticism at the Serb
side for responding with dozens of tanks to alleged provocations by
the KLA.
	   Serb police said they would stay in Obranca, two kilometers
(about a mile) from Lapastica, until at least after the funeral
later Sunday of a 65-year-old Serb farmer killed by the KLA the
previous day. The police took up positions behind his house and
were firing from trenches there.
	   The farmer, one of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly
ethnic Albanian village, was shot after he and his family opened
fire on the KLA, a rebel commander was quoted as saying in the
ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore on Sunday.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region.
	   In a separate incident Sunday, the Serb-run Media Center said a
62-year-old villager from Velika Reka near Podujevo was shot at
with automatic weapons and fired back on the ``terrorists.''
	   The rebels have acknowledged they are rearming and preparing for
sustained fighting in order to gain freedom for Kosovo, an
Albanian-dominated province in Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   A large group of armed ethnic Albanians was prevented from
entering Kosovo illegally from Albania late Saturday when Yugoslav
army border guards fired back on the ``attackers'' near the Vrbnica
border outpost, the Media Center said. No casualties were reported.
	   International diplomacy that produced an October peace agreement
has failed to achieve an agreement on Kosovo's political status
aimed at ending the conflict.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, and some 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   Hundreds have fled the latest fighting in the Podujevo region,
walking for kilometers (miles) in sub-freezing temperatures and
packing into houses already cramped with other refugees, sometimes
dozens to the room.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa, on 202 for five
wickets, took a four-run lead into tea on Sunday, the second day of
the third Test against the West Indies at Kingsmead.
	   West Indies are facing their decisive Test in the five-match
Test against South Africa, whose dominant bowling has held them to
2-0.
	   South Africa's middle order batsmen kept chipping away at the
tourists' attack during the post-lunch session, but neither Hansie
Cronje nor Darryl Cullinan were able to convert good starts into
big scores.
	   Cronje fell to a beautiful delivery from Courtney Walsh which
cut in between his bat and pads to bowl him for 30.
	   Cullinan was run out going for a tight second run to the West
Indies hero of the pre-lunch session, Franklyn Rose. Rose whipped
the ball in to wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs, who removed the bails to
run out the South African for 40.
	   At the crease at tea were Jonty Rhodes on 37, and Shaun Pollock
on three. Rhodes was particularly harsh on Ambrose, pulling him for
two legside sixes in consecutive overs. Pollock contented himself
by playing defensively until the tea break.
	   The West Indies kept themselves in the match by holding South
Africa to 111 for three wickets at lunch.
	   Franklyn Rose removed South Africa's top three batsmen for just
23 runs, improving the team's position after their batsmen failed
on the first day.
	   Rose's victims were Hershelle Gibbs, who had looked in wonderful
form, for 35, Gary Kirsten for 26, and a flu-stricken Jacques
Kallis for 11.
	   Kirsten and Kallis fell to catches behind the wicket, and Gibbs
to a fine effort by Philo Wallace at short midwicket.
	   Captain Hansie Cronje and Darryll Cullinan set about repairing
the innings, and were undefeated on 14 and 16 respectively at
lunch, and neither looked in any particular difficulty against the
three-pronged pace attack, and the leg spin of Rawl Lewis.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rejecting the notion of peace
talks and threatening to rain artillery shells down on Sierra
Leone's capital, a rebel commander on Sunday said his troops would
launch a major attack on Freetown anytime.
	   ``When we start shelling the city we won't stop,'' said rebel
commander Sam Bockarie. ``It's too late for talking and
listening.''
	   Bockarie's Revolutionary United Front has staged a surprise
series of assaults in recent days, reportedly moving the rebel
force to within striking distance of the capital, Freetown.
	   Fearing an impending attack, angry residents in Freetown surged
through the streets over the weekend and burned alive at least two
men accused of being rebel spies.
	   Bockarie claimed his forces had killed at least 100 Nigerian
troops _ members of a West African coalition force in Sierra Leone
that ousted a military junta from power in February.
	   Rebel fighters and their allies from the country's deposed
military government have continued to wage war in Sierra Leone's
countryside, carrying out of a campaign of terror.
	   Although leaders of the rebel movement deny charges of
mutilation and torture, human rights groups and aid workers say
thousands of Sierra Leonean civilians have been butchered and
maimed at the hands of the rebels.
	   Gunmen from the Nigerian-led coalition force, known as ECOMOG,
along with traditional militiamen, have been reinforcing the
capital in anticipation of the looming attack by the RUF.
	   Bockarie, known by his rebel nickname ``Mosquito,'' dismissed
the defensive buildup.
	   ``They are going to run away from us just as they have been
doing so far,'' Bockarie said.
	   The rebels say they are poised in the town of Waterloo, just 20
kilometers (12 miles) south of Freetown.
	   Varying reports also indicated fighting for control of the
central town of Makeni, where both rebel and ECOMOG troops say they
are in power.
	   It was not immediately clear who was in control of Makeni, but
the fact that the rebels were battling for that town and are on the
outskirts of Freetown indicates a stunning reversal in recent
months.
	   Since driving the rebels and military junta from power more than
10 months ago, Nigerian commanders leading the ECOMOG force have
repeatedly said the insurgent movement was on its last legs.
	   Far from it, the rebels are now threatening to undo the
successful first use of military force in Africa to restore a
legitimately elected government.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was driven from power in May 1997
by then Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who established a military
junta in conjunction with the Revolutionary United Front.
	   The junta was ousted by ECOMOG in February, clearing the way for
Kabbah's return in early March.
	   Characterized by ECOMOG as small skirmishes by resistance
fighters, fighting in Sierra Leone's hinterland has intensified in
recent weeks and moved progressively closer to the capital.
	   Refugees fleeing the fighting have flooded into Freetown.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations called Sunday for a
48-hour cease-fire between the Angolan government and UNITA rebels
to allow an investigation team to reach the site of a U.N. aircraft
that crashed with 14 people on board this weekend.
	   The C-130 aircraft went down in an area 500 kilometers (310
miles) southeast of the capital Luanda where the government army
has been fighting UNITA for nearly a month.
	   It was not known if there were any survivors.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said there was no immediate
information on the cause of the crash. He cited government sources
in the central highland city of Huambo as saying they had seen a
plane go down in flames shortly after takeoff from there and that
it had crashed 25 miles (40 kilometers) away in Vila Nova.
	   An Angolan government plane was shot down Dec. 14, just north of
another central highland city of Kuito, killing 10 people. It was
not clear who had fired at the aircraft.
	   Onboard the plane that crashed Saturday were four Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian, a
Namibian, a South African, a Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   Eight were members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola and
two were employed by a private communications company, Dinacom,
working with the United Nations, Toure said. The other four were
the plane's crew.
	   The World Food Program reacted to the crash by suspending food
delivery flights throughout Angola until Wednesday, pending more
information on the crash, according to Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman
for the organization in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
	   The U.N. military observers are charged with monitoring a 1994
peace accord that is severely threatened by fighting between the
government and UNITA rebels that flared up again three weeks ago.
	   Kuito and Huambo, which lie some 130 kilometers (80 miles)
apart, have served as a stage for heavy battles between UNITA and
the government for nearly a month.
	   Neither the government nor the rebels responded to the U.N. call
for a cease-fire, Toure said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to the Angolan
government and to UNITA to allow members of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola to go to the crash site and assist in search and
rescue operations, a spokesman said in a statement.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric and chartered by the United
Nations, was headed for Saurimo, in the province of Lunda Sul,
about 390 miles (625 kilometers) east of Huambo, Toure said. The
four-engine C-130, one of the most widely used military transport
planes, can carry up to 92 people.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay that Angola
appears headed back to civil war, which has ravaged the southern
African nation since the country's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get both sides to adhere to a 1994
peace accord. The agreement called for UNITA, whose name is a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence for Angola, to disarm and to hand areas under its
control to the government. However, lingering hostility between the
two sides has hindered implementation of the deal.
	   The council on Wednesday again accused Angolan rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.
	   WFP's Barton said that food distribution to approximately
400,000 Angolans displaced by the conflict would not be interrupted
by the grounded flights.
	   But she said the situation was ``grave'' because air cargo is
the only way to replenish supplies. Commercial food supplies via
roads have been shut down by the fighting.

treatment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The government has granted the
imprisoned head of a major opposition group permission to fly to
the United States for medical treatment after several months of
deteriorating health, the Ethiopian News Agency said Sunday.
	   Asrat Woldeyes, president of the All-Amhara Peoples
Organization, is serving a five-year sentence on charges of
encouraging armed insurrection in two speeches. He was being tried
on a third similar charge.
	   But the government said Sunday it was temporarily dropping the
third charge against Asrat because of his poor health.
	   The 69-year-old British-educated surgeon suffers from high blood
pressure and diabetes that is severely affecting his eyes.
	   The personal physician of the late Emperor Haile Selassie is a
strong critic of the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. He
is particularly critical of policies that have led to the creation
of new autonomous regions along linguistic and ethnic lines.
	   Asrat collapsed on his way to court earlier this year, and after
a week of insistent appeals by his supporters, the government
hospitalized him.
	   His doctors have appealed to the government to allow him to
travel overseas for treatment.
	   No information was immediately available on Asrat's date of
departure or destination in the United States.

Weekly: 8 supporters of dissident Iranian cleric arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Eight supporters of a dissident cleric have
been arrested, the weekly Aban reported on Sunday.
	   It said that seven of the supporters of Grand Ayatollah Hossein
Ali Montazeri were detained for distributing pamphlets calling for
his release from house arrest.
	   The eighth, Abasali Fateh, an associate of Montazeri, also was
taken into custody, the paper said. It did not give a reason for
his arrest.
	   All eight are clerics, the paper said. It did not say when they
were detained.
	   The arrests were ordered by the Special Court for the Clergy,
the paper said.
	   Last November, Montazeri was publicly repudiated after he
questioned the legitimacy of rule by the clergy, including Iran's
powerful spiritual leader Ali Khamenei.
	   Khamenei accused him of treason and, days later, hard-liners
attacked Montazeri's home and office in Qom, forcing him to flee
under police protection.
	   Montazeri has been confined to his house in the holy city of Qom
since the middle of last year.
	   He is allowed no visitors and in February, a court ordered the
freezing of his bank account.
	   Montazeri was once heir apparent to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   But he fell from grace for being too critical of Khomeini's
hard-line policies and was put under house arrest just before
Khomeini died in 1989.
	   Later freed, he maintained a low profile, speaking out only
occasionally against human rights violations. He has a wide

Heavy fighting erupts in northern Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with verifier calling clash serious, color, Albanians

guards drove back armed rebels entering from Albania, separate
shooting incident &QL;

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in northern
Kosovo.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica _ the
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that appears to be the main
target of their four-day-old offensive.
	   The ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire first on
Sunday morning, but rebels were shooting back heavily.
	   The crackdown has resulted in the most serious clashes in the
secessionist province since an October truce, despite the efforts
of international monitors determined to prevent a return to
full-scale war.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
offensive. The body of the latest victim, a 44-year-old man, was
discovered Saturday night, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in rebel-controlled territory between Obranca and
Lapastica, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina. The
unarmed patrols generally keep clear of the combat.
	   One verifier near the scene of Sunday's clash characterized it
as ``serious fighting.''
	   International monitors have talked to both sides in the fight
over the ethnic Albanian-dominated province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia. Those efforts, and visits to the areas of
conflict, appear to have helped prevent a complete breakdown of the
shaky truce.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area. International officials, who still hold both sides
responsible for the worsening violence, have strongly criticized
the Serbs for responding with dozens of tanks to alleged
provocations by the KLA.
	   Serb police said they would stay in Obranca, two kilometers
(about a mile) from Lapastica, until at least after the funeral
later Sunday of a 65-year-old Serb farmer killed by the KLA on
Saturday. The police took up positions behind his house and were
firing from trenches there.
	   The farmer, one of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly
ethnic Albanian village, was shot after he and his family opened
fire on the rebels, a KLA commander was quoted as saying in the
ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore on Sunday.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region.
	   In a separate incident Sunday, the Serb-run Media Center said a
62-year-old villager from Velika Reka near Podujevo was shot at
with automatic weapons and fired back on the ``terrorists.''
	   The rebels have acknowledged they are rearming and preparing for
sustained fighting in order to gain freedom for Kosovo.
	   A large group of armed ethnic Albanians was prevented from
entering Kosovo illegally from Albania late Saturday when Yugoslav
army border guards fired on the ``attackers'' near the Vrbnica
border outpost, the Media Center said. No casualties were reported.
	   International diplomacy that produced an October peace agreement
has failed to achieve an agreement on Kosovo's political status
aimed at ending the conflict.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, driving some 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   Hundreds have fled the latest fighting in the Podujevo region,
walking for kilometers (miles) in sub-freezing temperatures and
packing into houses already cramped with other refugees, sometimes
dozens to the room.

Arafat accuses Israel of stalling peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Sunday that Israel had ``frozen completely'' the peace process
and was refusing to implement the latest land-for-security accord.
	   The accusation came despite assurances from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would continue carrying out
the agreement regardless of Israeli national elections expected in
spring or early summer.
	   Arafat was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
in Cairo earlier Sunday that Israel was using the elections as an
excuse not to withdraw troops from the West Bank.
	   But when asked upon his arrival in Gaza, the leader would only
say that Israel ``must respect (the accord) as they respect all
their commitments with all other countries.''
	   Asked if he believed Israel had frozen the implementation of the
Wye accord, Arafat told reporters in Gaza: ``No doubt. The Israeli
side has completely frozen everything.''
	   On Dec. 2, Israel postponed the withdrawal of troops from parts
of the West Bank as outlined in the Wye River agreement until the
Palestinians fulfill several conditions.
	   Israel withdrew in November from two percent of the West Bank
under the Wye accord and was slated to pull out of 11 percent more
in two phases by the end of January.
	   The Israeli demands include Palestinian agreement to stop saying
they will declare a state on May 4, 1999, regardless of the state
of the negotiations, to crack down on anti-Israeli incitement and
rein-in Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu said Friday that despite the Israeli election campaign
if the Palestinians fulfill the conditions, Israel will carry out
its part of the agreement signed on Oct. 23 at the White House.
	   The Palestinian cabinet repeated its insistence on Friday that
it will declare a state in May.
	   An Arafat spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called on the United
States Sunday to pressure Israel to continue fulfilling its part of
the Wye agreement despite the elections.
	   ``We signed an agreement with the Israeli government and not
with the Likud Party,'' Abourdeneh said in reference to Netanyahu's
party.
	   In a sign of the tensions, Israeli soldiers shot rubber bullets
and tear gas Sunday at Palestinians who threw rocks at them and
Israeli vehicles near the Kalandia refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
	   The clashes broke out after an Israeli police car hit and
injured a Palestinian in the refugee camp, witnesses said.

China sentences dissident to 10 years imprisonment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with wife's comments
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Broadening a crackdown on dissent, China swiftly
tried and sentenced a labor activist Sunday to 10 years
imprisonment for telling a U.S. government-funded radio network
about farmers' protests, his wife said.
	   Zhang Shanguang was the fourth dissident given a lengthy jail
term in a week. He was sentenced following a closed-door, 2-hour,
20-minute hearing from which his wife, friends and relatives were
barred, his wife, Hou Xuezhu, said.
	   ``It's unjust, unfair,'' she said.
	   The harsh sentence underscored the ruling Communist Party's
determination to keep a tight grip on power as it grapples with
mounting unemployment and economic difficulties, and heads into a
politically charged year.
	   The 10th anniversary of the government's crackdown on democracy
protests on Tiananmen Square falls in June. A few months later, in
October, the Communist Party will fete the 50th anniversary of its
rule over China, and in December China takes back control of the
Portuguese colony of Macau.
	   Chinese leaders are anxious to ensure that no one seizes upon
these events to push for change or vent grievances. They also want
to prevent democracy and labor activists from tapping into the
discontent caused by millions of lay-offs from state factories that
are being shut down and restructured.
	   In a strident speech last week, President Jiang Zemin vowed to
crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and ordered that
threats to stability be ``resolutely nipped in the bud.''
	   Zhang's summary trial follows heavy sentences given last week to
three of China's most prominent dissidents: Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin
and Wang Youcai. They were charged with endangering state security
and sentenced to 13 years, 12 years and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Zhang, however, was not a member of the would-be opposition
group and his sentence suggested a broadening of the government's
efforts to crush dissent.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing, through its spokesman, Bill Palmer,
said Sunday it was ``deeply disappointed with the guilty verdicts
and the extremely harsh sentences'' handed down in the past week.
	   Zhang had been working on setting up an association to protect
the rights of laid-off workers when he was arrested in July, after
the visit to China by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   At his trial, the court in Huaihua city in south China's Hunan
province convicted Zhang of providing ``intelligence'' to people
overseas by giving an interview to Radio Free Asia about farmers'
protests and heavy rural taxes, his wife said.
	   The U.S. government-funded network has irked Chinese officials
with reports on human rights and other issues, and its broadcasts
are sometimes jammed in China. His wife said Zhang gave the radio
just one interview in March and spoke about a protest by 70 to 80
farmers.
	   After the closed hearing, the court adjourned for 30 minutes
before passing sentence, his wife said. She said she was allowed
into the court for the sentencing, but was not allowed to speak to
her husband.
	   Zhang is sick with tuberculosis and has lost ``a lot'' of weight
in detention, she said. But ``his spirit is very good,'' she added.
	   Court officials told her that she had not been allowed into the
hearing because Zhang's case involved ``state secrets,'' she said.
	   Under China's criminal code, Zhang was facing a maximum penalty
of death. His wife said that apart from a 10-year sentence Zhang
also was stripped of his political rights for five years, meaning
he will be under close official supervision after his release.
	   Zhang had already served a seven-year jail term for labor
activism and prosecutors had reportedly called on the court to
strictly punish him as a repeat offender.
	   Hunan police mobilized ``a large number'' of officers to watch
other dissidents at home and prevent them from going to the court
to show support for Zhang, Human Rights in China, a New York-based
rights group, said.
	   Despite the tight security, it said some people from as far away
as Beijing, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to the north, had given
police the slip and were in Huaihua to show their support.
	   It also said that 274 people in more than 20 provinces and major
cities had signed an open letter calling for Zhang's release.
	   The letter was addressed to President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Mary Robinson, the United Nation's top human rights
official, who visited China in September, it said.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More people are becoming dissatisfied with the
performance of the Hong Kong government, a semi-annual public
opinion poll showed Sunday.
	   The survey, conducted by the University of Hong Kong between
July and December, showed 36.9 percent of 4,755 people questioned
said they were dissatisfied with government's overall performance,
compared with 15.4 percent in the same period in 1997.
	   Only 22.7 percent of respondents said they were satisfied, down
from 42.7 percent from last year.
	   The poll also said 55 percent of those questioned expressed
dissatisfaction with the government's economic performance, up from
16.8 percent.
	   Hong Kong's economy, which is mired in recession, contracted 7
percent in the third quarter. It is expected to shrink by 5 percent
this year, compared with 5.3 percent growth in 1997.
	   No margin of error was given for the poll.

After decade delay, Brazil rediscovers nuclear energy

<TEXT>
	   ANGRA DOS REIS, Brazil (AP) _ Visitors to the Angra 2 nuclear
plant stroll by posters of Galileo and Leonardo da Vinci put up as
reminders of the age-old struggle between science and skepticism.
	   ``The work you do today will be recognized tomorrow,'' the
posters proclaim in Portuguese.
	   At least that's what the government hopes. So far, the power
plant has been a public relations nightmare, delayed for more than
a decade by cost overruns and safety concerns.
	   Now, Angra 2 is being finished and is scheduled to go into
operation in July. For workers, there is a sense of vindication.
	   ``This is the energy of the future,'' Jose Eduardo Brayner Costa
Mattos, the construction site manager, said while waving a hand at
an electricity generator stamped with the date 1988.
	   Critics say Brazil is out of step in rediscovering nuclear
power. They note that no U.S. utility has ordered a reactor since
the late 1970s and that Germany's new government and others in
Europe are moving to phase out nuclear power.
	   The gray concrete sphere of Angra 2 on Itaorna Beach, 100 miles
(160 kilometers) west of Rio de Janeiro, seems like a relic from
another age.
	   ``It will be a problem for generations to come,'' said Roberto
Kishinami, executive director in Brazil for the environmental group
Greenpeace. ``There's no place to put the waste, and the
environmental impact report is vague.''
	   Those weren't big concerns in 1975, when President Ernesto
Geisel signed an agreement with West Germany's Kraftwerk Union, a
subsidiary of Siemens, to build as many as eight, 1,300-megawatt
pressurized-water reactors to generate electricity.
	   For Brazil's ruling generals, the deal was part of its ``Big
Brazil'' development drive. It also gave them a reactor that could
produce fuel for an atomic weapons program, something they didn't
get with Angra 1, a 626-megawatt plant then being built by
Westinghouse Corp.
	   Right away there were problems.
	   Angra 2's first foundation was built on crumbling stone instead
of bedrock, and almost the entire budget went just to sink
additional support columns. Residents said it was a mistake to
build at Itaorna, a Guarani Indian name usually translated as
``rotten rock.''
	   Angra 1 didn't inspire much confidence, either. It broke down so
often that Brazilians dubbed it ``the lightning bug,'' because it
kept going off and on.
	   In the 1980s, with Angra 2 way behind schedule, Brazil went
broke and plunged into recession. With no money and less need for
energy, the plant was put on the back burner.
	   In 1987, a year after the Soviet reactor meltdown at Chernobyl,
Ukraine, a Brazilian junk dealer found a lead capsule containing
radioactive cesium 137 in the ruins of an abandoned medical clinic
and broke it open with a sledgehammer. Brazilians panicked after
radiation poisoning killed four people and sickened 103. So Angra 2
was kept in limbo.
	   It stayed there until 1994, when a new government economic plan
ended hyperinflation. With a strong currency, consumers went on a
buying spree _ and suddenly needed more energy for new freezers,
air conditioners and microwave ovens. President Itamar Franco gave
go-ahead for Angra 2.
	   Some 4,500 workers are laboring around the clock to finish the
plant. Machinery, vacuum-sealed in special foil and warehoused for
a decade, is unwrapped and installed.
	   ``It's 94 percent done,'' said Costa Mattos, the site manager.
	   A ``hot'' test of all systems but without fuel is set for April.
The final step is to load the reactor core with 236 zircon alloy
rods containing the uranium oxide fuel.
	   In July, 16 years late and at a cost of some dlrs 9 billion,
Angra 2 is to go on line.
	   Over the years, Brazil's priorities have changed. Civilian rule
returned in 1985, and the government signed the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty and scrapped the military's secret nuclear
weapons program.
	   Eletronuclear, the government nuclear company, knows any slip-up
at Angra 2 could sink its plans to finish Angra 3, today just a
dlrs 1 billion hole in the ground.
	   ``The design is old, but it has the same upgrades as in Germany.
So I would say it is First World,'' said Heini Schroer, a Siemens
computer technician from Erlangen, Germany.
	   The pressurized-water reactor is the safest reactor made and
environment-friendly as well, Costa Mattos said. Angra 2 won't heat
the seawater much or emit methane or other ``greenhouse gases,''
and radiation levels will be checked periodically on dozens of
monitors around the countryside, he said.
	   But Kleber Cosenza, the production supervisor, admits there is
no solution yet for used, but still radioactive, fuel. For now,
spent rods will be kept in a pool at the plant, but in 20 years it
will be full. After that, no one knows what will happen.
	   So Greenpeace is campaigning to block the licensing of Angra 2.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Clutching tattered pictures of sons and
husbands who were dragged from their doorsteps by security forces,
100 women chant outside the government's human rights office.
	   ``Give us our children back!'' the women shout in unison,
jostling each other to display the pictures of their missing loved
ones.
	   Ouardia Gherzoul has lost hope of ever seeing her 29-year-old
son again. An official investigation drags on because ``they don't
want to get to the bottom of it,'' she says.
	   Algeria's recent history is written in natural gas and blood.
One of the world's leading gas producers, it has been struggling
for nearly seven years with a Muslim insurgency that has caused at
least 75,000 deaths.
	   During the darkest days of the conflict, the military-backed
government managed to maintain quiet support _ from creditor
countries who depend on Algeria as the world's seventh-largest
natural gas producer, and from a Europe fearful the secularist
regime's collapse would send waves of boat people across the
Mediterranean.
	   In recent months, an army offensive combined with a hastily
formed civil defense force _ accused by human rights advocates of
abuses _ dealt a heavy blow to the militants. Car bombings and
village massacres ebbed.
	   Then, a new wave of mainly rural attacks came in December. The
holy month of Ramadan, which began this year on Dec. 20, has been
an especially violent time in recent years and will be a test of
whether the army has truly checked the violence.
	   But the huge massacres of recent years, when dozens and even
hundreds of people at a time were killed, seem to be over.
	   Algerians, hoping the worst of the violence is behind them, are
now trying to cope with its legacies _ the thousands of missing
people, traumatized orphans, displaced villagers, a wrecked
economy.
	   The civil defense forces have come under fire for abuses and a
lack of control. Abdenour Aliahia, president of the independent
Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights, estimates about
18,000 missing people were killed by security or civil defense
forces.
	   ``There are no human rights in Algeria. It's only now that some
people are ready to speak,'' he says, showing new files of young
men missing since last year.
	   The country of 30 million people also is struggling with the
painful restructuring of a socialist legacy: a creaky
state-dominated economy that can't provide enough jobs. The
unemployment rate is officially reported at 28 percent.
	   The mood makes for a strange kind of normalcy in Algiers, the
capital, where streets are calm but heavily patrolled by police,
and suburban police roadblocks still shake down motorists.
	   Algiers women who donned veils out of fear of the Islamic
militants are now dressing Western-style again, some looking ready
for a New York nightclub.
	   Newspapers that once blared daily headlines of killings by
militants now speak of other conflicts.
	   ``Social terrorism,'' La Tribune headlined recently, referring
to government efforts to sell off state industries, control wages,
cut subsidies and trim bloated payrolls.
	   Strikes are multiplying, with workers fearing they will be the
victims of economic restructuring.
	   It is a race against time to fix an economy that, during the
energy boom years, propped up Soviet-style industries ambitiously
built after Algeria won independence from France in 1962.
	   Now Algeria can't feed itself anymore or create enough jobs, and
insurgents have recruited from the masses of disaffected and
unemployed youth.
	   In a dingy cafe in the working-class Algiers suburb of El
Harrach, plagued in the past by deadly terrorist bombings, Karim
sipped a coffee with a friend recently as night fell. At 30,
unmarried and laying asphalt for a living, he is one of countless
young Algerians fed up with a system offering them a bleak future.
	   ``If I didn't have friends in the company, I wouldn't have a
job,'' he said.
	   He refused to give his family name out of fear of reprisal from
the police, with whom foreign journalists are required to move
about. ``I can't say anything more. You can't trust anyone here,''
he said.
	   Algeria is short at least 1.5 million dwellings, according to
Western estimates, and extended families sometimes crowd 18 to an
apartment. Silt-filled reservoirs mean water runs only on certain
days.
	   As Algeria seeks a way out of its economic morass, the crisis is
compounded by a political one. In September, President Liamine
Zeroual announced he was calling early elections and would not be a
candidate.
	   In a political system largely directed by the military, the
reasons for the retired general's early departure are murky.
	   His market-oriented reforms, backed by the International
Monetary Fund, have run into trouble with the retired generals who
run factories that grind out shoddy goods with bloated work forces.
	   Zeroual also was criticized within the military for his contacts
with the Islamic Salvation Front, the main Islamic party, and its
military arm, the Islamic Salvation Army, with which he reached a
truce last year.
	   The Salvation Front unleashed the insurgency after the
government canceled January 1992 elections that the party was
poised to win on voter anger with corruption and high unemployment.
	   The new presidential election, slated for April, could bring the
country's first civilian president since independence, although it
remains to be seen how much control the army would continue to
exert.
	   In the meantime, people like Salah Belarbi, 35, who lost his job
when the government closed the state media company where he worked,
are losing hope.
	   ``The government and the union give us promises,'' he said.
``But they don't care about us.''

Jobs slashed at Algerian state firms, but privatization offers

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ For nearly seven years, Algeria's bloody
insurgency has been unable to do what union leaders have done
lately: cripple the country.
	   They are doing it not with violence but with strikes, to protest
job cuts.
	   It's a different kind of warfare, one over how to revamp a
socialist economy that can't feed the country or provide enough
jobs despite vast natural gas reserves.
	   The government's push to privatize, cut subsidies and allow many
companies to fail has thrown thousands of people out of work at
state enterprises, which produce everything from steel to soft
drinks.
	   Even among the employed, like Salim Ait Anokrane, a 22-year-old
textile worker, anger is rising.
	   ``I work, but I'm not paid. There are hundreds like me,'' he
said. ``We don't have enough to feed our children. We'll march on
Algiers if we have to. It that's not enough, we'll smash
everything.''
	   Newspapers have reported several cases of layoff-related
suicides, although they haven't given numbers.
	   The main union, UGTA, calls workers who kill themselves
``victims of social terrorism'' inflicted by government technocrats
and is threatening to grind the country to a halt with a general
strike.
	   One of the union's targets is the privatization czar,
Abderrahmane Mebtoul, a former economics professor who argues the
selloff of state industries ``is not a panacea but it's a key move
toward democracy.''
	   ``The state sector is generally corrupt,'' Mebtoul said. ``Only
the private sector will create wealth.''
	   The government wasted dlrs 13 billion bailing out state
industries since 1990, he said. ``If it was used to create
businesses, it would have created 500,000 jobs.''
	   There are glimmers of optimism.
	   Feiza Hayani, 26, put together enough money to open a ``Business
Center'' at the newly privatized Es Safir hotel to offer guests the
services of two desktop computers, printers and a fax machine.
	   ``Young people are intelligent and responsible. You just have to
give them a chance,'' she said.
	   Foreign companies are showing interest. Coca-Cola opened a
bottling plant, while U.S.-based Pfizer is building a drug factory
and the Italian drug firm Cophital also is setting up.

Arafat accuses Israel of stalling peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Sunday that Israel had ``frozen completely'' the peace process
and was refusing to implement the latest land-for-security accord.
	   The accusation came despite assurances from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would continue carrying out
the agreement regardless of Israeli national elections expected in
spring or early summer.
	   Arafat was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
in Cairo earlier Sunday that Israel was using the elections as an
excuse not to withdraw troops from the West Bank.
	   But when questioned upon his arrival in Gaza, the leader would
only say that Israel ``must respect (the accord) as they respect
all their commitments with all other countries.''
	   Asked if he believed Israel had frozen the implementation of the
Wye accord, Arafat told reporters in Gaza: ``No doubt. The Israeli
side has completely frozen everything.''
	   On Dec. 2, Israel postponed the withdrawal of troops from parts
of the West Bank as outlined in the Wye River agreement until the
Palestinians fulfill several conditions.
	   Israel withdrew in November from 2 percent of the West Bank and
was slated to pull out of 11 percent more in two phases by the end
of January.
	   The Israeli demands include a Palestinian agreement to stop
saying they will declare a state on May 4, regardless of the state
of the negotiations, to crack down on anti-Israeli incitement and
to rein-in Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu said Friday that despite the Israeli election
campaign, Israel will carry out its part of the agreement if the
Palestinians fulfill the conditions.
	   The Palestinian cabinet repeated its insistence on Friday that
it will declare a state in May.
	   An Arafat spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called Sunday on the
United States to pressure Israel to continue fulfilling its part of
the U.S.-brokered accord.
	   In a sign of the tensions, Israeli soldiers shot rubber bullets
and tear gas Sunday at Palestinians who threw rocks at them and
Israeli vehicles near the Kalandia refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
	   The clashes broke out after an Israeli police car hit and
injured a Palestinian in the refugee camp, witnesses said.

Weekly: 8 supporters of dissident Iranian cleric arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Eight supporters of a dissident cleric have
been arrested, the weekly Aban reported on Sunday.
	   The publication said that seven of the supporters of Grand
Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri were detained for distributing
pamphlets calling for his release from house arrest.
	   The eighth, Abasali Fateh, an associate of Montazeri, also was
taken into custody, the paper said. It did not give a reason for
his arrest.
	   All eight are clerics, the paper said. It did not say when they
were detained.
	   The arrests were ordered by the Special Court for the Clergy,
the paper said.
	   Last November, Montazeri was publicly repudiated after he
questioned the legitimacy of rule by the clergy, including Iran's
powerful spiritual leader Ali Khamenei.
	   Khamenei accused him of treason and, days later, hard-liners
attacked Montazeri's home and office in the holy city of Qom,
forcing him to flee under police protection.
	   Montazeri has been confined to his house in Qom since the middle
of last year. He is allowed no visitors and his bank account has
been frozen.
	   Montazeri has a wide following among Iran's 60 million people.

Leading union calls for strike ban in Rome's jubilee year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A leading Italian labor union is urging a moratorium
on public-service strikes in Rome during the 2000 Jubilee, when 20
million pilgrims are expected for festivities kicking off
Christianity's third millenium.
	   Transport Minister Tiziano Treu welcomed the proposal but said
Sunday it didn't go far enough _ asking that the 2000 truce in
Italy's chronic labor-boss squabbles be extended countrywide.
	   Walter Cerfeda of the General Confederation of Italian Labor
called for the Pax Romana on Saturday, saying strikes during the
millennium year would have a devastating effect on Romans, tourists
and the country's image.
	   ``In 2000, we risk suffering through strikes that would bring
Rome to its knees,'' he said.
	   City leaders over the past year have had to intervene to keep
subway, taxi and bus drivers from all striking on the same days,
paralyzing a city whose streets are already clogged by fix-it
projects for the jubilee.
	   Three times the usual number of pilgrims are expected for the
jubilee. Cerfeda, head of one of Italy's three largest labor
groups, urged talks to resolve labor issues in 1999 so they don't
drag into 2000.

Anti-apartheid activist who lead women into struggle dead at 67

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Dorothy Nyembe, 67, an
anti-apartheid activist who led rural women into the struggle
against white minority rule, was buried Thursday in Umlazi, a
sprawling black township outside of Durban.
	   She died last week of asthma.
	   Jailed for 18 years by the apartheid government, Nyembe defied
``conventional wisdom'' that rural women must only care for
children and cook for their men, the Sunday Times of Johannesburg
wrote in an obituary.
	   Like her better-known comrade, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the
ex-wife of President Nelson Mandela, Nyembe held her own in
political debates mostly dominated by men, the Times wrote.
	   Both women were key organizers of the 1956 women's campaign
against apartheid era pass laws that required nonwhites to carry
documents limiting their mobility to designated regions of the
country.
	   After the African National Congress was banned in 1960, Nyembe
joined the underground military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. She spent
two jail terms _ one for three years, another for 15 _ for her
political activity.
	   The staunch Methodist Christian received a top medal from the
former Soviet Union for her fight against white oppression.
	   As an inmate at Barberton Prison in the eastern part of the
country, Nyembe was forced by wardens to wash laundry for her male
counterparts, the Times said.
	   Several thousand ANC supporters, including several Cabinet
ministers, attended her funeral on Sunday, according to Bheki Cele,
spokesman for the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal.

Wachter beats Meissnitzer, clinches first victory of season

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) _ Austrian veteran Anita Wachter, on the
mend from a bad knee injury, surprised even herself Sunday by
easily capturing a World Cup giant slalom race for her first
triumph in nearly three years.
	   Teammate Alexandra Meissnitzer, the favorite and overall World
Cup leader, finished a relatively distant second and said she had
no chance against her impressive countrywoman.
	   Wachter stormed down the fast, perfectly prepared Hirschenkogel
course in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 7.90 seconds,
beating Meissnitzer by a clear margin of 0.74 seconds.
	   ``This result is just incredible for me,'' an emotional Wachter
said.
	   Coming back from a severe knee injury suffered in a crash last
season in Cortina, Italy, Wachter won her first race since January
1996. Her previous season's best had been third in a giant slalom
at Val d'Isere earlier this month.
	   ``I gained a lot of self-confidence from that race,'' Wachter
said. ``I knew could be in the top three today, but the victory is
a big surprise.''
	   Wachter, the 1993 overall World Cup champion, made a decision
last summer to pursue World Cup points in slalom and giant slalom
only.
	   ``I didn't know how my knees would react to a full load,'' she
explained. ``Now I see it was a good decision.''
	   The 31-year old Austrian, on the women's alpine skiing circuit
since 1985, hopes for a podium finish at the alpine skiing World
Championships at Vail, Colorado, in January.
	   ``I proved to myself I'm still good,'' she said.
	   Meissnitzer squandered her chance for a third consecutive giant
slalom victory in an overly cautious second run, in which she
finished a disappointing tenth.
	   ``In the last few days, the pressure was pretty high,'' the
Austrian champion said.
	   Praising Wachter for her performance, Meissnitzer said she
wouldn't have won even if she hadn't been so cautious in the second
run.
	   ``Today I simply had no chance,'' she said.
	   Finishing eighth in the first run, Norway's Andrine Flemmen came
home third in a combined 2:09.33, posting a brilliant second leg.
	   Liechtenstein's Birgit Heeb, third after the first leg, dropped
one place to an overall fourth, while Sweden's Anna Ottosson
climbed three places to fifth.
	   A mistake resulting in a crash threw Switzerland's Corinne Ray
Bellet off the course midway down the first run, shortly after she
clocked the fourth best intermediate time.
	   Despite being beaten Sunday, Meissnitzer boosted her lead atop
the overall World Cup standings, where she sits with 891 points.
	   Germany's Martina Ertl, seventh in Sunday's race, is second with
504, followed by Austrian Renate Goetschl with 485.
	   The World Cup circuit continues Monday with a night slalom at
the Hirschenkogel.

Second arson attack in Cape Town since Christmas Day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ In the second arson incident
since Friday, a house and car belonging to a man warned beforehand
to stop illegal drug activities were set afire Sunday, police said.
	   There were no injuries reported.
	   The alleged arsonists doused the house and car with gasoline and
set them alight in the early morning hours, said police spokesman
Supt. Wicus Holtzhausen. The attack caused an estimated 150,000
rand (dlrs 25,000) damage.
	   Holtzhausen said the owner of the property was reportedly warned
by neighbors on Saturday to stop illegal activities. The neighbors
threatened to inform an anti-drug group if he did not stop,
Holtzhausen said.
	   On Christmas Day, a petrol bomb injured two people and destroyed
a house belonging to another man who had been warned by an
anti-drug group, police said.
	   Similar attacks in the past have been linked to a mostly Islamic
vigilante group called People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, or
PAGAD.
	   Earlier this month, a pipe bomb caused some damage at a Cape
Town synagogue.
	   The bombing of the Planet Hollywood restaurant on Cape Town's
waterfront in August claimed two lives. No arrests have been made
in the case.

Five killed as armed mobs attack police in Pakistan

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with number killed and wounded &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Soldiers patrolled the streets of a
northern Pakistani city Sunday after armed mobs exchanged heavy
gunfire with security forces, leaving at least five people dead and
wounding 20 others, police said.
	   Police ran for cover as armed mobs attacked police stations and
government buildings in Bannu city, some 120 kilometers (75 miles)
south of Peshawar _ the capital of Northwest Frontier Province,
witnesses said.
	   The violence started after prayer leaders in mosques urged
people to avenge the police killing of a youngster during the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, they said.
	   Armed people on roofs fired at the security forces, killing a
soldier and wounding a policeman, police said.
	   The security forces fired back, killing at least four people and
wounding 19 others.
	   The civil administration called in the army to restore peace.

Killer elephant executed in eastern india

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An elephant who had rampaged through
human settlements and trampled to death 19 people in the last
year-and-a-half, was shot dead in northeastern India by orders of
the forest department, domestic news agencies reported Sunday.
	   The elephant, named Gobindra Singh, was declared a ``rogue''
last month when he killed a forest department doctor who had
tranquilized him for a medical check. The elephant suddenly
regained consciousness and attacked the veterinarian.
	   Declaring an elephant hunting a rogue is takes a lot of
deliberation because elephant hunting is banned.
	   In the past, he has also damaged crops and destroyed more than
150 huts, the United News of India said.
	   Three hunters shot the bull elephant Saturday evening in the
remote Tinsukhia district in Assam state, UNIT said. The heavily
forested area is 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) east of the Indian
capital, New Delhi.
	   Wildlife experts say a shrinking habitat and a disproportionate
rise in the number of elephants in the past 15 years have led to a
change in the elephants' behavior making some of them violent.
	   Wild elephants have killed nearly 400 people in Assam in the
past 10 years.

China sentences dissident to 10 years imprisonment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Zhang's age, previous job in graf 15 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Broadening a crackdown on dissent, China swiftly
tried and sentenced a labor activist Sunday to 10 years
imprisonment for telling a U.S. government-funded radio network
about farmers' protests, his wife said.
	   Zhang Shanguang was the fourth dissident given a lengthy jail
term in a week. He was sentenced following a closed-door, 2-hour,
20-minute hearing from which his wife, friends and relatives were
barred, his wife, Hou Xuezhu, said.
	   ``It's unjust, unfair,'' she said.
	   The harsh sentence underscored the ruling Communist Party's
determination to keep a tight grip on power as it grapples with
mounting unemployment and economic difficulties, and heads into a
politically charged year.
	   The 10th anniversary of the government's crackdown on democracy
protests on Tiananmen Square falls in June. A few months later, in
October, the Communist Party will fete the 50th anniversary of its
rule over China, and in December China takes back control of the
Portuguese colony of Macau.
	   Chinese leaders are anxious to ensure that no one seizes upon
these events to push for change or vent grievances. They also want
to prevent democracy and labor activists from tapping into the
discontent caused by millions of lay-offs from state factories that
are being shut down and restructured.
	   In a strident speech last week, President Jiang Zemin vowed to
crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and ordered that
threats to stability be ``resolutely nipped in the bud.''
	   Zhang's summary trial follows heavy sentences given last week to
three of China's most prominent dissidents: Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin
and Wang Youcai. They were charged with endangering state security
and sentenced to 13 years, 12 years and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party.
	   Zhang, however, was not a member of the would-be opposition
group and his sentence suggested a broadening of the government's
efforts to crush dissent.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing, through its spokesman, Bill Palmer,
said Sunday it was ``deeply disappointed with the guilty verdicts
and the extremely harsh sentences'' handed down in the past week.
	   Zhang had been working on setting up an association to protect
the rights of laid-off workers when he was arrested in July, after
the visit to China by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   At his trial, the court in Huaihua city in south China's Hunan
province convicted Zhang of providing ``intelligence'' to people
overseas by giving an interview to Radio Free Asia about farmers'
protests and heavy rural taxes, his wife said.
	   The U.S. government-funded network has irked Chinese officials
with reports on human rights and other issues, and its broadcasts
are sometimes jammed in China. His wife said Zhang gave the radio
just one interview in March and spoke about a protest by 70 to 80
farmers.
	   After the closed hearing, the court adjourned for 30 minutes
before passing sentence, his wife said. She said she was allowed
into the court for the sentencing, but was not allowed to speak to
her husband.
	   The 42-year-old former schoolteacher is sick with tuberculosis
and has lost ``a lot'' of weight in detention, she said. But ``his
spirit is very good,'' she added.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ With South Africa nearly a full
century ahead, West Indies clung on Sunday to a slim chance of
success in the third cricket Test against South Africa at
Kingsmead.
	   The Test is a make-or-break match for West Indies, already down
0-2 from South Africa's dominant bowling. West Indies
	   South Africa, on 292 for eight wickets, lead by 94 runs on the
first innings when bad light stopped play 13 overs early on the
second day of the third Test.
	   Hero for the West Indies _ and the only reason they are still in
this match _ was Franklyn Rose, who bowled a career-best 6-75.
There are still two wickets he could take.
	   Rose bowled an immaculate line and length throughout the day,
eluding the South African batsmen. His sharp fielding also led to
the run out of Darryll Cullinan after lunch for 40.
	   But Curtly Ambrose had a miserable day, conceding 60 runs in his
17 overs, including a disastrous 16 during one over to Jonty Rhodes
where he bowled four no-balls.
	   The only other wicket taker for the West Indies was Courtney
Walsh, who again bowled for lengthy spells without much reward: he
finished with one for 60 off his 27 overs.
	   In a day in which the bat never really got on top of the ball,
Rhodes played an exemplary innings, with only a few overambitious
shots that failed to make contact.
	   For the rest, Rhodes played straight with much success. While
facing leg spinner Rawl Lewis, Rhodes pulled and swept with a great
deal of power. His undefeated 85 is the highest score so far in the
series.
	   With Rhodes at the crease when play resumes early at 9:30 a.m.
local time (0730 gmt) on Monday, Allan Donald resumes on one.
	   South Africa's middle order batsmen kept chipping away at the
tourists' attack before tea, but neither Hansie Cronje nor Darryl
Cullinan were able to convert good starts into big scores.
	   Cronje fell to a beautiful delivery from Walsh which cut in
between his bat and pads to bowl him for 30.
	   Cullinan was run out going for a tight second run to Rose. The
West Indies bowler whipped the ball in to wicketkeeper Ridley
Jacobs, who removed the bails to run out the South African for 40.
	   At the crease at tea were Rhodes on 37 and Shaun Pollock on
three. Rhodes was particularly harsh on Ambrose, pulling him for
two legside sixes in consecutive overs. Pollock contented himself
by playing defensively until the tea break.
	   South Africa had 111 for three wickets at lunch.
	   Rose's first victims of the day were Hershelle Gibbs, who had
looked in wonderful form, for 35, Gary Kirsten for 26, and a
flu-stricken Jacques Kallis for 11.
	   Kirsten and Kallis fell to catches behind the wicket, and Gibbs
to a fine effort by Philo Wallace at short midwicket.

Turks in Santa suits protest traffic increase through Bosporus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Environmentalists dressed in Santa suits
took hundreds of fishing boats out in the Bosporus Strait on Sunday
to protest increasing oil-tanker traffic through the narrow
waterway.
	   The protest blocked traffic in the busy strait for hours.
	   ``It's no longer ships, but the sea, that is crying SOS,'' one
of the slogans displayed from the boats said. ``Istanbul cannot be
sacrificed to sea accidents,'' declared another.
	   The protesters were supporting Turkey's moves to restrict
passage of huge oil tankers through the Bosporus, the dividing line
for both the ancient city of Istanbul and for Europe and Asia. The
strait has been the site of nearly 200 accidents in the past
decade.
	   Turkey has been pushing for a new pipeline for Caspian oil
through its territory, and citing safety risks, has strongly
opposed a Russian project that would rely on carrying the oil
through the Bosporus.
	   Already, 440 million barrels of oil transit the Bosporus
annually. The new Caspian production could add hundreds of millions
more.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ With South Africa nearly a full
century ahead, West Indies clung on Sunday to a slim chance of
success in the third cricket Test against South Africa at
Kingsmead.
	   The Test is a make-or-break match for West Indies, already down
0-2 from South Africa's dominant bowling. West Indies
	   South Africa, on 292 for eight wickets, lead by 94 runs on the
first innings when bad light stopped play 13 overs early on the
second day of the third Test.
	   Hero for the West Indies _ and the only reason they are still in
this match _ was Franklyn Rose, who bowled a career-best 6-75.
There are still two wickets he could take.
	   Rose bowled an immaculate line and length throughout the day,
eluding the South African batsmen. His sharp fielding also led to
the run out of Darryll Cullinan after lunch for 40.
	   But Curtly Ambrose had a miserable day, conceding 60 runs in his
17 overs, including a disastrous 16 during one over to Jonty Rhodes
where he bowled four no-balls.
	   The only other wicket taker for the West Indies was Courtney
Walsh, who again bowled for lengthy spells without much reward: he
finished with one for 60 off his 27 overs.
	   In a day in which the bat never really got on top of the ball,
Rhodes played an exemplary innings, with only a few overambitious
shots that failed to make contact.
	   For the rest, Rhodes played straight with much success. While
facing leg spinner Rawl Lewis, Rhodes pulled and swept with a great
deal of power. His undefeated 85 is the highest score so far in the
series.
	   With Rhodes at the crease when play resumes early at 9:30 a.m.
local time (0730 gmt) on Monday, Allan Donald resumes on one.
	   South Africa's middle order batsmen kept chipping away at the
tourists' attack before tea, but neither Hansie Cronje nor Darryl
Cullinan were able to convert good starts into big scores.
	   Cronje fell to a beautiful delivery from Walsh which cut in
between his bat and pads to bowl him for 30.
	   Cullinan was run out going for a tight second run to Rose. The
West Indies bowler whipped the ball in to wicketkeeper Ridley
Jacobs, who removed the bails to run out the South African for 40.
	   At the crease at tea were Rhodes on 37 and Shaun Pollock on
three. Rhodes was particularly harsh on Ambrose, pulling him for
two legside sixes in consecutive overs. Pollock contented himself
by playing defensively until the tea break.
	   South Africa had 111 for three wickets at lunch.
	   Rose's first victims of the day were Hershelle Gibbs, who had
looked in wonderful form, for 35, Gary Kirsten for 26, and a
flu-stricken Jacques Kallis for 11.
	   Kirsten and Kallis fell to catches behind the wicket, and Gibbs
to a fine effort by Philo Wallace at short midwicket.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Dorothy Nyembe, 67, an
anti-apartheid activist who led rural women into the struggle
against white minority rule, was buried Thursday in Umlazi, a
sprawling black township outside of Durban.
	   She died last week of asthma.
	   Jailed for 18 years by the apartheid government, Nyembe defied
``conventional wisdom'' that rural women must only care for
children and cook for their men, the Sunday Times of Johannesburg
wrote in an obituary.
	   Like her better-known comrade, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the
ex-wife of President Nelson Mandela, Nyembe held her own in
political debates mostly dominated by men, the Times wrote.
	   Both women were key organizers of the 1956 women's campaign
against apartheid era pass laws that required nonwhites to carry
documents limiting their mobility to designated regions of the
country.
	   After the African National Congress was banned in 1960, Nyembe
joined the underground military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. She spent
two jail terms _ one for three years, another for 15 _ for her
political activity.
	   The staunch Methodist Christian received a top medal from the
former Soviet Union for her fight against white oppression.
	   As an inmate at Barberton Prison in the eastern part of the
country, Nyembe was forced by wardens to wash laundry for her male
counterparts, the Times said.
	   Nyembe was elected a Member of Parliament in the 1994 elections
that ended apartheid.
	   Several thousand ANC supporters, including several Cabinet
ministers, attended her funeral on Sunday, according to Bheki Cele,
spokesman for the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal.

Chelsea, Villa and Man Utd lead the title chase at halfway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Halfway through the campaign, five clubs are in
strong contention for the Premier League title and the leadership
could change hands three times in four days.
	   Having lost on Saturday to surrender top place to Chelsea, Aston
Villa can regain the leadership by beating Sheffield Wednesday at
Villa Park on Monday.
	   But Chelsea, unbeaten since the opening day of the season, is in
action again on Tuesday when it hosts third place Manchester United
and a victory at Stamford Bridge will put Gianluca Vialli's team
top on goal difference once again.
	   Then there's a third scenario.
	   If Villa loses to Wednesday, United, which is two points behind
them both, can go top by winning at Chelsea.
	   According to United manager Alex Ferguson, fourth place Leeds
and defending titlist Arsenal shouldn't be written off either. Both
are four points off the lead and playing well.
	   On Saturday, Leeds won 3-0 at Ruud Gullit's Newcastle against a
team fielding its 22 million pound (dlrs 36.87 million) strikeforce
of Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson for the first time. Arsenal,
with most of its stars returning to fitness, downed West Ham 1-0.
	   ``It's looking very tight at the top,'' Ferguson said after his
team outplayed last place Nottingham Forest 3-0 on Saturday helped
by two goals fro, Norwegian defender Ronny Johnsen.
	   ``Leeds United had a resounding victory at Newcastle and that
was a heck of a result for them and of course we still have
Chelsea, Aston Villa and Arsenal.
	   ``I think consistency is the key factor now, albeit with half
the season still to go.''
	   The bookmakers have Chelsea and Manchester United as
co-favorites at 7-4 with Arsenal at 9-2 and Villa 11-2. Leeds,
whose chances have been consistently downplayed by manager David
O'Leary, is considered a 28-1 shot.
	   All 20 teams play two matches over the holiday period before
they enter the FA Cup at the third round stage next weekend.
	   Villa looks in a good position to regain the lead on Monday
despite its 2-1 loss at lowly Blackburn. John Gregory's team hosts
a Wednesday lineup that slipped up 1-0 at home to Leicester on
Saturday.
	   ``We have had a few punches on the nose at various times _ and
we have shown the characteristics to bounce back and win our next
game. That is what we need to do against Wednesday,'' Gregory said.
	   ``It is always difficult straight after a game to keep things in
perspective because defeats don't happen very often to us. That was
only our second away defeat in 15 Premier League matches, which
isn't bad.''
	   The Chelsea-Manchester United confrontation on Tuesday is the
match of the week, coming only two weeks after the two teams tied
1-1 at Old Trafford.
	   Ferguson is worried about the fitness of Dutch defender Jaap
Stam, Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole, who all missed
the victory over Forest, while Chelsea may have top scorer Gustavo
Poyet missing. The tall Uruguayan midfielder, who has been one of
Chelsea's most influential players in the team's climb towards the
top, has a knee injury.
	   Poyet scored his 11th goal of the season in Saturday's 2-0
victory at Southampton which put Vialli's team top of the
standings.
	   Leeds is not in action until Tuesday when it hosts Wimbledon and
Arsenal will be confident of gaining three points at sliding
Charlton on Monday.
	   Barely a month ago, the Gunners had eight regular first teamers
sidelined through injury. But now only goalkeeper David Seaman and
center-back Tony Adams are out and Arsene Wenger's team is
returning to the form that earned it the league and FA Cup double
last season.
	   Down at the foot of the standings, last place Forest hosts next
to last Southampton. Only one point separates the two but there is
a three-point gap immediately above the Saints and relegation will
look a strong likelihood for the loser of Monday's game at the City
Ground.
	   Blackburn, which has climbed to fourth from last after two wins
and two ties under new manager Brian Kidd, goes to Leicester while
third from last Coventry has a tough game at seventh place West
Ham, which has lost once in nine home games.
	   In other games Monday, sixth place Middlesbrough goes to Derby,
Newcastle visits Liverpool and Tottenham hosts Everton.
	   Division One leader Sunderland, whose 11-point lead has been cut
to five after a tie with Birmingham and a surprise loss to Tranmere
on Saturday, should bounce back with a home victory over last place
Crewe. Second place Ipswich goes to Wolves.
	   With a 10-point advantage over third place Watford, Peter Reid's
Sunderland looks virtually assured of gaining one of the automatic
top two promotion places.

New round of fighting erupts in northern Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in a fourth
straight day of fighting in northern Kosovo.
	   The American head of international peace monitors, William
Walker, downplayed the clash as consisting of ``sporadic fighting''
and said the verifiers achieved a temporary truce late Sunday in
order for the wounded to be removed.
	   ``It didn't actually break out into all-out fighting,'' he said,
saying both sides were being ``relatively cautious.''
	   But the continuation of the worst fighting in months put more
pressure on an already shaky truce that has held through the late
fall and winter across the secessionist province of Serbia.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica _ the
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that has borne the brunt of Serb
firepower in the past four days.
	   The ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire first on
Sunday morning, but rebels shot back heavily.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, said they acted to protect and evacuate
the fast-declining number of Serb civilians in the area and to
remove the body of a farmer killed by the rebels Saturday.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
four days of fighting in the Podujevo region, some 30 kilometers
(20 miles) north of the capital Pristina. The body of the latest
victim, a 44-year-old man, was discovered Saturday night, the
Kosovo Information Center said.
	   As many as 10,000 civilians, mostly Albanians, have fled the
fighting, according to the center, which said many remained in
nearby woods Sunday.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in rebel-controlled territory between Obranca and
Lapastica. Despite Walker's comments later, one verifier at the
scene characterized it as ``serious fighting.''
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded Sunday, two seriously, in
neighboring Velika Reka after being ``ambushed'' by rebels when
they tried to rescue a wounded villager, the Serb-run Media Center
reported.
	   Efforts by the monitors to talk to both sides and visit the
fighting areas appear to have helped prevent a complete breakdown
of the wobbly truce.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity one with the other in terms of getting the
wounded out,'' Walker told CNN after the fighting calmed late
Sunday.
	   ``I would say the violence today has been sporadic at best.
There have been a number of outbreaks of shooting but they've all
died down,'' the diplomat said.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area, and the KLA has continued digging in and rearming
in their effort to break the Albanian-dominated province free of
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   A convoy of some of the Serb armored vehicles left Obranca, two
kilometers (about a mile) from Lapastica, Sunday afternoon with the
coffin of a 65-year-old Serb farmer who was buried hurriedly in
nearby Podujevo. The police had fired on the rebels for much of the
day from trenches behind his house.
	   The farmer, one of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly
ethnic Albanian village, was shot after he and his family opened
fire on the KLA, a rebel commander was quoted as saying in the
ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore on Sunday.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region.
	   A large group of armed ethnic Albanians was prevented from
entering Kosovo illegally from Albania late Saturday when Yugoslav
army border guards fired back on the ``attackers'' near the Vrbnica
border outpost, the Media Center said. No casualties were reported.
	   International diplomacy that produced an October peace agreement
has failed to achieve an agreement on Kosovo's political status
aimed at ending the conflict.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, and some 300,000 were driven from their homes.

Baby born prematurely as a result of rocket attack dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A baby born prematurely after his mother was
knocked down during a guerrilla rocket attack on Israel has died.
	   Keren Hevroni was knocked onto her stomach from the impact of a
rocket landing near her apartment, during last Wednesday's attack
on the northern town of Kiryat Shemona. She was carrying twins.
	   One fetus died immediately. The other was born late Thursday
night, and placed on life support. He died on Saturday. The death
of the unnamed child was reported in the Israeli media on Sunday.
	   ``The baby who survived for two days, I visited in intensive
care,'' Hevroni told Israel Television. ``I visited him twice, I
stood by him and looked at him, and I just prayed that at least he
would survive.''
	   One other Israeli was wounded in the attack and fifteen were
treated for shock.
	   The attack, carried out by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrilla group, was in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on
Tuesday which killed a Lebanese woman and six of her seven
children.
	   Israel said the intended target had been a Hezbollah radio
transmitter and that the building housing the family had been hit
by mistake. The Israeli army blamed pilot error and expressed its
regret at the deaths.

the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica _ the
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that appears to be the main
target of their four-day-old offensive.
	   The ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire first on
Sunday morning, but rebels were shooting back heavily.
	   The crackdown has resulted in the most serious clashes in the
secessionist province since an October truce, despite the efforts
of international monitors determined to prevent a return to
full-scale war.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
offensive. The body of the latest victim, a 44-year-old man, was
discovered Saturday night, the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in rebel-controlled territory between Obranca and
Lapastica, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina. The
unarmed patrols generally keep clear of the combat.
	   One verifier near the scene of Sunday's clash characterized it
as ``serious fighting.''
	   International monitors have talked to both sides in the fight
over the ethnic Albanian-dominated province of Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia. Those efforts, and visits to the areas of
conflict, appear to have helped prevent a complete breakdown of the
shaky truce.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area. International officials, who still hold both sides
responsible for the worsening violence, have strongly criticized
the Serbs for responding with dozens of tanks to alleged
provocations by the KLA.
	   Serb police said they would stay in Obranca, two kilometers
(about a mile) from Lapastica, until at least after the funeral
later Sunday of a 65-year-old Serb farmer killed by the KLA on
Saturday. The police took up positions behind his house and were
firing from trenches there.
	   The farmer, one of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly
ethnic Albanian village, was shot after he and his family opened
fire on the rebels, a KLA commander was quoted as saying in the
ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore on Sunday.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region.
	   In a separate incident Sunday, the Serb-run Media Center said a
62-year-old villager from Velika Reka near Podujevo was shot at
with automatic weapons and fired back on the ``terrorists.''
	   The rebels have acknowledged they are rearming and preparing for
sustained fighting in order to gain freedom for Kosovo.
	   A large group of armed ethnic Albanians was prevented from
entering Kosovo illegally from Albania late Saturday when Yugoslav
army border guards fired on the ``attackers'' near the Vrbnica
border outpost, the Media Center said. No casualties were reported.
	   International diplomacy that produced an October peace agreement
has failed to achieve an agreement on Kosovo's political status
aimed at ending the conflict.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, driving some 300,000 were driven from their homes.
	   Hundreds have fled the latest fighting in the Podujevo region,
walking for kilometers (miles) in sub-freezing temperatures and
packing into houses already cramped with other refugees, sometimes
dozens to the room.

DaimlerChrysler reports sales up for 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Automobile giant DaimlerChrysler
announced Sunday its 1998 sales totaled 260 billion marks (dlrs 158
billion), about 13 percent higher than the two companies' combined
sales in 1997.
	   In a news release, DaimlerChrysler said its total unit sales in
1998 were around 4.4 million cars. Records were set in each
division, it said.
	   Some 850,000 Mercedes-Benz and Smart models were sold for a
record turnover of 60 billion marks (dlrs 36 billion).
	   The Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Jeep divisions sold more than
3 million cars for total sales, including Chrysler's financial
services division, of a record 115 billion marks (dlrs 70 billion),
the statement said.
	   Trucks and other commercial vehicles also were developing into a
crucial pillar for the company, it said. About 480,000 commercial
vehicles were sold for a record turnover of 45 billion marks (dlrs
27 billion).
	   Chairmen Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton said in the release
that they expect ``the first substantial positive effects of the
merger in 1999.''
	   The automaker plans to release preliminary profit figures at the
end of February or early March. The year-end news conference is
scheduled for March 31.
	   Analysts expect DaimlerChrysler to post a net profit of between
10 billion and 11 billion marks (dlrs 6 billion to dlrs 6.7
billion) in 1998, after a combined 8.04 billion by the two separate
companies in 1997.

Youths burn 20 cars in Strasbourg despite anti-violence measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ Youths burned about 20 cars and stoned
public transit overnight, officials said Sunday, repeating violence
staged in previous years around New Year's despite expanded youth
programs.
	   The violence in the eastern border city broke out after a pop
music concert Saturday night. Young vandals torched cars and hurled
rocks and other projectiles against a bus and a tram in the working
class Hautepierre and Meinau suburbs.
	   No injuries were reported, officials said on customary
anonymity, and police failed to arrest any of the vandals.
	   From Saturday until Jan. 2, local officials were planning
low-cost hip hop, techno and Algerian rai music concerts, along
with cyber cafe access at reduced rates. The city was backing the
programs with 3.5 million francs (dlrs 625,000) in funding.
	   Last year 500 cars were burned in Strasbourg, up 100 from the
year before. A rash of burnings at the end of 1997 were blamed on
youths competing with each other for attention from French media.
	   The youth violence in many cities across France has usually
occurred in poor immigrant neighborhoods wracked by high
unemployment, often sparking transit walkouts by drivers fed up
with attacks on them. A 12-day-old bus strike in the eastern city
of Nancy was in part blamed on violence.
	   Youths of mainly North African descent rioted in working class
districts in the southern city of Toulouse for several days last
week, after police shot and killed an alleged car thief from one of
their neighborhoods.

New round of fighting erupts in northern Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. diplomat calling fighting sporadic, saying
temporary truce obtained late Sunday, Serbs saying action was to
evacuate body and civilians, convoy of armored vehicles leaves
site, Albanians saying 10,000 civilians have evacuated in recent
days. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police and ethnic Albanian
rebels waged a fierce battle Sunday around a guerrilla stronghold,
exchanging fire with artillery, mortars and grenades in northern
Kosovo.
	   The leader of a group of international monitors, William Walker,
downplayed the clash, saying it consisted of ``sporadic fighting''
and that the verifiers achieved a temporary truce late Sunday so
the wounded could be removed.
	   ``It didn't actually break out into all-out fighting,'' he said.
	   But the continuation of the four-day battle, the worst fighting
in months, put more pressure on an already shaky truce that has
held since October across Kosovo, the mainly ethnic Albanian
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica _ the
Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that has borne the brunt of Serb
firepower in the past four days.
	   The ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire first Sunday
morning, but rebels shot back heavily.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, said they acted to protect and evacuate
the fast-declining number of Serb civilians in the area and to
remove the body of a farmer killed by the rebels Saturday.
	   At least 10 ethnic Albanians have been reported killed in the
four days of fighting in the Podujevo region, some 30 kilometers
(20 miles) north of the capital Pristina. The body of the latest
victim, a 44-year-old man, was discovered Saturday night, the
Kosovo Information Center said.
	   As many as 10,000 civilians, mostly Albanians, have fled the
fighting, according to the center. Many remained in nearby woods,
it reported.
	   Teams of international monitors were sent to the area of
Sunday's shooting in rebel-controlled territory between Obranca and
Lapastica. Despite Walker's comments later, one verifier at the
scene characterized it as ``serious fighting.''
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded Sunday, two seriously, in
neighboring Velika Reka after being ``ambushed'' by rebels when
they tried to rescue a wounded villager, the Serb-run Media Center
reported.
	   Monitors' efforts to talk to combatants and to visit the
fighting areas appear to have helped prevent a complete breakdown
of the wobbly truce.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity one with the other in terms of getting the
wounded out,'' Walker, an American, told CNN after the fighting
calmed late Sunday.
	   ``I would say the violence today has been sporadic at best.
There have been a number of outbreaks of shooting but they've all
died down,'' the diplomat said.
	   But Serb forces have refused to end their buildup in the
rebel-held area, and the KLA has continued digging in and rearming
in their effort to free Kosovo from Serbia.
	   A convoy of some of the Serb armored vehicles left Obranca, two
kilometers (about a mile) from Lapastica, Sunday afternoon with the
coffin of a 65-year-old Serb farmer who was buried hurriedly in
nearby Podujevo. The police had fired on the rebels for much of the
day from trenches behind his house.
	   The farmer, one of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly
ethnic Albanian village, was shot after he and his family opened
fire on the KLA, a rebel commander was quoted as saying in the
ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore on Sunday.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said the farmer's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic told reporters.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, and some 300,000 were driven from their homes.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The bodies of four foreigners who were
beheaded earlier this month in Chechnya will be sent to Britain and
New Zealand this week, officials said Sunday.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday evening in the
village of Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital,
Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday,
according to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   A spokesman for the British embassy in Moscow confirmed that the
men's bodies had been identified.
	   ``We have been in touch with the medical people in Chechnya.
They have said the bodies are ours, and we have accepted this,''
the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anomymity.
	   Chechen Presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev said the heads
and the bodies would be sent back to Britain and New Zealand within
the next few days.
	   Eamonn Hickey, father of the 26-year-old Darren Hickey, said he
was relieved that his son's body would soon be returned.
	   ``We are devastated, but at least there will be a funeral after
all,'' he said from the family pub in Thames Ditton, England.
	   Chechnya fought a 1994-96 independence war with Russia. It now
runs its own affairs, though no country recognizes its claims of
sovereignty.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since the war ended.

Saudi reportedly lobbies for postponement of meeting on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Arabia is lobbying to postpone this
week's emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers scheduled to
discuss the showdown between the United States and Iraq, Arab
diplomats said Sunday.
	   The meeting, due to be held Wednesday in the Egyptian capital,
Cairo, was called by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid in the wake of last week's U.S.-British military
attacks on Iraq.
	   Abdel-Meguid said Sunday that 14 out of the 22 Arab foreign
ministers have accepted his invitation to attend the meeting. His
diplomatic initiative followed a call by Yemen's President Ali
Abdullah Saleh for an an Arab summit to forge a united Arab
position after the air attacks.
	   But Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saudi Arabia sent its chief diplomat, Prince Saud al-Faisal, to
Cairo Sunday to ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to back its
demand for putting off the meeting until the end of the Muslim holy
month Ramadan in mid-January.
	   Egyptian officials would not confirm that the Saudi envoy
visited Egypt.
	   Iraq wants the Cairo meeting to back its demand for the lifting
of the crippling U.N economic sanctions which were imposed after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   Saudi Arabia is apparently worried that the Arab states may give
Iraq the much needed backing in its confrontation with the United
States and Britain.
	   Egypt's influential Al-Ahram newspaper reported Sunday that the
Gulf states of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia's
allies, will send their foreign ministers to the meeting in Cairo,
for the meeting.
	   Also on Sunday, Iraq submitted a draft resolution to a meeting
of Arab legislators in Jordan urging Arab nations to ignore the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq and demanding that all foreign troops be
pulled out of the Gulf.

Report: Murdoch eyeing big investment in German media concern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German media giant Kirch Gruppe
refused to comment Sunday on a report that Rupert Murdoch hopes to
take a dlrs 1 billion stake in the new holding company being formed
through its restructuring.
	   Along with Murdoch's News Corp., this week's Focus magazine
reported the other two international investors would be Saudi
Arabian Prince al Waleed and Italian media tycoon Silvio
Berlusconi.
	   It said Prince al Waleed is aiming to invest about dlrs 350
million to dlrs 450 million in the holding company, to be called
Taurus, which covers Kirch's core business activities of film
licensing, film production and television.
	   Berlusconi would join through a share swap that would bring 13
percent of his Mediaset SpA under the Kirch holding company, the
report said, citing unidentified Italian media executives as
sources.
	   It said all prospective partners were in agreement that Kirch
would remain the majority shareholder in the restructured group. It
said talks were to continue in Milan on Monday to work out details
for Taurus to buy programming from News Corp.'s Fox network in the
United States.
	   Kirch has been in talks with international investors for months,
and has said it expects them to be finalized by the end of the
year. A spokesman declined Sunday to comment on the Focus report.
	   The entire operation has been valued between at least dlrs 2.4
billion to dlrs 3 billion, according to media reports.

Two dead, one missing in gales lashing British Isles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two men were killed and a third was missing and
feared dead in high winds and rain in Britain and Ireland, police
said Sunday.
	   Michael Joyce, 26, was killed in the Irish Republic when a
falling tree crushed his car near the village of Maam Cross, in the
Connemara region of County Galway. His girlfriend escaped unhurt.
	   In Brighton, southern England, coastguard officials called off
the search for a 28-year-old man was swept into the sea by a 30
foot (9 meter) wave as he walked along a beach with his girlfriend
and her son. A rescue attempt later failed. The coastguards said it
was unlikely the man would survive in the cold water.
	   In Devonshire, southern England, search teams found the body of
44-year-old Paul Witt, who was swept away while watching flood
waters at his home in the village of Ashburton. He was last seen
standing close to a broken fence at the bottom of his garden and is
thought to have accidentally stumbled into the River Ashton.
	   Searchers found a body just half a mile downstream on Sunday and
police identified it as Witt's.

South Africa joins Africa-wide AIDS vaccine research effort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African researchers will
participate in an international AIDS vaccine development project
that will focus on two African strains of HIV, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   The dlrs 9.1 million project is funded by the New York-based
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, the Sunday Independent
reported.
	   The South African government will contribute 5 million rand
(dlrs 830,000) to the project, said Dr. William Makgoba, head of
the country's Medical Research Council.
	   The project will mark the first major efforts for a vaccine
against two HIV strains found in South Africa and Kenya. Most
vaccine research to date has focussed on an HIV strain found mainly
in Europe and the United States, the newspaper said.
	   About two-thirds of the 33 million people worldwide who are
infected with the HIV virus live south of the Sahara, the United
Nations said recently.
	   Collaboration on the project will include AlphaVax, a U.S.-based
company; the University of Cape Town; the University of Oxford in
England and the University of Nairobi in Kenya, the report said.
	   IAVI is an independent group founded in 1996 with backing from
the Rockefeller and Sloan foundations, the United Nations and the
World Bank. Its strategy is to develop multiple vaccines with
partnerships between vaccine producers and developing countries.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted
a California company permission to begin the largest test yet of a
possible vaccine to prevent infection by the virus that causes
AIDS.
	   The three-year trial of VaxGen Inc.'s AIDSvax will include 5,000
American volunteers at high risk for catching the AIDS virus and
2,500 high-risk people in Thailand.
	   Controversy has surrounded the development of an alleged AIDS
remedy, Virodene, in South Africa. Earlier this month, the panel
that controls drug testing rejected Virodene for clinical trials,
saying the move was prompted by its concern for science and public
safety.

Strobl leads opening practice, missed by leading Norwegians

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Lasse Kjus, this season's World Cup
downhill sensation, is suffering from bronchitis and will not start
in the last speed race of the year scheduled in this Italian Alpine
resort on Tuesday.
	   Norwegian team officials said Sunday that Kjus will need about
one week to recover and should be back to action in Kranjska Gora,
Slovenia, on Jan. 5-6.
	   Kjetil Andre Aamodt, another leading Norwegian skier, also
skipped Tuesday's downhill here _ the fourth of the season _ after
missing a plane connection in Copenhagen and Sunday's opening
practice, Italian organizers said.
	   Austrian Fritz Strobl, in high spirit and form following his
amazing third place in a Super-G at Innsbruck last Monday, led the
first of two practice runs ahead of Italy's Peter Runggaldier and
Swiss Bruno Kernen.
	   Kjus, who trails World Cup leader Hermann Maier by only three
points in the overall standings _ 537 to 540 + dominated the two
first downhills of the season in Val D'Isere and Val Gardena and
placed second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in the third.
	   Kjus is the leader of the downhill standings with 280 points. He
last started in Monday's Super-G at Patscherkofel in which he
finished 14th.
	   His absence at the starting gate of the demanding and icy
Stelvio course was expected to boost the Austrians bid for their
first World Cup downhill victory this season.
	   The other members of the Norwegian downhill team _ Lasse
Pualsen, Kenneth Siversten and Audun Groenvold _ arrived too late
for Sunday's run but will start in Monday's second practice and in

minute, 57.48 seconds, edging Runggaldier by 0.15.
	   Kernen, the defending world downhill champion, came in third,
0.28 behind.
	   Werner Franz led Austrian teammates Andreas Schifferer and Maier
for fourth place,
	   Maier, who captured his first World Cup downhill career victory
in Bormio last year, was one of the favored skiers in Tuesday's
race.
	   American Chad Fleischer placed seventh, 0.60 seconds slower than

	   Ghedina was a distant 21st, with a gap of 1.61 seconds.

West African peacekeeping force lands in Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The first group of west African
peacekeeping troops has arrived in Guinea-Bissau as part of a
November peace pact to end a five-month civil war in the tiny west
African country, news reports said.
	   Seventy troops from Togo arrived Saturday in the capital of the
former Portuguese colony and more were expected Sunday, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   Guinea-Bissau erupted in civil war earlier this year when the
country's top military commander, Ansumane Mane, led a revolt
against President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   About half the country's population of 1 million was displaced
by the fighting that raged in the capital and spread to inland
areas over five months.
	   The warring sides signed a cease-fire pact Nov. 2 and agreed to
have troops from ECOMOG _ the Economic Community of West African
States Military Observer Group _ monitor the treaty.
	   Troops from the West African force will also provide security
for relief agencies working near Guinea-Bissau's northern border
with Senegal.

Iraqi weekly names Saddam Man of All Years

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi weekly on Sunday named President
Saddam Hussein Man of All Years because of his courage and
popularity among the Iraqi people.
	   ``He alone... and nobody else lives in our hearts and symbolizes
our dignity and pride,'' said Al-Musawir al-Arabi weekly in a
front-page editorial. A picture of Saddam, wearing a cowboy hat and
holding an AK-47 assault rifle, appeared next to the editorial.
	   ``Who has the courage to keep the whole world busy?'' said the
editorial, adding that Saddam enjoyed ``patience and forgiveness''
and ``does not fear but the creator.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth
Starr were named Time magazine's Men of the Year last week.

Strobl leads opening practice, missed by leading Norwegians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Lasse Kjus, this season's World Cup
downhill sensation, is suffering from bronchitis and will not start
in the last speed race of the year scheduled in this Italian Alpine
resort on Tuesday.
	   Norwegian team officials said Sunday that Kjus will need about
one week to recover and should be back to action in Kranjska Gora,
Slovenia, on Jan. 5-6.
	   Kjetil Andre Aamodt, another leading Norwegian skier, also
skipped Tuesday's downhill here _ the fourth of the season _ after
missing a plane connection in Copenhagen and Sunday's opening
practice, Italian organizers said.
	   Austrian Fritz Strobl, in high spirit and form following his
amazing third place in a Super-G at Innsbruck last Monday, led the
first of two practice runs ahead of Italy's Peter Runggaldier and
Swiss Bruno Kernen.
	   Kjus, who trails World Cup leader Hermann Maier by only three
points in the overall standings _ 537 to 540 _ dominated the two
first downhills of the season in Val D'Isere and Val Gardena and
placed second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in the third.

Gunmen kill four family members in KwaZulu-Natal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Four members of a family were killed
in what police believe was a family revenge attack in a region in
eastern South Africa that has been plagued by violence, police said
Sunday.
	   The attack took place Saturday evening in a rural area in
KwaZulu-Natal, where two gunmen armed with heavy caliber rifles
allegedly forced open the door and began shooting, said Capt.
Joshua Gwala, a police spokesman.
	   The victims ranged in age from 8 to 30 years.
	   The killing brought to 21 the total number of people killed
since Christmas Eve in four different attacks. Police discounted
any links among the killings that occurred in towns spread
throughout the region.
	   In the worst attack on Christmas Eve, eight people died in the
town of Margate.
	   Saturday's attack in the small village of Ntabamhlophe developed
from a dispute between two families, police said.
	   President Nelson Mandela on Saturday said he backed a special
initiative from the National Director of Public Prosecutions to
investigate the killings.
	   Multiple killings in KwaZulu-Natal receive special attention
after more than 10,000 people died in political clashes in the
years before the first all-race elections in 1994.
	   On Christmas Day in 1995, a political massacre claimed 18 lives
in Shobashobane, when 2,000 armed supporters of the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party attacked rival members of
Mandela's African National Congress.

Ex-communist calls for amnesty for former East German officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS SCHMOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The successor to East Germany's communist party
intends next year to introduce a bill in parliament to grant
amnesty to former East German officials, the party leader said
Sunday.
	   Lothar Bisky, chairman of the Party for Democratic Socialism,
said he would like to see an end to investigations against former
East German lawyers, politicians and army members, and a lifting or
reduction of sentences for those already convicted.
	   He accused prosecutors of seeking to make up for the lax
treatment given to many ex-Nazis after World War II by pursuing
East German functionaries.
	   ``That this now is to be made right by of all things the
clearing up of East Germany history, I consider it to be an
exercise on the wrong object,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
	   A PDS lawmaker, Evelyn Kenzler, was harshly criticized earlier
this month by Germany's main governing and opposition parties after
she called for an amnesty for former East German officials
convicted of crimes under communist rule.
	   Some called the idea an insult to former East German activists
whose peaceful demonstrations led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989.
	   All mainstream parties have voiced opposition to an amnesty,
making the PDS proposal unlikely to go anywhere in parliament.
	   But Bisky said he felt those who worked for the East German
government and did not violate East German laws should be left in
peace. ``That doesn't mean that one doesn't deal with the effects
(of their actions) critically,'' he said.
	   The PDS has long argued against trying officials and the
rank-and-file for enforcing what was then East German law,
including the shoot-to-kill orders on the border. The federal
Constitutional Court, Germany's highest, ruled in 1996 that the
trials were legal because the shootings violated human rights.

State government urged to protect Christians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's national minorities commission
Sunday urged the government of the western state of Gujarat to
ensure that violence against Christians is not repeated when
radical Hindu groups hold rallies and demonstrations across the
state.
	   The demonstrations are scheduled for Monday.
	   Christian groups have asked for police protection in some parts
of Gujarat where there have been more than 40 instances of violence
against the community this year.
	   The most recent violence was during Christmas when Hindu zealots
attacked two Catholic schools, one hospital and three churches,
reports said. Three women were also injured when attackers
allegedly threw stones as they returned from church.
	   On Sunday, More than 1,000 Hindu right-wing activists held a
demonstration in a village in central Gujarat where they
distributed pamphlets asking Christian missionaries to stop
conversions and urged Hindus who had converted to return to their
faith.
	   Christians say the violence is being fanned by Hindu right-wing
groups closely linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has condemned the recent
attacks. His government denies there is any orchestrated
anti-Christian campaign.

Arc de Triomphe in second day; talks planned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PAR101

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Talks were planned early in the week to resolve a
two-day-old strike at the Arc de Triomphe that barred throngs of
holiday visitors from climbing atop the stone monument, officials
said Sunday.
	   Culture Ministry officials were to meet as early as Monday with
the Union of Cultural Affairs Personnel, which was demanding the
government hire more attendants.
	   About 60 employees work at the Arc de Triomphe, and union
officials say that with rising numbers of visitors in the past
year, the staff is overworked.
	   Employees have also complained that conditions were more
difficult than at other Paris cultural sites, due to the noise and
pollution from the traffic circle surrounding the monument and the
cramped spaces inside the Arc.
	   The ministry was looking for a quick solution to the dispute,
said a ministry spokesman on condition of anonymity.
	   Built at the top of the Avenue des Champs-Elysees between 1806
and 1836 to honor Napoleon's victories, the Arc de Triomphe draws
about 1.4 million visitors a year. Winding stairways lead up to the
roof, with a view of the Paris skyline.
	   Strikes in recent weeks have also hit the Orsay, Louvre and
Grand Palais museums, with employees making similar demands for
more staff to handle larger crowds.
	   A recent strike at the Eiffel Tower, operated by the city of
Paris, was staged by workers demanding more hirings to comply with
the leftist government's 35-hour work week law.

Baby born prematurely as a result of rocket attack dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A baby born prematurely after his mother was
knocked down during a guerrilla rocket attack on Israel has died,
according to media reports Sunday.
	   Keren Hevroni was knocked onto her stomach from the impact of a
rocket landing near her apartment, during last Wednesday's attack
on the northern town of Kiryat Shemona. She was carrying twins.
	   One fetus died immediately. The other was born late Thursday
night, and placed on life support. He died Saturday.
	   ``The baby who survived for two days, I visited in intensive
care,'' Hevroni told Israel Television. ``I visited him twice, I
stood by him and looked at him, and I just prayed that at least he
would survive.''
	   One other Israeli was wounded in the attack and fifteen were
treated for shock.
	   The attack, carried out by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrilla group, was in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on
Tuesday that killed a Lebanese woman and six of her seven children.
	   Israel said the intended target had been a Hezbollah radio
transmitter and that the building housing the family had been hit
by mistake. The Israeli army blamed pilot error and expressed its

Saudi reportedly lobbies for postponement of meeting on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Arabia is lobbying to postpone this
week's emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers scheduled to
discuss the showdown between the United States and Iraq, Arab
diplomats said Sunday.
	   The meeting, due to be held Wednesday in the Egyptian capital,
Cairo, was called by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid in the wake of last week's U.S.-British military
attacks on Iraq.
	   Abdel-Meguid said Sunday that 14 of the 22 Arab foreign
ministers have accepted his invitation. His diplomatic initiative
followed a call by Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh for an an
Arab summit to forge a united Arab position after the attacks.
	   But Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saudi Arabia sent its chief diplomat, Prince Saud al-Faisal, to
Cairo on Sunday to ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to back its
demand for putting off the meeting until the end of the Muslim holy
month Ramadan in mid-January.
	   Egyptian officials would not confirm the Saudi envoy's visit.
	   Iraq wants the Cairo meeting to back its demand for the lifting
of the crippling U.N economic sanctions that were imposed after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   Saudi Arabia is apparently worried that the Arab states may give
Iraq the much needed backing in its confrontation with the United
States and Britain.
	   Egypt's influential Al-Ahram newspaper reported Sunday that the
Gulf states of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia's
allies, will send their foreign ministers to the meeting in Cairo.
	   Also on Sunday, Iraq submitted a draft resolution to a meeting
of Arab legislators in Jordan urging Arab nations to ignore the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq and demanding that all foreign troops be
pulled out of the Gulf.

Marion Jones, Pantani lead lists by Italy's leading sports daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ U.S. track and field star Marion Jones was
picked as the best woman athlete of 1998 in a survey by Italy's
largest sports daily, Gazzetta dello Sport of Milan.
	   Possibly helped by a bit of nationalism, Italian cyclist Marco
Pantani led the men's lists ahead of Ethiopian long distance runner
Haile Gebrselassie.
	   Marion Jones, the American sprinter and long jumper who won 40
of 41 events contested this year, got 480 points in the survey.
	   French sprinter Christine Arron finished second with 333 points
with U.S. swimmer Jenny Thompson third with 321.
	   Pantani, winner of the Tours of Italy and France, led
Gebrselassie 476 to 457 points.
	   Another long distance runner, Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco,
edged Formula One world champion Mika Hakkinen for third place.
	   France's soccer team, the 1998 World Cup titlist, led the team's
vote with 299 points, ahead of Yugoslavia's basketball team which
got 238.
	   The Chicago Bulls of NBA were only sixth.

Iraqi weekly names Saddam Man of All Years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi weekly on Sunday named President
Saddam Hussein ``Man of All Years'' because of his courage and
popularity among the Iraqi people.
	   ``He alone... and nobody else lives in our hearts and symbolizes
our dignity and pride,'' said Al-Musawir al-Arabi weekly in a
front-page editorial. A picture of Saddam, wearing a cowboy hat and
holding an AK-47 assault rifle, appeared next to the editorial.
	   ``Who has the courage to keep the whole world busy?'' said the
editorial, adding that Saddam enjoyed ``patience and forgiveness''
and ``does not fear but the creator.''
	   Like all publications in Iraq, the Al-Musawir al-Arabi weekly is
government controlled.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth
Starr were named Time magazine's ``Men of the Year'' last week.

Russia deploys newest generation of nuclear missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with parliament committee considering funding
of nuclear forces, includes range of missile. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The military put 10 new Topol-M nuclear missiles
on full combat readiness Sunday, the first time the missile has
been deployed. The missile was developed to sustain Russia as a
global nuclear power.
	   The single-warhead Topol-M's were commissioned in the Saratov
region, about 700 kilometers (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The deployment was a major step for Russia's cash-strapped
military. The government doesn't have enough money to maintain all
its armed forces, and decided to concentrate defense spending on
developing the Topol-M.
	   ``This is a very important event, because even in the difficult
financial conditions of 1998 we have managed to find funds for
financing this top priority area,'' said Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   A parliament committee is drafting a bill that would guarantee
funding to the strategic missile forces until 2010, regardless of
the country's economic situation, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The measure would ensure that Russia maintains nuclear parity
with the West, according to Roman Popkovich, chairman of the
Defense Committee of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   The intercontinental Topol-M will be the new heart of Russia's
missile forces. Forty are expected to be built by the end of 2000,
taking the place of heavier, multiple-warhead missiles.
	   The Topol-M is a lightweight, rugged missile designed to be
fired from a vehicle. Its range has been reported to exceed 10,000
kilometers (6,200 miles), and its mobility increases its safety
from preemptive enemy first strikes, unlike silo-based warheads.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A natural gas pipeline exploded Sunday
in a rural hamlet in northern Colombia killing at least nine people
and injuring dozens more, authorities said
	   Authorities had not determined the cause of the blast.
	   The early-morning explosion in Arroyo de Piedra, 410 miles (680
kilometers) north of Bogota, also destroyed twenty houses, said
local fire chief, Sgt. Gonzalo Charris.
	   ``Apparently there are more victims in the wreckage of the
homes,'' Charris said in a radio interview.
	   The exact death and injury toll, as well as the ages and sex of
the victims, was unclear.
	   Charris reported 15 deaths and 50 people injured. However, the
health secretary in the nearby town of Sabana Larga, Rafael
Bohorquez, said in a separate radio interview that 10 people had
died and 58 were injured.
	   A photographer present in the area told The Associated Press he
had seen the bodies of nine blast victims.
	   Police said the gas was turned off immediately after the blast,
and the fire was under control.

Tribesmen block workers from going to oil fields in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesman on Sunday prevented workers from
repairing a damaged oil pipeline that they blew up two days earlier
in northeastern Yemen, tribal leaders said.
	   Armed men asked a group of technicians working for the American
Hunt Oil Co. not to repair the pipeline in the Marib province, 170
kilometers (107 miles) northeast of the capital, San`a, said the
tribal leaders, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. They
said the tribesmen did not use force.
	   Tribesmen, who have been demanding that the government give them
a percentage of the oil profits, also blocked laborers from heading
to work in other oil fields in the Marib province.
	   The official Al-Ayam newspaper reported Sunday that tribesmen
blew up the Hunt oil pipeline Friday and tribal leaders said fire
was still raging Sunday. Hunt officials could not be immediately
reached to give an assessment of the damage.
	   A similar explosion in the past resulted in a loss of 1,500
barrels of oil a day.
	   Friday's blast was the latest attack on oil and gas pipelines
since June when tribesmen and city residents protested a 40 percent
rise in the price gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet
demands by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Tribesmen are also demanding that the government build power
plants and a water distribution system in their region.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontent with the government.
	   Hunt Oil Company's oil field concession in Marib produces
165,000 barrels per day. The company employs 1,300 Yemeni staff in
addition to 30 foreign workers.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Unidentified attackers burned down a
church in a remote area in western India where a series of attacks
on Christians since Christmas has terrorized the small community.
	   A spokesman for the United Christian Forum for Human Rights, a
lay group of Christians, gave no details of the attack in a village
in Gujarat state. The area is 900 kilometers (550 miles) southwest
of New Delhi.
	   In the last two days, Hindu zealots have attacked two Catholic
schools, one hospital and three churches. More than 10 people have
also been injured by thrown stones.
	   On Sunday, More than 1,000 Hindu right-wing activists held a
demonstration in a village in central Gujarat and distributed
pamphlets asking Christian missionaries to stop conversions and
urging Hindus who had converted to return to their faith.
	   Fearing further attacks, Christian groups have asked for police
protection in some parts of Gujarat where there have been more than
40 instances of violence against the community this year.
	   Christians say the violence is being fanned by Hindu right-wing
groups closely linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   These groups are scheduled to hold demonstrations throughout
Gujarat on Monday.
	   India's national minorities commission Sunday urged the Gujarat
government to ensure that violence against Christians is not
repeated during the rallies are held.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has condemned the recent
attacks on Christians. His government denies there is any
orchestrated anti-Christian campaign.

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police using artillery,
mortars and other heavy weapons battled ethnic Albanian rebels for
hours Sunday in a fourth straight day of combat in the snowy fields
of northern Kosovo.
	   The U.S. diplomat who heads an international monitoring force
gained commitments from both sides for a temporary truce as
darkness fell late Sunday, in order to evacuate wounded. William
Walker voiced hope the ``sporadic fighting'' can be contained
without again engulfing the province in full-scale war.
	   But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb troops and
armor remained entrenched in their standoff near the northern town
of Podujevo, and there was no indication the worst outbreak of
fighting in months was over.
	   Sunday's at-times fierce clash put more pressure on an already
shaky truce that has held through the late fall and winter across
the secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   The reported death toll from the Serb crackdown that began last
Thursday reached 10, all ethnic Albanians, over the weekend with
the reported discovery of another body late Saturday night. Five
people were reported wounded Sunday _ four Serbs and an Albanian
rebel.
	   As many as 10,000 civilians, mostly Albanians, have fled the
fighting and many remained in nearby woods in sub-freezing
temperatures Sunday, according to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center.
	   After three days of intermittent clashes near the KLA stronghold
of Lapastica, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, the
ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire Sunday morning in
violation of a truce made with verifiers the previous night.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, said they acted to protect and evacuate
the fast-declining number of Serb civilians in the area and to
remove the body of a 65-year-old farmer whom the rebels killed
Saturday.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica. At
least one Yugoslav Army tank was involved in the action along with
numerous police armored personnel carriers, while the rebels fought
back with machine guns and grenades.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded, two seriously, in neighboring
Velika Reka after being ``ambushed'' by rebels when they tried to
rescue a wounded villager, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   One international verifier at the scene who declined to be named
characterized Sunday's developments as ``serious fighting.''
	   But Walker, whose force is gradually building toward 2,000
unarmed verifiers under the auspices of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, denied the province is
inevitably slipping back into war.
	   ``It didn't actually break out into all-out fighting,'' he said,
adding that both sides were being ``relatively cautious'' and not
using full firepower.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity one with the other in terms of getting the
wounded out,'' the diplomat told CNN after the fighting calmed.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the OSCE-led peace mission, said
the verifiers mediated the evacuation of two wounded Serbs and one
ethnic Albanian.
	   A convoy containing some of the Serb armored vehicles left
Obranca Sunday afternoon bearing the coffin of the killed farmer,
Milovan Radojevic, who was buried hurriedly in Podujevo. The police
fired on the rebels for much of the day from trenches behind his
house.
	   One of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly ethnic
Albanian village, he was shot after he and his family opened fire
on the KLA, according to the rebels.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina said Radojevic's death was
``another crime committed by Albanian terrorists whose aim is to
make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   ``State authorities are prepared to deal with all those
jeopardizing the territorial integrity of our country,'' Zoran
Andjelkovic said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region. It said Serb police
were stationed on Podujevo rooftops as many of the handful of
remaining Serbs left.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, and some 300,000 were driven from their homes.

	   LINZ, Austria (AP) -- Fire heavily damaged a major warehouse and
distribution center of the appliance company Technik-Quelle, and
officials Sunday estimated losses at 200 million schillings, or
about dlrs 17 million.
	   The cause of the fire, which was extinguished Sunday after 17
hours, was undetermined, according to the Austria Press Agency.
	   But the blaze severely damaged the main warehouse and
distribution center for the chain's Austrian operation of the
German-owned company. About 80 firemen and 23 firetrucks battled
the blaze in the city's Danube River harbor area.
	   The firm retails household supplies and appliances.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A natural gas pipeline exploded Sunday
in a rural hamlet in northern Colombia killing at least 12 people
and injuring 58 others, authorities said
	   Officials had not determined the cause of the morning blast, and
they did not appear to be blaming leftist guerrillas who frequently
sabotage oil pipelines.
	   The deadly explosion occurred at 9:30 a.m. in Arroyo de Piedra,
a village in Atlantico State roughly 400 miles (680 kilometers)
north of Bogota.
	   State health officials said nine people were killed immediately
and three died later in nearby hospitals. Three of the dead and six
of the wounded were children, they said.
	   ``The explosion was so large it sent rocks flying and brought
down power and telephone lines. ... The nearby houses caught fire
and their inhabitants have lost nearly everything, '' Rafael
Bohorquez, health secretary in the nearby town of Sabana Larga,
said in a radio interview.
	   At least 50 homes were destroyed, Governor Rodolfo Espinosa told
reporters during a visit to Arroyo de Piedra.
	   Police said the gas was turned off immediately after the blast
and the fire brought quickly under control.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Size does matter _ at least as far as
Colombian AIDS activists are concerned.
	   The activists paraded an enormous inflated condom through the
streets of the country's third largest city Sunday hoping to draw
attention to the threat of AIDS.
	   ``The idea is for people to realize that the disease exists,
that it's here, and that it represents a far greater threat than
the condom we're displaying,'' Dr. John Jairo Palacio told
reporters.
	   The mock prophylactic, which weighed roughly three thousand
pounds (1,500 kilograms), stretched over a half-mile (one
kilometer) down a holiday street fair in Cali, a city of two
million inhabitants.
	   Dozens of police escorted the giant birth control device,
guarding against possible punctures.
	   The huge plastic condom was the idea of doctors specializing in
sexually-transmitted diseases at the Santiago de Cali University
and workers from drug rehabilitation programs.
	   Palacio said the condom took two months to build at a cost dlrs
13,000, and was paid for by the university and a condom
manufacturer.
	   The Health Ministry reported 170,000 people have tested positive
for AIDS in Colombia, whose population is about 40 million. The
number of afflicted persons could increase to 190,000 by the year
2000 unless condom use increases, the Ministry has said.

U.N. calls for 48-hour cease-fire to probe plane crash in Angola

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan state radio blamed UNITA rebels
for shooting down a U.N.-chartered plane carrying 14 people while
the international organization Sunday called for a 48-hour
cease-fire to allow a search for survivors.
	   RNA radio said the C-130 aircraft was shot down Saturday by
UNITA troops battling the government army in the Huambo area, about
500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda. UNITA
has neither confirmed nor denied the accusation.
	   In Luanda, U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said the aircraft was
painted with the U.N. colors, and that both sides were informed of
the flight's schedule before takeoff.
	   The 10 passengers included three Angolans, two Russians, an
Australian, one Egyptian, one Cameroonian, a Zambian and a
Namibian.
	   Eight were members of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola and
two were employed by a private communications company, Dinacom,
which works with the United Nations, Toure said.
	   The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a Bolivian
and a Filipino.
	   Despite the radio claim, Toure said the United Nations had no
immediate information as to the cause of the crash. He cited
government sources in the central highland city of Huambo as saying
they had seen a plane go down in flames shortly after takeoff from
there and that it had crashed 25 miles (40 kilometers) away in Vila
Nova.
	   Toure said neither side had responded to the call for a halt in
the fighting.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa cited UNITA Secretary-General
Paulo Lukamba Gato as saying he knew the plane had crashed in a
rebel-held area, but that he had not yet spoken to UNITA rebels
there.
	   Given the resumption of fighting this month, ``No one should be
flying those areas,'' Lusa quoted Gato as saying.
	   He admitted UNITA rebels had shot down a government plane Dec.
14, just north of another central highland city, Kuito. All ten
people on board died.
	   Kuito and Huambo, which lie some 130 kilometers (80 miles)
apart, have served as a stage for heavy battles between UNITA and
the government since the beginning of December.
	   Some 200 people were killed and more than 400 wounded over the
past two weeks in Kuito, the private Radio Eclesia reported Sunday
from the rebel-targeted city.
	   The World Food Program reacted to Saturday's plane crash by
suspending food delivery flights throughout Angola until Wednesday,
pending more information on the crash, spokeswoman Brenda Barton
said from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
	   She said, however, that food distribution to approximately
400,000 Angolans displaced by the conflict would not be
interrupted.
	   The U.N. observers are in Angola to monitor a 1994 peace accord
that is severely threatened by latest fighting.
	   On news of the crash, Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to
the government and UNITA to enable observers go to the site and
assist in search and rescue operations. He also asked for their
cooperation in the investigation.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was headed for Saurimo, about
390 miles (625 kilometers) east of Huambo, Toure said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since 1975's independence from Portugal.
	   The 1994 accord called for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola, to disarm and
hand areas under its control to the government.
	   The Security Council last week accused rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Death comes easily in Sierra
Leone, where rebel fighters randomly kill and hack off limbs of
unarmed villagers and government forces reply with scorched-earth
bombing raids.
	   Combine that with disease and miserable poverty and the average
citizen of Sierra Leone has a life expectancy of just 34 years.
	   But while United Nations considers the West African country the
world's most unlivable, its churches, markets and discos are filled
with people trying to salvage normal lives from the bloody despair.
	   ``Even if there is a rebel fighting in my parlor room, I would
never live anywhere else,'' says James Fulah, a taxi driver who
spends his days negotiating the crowded streets of the capital of
Freetown.
	   A former British colony filled with lush forests, fertile fields
and bountiful diamond and mineral wealth, Sierra Leone should be a
land of plenty.
	   No one should go hungry here _ mangos, bananas and other fruit
grow like weeds and rice used to be an export crop. Yet many
villagers are unable to tend their fields for fear of rebel attacks
if they leave their homes. Food aid is brought in by the ton.
	   A surprise rebel advance in recent days has once again shaken
Sierra Leone, and insurgent commanders are vowing to storm the
capital.
	   Still, the relentless hardships have not dampened a lively
national spirit. Flag-waving citizens eagerly turn up for rallies
staged by the elected government, which was restored after the
widely-reviled rebels and their military allies were deposed in
February.
	   Impoverished villagers generously give donations to the ragged
government-backed traditional militiamen who guard countless
villages and roadblocks throughout the country and are often the
only defense against rebel attack.
	   Unlike many other war-torn African countries, Sierra Leone has
managed to retain a veneer of normalcy amid the chaos. Water and
electricity services continue to operate _ albeit intermittently _
in most cities. Even during the worst of the fighting, stiff
English customs such as afternoon tea are diligently observed by
the educated class.
	   It is a country where gallows humor and macabre jokes have been
spawned by the coups, beheadings and rebel atrocities that mark
Sierra Leone's recent history.
	   Some would say Sierra Leone has little to laugh about.
	   For the past three years, the United Nations Development Program
has ranked Sierra Leone last among 174 countries assessed for their
quality of life _ a measure of income, education, life expectancy
and health care.
	   Up to a quarter of Sierra Leone's 4.7 million people have fled
their homes since the rebels were driven from the capital by a
Nigerian-led coalition force. Seeking revenge against the
government, which returned after 10 months in exile, the rebels
have randomly mutilated, raped and murdered thousands, witnesses
and aid workers say.
	   And although the government forces enjoy wide popularity, they
have on occasion indiscriminately bombarded civilians in
retaliatory raids against the rebels.
	   Partly as a result of the war, Sierra Leoneans are forced to
cope with a shattered health care system and a burgeoning AIDS
epidemic.
	   The people have a life expectancy of just 34 years and the
average person earns the equivalent of dlrs 171 a year.
	   The country's economy, formerly dependent on diamond and bauxite
mining, has been nearly destroyed. This year the government
reported a budget of less than dlrs 30 million.
	   ``There is no question about Sierra Leone being at the bottom of
the list in 1998,'' said New York-based UNDP analyst Gul Tanghe.
``There are many other countries with serious problems, but we
believe Sierra Leone is the worst.''
	   The suffering is obvious. People with limbs hacked off in a
rebel revenge campaign fill hospitals. In the eastern town of
Kenema, a children's home in a hut covered with plastic sheeting is
swollen with abandoned and orphaned youngsters, many of whom
watched their parents being killed.
	   The capital of Freetown, once a charming city of Victorian
cottages and shops, is now a decaying hulk filled with
bullet-scarred British architecture and bitter memories of a
painful colonial past.
	   The last seven years of fighting has prevented people from
rebuilding their homes and livelihoods. But the veneer of everyday
life continues.
	   Shops often open early and close late; and until Freetown's 10
p.m. curfew was imposed last week, candle-lit stalls lined dark
Freetown streets until after midnight, the smell of chili and fresh
fish wafting through the air.
	   Couples bump and grind on the city's crowded dance floors. At
curfew time, the proprietors lock the doors and those within party
until dawn.
	   On a typical Sunday, voices of exultation and praise boom from
the Flaming Bible Church _ one of Freetown's more than 100
Christian churches and Muslim mosques.
	   ``Feel the fire! The Holy Ghost fire!'' Rev. Freddy Abu Sidique
shouts during a sermon. His most popular services include lessons
on exorcising demons and ridding houses of ghosts.
	   ``Feel the joy! Increase your business! increase your wages!
Bring safety and protection to your family! Live and continue
living!'' Sidique says to a roar of approval.

Arab legislators condemn U.S.-British ``aggression'' against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting ending; legislators calling for end to
sanctions. CHANGES overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab legislators on Sunday strongly
condemned last week's U.S.-British military attacks on Iraq and
urged their governments to work for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
on Baghdad.
	   A statement at the end of a one-day meeting of the Arab
Parliamentary Union described the attacks as ``unjust U.S.-British
aggression'' on Iraq.
	   It was the first time since the 1991 Gulf War that a pan-Arab
body has given its full support to Iraq. Although the Arab
Parliamentary Union is not a decision-making body, but its
resolution could boost the position of Iraq, which has been in
isolation since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   It was unclear if any of the Arab governments would respond to
the recommendations.
	   The legislators called on the U.N. Security Council to ensure
that the attacks are not repeated and demanded financial
compensation for the Iraqi people who suffered because of the
attacks.
	   ``We call upon Arab governments to work for the lifting of the
embargo on Iraq and to put an end to the Iraqi people's
suffering,'' said the statement.
	   It called for the holding of an emergency Arab summit to support
Iraq and sending an Arab parliamentary delegation to Iraq to assess
the damage inflicted by the U.S.-British attacks.
	   The resolution appeared to endorse a draft resolution that Iraq
submitted earlier in the day urging Arab nations to ignore the
sanctions and demanding that all foreign troops be pulled out of
the Gulf.
	   The resolution was put before the legislators by a delegation
headed by Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as about 200
members of Jordanian political parties and unions held a sit-in to
demand an end to the sanctions.
	   Outside Amman's Royal Theater where the legislators were
meeting, the demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and waved
banner saying any aggression on Iraq amounts to an attack on the
entire Arab world.
	   Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq that ended Dec. 19
brought demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support of
Iraq, but until now all Arab governments have adhered to the trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.
	   After Jordan's Prince Hassan opened Sunday's emergency meeting,
urging solidarity with Iraq's people and a search for ways to end
their suffering, an Iraqi delegate shouted complaints that no
mention was made of the American-British aggression.
	   ``The Iraqi people do not need humanitarian aid,'' said Khalid
al-Douri. ``We are here to see the Arab nation unite in one stand,
condemn the aggression and call for the lifting of sanctions.''
	   Delegations from 16 of the Parliamentary Union's 19 member
states had arrived for the meeting's opening; eighteen had been
expected. Kuwait _ which has resisted all efforts to ease sanctions
on Iraq _ had announced it would not take part.
	   The United States and Britain have been the strongest advocates
of maintaining the sanctions, which limit Iraq's oil exports and
cannot be lifted until U.N. experts certify the county has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. and British officials said the attacks were aimed at
degrading the ability of President Saddam Hussein's government to
make prohibited weapons and at demanding the Iraq reverse its
pledge not to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   The Iraqi resolution submitted Sunday also calls on Arab
parliaments to demand foreign troops be pulled out of the Arab Gulf
states and that those states stop providing facilities and services
to foreign armies.
	   The United States has some 17,000 troops in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia
and Bahrain and on ships offshore. Britain also has troops and
warplanes in Kuwait and several ships in the Gulf.

Brazil `Suicide tribe' faces massive unemployment in remote state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian indigenous tribe known
for its occasional waves of suicides is facing massive unemployment
and increased internal conflict, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Some 4,000 members of the Guarani-Kaiowa tribe in Mato Grosso do
Sul, a remote bushlands state south of the Amazon jungle, are
likely to lose their jobs in the region's sugarcane fields next
year, said the daily Folha de Sao Paulo.
	   The tribal members will be fired if they continue to refuse to
register as legal workers. Guarani-Kaiowa leaders have advised the
tribe members not to legalize their status since that would end
costly commissions paid by sugar mill owners to labor agents and
tribal leaders.
	   ``The tragedy is that these people will have nothing to do and
will receive no income,'' Joao de Chagas Neto, manager of the
Debrasa sugar mill told the newspaper. ``Outside of the sugar
mills, nobody hires Indians.''
	   In the past dozen years, some 255 tribal members have committed
suicide. Anthropologists attribute the suicides to poverty, the
disintegration of families, alcoholism and forced acculturation in
the face of a westward push by white settlers.
	   The 27,000-strong tribe, one of the largest in Brazil, once
occupied 40 percent of Mato Grosso do Sul state, which covers an
area of 358,00 square kilometers (143,200 square miles). Today they
occupy just 1 percent of the state.

OSCE may reconsider Kosovo mission if violence continues, chief

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The fledgling international mission to
put 2,000 peace monitors in Kosovo will be re-evaluated if the
escalation of bloodshed in the Serbian province continues, a top
official said Sunday.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, blamed both warring sides and urged them to
pull back and engage in political negotiations. He accused the
Serbs of ``repressive actions'' and ethnic Albanian rebels of
``terrorist acts.''
	   The OSCE, headquartered in Vienna, currently has about 600
verifiers from its 54 member nations in Kosovo under the terms of a
U.S.-brokered October agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Geremek, who also is Poland's foreign minister, issued a
statement expressing deep concern over the renewed fighting of the
last four days and the breach of the fragile cease-fire.
	   ``Contrary to the October agreement and commitments, Serbian
forces have re-entered Kosovo and undertaken repressive actions,''
he said in Warsaw. ``At the same time terrorist acts have again
been committed by Kosovo Albanian military factions.
	   ``This spiral of violence puts in danger the perspective of a
peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo.''
	   He said he fully supports the efforts of U.S. diplomat William
Walker, the head of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, to remedy
the situation on the ground and emphasized that ``the safety of
this mission and its personnel should be safeguarded.''
	   ``If the bloodshed and violence escalate, the OSCE would have to
reconsider the forms of its activities in Kosovo in the context of
a broader involvement of the international community in the search
for a peaceful solution to the conflict,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting ending; legislators calling for end to
sanctions. CHANGES overline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab legislators on Sunday strongly
condemned last week's U.S.-British military attacks on Iraq and
urged their governments to work for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
on Baghdad.
	   A statement at the end of a one-day meeting of the Arab
Parliamentary Union described the attacks as ``unjust U.S.-British
aggression'' on Iraq.
	   It was the first time since the 1991 Gulf War that a pan-Arab
body has given its full support to Iraq. Although the Arab
Parliamentary Union is not a decision-making body, its resolution
could boost the position of Iraq, which has been in isolation since
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   It was unclear if any of the Arab governments would respond to
the recommendations.
	   The legislators called on the U.N. Security Council to ensure
that the attacks are not repeated and demanded financial
compensation for the Iraqi people who suffered because of the
attacks.
	   ``We call upon Arab governments to work for the lifting of the
embargo on Iraq and to put an end to the Iraqi people's
suffering,'' said the statement.
	   It called for an emergency Arab summit to support Iraq and for
sending an Arab parliamentary delegation to Iraq to assess the
damage inflicted by the U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   The resolution appeared to endorse a draft resolution that Iraq
submitted earlier in the day urging Arab nations to ignore the
sanctions and demanding that all foreign troops be pulled out of
the Gulf.
	   The resolution was put before the legislators by a delegation
headed by Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as about 200
members of Jordanian political parties and unions held a sit-in to
demand an end to the sanctions.
	   Outside Amman's Royal Theater, where the legislators were
meeting, the demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and waved
a banner saying any aggression on Iraq amounts to an attack on the
entire Arab world.
	   Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes that ended Dec. 19 brought
demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support of Iraq, but
all Arab governments have adhered to the trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.
	   After Jordan's Prince Hassan opened Sunday's emergency meeting,
urging solidarity with Iraq's people and a search for ways to end
their suffering, an Iraqi delegate shouted complaints that no
mention was made of the American-British aggression.
	   ``The Iraqi people do not need humanitarian aid,'' said Khalid
al-Douri. ``We are here to see the Arab nation unite in one stand,
condemn the aggression and call for the lifting of sanctions.''
	   Delegations from 16 of the Parliamentary Union's 19 member
states had arrived for the meeting's opening; eighteen had been
expected. Kuwait _ which has resisted all efforts to ease sanctions
on Iraq _ had announced it would not take part.

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police using artillery,
mortars and other heavy weapons battled ethnic Albanian rebels for
hours Sunday in a fourth straight day of combat in the snowy fields
of northern Kosovo.
	   The U.S. diplomat who heads an international monitoring force
gained commitments from both sides for a temporary truce as
darkness fell late Sunday, in order to evacuate wounded. William
Walker voiced hope the ``sporadic fighting'' can be contained
without again engulfing the province in full-scale war.
	   But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb troops and
armor remained entrenched in their standoff near the northern town
of Podujevo, and there was no indication the worst outbreak of
fighting in months was over.
	   Sunday's at-times fierce clash put more pressure on an already
shaky truce that has held through the late fall and winter across
the secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   The reported death toll from the Serb crackdown that began last
Thursday reached 10, all ethnic Albanians, over the weekend with
the reported discovery of another body late Saturday night. Five
people were reported wounded Sunday _ four Serbs and an Albanian
rebel.
	   As many as 10,000 civilians, mostly Albanians, have fled the
fighting and many remained in nearby woods in sub-freezing
temperatures Sunday, according to the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center.
	   After three days of intermittent clashes near the KLA stronghold
of Lapastica, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, the
ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire Sunday morning in
violation of a truce made with verifiers the previous night.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, said they acted to protect and evacuate
the fast-declining number of Serb civilians in the area and to
remove the body of a 65-year-old farmer whom the rebels killed
Saturday.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica. At
least one Yugoslav Army tank was involved in the action along with
numerous police armored personnel carriers, while the rebels fought
back with machine guns and grenades.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded, two seriously, in neighboring
Velika Reka after being ``ambushed'' by rebels when they tried to
rescue a wounded villager, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   One international verifier at the scene characterized Sunday's
developments as ``serious fighting.'' And chairman Bronislaw
Geremek of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which oversees the force of unarmed verifiers, said the mission
will be re-evaluated ``if the bloodshed and violence escalate.''
	   But Walker emphasized that the scope of Sunday's clash was
limited and denied the province is inevitably slipping back into
war.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq increased the pressure in its
confrontation with the United Nations Sunday, saying it would
reject an extension of a U.N.-monitored program that feeds
civilians and order aid monitors to leave.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh did not say when
Baghdad would ask the U.N. staff to depart. The latest phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal expires at the end of April.
	   The tough talk came only a day after Iraq said it would fire on
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling a no-fly zone imposed after
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   It also come shortly before a group of Arab legislators meeting
in Amman, Jordan strongly condemned last week's U.S.-British
attacks as ``unjust aggression'' on Iraq. They also called on their
governments to work on the lifting of the U.N. trade embargo which
has crippled the country's economy.
	   The oil-for-food deal brings crucial supplies such as flour,
lentils, rice sugar and medicine to families suffering under
eight-years of U.N. sanctions. It is unlikely that Iraq would
cancel the deal without an easing of the embargo.
	   Iraq, however, has long feared that the humanitarian program is
eroding support for an easing of the sanctions on humanitarian
grounds.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands the
lifting of sanctions,'' Saleh said. ``This means the ouster of U.N.
teams which supervise it.''
	   About 400 U.N. workers monitor the oil-for-food deal to ensure
that the Iraqi government does not divert any of the money or aid
and use it for its own purposes. The deal began in December 1996.
	   The latest six month phase allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion
in oil to buy needed supplies. About 3 percent of that money is
used to pay the humanitarian aid monitors, the expenses needed to
administer the program and to fund the work of weapons inspectors
in Iraq. Another 30 percent goes to compensate victims of Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War.
	   ``Iraq is bearing huge expenses which it pays to these (U.N.)
personnel and they do nothing apart from verifying that the imports
have reached Iraqi ports,'' Saleh said in an interview with
Associated Press Television News.
	   The U.N. embargo, which was imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors verify that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The United States and Britain began four days of punishing
airstrikes on Dec. 16 after the weapons inspectors released a
report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the U.N. arms monitors to resume
their work.
	   Iraqi officials said that anti-aircraft gunners were prepared to
open fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``Violating Iraqi airspace is an aggression,'' Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan told APTN Sunday.
	   ``The so-called farce of no-fly zones must end,'' he said. ``The
so-called no-fly zones only exist in the British and American
imagination.''
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the areas.
	   The United States and Britain have said that they will continue
to enforce the zones.
	   ``Our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel threatened at
any time,'' National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley said
in Washington.
	   Iraq said that its anti-aircraft gunners drove off an attack
Saturday by ``enemy'' warplanes.
	   Officials in Washington and London said that pilots patrolling
the southern no-fly zone saw anti-aircraft fire in the distance,
but were in no danger.
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in
1991-92 to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south.

	   ``It didn't actually break out into all-out fighting,'' he said,
adding that both sides were being ``relatively cautious'' and not
using full firepower.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity one with the other in terms of getting the
wounded out,'' the diplomat told CNN after the fighting calmed.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the OSCE-led peace mission, said
the verifiers mediated the evacuation of two wounded Serbs and one
ethnic Albanian.
	   A convoy containing some of the Serb armored vehicles left
Obranca Sunday afternoon bearing the coffin of the killed farmer,
Milovan Radojevic, who was buried hurriedly in Podujevo. One of the
last Serb civilians in the predominantly ethnic Albanian village,
he was shot after he and his family opened fire on the KLA,
according to the rebels.
	   The Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb police are passing
out weapons to Serb civilians in the region. It said Serb police
were stationed on Podujevo rooftops as many of the handful of
remaining Serbs left.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels last
February, and some 300,000 were driven from their homes.

Iraq threatening to expel U.N. humanitarian aid workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi trade minister saying Iraq prepared to
expel U.N. humanitarian aid workers, CHANGES overline, byline &QL;

 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq increased the pressure in its
confrontation with the United Nations on Sunday, saying it would
reject an extension of a U.N.-monitored program that feeds
civilians and would order aid monitors to leave.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh did not say when
Baghdad would ask the U.N. staff to depart. The latest phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal expires at the end of April.
	   The tough talk came only a day after Iraq said it would fire on
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling a no-fly zone imposed after
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   It also come shortly before a group of Arab legislators meeting
in Amman, Jordan strongly condemned last week's U.S.-British
attacks as ``unjust aggression'' on Iraq. They also called on their
governments to work on the lifting of the U.N. trade embargo, which
has crippled the country's economy.
	   The oil-for-food deal brings crucial supplies such as flour,
lentils, rice sugar and medicine to families suffering under
eight-years of U.N. sanctions. It is unlikely that Iraq would
cancel the deal without an easing of the embargo.
	   Iraq, however, has long feared that the humanitarian program is
eroding support for an easing of the sanctions on humanitarian
grounds.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands the
lifting of sanctions,'' Saleh said. ``This means the ouster of U.N.
teams which supervise it.''
	   About 400 U.N. workers monitor the oil-for-food deal to ensure
that the Iraqi government does not divert any of the money or aid
and use it for its own purposes. The deal began in December 1996.
	   The latest six month phase allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion
in oil to buy needed supplies. About 3 percent of that money is
used to pay the humanitarian aid monitors, the expenses needed to
administer the program and to fund the work of weapons inspectors
in Iraq. Another 30 percent goes to compensate victims of Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War.
	   ``Iraq is bearing huge expenses which it pays to these (U.N.)
personnel and they do nothing apart from verifying that the imports
have reached Iraqi ports,'' Saleh said in an interview with
Associated Press Television News.
	   The U.N. embargo, which was imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors verify that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The United States and Britain began four days of punishing
airstrikes on Dec. 16 after the weapons inspectors released a
report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the U.N. arms monitors to resume
inspections.
	   Iraqi officials said that anti-aircraft gunners were prepared to
open fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq.
	   ``Violating Iraqi airspace is an aggression,'' Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan told APTN Sunday.
	   ``The so-called farce of no-fly zones must end,'' he said. ``The
so-called no-fly zones only exist in the British and American
imagination.''
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally
confronted aircraft flying in the areas.
	   The United States and Britain have said that they will continue
to enforce the zones.
	   ``Our pilots can act in self-defense if they feel threatened at
any time,'' National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley said
in Washington.
	   Iraq said that its anti-aircraft gunners drove off an attack
Saturday by ``enemy'' warplanes.
	   Officials in Washington and London said that pilots patrolling
the southern no-fly zone saw anti-aircraft fire in the distance,
but were in no danger.
	   The no-fly zones were established in 1991-92 to halt air attacks
against Kurdish rebels in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels in the
south.

OSCE may reconsider Kosovo mission if violence continues, chief
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The fledgling international effort to put
2,000 peace monitors in Kosovo will be re-evaluated if the
escalation of bloodshed in the Serbian province continues, a top
official said Sunday.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, blamed both warring sides and urged them to
pull back and engage in political negotiations. He accused the
Serbs of ``repressive actions'' and ethnic Albanian rebels of
``terrorist acts.''
	   The OSCE, headquartered in Vienna, currently has about 600
verifiers from its 54 member nations in Kosovo under the terms of a
U.S.-brokered October agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Geremek, who also is Poland's foreign minister, issued a
statement expressing deep concern over the renewed fighting of the
last four days and the breach of the fragile cease-fire.
	   ``Contrary to the October agreement and commitments, Serbian
forces have re-entered Kosovo and undertaken repressive actions,''
he said in Warsaw. ``At the same time terrorist acts have again
been committed by Kosovo Albanian military factions.
	   ``This spiral of violence puts in danger the perspective of a
peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   ``If the bloodshed and violence escalate, the OSCE would have to
reconsider the forms of its activities in Kosovo,'' he said.

More missing in heavy seas during race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS with more sailors missing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A major search involving Australia's
navy continued Monday for a crewman swept overboard from one yacht
and for the nine-member crew of another boat missing in huge seas
during the Sydney to Hobart race.
	   Radio reports, unconfirmed by race officials, said that up to 20
sailors may be missing.
	   The lone sailor was swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat
rolled in wild seas in Bass Strait on Sunday night.
	   The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has alerted all
shipping in the Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the
remnants of the 115-boat fleet.
	   An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot Sydney
yacht had been rolled in the heavy seas near Gabo Island, about 450
kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne, with several crewmen
being injured including the unidentified man lost overboard.
Another crewman has a broken leg.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait.
	   The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and
heat-seeking equipment to search the area.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said Monday morning that grave fears
were held for the safety of the unidentified man swept off Sword of
Orion.
	   Gray said he was also ``extremely concerned'' for the crew
aboard Winston Churchill which had been out of contact for about 12
hours.
	   He said that three people had been evacuated from Sword of Orion
overnight by a Sea King helicopter. Six crew remained on board, two
in a serious condition.
	   He said a long-range aircraft has been directed to the region to
assist the search.
	   Gray said four distress beacons had been received during the
night but had yet to be identified. The navy frigate HMAS Newcastle
departed during the night and would join the search by Monday
afternoon, Gray said.
	   Earlier, as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused
havoc to the fleet, several rescues took place.
	   A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the
Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical
miles south of Gabo Island.
	   John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40
minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to
safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large
swells to secure Campbell.
	   The Victorian police Air Wing used an infra-red night vision
system to find Campbell.
	   A helicopter lifted the entire crew of 12 from the dismasted VC
Offshore Stand Aside, a 40-foot yacht from Adelaide.
	   Several crew members were injured in the dismasting, with one
losing several fingers and another suffering head injuries.
	   A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the
630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering
injuries to crew.
	   Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara is narrowly ahead of last
year's line winner Brindabella.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile
race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by
German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. djp)

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police using artillery,
mortars and other heavy weapons battled ethnic Albanian rebels for
hours Sunday in a fourth straight day of combat in the snowy fields
of northern Kosovo.
	   The U.S. diplomat who heads an international monitoring force
gained commitments from both sides for a temporary truce as
darkness fell late Sunday, in order to evacuate wounded. William
Walker voiced hope the ``sporadic fighting'' can be contained
without again engulfing the province in full-scale war.
	   But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb troops and
armor remained entrenched in their standoff near the northern town
of Podujevo, and there was no indication the worst outbreak of
fighting in months was over.
	   Sunday's at-times fierce clash put more pressure on an already
shaky truce that has held through the late fall and winter across
the secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   The reported death toll from the Serb crackdown that began last
Thursday reached 10, all ethnic Albanians, with the discovery of
another body. Five people were reported wounded Sunday _ four Serbs
and an Albanian rebel.
	   Elsewhere in Kosovo, Serb sources claimed three ``terrorists''
in KLA uniforms shot dead three Gypsy or Roma men Sunday night
outside the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northwest of Pristina. The Serb-run Media Center said police
blocked off the suburb and were searching for the killers. Further
details were not available.

 &UR; Netanyahu, confident of Likud backing, lashes out at opposition &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES throughout with Likud central committee meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV (AP) _ Emerging from a week in the wilderness, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back on familiar ground Sunday _
launching an elections campaign.
	   Basking in the adoration of his Likud party faithful and lashing
out at the opposition, Netanyahu appeared confident and cheerful _
a stark contrast to his agonized equivocation last week as
parliamentary support for his security policies collapsed,
precipitating elections likely to take place by June.
	   Netanyahu was addressing a meeting of the Likud central
committee called to determine when internal elections for the
party's leadership and for its list of parliamentary candidates
should take place.
	   The dates were a foregone conclusion _ Jan. 25 for party leader
and Feb. 8 for the Knesset candidates _ but the meeting was a
useful vehicle for Netanyahu to demonstrate that he still had a
firm grip on the party machine.
	   To cries of ``Bibi, King of Israel,'' Netanyahu all but ignored
internal challengers, instead looking ahead to elections likely to
take place by June.
	   He accused the Labor Party of working with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to ensure Netanyahu's defeat.
	   ``We're working for a secure peace, but they say no,'' he said
of the opposition Labor party. ``We'll go to elections, and we'll
win in elections.''
	   Netanyahu agreed to early elections last week after parliament
rejected his peace policies.
	   Hard-liners were furious with Netanyahu for agreeing to further
territorial concessions to the Palestinians at U.S. brokered peace
talks at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Doves in the opposition were angry with Netanyahu for freezing
the Wye process last month in hopes of extracting further
concessions from the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's last-minute offer during last week's Knesset debate
to set up a national unity government _ an about-face _ was seen as
blatant opportunism and provoked loud laughter from both opposition
and coalition legislators.
	   Before making the offer, he appeared gripped by confusion _
approaching the podium to speak, then suddenly backing away.
	   His apparent weakness unleashed a week of furious speculation
that he might not survive even as a leader of the Likud.
	   That ended Sunday, when Netanyahu's only serious threat within
the Likud dropped out of the race for the party's candidacy for
early elections.
	   Mayor Ehud Olmert, the popular mayor of Jerusalem, made the
decision to bow out after failing to enlist the support of Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The only remaining challenger for the Likud leadership is Uzi
Landau, 55, the hard-line chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   Landau is not likely to win, and has indicated that he knows
that _ and is hoping to use his bid to force Netanyahu to make
hard-line pledges during an internal campaign. That would make it
harder for Netanyahu to sound conciliatory toward the Palestinians
during a general elections campaign.
	   Landau told Israel television his campaign would force the party
to become ``a Likud with principles, a Likud of backbone,''.
	   His internal support ensured, a smiling, relaxed Netanyahu took
the podium Sunday with his cabinet on stage.
	   Many of them remained grim-faced, nervously tapping the table.
	   Mordechai refused the opportunity to speak. He is still
entertaining offers from the Labor party and a new centrist party,
furious that Netanyahu reportedly offered the defense ministry to a
popular general.
	   Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister, refused to
speak to reporters, and rushed out of party headquarters after the
meeting. Israel radio reported that she is close to leaving the
Likud to join a centrist party headed by a former Netanyahu finance
minister, Dan Meridor.
	   Meridor _ and other Likud defectors _ have said that their
problem with Netanyahu is less with his policies and more with his
personality. They accuse him of being obsessed with survival at all
cost.
	   Benny Begin, the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
and one of the Likud's most staunchly right-wing members, has
decided to leave the party and run as prime minister, heading a new
rightist party.
	   Speaking to Israel television, Meridor described Netanyahu's 2
1/2 years as prime minister as ``the collapse of leadership and
political culture.''
	   One of Netanyahu's soldiers within the Likud, Uzi Cohen, spoke
last week of setting up a ``hit list'' of Netanyahu's opponents and
promised to prevent them from getting reelected.
	   Cohen later said he regretted using violent language, but some
veteran party members say that Netanyahu has changed the tone of
the party for good.
	   ``This is not the same political culture,'' said Dov Milman, a
founder of the party, contemplating the party members who jeered
the mention of Meridor. ``These are our people, that's what there
is, there's no choice.''
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak also accused Netanyahu of dirty
politics.
	   ``What we heard today was not a campaign speech,'' he said of
Netanyahu's accusations of Labor party collusion with Arafat. ``It
was incitement.''

hours Sunday in a fourth straight day of combat in the snowy fields
of northern Kosovo.
	   The U.S. diplomat who heads an international monitoring force
gained commitments from both sides for a temporary truce as
darkness fell late Sunday, in order to evacuate wounded. William
Walker voiced hope the ``sporadic fighting'' can be contained
without again engulfing the province in full-scale war.
	   But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb troops and
armor remained entrenched in their standoff near the northern town
of Podujevo, and there was no indication the worst outbreak of
fighting in months was over.
	   Sunday's at times fierce clash put more pressure on an already
shaky truce that has held through the late fall and winter across
the secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   The reported death toll from the Serb crackdown that began last
Thursday reached 10, all ethnic Albanians, with the discovery of
another body. Five people were reported wounded Sunday _ four Serbs
and an Albanian rebel.
	   Elsewhere in Kosovo, Serb sources claimed three ``terrorists''
in KLA uniforms shot dead three Gypsy or Roma men Sunday night
outside the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northwest of Pristina. The Serb-run Media Center said police
blocked off the suburb and were searching for the killers. Further
details were not available.

Lukashenko says foreign ambassadors to return to Minsk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
predicted Sunday that foreign ambassadors would return to Belarus
in early January, six months after they left in a dispute over
housing.
	   Lukashenko sounded unusually conciliatory in a two-hour-long,
nationally televised speech that mostly focused on Belarus' new
partnership with Russia. Discussing the diplomatic dispute, he said
both sides had made concessions in settling their differences over
the ambassadorial residences.
	   ``It is a good lesson both for Belarus and for the Western
ambassadors,'' he said. ``Before acting toughly and sharply, we
should coordinate our steps, we should hold more consultations. It
will be like this in the future.''
	   Earlier this year, Lukashenko's government said it needed to
repair the plumbing and sewage system in the Drozdy diplomatic
compound on the outskirts of the capital, Minsk, and the
ambassadors had to move.
	   The United States and most European countries recalled their
ambassadors in June to protest the move. They said it violated the
Vienna convention, which states that ambassadors' residences, like
embassy buildings, are considered the territory of their nations.
	   Earlier this month, the European Union and Belarus signed an
agreement under which the EU nations will begin looking for new
homes for their ambassadors and Belarus will pay
as-yet-undetermined sums in compensation.
	   Lukashenko predicted that the ambassadors would return by Jan.
13, the Orthodox New Year.
	   He said little new about the agreement with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, under which the leaders will take steps toward
merging the two former Soviet republics.
	   Lukashenko insisted that the two countries ``will remain
sovereign states,'' but that they would share a parliament and
would jointly conduct foreign policy, defense policy and customs
services.
	   He said economic privatization should be carried out
independently by each state. Belarus has privatized very little of
its economy, whereas Russia has put much of its economy in private
hands.

Egypt opposes does not support Saddam, Mubarak says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In one of his strongest remarks, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for
provoking the U.S.-British attacks against Iraq, a newspaper
reported.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying in its early Monday
edition.
	   Mubarak said he opposed last week's U.S.-British airstrikes
against Iraq, but that Saddam was responsible for creating a
situation that led to the attacks.
	   ``It's the Iraqi people who will have to pay for this attack,''
Mubarak said.
	   Egypt was part of the U.S.-led coalition that forced Iraq's
invading troops out of Kuwait in 1991.
	   Shortly after the war, Mubarak made scathing remarks against
Saddam, berating him for ignoring pleas from the Arab world to
withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
	   But his anti-Saddam rhetorics have eased as Iraq endures
an-eight year crippling U.N. sanctions. He even resumed contact
with the Iraqi regime, receiving Iraqi envoys in an attempt to
avert a showdown between Iraq and the United States.
	   Last week's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq prompted a
burst of protests across the Arab world, including Egypt. Mubarak
called for an ``immediate halt'' to the strikes.
	   In a meeting in Amman, Jordan, Sunday, legislators from 16 Arab
countries, including Egypt, strongly condemned the airstrikes
against Iraq and called on their governments to lift the sanctions
that were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Angolan radio blames rebels for crash of U.N. plane

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan state radio blamed UNITA rebels
for shooting down a U.N. chartered plane carrying 14 people, a U.N.
official in Luanda said Sunday.
	   The United Nations called for a 48-hour cease-fire to allow a
search for any survivors of Saturday's crash, said spokesman
Hamadoun Toure.
	   He said that despite the radio report, the United Nations had no
immediate information about the cause of the crash. He said neither
rebels nor the government had responded to the call for a halt in
the fighting.
	   According to Toure, RNA radio said the C-130 aircraft was shot
down by UNITA troops battling the army in the Huambo area, about
500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda. UNITA
has neither confirmed nor denied the accusation.
	   Toure said the aircraft was painted with the U.N. colors, and
that both sides were informed of the flight's schedule before
takeoff.
	   The 10 passengers included three Angolans, two Russians, an
Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and a Namibian.
The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a Bolivian and
a Filipino.
	   Eight passengers were members of the U.N. Observer Mission in
Angola, which is montioring a 1994 peace accord between the rebels
and the government, and two were employed by a private
communications company, Dinacom, which works with the United
Nations, Toure said.
	   The peace accord is severely threatened by the latest fighting.
	   Toure said government sources in Huambo in the central highlands
said they saw a plane go down in flames shortly after takeoff. It
crashed 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in Vila Nova, the sources
told Toure.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa cited UNITA Secretary-General
Paulo Lukamba Gato as saying he knew the plane had crashed in a
rebel-held area, but that he had not yet spoken to UNITA rebels
there.
	   Given the resumption of fighting this month, ``No one should be
flying in those areas,'' Lusa quoted Gato as saying.
	   He admitted UNITA rebels had shot down a government plane Dec.
14, just north of another central highland city, Kuito. All ten
people on board died.
	   Kuito and Huambo, which lie some 130 kilometers (80 miles)
apart, have served as a stage for heavy battles between UNITA and
the government since the beginning of the month.
	   Some 200 people were killed and more than 400 wounded over the
past two weeks in Kuito, the private Radio Eclesia reported Sunday
from the city.
	   The World Food Program reacted to Saturday's plane crash by
suspending food delivery flights throughout Angola until Wednesday,
pending more information on the crash, spokeswoman Brenda Barton
said from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
	   She said, however, that food distribution to approximately
400,000 Angolans displaced by the conflict would not be
interrupted.
	   On news of the crash, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed
to the government and UNITA to enable observers to go to the site
and assist in search and rescue operations. He also asked for their
cooperation in the investigation.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was headed for Saurimo, about
625 kilometers (390 miles) east of Huambo, Toure said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The 1994 accord called for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence for Angola, to disarm and
hand areas under its control to the government.
	   The Security Council last week accused rebel leaders of
undermining the peace process and demanded an immediate end to the
fighting.

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police using artillery,
mortars and other heavy weapons battled ethnic Albanian rebels for
hours Sunday in a fourth straight day of combat in the snowy fields
of northern Kosovo.
	   The U.S. diplomat who heads an international monitoring force
gained commitments from both sides for a temporary truce as
darkness fell late Sunday, in order to evacuate wounded. William
Walker voiced hope the ``sporadic fighting'' can be contained
without again engulfing the province in full-scale war.
	   But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb troops and
armor remained entrenched in their standoff near the northern town
of Podujevo, and there was no indication the worst outbreak of
fighting in months was over.
	   Sunday's at-times fierce clash put more pressure on an already
shaky truce that has held through the late fall and winter across
the secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   The reported death toll from the Serb crackdown that began last
Thursday reached 10, all ethnic Albanians, with the discovery of
another body. Five people were reported wounded Sunday _ four Serbs
and an Albanian rebel.
	   Elsewhere in Kosovo, Serb sources claimed that ``terrorists'' in
KLA uniforms shot dead three Roma men, also known as Gypsies,
outside the town of Kosovska Mitrovica Sunday night. The Serb-run
Media Center said police blocked off the suburb, which is 40
kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina, and were searching for
the killers.
	   As many as 10,000 civilians, mostly Albanians, have fled the
fighting and many remained in nearby woods in subfreezing
temperatures Sunday.
	   After three days of intermittent clashes near the KLA stronghold
of Lapastica, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, the
ethnic Albanians accused police of opening fire Sunday morning in
violation of a truce made with verifiers the previous night.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, said they acted to protect and evacuate
the fast-declining number of Serb civilians in the area and to
remove the body of a 65-year-old farmer whom the rebels killed
Saturday.
	   Police wearing flak jackets and helmets fired from trenches at
the outskirts of Obranca village toward neighboring Lapastica. At
least one Yugoslav Army tank was involved in the action along with
numerous police armored personnel carriers, while the rebels fought
back with machine guns and grenades.
	   Three Serb policemen were wounded, two seriously, in neighboring
Velika Reka after being ``ambushed'' by rebels when they tried to
rescue a wounded villager, the Serb-run Media Center reported.
	   One international verifier at the scene characterized Sunday's
developments as ``serious fighting.'' And chairman Bronislaw
Geremek of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which oversees the force of unarmed verifiers, said the mission
will be re-evaluated ``if the bloodshed and violence escalate.''
	   But Walker emphasized that the scope of Sunday's clash was
limited and denied the province is inevitably slipping back into
war.
	   ``It didn't actually break out into all-out fighting,'' he said,
adding that both sides were being ``relatively cautious'' and not
using full firepower.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity one with the other in terms of getting the
wounded out,'' the diplomat told CNN after the fighting calmed.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the OSCE-led peace mission, said
the verifiers mediated the evacuation of two wounded Serbs and one
ethnic Albanian.
	   A convoy containing some of the Serb armored vehicles left
Obranca Sunday afternoon bearing the coffin of the killed farmer,
Milovan Radojevic, who was buried hurriedly in Podujevo. The police
fired on the rebels for much of the day from trenches behind his
house.
	   One of the last Serb civilians in the predominantly ethnic
Albanian village, he was shot after he and his family opened fire
on the KLA, according to the rebels.
	   The top Serb official in Pristina, Zoran Andjelkovic, said
Radojevic's death was ``another crime committed by Albanian
terrorists whose aim is to make Kosovo ethnically'' all-Albanian.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb
police are passing out weapons to Serb civilians in the region. It
said Serb police were stationed on Podujevo rooftops as many of the
handful of remaining Serbs left.

Russian nationalist goes literary: `The A to Z of Sex'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Give this much to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the bad
boy of Russian politics: He has an impeccable sense of timing.
	   As the year of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky drew near its
close, Zhirinovsky took over a Moscow nightclub Sunday to unveil
his new book: ``The A to Z of Sex.''
	   Zhirinovsky, an extreme nationalist with a taste for the
outrageous, was once considered a potentially strong candidate for
president of Russia. Today, he is better known for the sort of
political burlesque that he demonstrated on the packed floor of
``Dolls'' nightclub.
	   ``Man needs something more in life,'' Zhirinovsky said,
explaining how he came to write about sex. ``Man doesn't live for
the factory whistle, nor for the machine gun fire, nor for stocks
and shares, nor for revolution and reform. ... It's our nature.''
	   Zhirinovsky's new book, written with sexologist Vladimir
Yurovitsky, combines advice on sex with nationalist political
ruminations. Zhirinovsky heads the Liberal Democratic party, which
supports a return to Russia's great power status and presents a
staunchly anti-Western attitude.
	   Speaking of the book, his foreign affairs spokesman, Alexander
Mitrofanov said: ``It's a new method of political technology. We
must connect with those who will vote for us in next year's
parliamentary elections. And I think young people will understand
this book. It's more political than about sex.''

Arafat accuses Israel of stalling peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with Israel accusing Palestinians of violating Palestinian
airport regulations, 13th graf
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Sunday that Israel had ``frozen completely'' the peace process
and was refusing to implement the latest land-for-security accord.
	   The accusation came despite assurances from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would continue carrying out
the agreement regardless of Israeli national elections expected in
spring or early summer.
	   Arafat was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
in Cairo earlier Sunday that Israel was using the elections as an
excuse not to withdraw troops from the West Bank.
	   But when asked upon his arrival in Gaza, the leader would only
say that Israel ``must respect (the accord) as they respect all
their commitments with all other countries.''
	   Asked if he believed Israel had frozen the implementation of the
Wye accord, Arafat told reporters in Gaza: ``No doubt. The Israeli
side has completely frozen everything.''
	   On Dec. 2, Israel postponed the withdrawal of troops from parts
of the West Bank as outlined in the Wye River agreement until the
Palestinians fulfill several conditions.
	   Israel withdrew in November from two percent of the West Bank
under the Wye accord and was slated to pull out of 11 percent more
in two phases by the end of January.
	   The Israeli demands include Palestinian agreement to stop saying
they will declare a state on May 4, 1999, regardless of the state
of the negotiations, to crack down on anti-Israeli incitement and
rein-in Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu said Friday that despite the Israeli election campaign
if the Palestinians fulfill the conditions, Israel will carry out
its part of the agreement signed on Oct. 23 at the White House.
	   The Palestinian cabinet repeated its insistence on Friday that
it will declare a state in May.
	   An Arafat spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called on the United
States Sunday to pressure Israel to continue fulfilling its part of
the Wye agreement despite the elections.
	   ``We signed an agreement with the Israeli government and not
with the Likud Party,'' Abourdeneh said in reference to Netanyahu's
party.
	   Meanwhile, Israel's airport authority accused the Palestinians
of violating the Wye accord by refusing to allow its security
officials to inspect an Egyptian plane that landed at the newly
opened Gaza International Airport Sunday, Israel TV said. Israel
retains security supervision over flights arriving at the
Palestinian-run airport.
	   In a sign of the tensions, Israeli soldiers shot rubber bullets
and tear gas Sunday at Palestinians who threw rocks at them and
Israeli vehicles near the Kalandia refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
	   The clashes broke out after an Israeli police car hit and
injured a Palestinian in the refugee camp, witnesses said.

 &UR; Netanyahu, confident of Likud backing, lashes out at opposition &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Likud central committee meeting;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV (AP) _ With his only serious rival for the party's
leadership bowing out, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basked in
the adoration of Likud's party faithful Sunday as he launched his
campaign for the upcoming election.
	   Netanyahu appeared confident and cheerful, a stark contrast to
his agonized equivocation last week as parliamentary support for
his security policies collapsed, precipitating elections likely to
take place by June.
	   His apparent weakness unleashed a week of furious speculation
that he might not survive even as a leader of the Likud.
	   That ended Sunday when Olmert made the decision to bow out after
failing to enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
	   The only remaining challenger for the Likud leadership is Uzi
Landau, 55, the hard-line chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   Landau is not likely to win, and has indicated that he knows it
_ and is hoping to use his bid to force Netanyahu to make hard-line
pledges during the leadership campaign.
	   Landau told Israel television his campaign would force the party
to become ``a Likud with principles, a Likud of backbone.''
	   When Netanyahu took the podium Sunday at a meeting of the Likud
central committee, his internal support was virtually ensured and
he was relaxed and smiling. He was surrounded by his Cabinet, many
grim-faced and nervously tapping a table.
	   The meeting was called to determine when internal elections for
the party's leadership and for its list of parliamentary candidates
should take place.
	   The dates were a foregone conclusion _ Jan. 25 for party leader
and Feb. 8 for the Knesset candidates _ but the meeting was a
useful vehicle for Netanyahu to demonstrate that he still had a
firm grip on the party machine.
	   To cries of ``Bibi, King of Israel,'' Netanyahu all but ignored
internal challengers, instead looking ahead to elections.
	   Netanyahu accused the main opposition Labor Party of working
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to ensure his defeat.
	   ``We're working for a secure peace, but they say no,'' he said
of the opposition Labor party. ``We'll go to elections, and we'll
win in elections.''
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak accused Netanyahu of dirty politics.
	   ``What we heard today was not a campaign speech,'' he said. ``It
was incitement.''
	   Hard-liners were furious with Netanyahu for agreeing to further
territorial concessions to the Palestinians at U.S. brokered peace
talks at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Doves in the opposition were angry with Netanyahu for freezing
the Wye process last month in hopes of extracting further
concessions from the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's last-minute offer during last week's Knesset debate
to set up a national unity government _ an about-face _ was seen as
blatant opportunism and provoked loud laughter from both opposition
and coalition legislators.
	   Before making the offer, he appeared gripped by confusion _
approaching the podium to speak, then suddenly backing away.
	   At Sunday's Likud meeting, Mordechai, the defense minister,
refused the opportunity to speak.
	   He is still entertaining offers from the Labor party and a new
centrist party, furious that Netanyahu reportedly offered the
defense ministry to a popular general.
	   Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister, refused to
speak to reporters, and rushed out of party headquarters after the
meeting. Israel radio reported that she is close to leaving the
Likud to join a centrist party headed by a former Netanyahu finance
minister, Dan Meridor.
	   Meridor _ and other Likud defectors _ have said that their
problem with Netanyahu is less with his policies and more with his
personality. They accuse him of being obsessed with survival at all
cost.
	   Benny Begin, the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
and one of the Likud's most staunchly right-wing members, has
decided to leave the party and run as prime minister, heading a new
rightist party.
	   Speaking to Israel television, Meridor described Netanyahu's 2
1/2 years as prime minister as ``the collapse of leadership and
political culture.''

Libya's Gadhafi fails to bring together Congolese sides

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi failed to
bring about a meeting between Congolese rebels and Congo's
President Laurent Kabila to explore ways to move the stalled peace
process, a rebel leader said Sunday.
	   ``There was no contact with Kabila,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba,
leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition, said in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali. ``Gadhafi wanted to hear from us our
position regarding the peace process.''
	   Gadhafi, who has supported Kabila in Congo's five-month war,
invited the rebels and the president they are fighting to oust to
Tripoli on Saturday to try to push the peace process.
	   Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the rebel coalition
of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition
politicians has torpedoed efforts to broker a cease-fire and open
political negotiations in Congo.
	   Last week, African negotiators postponed another round of peace
talks scheduled for Dec. 27-28 in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   The Organization of African Unity has been trying to obtain a
cease-fire in Congo, followed by the withdrawal of foreign forces
and talks on the future of Africa's third largest nation.
	   Rwandan diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Gadhafi had put forward his own initiative, different from the
African proposal. They had no details.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the August
rebellion and is demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from
Congo. Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have sent troops, arms
and aircraft in support of Kabila's government.
	   Rwanda and Uganda say they will stay in Congo as long as their
security is threatened. They accuse Kabila of enlisting thousands
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels who had been using eastern Congo to
destabilize their governments.
	   On Sunday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni flew to Tripoli for
talks with Gadhafi on the situation in Congo, the official Libyan
JANA news agency reported.
	   Uganda, like Rwanda, has been supporting a cease-fire, but only
if negotiated directly between Kabila and the rebels.
	   According to Chadian press reports, Gadhafi has bankrolled the
involvement of Chadian troops fighting the rebels in northern
Congo. Several hundred Chadian soldiers have been taken prisoner by
Ugandan forces in Congo.

	   OBRANCA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police using artillery,
mortars and other heavy weapons battled ethnic Albanian rebels for
hours Sunday in a fourth straight day of combat in the snowy fields
of northern Kosovo.
	   The U.S. diplomat who heads an international monitoring force
gained commitments from both sides for a temporary truce as
darkness fell late Sunday, in order to evacuate wounded. William
Walker voiced hope the ``sporadic fighting'' can be contained
without again engulfing the province in full-scale war.
	   But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb troops and
armor remained entrenched in their standoff near the northern town
of Podujevo, and there was no indication the worst outbreak of
fighting in months was over.
	   Sunday's at-times fierce clash put more pressure on an already
shaky truce that has held through the late fall and winter across
the secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   The reported death toll from the Serb crackdown that began last
Thursday reached 10, all ethnic Albanians, with the discovery of
another body. Five people were reported wounded Sunday _ four Serbs
and an Albanian rebel.
	   Elsewhere in Kosovo, Serb sources claimed that ``terrorists'' in
KLA uniforms shot dead three Roma men, also known as Gypsies,
outside the town of Kosovska Mitrovica Sunday night. The Serb-run
Media Center said police blocked off the suburb, which is 40
kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina, and were searching for
the killers.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq increased the pressure in its
confrontation with the United Nations on Sunday, saying it would
reject an extension of a U.N.-monitored program that feeds
civilians and would order aid monitors to leave.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh did not say when
Baghdad would ask the U.N. staff to depart. The latest phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal expires at the end of April.
	   U.N. officials declined to comment Sunday.
	   The tough talk came a day after Iraq said it would fire on U.S.
and British warplanes patrolling a no-fly zone imposed after the
1991 Gulf War.
	   It also came shortly before a group of Arab legislators meeting
in Amman, Jordan strongly condemned last week's U.S.-British
attacks as ``unjust aggression'' on Iraq. They also called on their
governments to work on the lifting of the U.N. trade embargo, which
has crippled the country's economy.
	   In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the
airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the
attacks, a newspaper reported.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying in its early Monday
edition.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ An undergound natural gas pipeline
erupted in a rural hamlet in northern Colombia on Sunday, killing
at least 12 people, bringing down power lines, and setting homes on
fire, authorities said.
	   Another 70 people were injured in the blast in Arroyo de Piedra,
a village in Atlantico state, 410 miles (about 650 kms) north of
the capital, Bogota.
	   Officials feared the death toll could rise, as burn victims
succumb to their injuries.
	   Authorities have not determined the cause of the explosion, but
they said it appeared to have been accidental. There was no
indication that leftist guerrillas who frequently sabotage oil
pipelines were responsible, they said.
	   The first television images from the scene of the disaster
showed several charred bodies laid out in a cement courtyard,
partially covered with white and colored bedsheets. A man wept
uncontrollably, telling reporters from the Caracol television
network that he had lost his mother and a sister in the blast.
	   Ruptured segments of the pipeline were also seen sticking out of
a massive dirt crater left by the explosion in a humble barrio of
wood and cinderblock homes located alongside a highway.
	   ``The explosion was so large it sent rocks flying and brought
down power and telephone lines''' said Rafael Bohorquez, a local
health official interviewed on the RCN radio station. ``The nearby
houses caught fire and their inhabitants have lost nearly
everything.''
	   At least 50 homes were destroyed, said Gov. Rodolfo Espinosa,
who toured the village. Police said the gas was turned off
immediately after the blast and the fire brought under control.
	   State health officials said nine people were killed immediately
and three died later in nearby hospitals. Three of the dead and six
of the wounded were children, they said.
	   The injured, many with serious burns, were being treated in area
hospitals.
	   ``We are still in the danger stage,'' Danorella Valderrama, the
state health department's emergency and disaster coordinator told
The Associated Press.
	   At the University Hospital in Barranquilla, the state capital,
12 patients, three of them children, were in stable condition with
third degree burns over 80 percent of their bodies, said admissions
official Diana Sarmento.

Arafat accuses Israel of stalling peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES in grafs 13-14 with Israel accusing Palestinians of
violating Palestinian airport regulations &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Sunday that Israel had ``frozen completely'' the peace process
and was refusing to implement the latest land-for-security accord.
	   The accusation came despite assurances from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would continue carrying out
the agreement regardless of Israeli national elections expected in
spring or early summer.
	   Arafat was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
in Cairo earlier Sunday that Israel was using the elections as an
excuse not to withdraw troops from the West Bank.
	   But when asked upon his arrival in Gaza, he would only say that
Israel ``must respect (the accord) as they respect all their
commitments with all other countries.''
	   Asked if he believed Israel had frozen the implementation of the
Wye accord, Arafat told reporters in Gaza: ``No doubt. The Israeli
side has completely frozen everything.''
	   On Dec. 2, Israel postponed the withdrawal of troops from parts
of the West Bank as outlined in the Wye River agreement until the
Palestinians fulfill several conditions.
	   Israel withdrew in November from two percent of the West Bank
under the Wye accord and was slated to pull out of 11 percent more
in two phases by the end of January.
	   The Israeli demands include Palestinian agreement to stop saying
they will declare a state on May 4, 1999, regardless of the state
of the negotiations, to crack down on anti-Israeli incitement and
rein in Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu said Friday that despite the Israeli election
campaign, if the Palestinians fulfill the conditions, Israel will
carry out its part of the agreement signed on Oct. 23 at the White
House.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet repeated its insistence on Friday that
it will declare a state in May.
	   An Arafat spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called on the United
States Sunday to pressure Israel to continue fulfilling its part of
the Wye agreement despite the elections.
	   ``We signed an agreement with the Israeli government and not
with the Likud Party,'' Abourdeneh said in reference to Netanyahu's
party.
	   Meanwhile, Israel's airport authority accused the Palestinians
of violating the Wye accord by refusing to allow its security
officials to inspect an Egyptian plane that landed at the newly
opened Gaza International Airport Sunday, Israel TV said.
	   Israel retains security supervision over flights arriving at the
Palestinian-run airport.
	   In a sign of heightened tensions, Israeli soldiers shot rubber
bullets and tear gas Sunday at Palestinians who threw rocks at them
and Israeli vehicles near the Kalandia refugee camp north of
Jerusalem.
	   The clashes broke out after an Israeli police car hit and
injured a Palestinian in the refugee camp, witnesses said.

 &UR; EDs: RECASTS with two dead conifirmed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two yacht crew members are dead, three
yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the
limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter
the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.
	   A helicopter rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical miles
off the far south New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday
morning.
	   Two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post
Naiad were left behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard
the helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, he said.
	   The deaths were confirmed by an Australian Search and Rescue
Coordination Center spokesman in Canberra a short time later.
	   Neither organization was able to say how the sailors died or
give details on the injuries suffered by surviving crewmen.
	   Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor
swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on
Sunday night.
	   The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which
sailed in the inaugural 1945 race, B-52 and Solo Globe Challenger.
	   A major search involving Australia's navy continued Monday
morning for those missing.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the
sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.
	   ``It's supposition. We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in
1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe
conditions,'' Campbell said.
	   Despite the horrendous conditions it was unlikely the race would
be called off, he said.
	   ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole
responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he
continues in the race or retires,'' he said.
	   The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has alerted all
shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the
remnants of the 115-boat fleet.
	   An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot Sydney
yacht Sword of Orion had rolled in heavy seas near Gabo Island
about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne.
	   Several crewmen were injured including one with a broken leg.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait when it overturned.
	   The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and
heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS
Newcastle was on its way to the area.
	   Earlier, as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused
havoc to the fleet, several rescues took place.
	   A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the
Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical
miles south of Gabo Island.
	   John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40
minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to
safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large
swells to secure Campbell.
	   A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the
630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering
injuries to crew.
	   Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last
year's line winner Brindabella.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile
race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by
German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. (djp)

Tonga mops up after Cyclone Cora
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with fishing boat found safely; adds banana background
in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Tonga faces food shortages and a
massive cleanup after Cyclone Cora blasted through the Pacific
Island nation, causing extensive wind and flood damage.
	   None of the island's banana trees, which are a major food source
and one of the country's principal export crops, were left standing
on the affected Tongan islands, a Radio Tonga spokesman told New
Zealand's National Radio on Sunday.
	   ``I don't think any of the crops will be still standing,'' the
spokesman said, adding surviving crops could die in the next few
days from flooding seawater.
	   The typhoon swept through on Saturday.
	   There were no reports of injuries, the spokesman said. A
seven-meter (23-foot) fishing boat with seven people on board,
originally thought missing, had come into port when the storm
threatened and was safe, police said.
	   About 70,000 people on Tonga's main island of Tongatapu, about
2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) northeast of Wellington, were
without electricity or phone lines.
	   Winds reached up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) during the
cyclone.
	   ``We've had extensive damages to crops, especially breadfruit,
bananas and food crops, both in the northern islands and now the
central island of Tongatapu,'' the spokesman said.
	   Weather forecaster Chris Webster said winds on the island had
dropped considerably and the cyclone was well to the southeast of
Tonga.
	   ``It's pretty much open ocean now around that area, but its
still of considerable interest for shipping because anyone who's
around there still obviously needs to know about it,'' Webster
said.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Dion Nash and Daniel Vettori put
on a record partnership to guide the hosts into a commanding
position in the second test against India at the Basin Reserve on
Monday.
	   In reply to India's 208, New Zealand resuming the day on 290 for
seven, was 346 for eight at lunch on the third day with Nash
unbeaten on 84.
	   Sachin Tendulkar, the sixth bowler tried by skipper Mohammad
Azharuddin to dislodge the four-hour stand, bowled Vettori as the
left hander made room to tickle the ball to fine leg.
	   Vettori's 57 runs came off 194 balls and included four
boundaries.
	   Nash and Vettori coming together with New Zealand on 208 for
seven, and shared a New Zealand record 137 for the eighth wicket.
	   The previous record was 136, shared by Bevan Congdon and Bob
Cunis against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1971-72.
	   Nash, curbed his natural exuberance to play a vital role in the
stand and has so far batted for 280 minutes and hit four boundaries
off 214 balls.
	   Tendulkar replacing leg spinner Anil Kumble had Vettori dropped
with his second ball, Azharuddin just managing to get his finger
tips to an outside edge.
	   It was the sixth catch dropped by India as they let the New
Zealand innings slip away. Kumble has been the most successful
bowler so far with 3-82 off 43 overs.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jackie Chan is a frugal fighter, washing his
own underwear and socks every night in a hotel because laundry
charges are too high.
	   The action star also frets over wasting soap.
	   ``I go to the Beverly (Hills) Hotel, I use the soap one day, two
days. I take the shower cap and wrap the soap in it and travel with
it,'' he said in Sunday's Los Angeles Times.
	   ``The new generation, they just waste it,'' he said. ``When we
were young we didn't have soap.''
	   Chan's latest film, ``Rush Hour,'' pulled in more than dlrs 130
million. Chan said a sequel is planned.
	    &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi weekly has named President Saddam
Hussein its ``Man of All Years'' because of his courage and
popularity among the Iraqi people.
	   ``He alone ... and nobody else lives in our hearts and
symbolizes our dignity and pride,'' the Al-Musawir al-Arabi weekly
said Sunday in a front-page editorial. A picture of Saddam, wearing
a cowboy hat and holding an AK-47 assault rifle, appeared next to
the editorial.
	   ``Who has the courage to keep the whole world busy?'' said the
editorial, adding that Saddam enjoyed ``patience and forgiveness''
and ``does not fear but the creator.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth
Starr were named Time magazine's Men of the Year last week.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Barbara Walters looks at Monica Lewinsky and
sees a daughter who was in love.
	   The veteran interviewer said she would have tried to persuade
Lewinsky to end her relationship with President Bill Clinton, but
would have been prepared for failure.
	   ``I would have tried to tell her that this was a relationship
that had no future,'' Walters said in the upcoming TV Guide. ``But
have you ever tried to stop a daughter when she is in love from
doing anything? It's very hard.''
	   Walters had a favorable impression of Lewinsky both before and
after two recent meetings.
	   ``I found Monica warm and intelligent and very open. I told her,
`You're very alive.' And she said, `Maybe that was the appeal (to
the president).'''

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ American track and field star Marion Jones
was picked as the best woman athlete of 1998 in a survey by Italy's
largest sports daily, Gazzetta dello Sport of Milan.
	   Italian cyclist Marco Pantani led the men's list ahead of
Ethiopian long distance runner Haile Gebrselassie.
	   Jones, the sprinter and long jumper who won 40 of 41 events this
year, got 480 points in the survey. French sprinter Christine Arron
finished second with 333 points with American swimmer Jenny
Thompson third with 321.
	   Pantani, winner of the Tours of Italy and France, led
Gebrselassie 476-457. Another long distance runner, Hicham El
Guerrouj of Morocco, edged Formula One world champion Mika Hakkinen
for third place.
	    &UR; ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Hoping to draw attention to the threat
of AIDS, activists paraded an enormous inflated condom through the
streets of Colombia's third largest city.
	   The mock prophylactic _ 12 feet (3.6 meters) in diameter,
stretching over a half-mile (one kilometer) in length and weighing
roughly 3,000 pounds (1,500 kilograms) _ was exhibited Sunday
during an annual holiday street fair in Cali.
	   A troupe of dancers performed inside the enormous plastic
structure on a tree-lined sidewalk alongside one of Cali's main
boulevards. Armed police in olive-green uniforms escorted the giant
birth control device, guarding against possible punctures.
	   Construction of the huge plastic condom was the idea of doctors
specializing in sexually-transmitted diseases at the Santiago de
Cali University and workers from drug rehabilitation programs.
	   Dr. John Jairo Palacio said the condom took two months to build
and cost dlrs 13,000. It was paid for by the university and a
condom manufacturer.
	   The Health Ministry reported 170,000 Colombians have been
diagnosed with AIDS and warned the number will increase if measures
aren't taken.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq intensified its confrontation with the
United Nations Sunday, saying it will reject any extension of a
U.N.-monitored food program and will require the monitors to leave.
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh did not say when Baghdad
would ask the U.N. staff to depart. The latest phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal expires at the end of April. U.N.
officials declined to comment. The Iraqi announcement came a day
after Baghdad said it would fire on U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling a no-fly zone imposed after the 1991 Gulf War. Later
Sunday, Arab legislators from 16 nations meeting in Amman, Jordan
strongly condemned last week's U.S.-British attacks as ``unjust
aggression'' on Iraq. They also called on their governments to work
on lifting U.N. economic sanctions which have crippled Iraq's
economy. (IRAQ)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat voiced hope
Sunday that the latest round of fighting in northern Kosovo can be
contained after international monitors secured a temporary truce
agreement with both sides. During the day, Serbian police using
artillery, mortars and other heavy weapons battled ethnic Albanian
rebels for hours, the fourth straight day of combat in the snowy
fields of northern Kosovo. After agreement on the temporary truce
was reached as darkness fell, William Walker, who heads an
international monitoring force, expressed hope that the ``sporadic
fighting'' can be contained without again engulfing the province in
full-scale war. But both Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and Serb
troops and armor remained entrenched near the northern town of
Podujevo. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LUANDA, Angola _ Angolan state radio blamed UNITA rebels Sunday
for shooting down a U.N. chartered plane carrying 14 people, a U.N.
official in Luanda said. The United Nations called for a 48-hour
cease-fire to allow a search for any survivors of Saturday's crash
but neither side responded to the call, said spokesman Hamadoun
Toure. He said that despite the radio report, the United Nations
had no immediate information about the cause of the crash.
According to Toure, RNA radio said the C-130 aircraft was shot down
by UNITA troops battling the army in the Huambo area, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda. UNITA has
neither confirmed nor denied the accusation. (ANGOLA-PLANE CRASH)
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Khmer Rouge rebel chiefs who have
agreed to lay down their arms remained holed up in a former
guerrilla stronghold Monday ahead of a possible meeting with
Cambodia's leader. Cambodians whose families and friends died under
the Khmer Rouge reign of terror expressed hope Sunday that the
rebel leaders will be punished for crimes against humanity. But
there were signs the government had reached an understanding with
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea that in exchange for pulling the plug
on their dying guerrilla struggle, they would be allowed to avoid
at least facing an international tribunal overseas. Prime Minister
Hun Sen has brushed aside questions of a trial so far, but favors
one held in Cambodia _ if at all, aides said. (CAMBODIA-KHMER
ROUGE)
	   TEL AVIV _ With his only serious threat for the party's
leadership bowing out, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basked in
the adoration of Likud's party faithful Sunday as he launched his
campaign for the upcoming election. Netanyahu appeared confident
and cheerful at a meeting of his Likud party leadership, a stark
contrast to his agonized equivocation last week as parliamentary
support for his security policies collapsed, precipitating
elections likely to take place by June. His apparent weakness
unleashed a week of furious speculation that he might not survive
even as a leader of the Likud. That ended Sunday when Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert, his most serious rival, made the decision to bow
out after failing to enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)

	   TEL AVIV (AP) _ With his only serious rival for the party's
leadership bowing out, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basked in
the adoration of Likud's party faithful Sunday as he launched his
campaign for the upcoming election.
	   Netanyahu appeared confident and cheerful, a stark contrast to
his agonized equivocation last week as parliamentary support for
his security policies collapsed, precipitating elections likely to
take place by June.
	   His apparent weakness unleashed a week of furious speculation
that he might not survive even as a leader of the Likud.
	   That ended Sunday when Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, his chief
rival, decided to bow out of the leadership race after failing to
enlist the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   The only remaining challenger for the Likud leadership is Uzi
Landau, 55, the hard-line chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   Landau is not likely to win, and has indicated that he knows it
_ and is hoping to use his bid to force Netanyahu to make hard-line
pledges during the leadership campaign.
	   Landau told Israel television his campaign would force the party
to become ``a Likud with principles, a Likud of backbone.''
	   When Netanyahu took the podium Sunday at a meeting of the Likud
central committee, his internal support was virtually ensured and
he was relaxed and smiling.
	   To cries of ``Bibi, King of Israel,'' Netanyahu all but ignored
internal challengers, instead looking ahead to elections.
	   But many Cabinet members on the podium with Netanyahu were
grim-faced.
	   Mordechai, the defense minister, refused the opportunity to
speak. He is still entertaining offers from the main opposition
Labor party and a new centrist party, furious that Netanyahu
reportedly offered the defense ministry to a popular general.
	   Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister, refused to
speak to reporters, and rushed out of party headquarters after the
meeting. Israel radio reported that she is close to leaving the
Likud to join a centrist party headed by a former Netanyahu finance
minister, Dan Meridor.
	   The meeting was called to determine when internal elections for
the party's leadership and for its list of parliamentary candidates
should take place.
	   The dates were a foregone conclusion _ Jan. 25 for party leader
and Feb. 8 for the Knesset candidates _ but the meeting was a
useful vehicle for Netanyahu to demonstrate that he still had a
firm grip on the party machine.
	   Netanyahu accused Labor of working with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to ensure his defeat.
	   ``We're working for a secure peace, but they say no,'' he said
of the opposition Labor party. ``We'll go to elections, and we'll
win in elections.''
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak accused Netanyahu of dirty politics.
	   ``What we heard today was not a campaign speech,'' he said. ``It
was incitement.''
	   Hard-liners were furious with Netanyahu for agreeing to further
territorial concessions to the Palestinians at U.S. brokered peace
talks at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Doves in the opposition were angry with Netanyahu for freezing
the Wye process last month in hopes of extracting further
concessions from the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's last-minute offer during last week's Knesset debate
to set up a national unity government _ an about-face _ was seen as
blatant opportunism and provoked loud laughter from both opposition
and coalition legislators.
	   Before making the offer, he appeared gripped by confusion _
approaching the podium to speak, then suddenly backing away.
	   Meridor _ and other Likud defectors _ have said that their
problem with Netanyahu is less with his policies and more with his
personality. They accuse him of being obsessed with survival at all
cost.
	   Benny Begin, the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
and one of the Likud's most staunchly right-wing members, has
decided to leave the party and run as prime minister, heading a new
rightist party.
	   Speaking to Israel television, Meridor described Netanyahu's 2
1/2 years as prime minister as ``the collapse of leadership and
political culture.''

 &UR; EDs: RECASTS with two dead confirmed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two yacht crew members are dead, three
yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the
limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter
the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.
	   A helicopter rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical miles
off the far south New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday
morning.
	   Two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post
Naiad were left behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard
the helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, he said.
	   The deaths were confirmed by an Australian Search and Rescue
Coordination Center spokesman in Canberra a short time later.
	   Neither organization was able to say how the sailors died or
give details on the injuries suffered by surviving crewmen.
	   Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor
swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on
Sunday night.
	   The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which
sailed in the inaugural 1945 race, B-52 and Solo Globe Challenger.
	   A major search involving Australia's navy continued Monday
morning for those missing.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the
sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.
	   ``It's supposition. We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in
1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe
conditions,'' Campbell said.
	   Despite the horrendous conditions it was unlikely the race would
be called off, he said.
	   ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole
responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he
continues in the race or retires,'' he said.
	   The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has alerted all
shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the
remnants of the 115-boat fleet.
	   An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot Sydney
yacht Sword of Orion had rolled in heavy seas near Gabo Island
about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne.
	   Several crewmen were injured including one with a broken leg.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait when it overturned.
	   The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and
heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS
Newcastle was on its way to the area.
	   Earlier, as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused
havoc to the fleet, several rescues took place.
	   A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the
Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical
miles south of Gabo Island.
	   John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40
minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to
safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large
swells to secure Campbell.
	   A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the
630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering
injuries to crew.
	   Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last
year's line winner Brindabella.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile
race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by
German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. (djp)

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The Honduran government said Sunday
it hopes that 65 percent of its foreign debt will be forgiven to
help it rebuild from the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``This will allow the country to have fresh resources to use for
the national reconstruction,'' said Moises Starkman, the Honduran
minister of international cooperation.
	   Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, has
struggled for years to bring down its foreign debt _ now dlrs 4.3
billion, or 40 percent of the government's budget.
	   The government appealed for debt relief after Hurricane Mitch
caused an estimated dlrs 4 billion of dollar in damage to the
Central American country in late October and early November. The
storm killed more than 5,600 people in Honduras, according to
government figures.
	   The United States, Canada, Cuba and France are among the
countries that have promised to forgive part or all of their share
of Honduras' debt.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Two suspects have been arrested in Mexico and
admitted killing an American reporter in a remote mountain region
earlier this month, an investigator said Sunday.
	   The men were found with belongings of Philip True _ the Mexico
City correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News _ said Jalisco
State attorney general's office investigator Mario Hernandez.
	   He said they confessed to killing True.
	   Hernandez did not give a motive for the killing. Local news
reports, citing unnamed sources, said it was robbery.
	   True, 50, disappeared while hiking alone through the Sierra
Madre Occidental, where he was spending vacation time and pursuing
a story on the Huichol Indian culture. His body was found Dec. 16
in a shallow grave in the west-central state.
	   An initial autopsy determined True was strangled as many as 10
days before his body was found. The Mexican attorney general's
office said it expects to announce the results of a second autopsy
shortly.
	   Hernandez said the suspects _ Juan Chivarrer Lopez and Miguel
Hernandez de la Cruz, both Huichol Indians _ had True's backpack,
tent, passport and other belongings.
	   He said they were arrested by soldiers Saturday in the region
where True was killed and then flown to the state capital,
Guadalajara. The Express-News had reported the arrests occurred
Friday, citing an unnamed source. There was no explanation for the
discrepancy.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Italian Mafia has turned
Brazil into a haven for money laundering, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   A recent report by the FBI and the Italian police shows that the
Mafia has set up an elaborate money-laundering scheme through four
Sao Paulo-based dummy corporations that receive money from European
cocaine and heroin sales, said the Rio daily, Jornal do Brasil.
	   The 181-page report took two years and involved hours of
telephone wiretaps, hidden microphones and fax interceptions
approved by Italian judges.
	   The investigation revealed that the Mafia has invested dlrs 20
million in the four corporations _ a travel agency and three video
bingo game companies.
	   Brazil has long been a favorite hideout for fugitive Mafia
leaders because of the ease with which foreigners can get
citizenship and because of bank secrecy laws, which make it
difficult to investigate money laundering or tax evasion.
	   Legislation approved by the Congress early this year now gives
the nation's Central Bank the power to investigate suspicious
accounts.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A natural gas pipeline exploded in a
rural hamlet in northern Colombia on Sunday, killing at least 12
people, bringing down power lines, and setting homes on fire,
authorities said.
	   The blast in Arroyo de Piedra, a village in Atlantico State, 410
miles north of the capital, Bogota, also injured 80 people.
Officials said they feared the death toll could rise.
	   Authorities have not determined the cause of the explosion, but
they said it appeared to have been accidental. There was no
indication that leftist guerrillas who frequently sabotage oil
pipelines were responsible.
	   Television images from the town showed several charred bodies
laid out in a cement courtyard, partially covered with white and
colored bed sheets. Bandaged, burned children stared from hospital
beds.
	   Ruptured segments of the pipeline stuck out of a giant dirt
crater left by the explosion of the underground pipeline in a
humble neighborhood of wood and cinder block homes.
	   ``I'm in intense pain,'' survivor Nadim Cera told the Caracol
television network, fighting back tears. The fruit vendor lost his
mother, two sisters and a cousin in the explosion which also
critically injured his father.
	   State health officials said nine people were killed immediately
and three died later in area hospitals. Three of the dead and six
of the wounded were children, they said.
	   ``The explosion was so large it sent rocks flying and brought
down power and telephone lines''' said Rafael Bohorquez, a local
health official interviewed on Colombian radio. ``The nearby houses
caught fire and their inhabitants have lost nearly everything.''
	   At least 50 homes were destroyed, Gov. Rodolfo Espinosa told
reporters during a visit to Arroyo de Piedra. Police said the gas
was turned off immediately after the blast and the fire brought
under control.
	   Sixty people remained hospitalized with serious burns and other
injuries, officials said.
	   ``Many of the patients are in critical condition at the
moment,'' Danorella Valderrama, the state health department's
emergency and disaster coordinator, told The Associated Press.
	   At the University Hospital in Barranquilla, the state capital,
12 patients were in stable condition with third degree burns over
80 percent of their bodies, said Diana Sarmento, a hospital
admissions official.

Balloon launch put off to later in week

<TEXT>
	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ A joint Australian-American
attempt to fly a balloon non-stop around the world has been
postponed due to high winds over the launch pad in Outback
Australia.
	   Team Re/Max, which planned to lift off from Alice Springs about
6 a.m. local time Tuesday (1900GMT Monday), will hold off until a
high pressure system causing strong winds over central Australia is
expected to weaken on Thursday or Friday.
	   Bill Echols, the team's media spokesman, said ground and high
altitude winds far exceeded safe launching conditions for the giant
polyethylene balloon.
	   ``The surface winds currently are too strong for any kind of a
balloon launch at this moment,'' Echols said.
	   ``Conditions are expected to continue until Wednesday; winds
which will be too high for a safe launch.''
	   Their non-stop expedition is expected to take 16 to 18 days and
bring them back to Australia.
	   Echols said the team hoped to succeed where others had failed by
taking the high road _ floating on the outer edge of the atmosphere
where predictable weather, the bane of previous attempts, should
not be a problem.
	   The space gondola will carry pilots John Wallington of Canberra
and Americans Dave Liniger and Bob Martin on a quest to set balloon
records including duration, distance and altitude.
	   Echols said the launch would be affected by both surface winds
and winds at altitudes of up to 300 meters _ the height of the
balloon.
	   He said the good news was the winds in the stratosphere had
increased by one knot per day over the last several days, making it
possible for the adventurers to cut hours or even days off their
expedition.
	   ``That's really a positive for us if they can get up there and
catch those faster winds,'' he said. ``It will mean that we cut
that many hours or days off the total flight.''
	   Echols said the crew would be ready to launch on Thursday or
Friday.
	   ``That really affords us a little more time to make sure the
gondola is properly re-installed and all the systems are working
properly,'' he said. (djp)

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks advance in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in thin,
end-of-year trading early Monday. Japanese stocks advanced
moderately.
	   The dollar bought 116.35 yen in early trading, up 0.22 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York and London were
closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 64.37 points,
or 0.47 points, to 13,862.32 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed up 91.22 points, or 0.67
percent.
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's movement was
limited in Tokyo as many overseas markets remain closed for the
year end holiday period or open with reduced staff.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened higher on buying of
blue chips amid the yen's weakening against the dollar.
	   A weaker yen makes Japanese exports less costly in the United
States and U.S. goods more expensive in Japan.
	   Trading, however, remained extremely thin as many participants
were staying out of the market at the end of the year.
	   ``There aren't many participants today, and a notable lack of
foreign activity,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.73 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,087.69. The
TOPIX closed up 8.78 points, or 0.82 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 1.750 percent, unchanged from Friday's finish. Its
price remained at 100.40 yen.

Two dead, two yachts missing in annual race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two
crew members and leaving two yachts missing.
	   The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post
Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales
state town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and
Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra.
	   One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was found mid-morning Monday
and was making its way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast,
an AusSAR spokesman said.
	   The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the vessel
was sailing unassisted.
	   The spokesman said no word had been received on the fate of the
Winston Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of
Orion on Sunday night. As of mid-morning Monday, he had been in the
water for 15 hours.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with
night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the
frigate HMAS Newcastle was on its way to the area.
	   Rescuers in more than 30 search aircraft were similarly unsure
of the whereabouts and condition of Solo Globe and its crew.
	   Seven others on board the Business Post Naiad were put aboard a
helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, the center said.
	   The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died
or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen.
There were unconfirmed reports that one of the dead sailors was
British.
	   With winds gusting to 80 knots and seas swelling to 10 meters
(35 feet), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the
three missing yachts.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the
sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.
	   ``It's supposition,'' Campbell said. ``We had John Quinn survive
for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in
very severe conditions.''
	   A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when
Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40
minutes and had hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior
Constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure
Campbell.
	   Despite the conditions, Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the
race would be called off.
	   ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole
responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he
continues in the race or retires,'' he said.
	   The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) alerted all
shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the
remnants of the 115-boat fleet.
	   A total of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer
(725-mile) race. Many lost their masts or have injured crew.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, 7
minutes, 10 seconds, set by German maxi Morning Glory in 1996.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at
least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.
	   The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the New
South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search

	   Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter,
the center said.
	   The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died
or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen.
	   With winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35
feet (10 meters), the race continued even as rescue teams searched
for the missing vessels.
	   There was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when
the 30-foot (9-meter) boat rolled in wild seas Sunday night near
Gabo Island, about 280 miles (450 kilometers) east of Melbourne.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait when it overturned. Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it
was not known how long the sailor could survive in the water.
	   The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which
sailed in the inaugural 1945 race; B-52; and Solo Globe Challenger.

Latest round-the-world balloon quest put off to later in week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ A joint Australian-American
attempt to fly a balloon non-stop around the world has been
postponed due to high winds over the launch pad in Outback
Australia.
	   Team Re/Max, which planned to lift off from Alice Springs about
6 a.m. local time Tuesday (1900 GMT Monday), will hold off until a
high pressure system causing strong winds over central Australia is
expected to weaken on Thursday or Friday.
	   The planned quest would come just days after Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett's team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii
on Christmas Day after completing about half of its attempt to
circle the globe.
	   Bill Echols, media spokesman for Team Re/Max, said ground and
high altitude winds far exceeded safe launching conditions for the
giant polyethylene balloon.
	   ``The surface winds currently are too strong for any kind of a
balloon launch at this moment,'' Echols said.
	   ``Conditions are expected to continue until Wednesday; winds
which will be too high for a safe launch,'' he said.
	   The expedition is expected to take 16 to 18 days and, if
successful, would bring them back to Australia.
	   The team is making its first attempt at what balloon enthusiasts
describe as the last great adventure in aviation.
	   Fossett, British millionaire Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden abandoned their more conventional balloon flight Friday
about 10 miles (15 kilometers) off Kahuku Point at the northeast
tip of the island of Oahu. They have tried a total of 11 times.
	   Fossett's team ditched its balloon after losing the
high-altitude 200 mph (320 kph) winds needed to carry the
combination helium and hot-air balloon across the Pacific to North
America.
	   Echols, however, said Team Re/Max hoped to succeed where others
had failed by taking the high road _ floating on the outer edge of
the atmosphere where predictable weather, the bane of previous
attempts, should not be a problem.
	   The space gondola will carry pilots John Wallington of Canberra
and Americans Dave Liniger and Bob Martin on a quest to set balloon
records including duration, distance and altitude.
	   Echols said the launch would be affected by both surface winds
and winds at altitudes of up to 300 meters (990 feet) _ the height
of the balloon.
	   He said the good news was that winds in the stratosphere had
increased by one knot per day over the last several days, making it
possible for the adventurers to cut hours or even days off their
expedition.
	   ``That's really a positive for us if they can get up there and
catch those faster winds,'' he said. ``It will mean that we cut
that many hours or days off the total flight.''
	   Echols said the crew would be ready to launch on Thursday or
Friday.
	   ``That really affords us a little more time to make sure the
gondola is properly re-installed and all the systems are working
properly,'' he said.

Cardinals make the playoffs for the first time in 16 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEMPE, Arizona (AP) _ The Arizona Cardinals made the playoffs
for the first time in 16 years _ and what an amazing way to get
there.
	   Chris Jacke kicked a 52-yard field goal as time expired Sunday
to give the Cardinals a 16-13 victory over the San Diego Chargers,
who had tied the game 16 seconds earlier on a fourth-down, 30-yard
touchdown pass.
	   The victory gave Arizona the final NFL playoff spot and set up a
meeting at Dallas next Saturday. The Cardinals last made the
playoffs in a non-strike year in 1975. They had a playoff game in
1982, but it was after a nine-game strike season.
 &UR; Buccaneers 35, Bengals 0 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-8) kept their playoff
hopes alive by beating the Bengals behind Mike Alstott's
career-high three TD runs. But they were eliminated about four
hours later when Arizona beat San Diego to clinch the final NFC
wild-card berth.
	   The Bucs got everything handed to them by Cincinnati (3-13). The
Bengals fumbled a punt, had another blocked, missed a field goal,
fumbled a kickoff and lost another quarterback to a hand injury as
Tampa Bay rolled to a 28-0 halftime lead.
 &UR; Jets 31, Patriots 10 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Vinny Testaverde threw four
touchdown passes as the New York Jets set a franchise record with
their 12th victory.
	   The Jets, 1-15 just two years ago before Bill Parcells took over
as coach, won their sixth in a row to finish the regular season at
12-4. The Jets and Patriots (9-7) had already clinched playoff
berths prior to Sunday's game.
	   Testaverde, the AFC's leading passer, set a club record with 29
TD asses. He threw TD passes of 4 yards to Kyle Brady, 8 to Curtis
Martin, 17 to Dedric Ward and 24 to Keyshawn Johnson.
 &UR; Falcons 38, Dolphins 16 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, while coach Dan Reeves watched from home, missing
his second straight game after heart bypass surgery, the Falcons
closed out the best regular season in team history by routing the
Miami Dolphins.
	   Atlanta (14-2), which had already clinched the NFC West and a
first-round bye, stunned the turnover-plagued Dolphins (10-6) by
jumping to a 21-0 lead just eight minutes into the game.
	   The Falcons enter the postseason with a nine-game winning
streak. Despite the loss, Miami earned a home playoff game when New
England lost to the Jets.
 &UR; Packers 16, Bears 13 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Ryan Longwell kicked the go-ahead field goal in the
fourth quarter and LeRoy Butler came up with a big sack and forced
fumble in the last minute as Green Bay (11-5) beat Chicago for the
10th straight time.
	   It was the last regular-season game for Green Bay's Reggie
White, the NFL's career sack leader. White, who is retiring after
this season, waved to cheering Packer fans as he left the field.
	   The Bears finished 4-12 for the second straight season, putting
coach Dave Wannstedt's job in jeopardy.
 &UR; Ravens 19, Lions 10 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Priest Holmes scored a touchdown and became the
Ravens' first 1,000-yard rusher as Baltimore (6-10) closed a
disappointing season by beating the error-prone Detroit Lions
(5-11).
	   The game probably marked the end of Ted Marchibroda's tenure as
Baltimore's coach. Marchibroda has a 16-31-1 record in three years
with the Ravens, and he is not expected to return next season.
	   Holmes gained 132 yards on 20 carries and finished with 1,008
yards for the season. Jim Harbaugh shrugged off an early elbow
injury to finish 17-for-26 for 141 yards and a touchdown.
 &UR; Panthers 27, Colts 19 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, not even Peyton Manning's record passing could
offset the Indianapolis Colts' horrid defense.
	   The Colts blew a double-digit lead for the fifth time this
season and lost to the Carolina Panthers (4-12), who got
second-half touchdowns by Michael Bates, Tim Biakabutuka and Raghib
Ismail.
	   Manning, who set NFL rookie records for attempts, completions,
yards and touchdowns, gave the Colts a 13-3 lead with a 44-yard TD
pass to Marcus Pollard early in the second quarter. But
Indianapolis (3-13) managed only a pair of field goals by Mike
Vanderjagt after that.
 &UR; Bills 45, Saints 33 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, with Doug Flutie resting for the playoffs, Rob
Johnson got some practice for the Buffalo Bills.
	   Johnson threw three TD passes and ran for a 12-yard score as the
Bills (10-6) beat the New Orleans Saints (6-10).
	   Johnson was 12-of-18 for 216 yards. Saints starter Kerry Collins
completed only 3 of 12 passes for 23 yards, was sacked twice and
intercepted once before being benched late in the first quarter.
 &UR; Giants 20, Eagles 10 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, the New York Giants found out just before
kickoff that their season was over. However, it didn't stop them
from giving the Eagles their first 13-loss season and ruining what
was probably the final game for Philadelphia coach Ray Rhodes.
	   Knocked out of the NFC wild-card picture by Tampa Bay's victory
earlier in the day, the Giants (8-8) finished their season by
winning their fourth straight and fifth in six games.
	   The Eagles (3-13) finished with their worst record since going
2-11-1 in 1972. Rhodes, named coach of the year in his first season
with the Eagles in 1995, said this week that he expects to be fired
soon after the season.
 &UR; 49ers 38, Rams 19 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, the 49ers won their 17th straight
regular-season home game and earned the right to play host to the
Packers in their wild-card playoff game.
	   Rookie R.W. McQuarters returned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown
and Steve Young passed for two TDs and ran for another in San
Francisco's 17th straight victory over the Rams (4-12). It's the
second-longest win streak against an opponent in NFL history,
trailing Washington's 18-game run over Detroit.
	   Wade Richey added field goals of 44, 27 and 20 yards for the
49ers (12-4), who haven't lost to the Rams since 1990, when they
were still based in Anaheim.
 &UR; Broncos 28, Seahawks 21 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Terrell Davis ran for 178 yards to become only the
fourth back in NFL history to reach 2,000 yards in a season, and
John Elway threw four touchdown passes to become only the third
passer in league history with 300 for his career.
	   The Broncos (14-2) head into the playoffs on a high note after
suffering their only two defeats of the season the previous two
games.
	   Despite a sore back, Davis topped the 2,000-yard mark with a
15-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. He finished the
regular season with 2,008 yards, third highest in NFL history.
	   Elway threw two TD passes to tight end Shannon Sharpe, one to
Rod Smith and one to Davis.

Stern says no more offers will be made after meeting in Denver
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF GOODMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern met with union head Billy Hunter in
``an attempt to salvage the season'' and made what the NBA
commissioner called the league's final offer.
	   In a sign that chances are small for a settlement before the
NBA's Jan. 7 ``drop-dead date'' for canceling the entire 1998-99
season, Stern said Sunday that the owners' latest offer produced
little progress.
	   ``This was not enough for the union,'' Stern said. ``We advised
the union that no further offers from the NBA will be made.''
	   The union had no immediate response following the five-hour
meeting in Denver.
	   ``In an attempt to salvage the season, we made additional
improvements in our offer,'' Stern said, adding that the league
proposed to increase the percentage of revenue to be shared with
players, the proposed maximum salary, the rookie salary scale and
the minimum salary.
	   The league also proposed an additional exemption to the salary
cap and accepted the union's 10 percent limitation on the escrow
arrangement.
	   NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said that both sides came out of
the latest session with a sense of frustration and admitted they
remain far apart.
	   Stern, along with deputy commissioner Russ Granik and special
assistant Bob Lanier, took part in the bargaining session. Players
were also represented by the Knicks' Patrick Ewing and lawyer
Jeffrey Kessler.
	   The meeting developed following Wednesday night's secret session
in Los Angeles between Stern and Hunter.
	   Hunter planned to return to New York later Sunday. No further
talks are scheduled with 10 days remaining until NBA owners meet
Jan. 7 in New York. Stern said if no deal is reached by then, he
will recommend the cancellation of the season to owners.
	   Some agents have been advising Hunter to hold off until the
deadline before trying to close the deal.
	   The sides are still unable to come to terms on how to distribute
some dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue. In order to salvage a 45 or
50-game schedule, a deal must be made by mid-January.

Two people die in Australian yacht race; 3 yachts missing

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at
least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.
	   The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the New
South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search
and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra.
	   Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter,
the center said.
	   The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died
or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen.
	   One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was found mid-morning Monday
and was making its way toward Eden on the New South Wales coast,
AusSAR said. The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the
vessel was sailing unassisted.
	   With winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35
feet (10 meters), the race continued even as rescue teams searched
for the missing vessels.
	   AusSAR said no word had been received on the fate of the Winston
Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of Orion on
Sunday night. As of mid-morning Monday, he had been in the water
for 15 hours.
	   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass
Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with
night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the
frigate HMAS Newcastle was on its way to the area.
	   The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which
sailed in the inaugural 1945 race and Solo Globe Challenger.
	   Despite the conditions, Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it
was unlikely the race would be called off.
	   ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole
responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he
continues in the race or retires,'' he said.
	   A total of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer
(725-mile) race. Many lost their masts or have injured crew.

U.S. top monitor in Kosovo hopeful fighting can be contained

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. diplomat voiced hope that
the latest round of fighting in northern Kosovo can be contained
after international monitors secured a temporary truce agreement
with both sides.
	   But daily clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels
over the last four day bode poorly for chances of peace in the
Serbian province, where at least 13 people have been shot dead in
the last four days.
	   In a sometimes-fierce battle Sunday, artillery, mortar and
machine-gun fire sounded for hours across the snowy fields of
rebel-controlled territory as the two sides fought from trenches,
villages and dirt roads.
	   At least five people _ three Serb policeman, a Serb civilian and
a Kosovo Liberation Army fighter _ were reported wounded as the
worst period of violence in Kosovo in months continued.
	   But William Walker, the American diplomat who heads the Kosovo
Verification Mission, countered assumptions that a return to war is
inevitable by stressing that the scope of violence remains limited.
	   ``This is what I would call sporadic fighting,'' he told CNN
after Sunday's clash ended. ``Both sides are being relatively
cautious'' and not using full firepower, he said.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity one with the other in terms of getting the
wounded out,'' the diplomat said.
	   Verifiers from the 54-nation peace mission, led by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, mediated the
evacuation of two wounded Serbs and one ethnic Albanian after the
fire fight.
	   But the truce may be nothing more than a brief pause, based on
past violation of pledges and the evidence on the ground.
	   Both the guerrillas and a substantial number of Serb troops and
armor remain entrenched in their standoff near the northern town of
Podujevo, and there was no indication the shooting in several
surrounding villages was over.
	   Sunday's clash was attributed to the funeral of a Serb farmer
whom the rebels killed the previous day.
	   The Serbs said they needed to ensure the safety of other
civilians while evacuating the body. The KLA complained that the
heavy Serb buildup was a provocation that prevented civilians who
fled the previous fighting from returning.
	   A new trouble spot emerged Sunday night when Serb police sealed
off a suburb of Kosovska Mitrovica and began searching for
``terrorists,'' their term for the rebels.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said men in KLA uniforms had shot dead
three Roma men, also known as Gypsies, in the town 40 kilometers
(25 miles) northwest of the capital Pristina.
	   Similar police actions this month following shootings blamed on
the rebels have resulted in harsh crackdowns backed by tanks and
artillery.
	   Four days of clashes, centered on the KLA stronghold of
Lapastica and neighboring Obranca, have tested an already shaky
truce that has held through the late fall and winter across the
secessionist province of Serbia, the dominant republic left in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite an October agreement that halted more than seven months
of fighting, neither side has shown a willingness to negotiate a
settlement to their differences.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go.

Iraq says it won't extend oil-for-food program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL;

 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has declared that it will refuse to
extend a U.N.-monitored program that brings crucial food to
families struggling under U.N. sanctions _ striking another blow in
its latest confrontation with the United Nations.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that
Baghdad will ask some 400 U.N. workers who monitor the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program to leave, but he did not give a
date.
	   The latest phase of the program _ which allows Iraq to sell oil
in return for needed supplies _ doesn't expire until the end of
April.
	   Saleh's announcement was the latest Iraqi response to the
four-day U.S. and British bombing campaign that ended Dec. 20.
Washington and London launched the airstrikes after U.N. weapons
inspectors reported that Baghdad had not kept its promise of full
cooperation in the search for its weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.N. officials declined to comment Sunday on Iraq's declaration.
	   Baghdad's first response was to ban the inspectors from
returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would fire on U.S. and
British warplanes patrolling skies over northern and southern Iraq.
	   The Iraqi government has also criticized its traditional allies
on the U.N. Security Council _ Russia, China and France _ for not
doing enough to prevent the airstrikes.
	   At a meeting of Arab legislators from 16 nations in Amman,
Jordan, Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, called for a
resolution demanding that economic sanctions against Baghdad be
lifted.
	   The lawmakers strongly condemned last week's U.S.-British
attacks as ``unjust aggression'' on Iraq. They also called on their
governments to work on the lifting of the U.N. trade embargo, which
has crippled the country's economy.
	   In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the
airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the
attacks, a newspaper reported.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying in its early Monday
edition.
	   The U.N. embargo, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors verify that Iraq is
free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The oil-for-food program began in 1996 to bring crucial supplies
such as flour, lentils, rice, sugar and medicine to families
struggling under sanctions. It is generally extended every six
months.
	   Though Iraq desperately needs the goods, it long has feared the
program makes it easier for the world to allow the sanctions to
continue.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands the
lifting of sanctions,'' Saleh said. ``This means the ouster of U.N.
teams which supervise it.''
	   About 400 U.N. workers monitor the program to ensure that the
Iraqi government does not divert any of the money for aid and use
it for its own purposes.
	   The latest six month phase allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion
in oil to buy needed supplies.

Two dead, two yachts missing in annual race

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two sailors died and 15 others were
missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.
	   ``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is
tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's
only two people who have died in it before,'' said Australian
Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray.
	   The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post
Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales
state town of Merimbula.
	   Gray said Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce Guy and
first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed. Both men were
from Launceston in northern Tasmania.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to
free himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board
the boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible.
	   Race officials said Guy sailed in two previous Sydney to Hobart
yacht races.
	   Grave fears were held for the safety of the nine crew on missing
cutter Winston Churchill, while contact has been lost with the five
crew aboard Solo Globe.
	   British sailor Glyn Charles was swept off the Sword of Orion on
Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas. At 12:30 p.m. local
time (0130 GMT) Monday Charles had been missing for about 17 hours.
	   Race officials said Charles had sailed in four Admiral's Cups
and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long
Gray could survive in the water.
	   ``It's supposition,'' Campbell said. ``We had John Quinn survive
for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in
very severe conditions.''
	   Gray said about 56 sailors had been winched to safety.
	   ``There's just many many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was found mid-morning Monday
and was making its way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast.
	   The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the vessel
was sailing unassisted.
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quicky. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   At least 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer
(725-mile) race.
	   The Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted all shipping in
Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of
the 115-boat fleet.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella.
	   Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they
were still well inside the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, 7
minutes, 10 seconds, set by German maxi Morning Glory in 1996.

	   CHURILOVICHI, Belarus (AP) _ Late in the year always has been
the slaughter season at Belarusian fur farms, but the economic
crisis in the former Soviet republics made this year a bit
different.
	   With sales of fur hats and coats down, the Voikov collective
farm just outside the capital, Minsk, couldn't afford to feed its
polar foxes and minks. So it has slaughtered most of them rather
than watch them starve.
	   The farm is trying to move the pelts at fire-sale prices, but
the result is reduced breeding stocks.
	   ``We had to do it, because the farm had huge debts to the meat
plants that were supplying food for our fur animals,'' said Yuri
Mikhailov, manager of the farm. ``We had to slaughter so many
animals in order not to torture them any longer.''
	   The farm had 1,143 polar foxes and 845 minks, and killed all but
400 foxes that they will use to rebuild the stocks.
	   On a recent day, the slaughtered animals were laid out in rows
on the ground or piled high in the back of trucks at the rundown
farm.
	   Watchdogs barked fiercely to warn off visitors, but most of the
cages they were protecting were empty. Young silver polar foxes,
among the few that survived, bared their small, sharp teeth and
also barked.
	   The farm's foxes and minks long have fed the big demand for fur
coats and hats in Russia, Belarus and other former Soviet states,
where there has never been an active anti-fur movement as in some
Western countries.
	   Although expensive, fur is not only for the elite. Many
middle-class Russians and Belarusians also own coats, and most
consider them necessities in the harsh winter.
	   ``Our people want to impress their neighbors, friends, relatives
_ with crystal, furniture and furs, which some of them buy at the
expense of eating properly,'' said Maxim Kapran, a member of
Belarus' Youth Ecological Movement.
	   Until recently, Russia purchased about 40 percent of the world's
fur, but that figure is declining, say Russians in the fur
industry.
	   The economic crisis in Russia and Belarus has shrunk the pool of
potential customers in both countries and may drive more fur farms
out of business.
	   Stores in Belarus have all but stopped carrying fur coats. Sales
in Russia are down by half or more compared to last winter, and fur
coats are piling up in storerooms, said Viktor Chipurnoi, vice
president of Soyuzpushnina, Russia's fur trading company.
	   ``After the crisis the situation changed, of course, because
people don't have money to pay for luxury items,'' Chipurnoi said.
	   As a result, fur farming in both Russia and Belarus are in
trouble.
	   Only 30 of the 200 fur farms that Russia had in the early 1990s
are still operating, Chipurnoi said. The others have closed, or are
reducing their stock and gradually phasing out production.
	   In Belarus, the conditions are as bad, if not worse.
	   ``The problems the fur breeding industry is experiencing are
common to the entire agricultural sector in Belarus,'' said Sergei
Stranadkin, chairman of the Voikov collective farm, which includes
the fur farm.
	   In both Russia and Belarus, the best hope for an improvement in
the fur business is an upswing in the overall economy.
	   ``We are trying to help fur farms,'' said Chipurnoi, the Russian
fur trader. ``If the economy gets through the crisis, people will
be buying fur again.''
	   ``Russia is a fur country,'' he added.

Gough strikes back for England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England paceman Darren Gough had
Australia reeling with four wickets in the fourth cricket test at
the MCG on Monday.
	   Australia went to lunch on day three at 163 for five in reply to
England's 270. The first day was washed out.
	   Gough took the opening two wickets Sunday and two more Monday
after Australia resumed on 59-2.
	   Angus Fraser, winning a surprise recall for this match, made the
opening breakthrough Monday when he had Mark Waugh out lbw for 36.
Waugh appeared unlucky with the ball seemingly destined to miss leg
stump.
	   Gough then added the scalps of Justin Langer and Darren Lehmann
to have figures of 4-52 at lunch and leave England in a good
position to press for a first innings lead.
	   Langer batted almost three hours for a dour 44 before a lapse in
concentration cost him his wicket.
	   The No.3 attempted a cover drive from Gough's bowling but edged
to Nasser Hussain, who held a smart catch head high in the gully.
	   Lehmann, recalled to the side in favor of Ricky Ponting, made
just 13 before becoming Gough's fourth victim. His edge gave
wicketkeeper Warren Hegg a first test dismissal.
	   Steve Waugh had 37 and Ian Healy five at the end of a session
extended by 30 minutes because of the opening day washout.

Wachter beats Meissnitzer, clinches first victory of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) _ In June, Anita Wachter was lying on an
operating table for the second time in four months, having grim
thoughts about the end of her career.
	   Six months later, the Austrian veteran put the exclamation point
on a strong comeback from knee surgery by impressively winning a
World Cup giant slalom race on home territory.
	   A jubilant Wachter called Sunday's victory _ her first in almost
three years _ ``incredible.''
	   ``I knew could be in the top three today, but the victory is a
big surprise,'' she said after denying teammate Alexandra
Meissnitzer a third straight giant slalom victory.
	   Meissnitzer, the favorite and overall World Cup leader, finished
a relatively distant second and said she had no chance against her
countrywoman.
	   Wachter sped down the fast, perfectly prepared Hirschenkogel
course in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 7.90 seconds,
beating Meissnitzer by 0.74 seconds.
	   Coming back from a severe knee injury suffered in a crash last
season in Cortina, Italy, Wachter won her first race since January
1996. Her previous season's best had been third in a giant slalom
at Val d'Isere earlier this month.
	   ``I gained a lot of self-confidence from that race,'' Wachter
said.
	   When Wachter, the 1993 overall World Cup champion, put her skis
on again after four months of rehabilitation, she knew she wouldn't
be able to compete in speed disciplines anytime soon.
	   She decided to pursue World Cup points in slalom and giant
slalom only, a move which has brought her third place in the giant
slalom standings after four events.
	   ``I didn't know how my knees would react to a full load,'' she
explained. ``Now I see it was a good decision.''
	   She added: ``I risked a lot today, more than anyone else.''
	   The 31-year old Austrian, on the women's alpine skiing circuit
since 1985, hopes for a podium finish at the alpine skiing World
Championships at Vail, Colorado, in January.
	   ``I proved to myself I'm still good,'' she said.
	   Meissnitzer squandered her chances on the second run, in which
she finished a disappointing tenth.
	   ``In the last few days, the pressure was pretty high,'' the
Austrian champion said.
	   Praising Wachter for her performance, Meissnitzer said she
wouldn't have won even if she hadn't been so cautious in the second
run.
	   ``Today I simply had no chance,'' she said.
	   Finishing eighth in the first run, Norway's Andrine Flemmen came
home third in a combined 2:09.33, posting a brilliant second leg.
	   Despite being beaten Sunday, Meissnitzer boosted her lead atop
the overall World Cup standings, where she sits with 891 points.
	   Germany's Martina Ertl, seventh in Sunday's race, is second with
504, followed by Austrian Renate Goetschl with 485.
	   The World Cup circuit continues Monday with a night slalom at
the Hirschenkogel.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks advance in morning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-morning stock, bond and currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in thin
end-of-year trading Monday morning. The gain lifted shares of
Japanese exporters, driving stocks in Tokyo higher.
	   The dollar bought 116.92 yen as of mid-morning, up 0.79 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York and London were
closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 35.67 points,
or 0.26 percent, to 13,833.62 at the end of morning trading. On
Friday, the average closed up 91.22 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   In currency dealings, trading was sluggish as many overseas
markets remain closed for the year-end holiday period or open with
reduced staff.
	   Pessimism about the Japanese economy weighed on the yen in what
little buying took place, said traders.
	   But that was good news for the stock market, where exporters
rose on expectations the cheaper yen would boost their sales in
overseas markets.
	   Gains were limited, however, as many investors stayed out of the
market at the end of the year.
	   ``There aren't many participants today, and a notable lack of
foreign activity,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.90 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,085.86. The
TOPIX closed up 8.78 points, or 0.82 percent, on Friday.
	   A lack of participants also restored calm to the bond market,
which had swooned last week amid concerns increased government
borrowing would flood the market with new bond issues.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 1.750 percent, unchanged from Friday's finish. Its
price remained at 100.40 yen.

Dozens of homeless evicted from walkway in Osaka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hundreds of officials began evicting some 35
homeless people inhabiting tents and cardboard shelters along a
walkway in western Japan's largest city, a municipal spokesman
said.
	   The city of Osaka ordered the evacuation after local residents
complained that noise produced by the homeless was disturbing
classes at a nearby junior high-school, said spokesman Katsuya
Matsumoto.
	   The homeless clashed with security guards and lit bonfires in an
attempt to hinder the evacuation, Matsumoto said. About a thousand
day laborers turned up to support the walkway dwellers, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The homeless had refused earlier instructions to leave
voluntarily, prompting the local government to clear out the area
by force, Matsumoto said.
	   Some 230 city officials backed up by Osaka prefectural, or
state, police were carrying out the evacuation, Matsumoto said. The
make-shift dwellings were being piled up and carried away on
trucks.
	   The city, about 408 kilometers (255 miles) west of Tokyo, plans
to install large flower boxes along the walkway to prevent the
homeless from setting up camp there again.
	   The ranks of Japan's homeless have been swelling in recent years
as the country's severe recession forces more and more people out
of work.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at
least two crew members and leaving at least 15 sailors and two
yachts missing.
	   The two dead were found on the 12-meter (40-foot) vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search
and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra.
	   ``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is
tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's
only two people who have died in it before,'' said Australian
Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray.
	   He said owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant
Phil Skeggs, both from northern Tasmania, were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two times the
yacht rolled, Gray said. Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness.
	   Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter,
the center said.
	   With winds gusting to 145 kph (90 mph) and seas swelling to 10
meters (35 feet), the race continued even as rescue teams searched
for the missing vessels.
	   There was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when
the 9-meter (30-foot) boat rolled in wild seas Sunday night near
Gabo Island, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne.
	   The missing boats were veteran cutter Winston Churchill and Solo
Globe Challenger. Another yacht reported missing, the B-52, was
found Monday.
	   Despite the conditions, Campbell said it was unlikely the race
would be called off.
	   At least 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer
(725-mile) race. Many lost their masts or have injured crew.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A doomed ship, space rocks, combat and comedy
combined to propel Hollywood to a record year at the box office,
pulling in nearly dlrs 7 billion in North America alone.
	   The industry reaped the benefits of ``Titanic,'' which was
actually released in late 1997 but racked up dlrs 488 million in
1998. That pushed the movie's total to a record dlrs 600 million in
North America.
	   So popular was the sinking ship epic that it was still
collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars a week at the box
office even as the video version was being released.
	   Studios also benefited from a wide range of successful _ though
not record-shattering _ movies, including 11 that grossed more than
dlrs 100 million and a 12th, ``A Bug's Life,'' that was likely to
hit that milestone this weekend.
	   And movie executives cited changes in exhibition, particularly
the increasing number of megaplexes that offer dozens of screens,
cleaner lobbies and more comfortable seats.
	   ``Finally, the excellent motion picture has the opportunity to
play in the excellent theater,'' said Disney distribution head Phil
Barlow. ``I believe the movies are considerably better, but the
theaters are tremendously better.''
	   That dlrs 7 billion North American total was an increase of more
than 9 percent over last year.
	   Attendance also jumped more than 5 percent, to 1.46 billion
tickets sold, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
	   Since 1988, domestic receipts have surged 56 percent, while the
average ticket price has gone up just 16 percent. Attendance has
increased 35 percent, while the population has risen about 11
percent.
	   The boom in movie grosses, however, is being offset by
increasing costs. The average movie cost dlrs 53.4 million to make
plus dlrs 22.2 million to sell in 1997, and the numbers likely were
higher in 1998.
	   ``We have to continually buck the tide of increasing costs,''
said Rob Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture
Group.
	   Still, studio officials are encouraged by the year-end numbers.
	   In 1998, Paramount and Disney had more than dlrs 1 billion each
in domestic grosses, while 20th Century Fox topped dlrs 730 million
and Sony and Warner Bros. each neared dlrs 700 million.
	   Universal, however, had a string of flops that led to a
management shakeup. The Seagrams-owned studio took in only dlrs 330
million _ about a 5 percent market share.
	   Only one movie passed dlrs 200 million _ ``Armageddon'' with
dlrs 202 million _ though ``Saving Private Ryan'' came close with
more than dlrs 190 million.
	   Instead, the spoils were spread around to a greater extent than
in the past.
	   Other movies joining the dlrs 100 million-plus club were
``There's Something About Mary'' (dlrs 173.7 million), ``Doctor
Dolittle'' (dlrs 144.1 million), ``The Waterboy'' (dlrs 140.9
million through Dec. 20), ``Deep Impact'' (dlrs 140.5 million),
``Godzilla'' (dlrs 136 million), ``Rush Hour'' (dlrs 133 million),
``Lethal Weapon 4'' (dlrs 129.7 million), ``The Truman Show'' (dlrs
125.6 million) and ``Mulan'' (dlrs 120.6 million).
	   ``A Bug's Life'' had dlrs 96.3 million going into the weekend,
with plenty of juice left in its release.
	   A wide range of genres scored at the box office. While
``Armageddon'' and ``Godzilla'' did well by offering traditional
summer escapism, ``Ryan'' attracted a large audience with an
unflinching look at war.
	   And three of the Top 5 movies made people laugh: ``Mary,''
``Dolittle'' and ``The Waterboy.''
	   ``The big story coming out of this year was that comedies did
really well,'' said ``Dolittle'' producer John Davis. ``You had a
lot of big-grossing family kind of pictures that appealed to a
little older family audience.''

Japanese authorities to pursue criminal probe of bank executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Authorities have launched an investigation into
possible criminal wrongdoing by executives at three large Japanese
banks that failed recently under the weight of bad loans, a
newspaper said Monday.
	   Tokyo prosecutors and police will probe top executives of Nippon
Credit Bank Ltd., the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., the Asahi newspaper reported.
	   Both agencies refused to comment on the report.
	   Authorities will look into whether management had broken any
laws as they presided over their banks' demise, the article said.
The investigation is highly unusual in Japan, where the stiffest
penalty faced by executives is usually a public apology and
resignation.
	   A focus of the investigation will be whether executives lied in
reporting the size of their banks' problems to investors and
officials.
	   Suspicions emerged after the collapse of Hokkaido Takushoku in
November of last year, when authorities discovered the bank had bad
or risky debts of 2.5 trillion yen (dlrs 21 billion) _ three times
what the bank had been telling the public.
	   Government auditors have discovered similar discrepancies at
Nippon Credit Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank after they were
placed under government control this year.
	   On Friday, the Financial Supervisory Agency announced its audits
discovered that the country's 17 largest still-functioning banks
had also underreported their bad loan problem by as much as 6
trillion yen (dlrs 51 billion).

Cracks widen in Japanese coalition talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cracks widened in a deal to form a coalition
government in Japan on Monday, when a top opposition leader said
the ruling party was not serious about cutting a deal, and a
government spokesman said a disagreement over defense could torpedo
the alliance plan.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal
Party had been expected to soon wrap up a coalition plan in the
works for weeks that would bolster the LDP's standing in
parliament.
	   But the talks have snagged over how far to expand the
participation of Japanese troops in U.N. missions. The LDP wants to
limit Japan's military to logistical support, while the Liberals
are pushing for a broader interpretation of the constitution
allowing troops to fully participate in U.N.-backed multinational
operations.
	   The dispute blocked progress in talks on Sunday and forced the
postponement of a meeting between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa scheduled for Monday morning.
	   Ozawa on Monday suggested the LDP lacked the will to follow
through on its deal with the opposition.
	   ``There is little eagerness (on the part of the goverment) to
definitely implement the agreement. That's where the situation
stands today,'' Ozawa said. He said that unless the government
demonstrated more willingness to go ahead with the deal, it would
be useless to have talks between the heads of the two parties.
	   The government, meanwhile, stood by its refusal to change its
interpretation of the U.S.-written constitution, which restricts
the Japanese military to defense operations and prohibits offensive
military action abroad.
	   ``We've already reached agreement with Ozawa that there will be
no change in the interpretation of the constitution,'' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters in Okinawa on
Monday. ``If the Liberal Party insists on more, we'll have to go
back to square one.''

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ The beard is grayer, the cheeks are thinner and
the hands jutting from the military uniform are mottled with age
spots, sometimes seeming to tremble.
	   Age may be Fidel Castro's greatest triumph. Against all odds,
the revolution he led celebrates the 40th anniversary of its
victory on Jan. 1.
	   Little over those decades has turned out the way anyone
expected. But almost every Cuban life has been radically
transformed: some for better, some for worse, and some for Miami.
	   The revolution has outlived decades of U.S. attempts to
overthrow it. The Soviet ally has long outlived the Soviet
motherland. Spanish hotels are now more important than Russian
missiles.
	   And yet, as in the bygone times of John F. Kennedy, Nikita
Khrushchev and Francisco Franco, Castro remains firm, vowing
``socialism or death.''
	   The era began shortly after midnight on Jan. 1, 1959, when
dictator Fulgencio Batista, his army crumbling, fled by airplane
from Havana's Camp Columbia to exile in the Dominican Republic.
	   Soon afterward, Castro appeared in the eastern city of Santiago
to make his first speech as the country's apparent new leader.
	   ``Personally I am not interested in power, nor do I envisage
assuming it at any time,'' he told celebrating supporters.
	   Cuban independence hero Jose Marti _ not Karl Marx _ had been
the guiding spirit of insurrection. The rebels promised multiparty
elections. Their support extended far into Cuba's middle and upper
classes, weary of Batista's thuggish regime.
	   In magazine advertisements, Coca-Cola welcomed ``the resurgence
of democratic liberties.'' The magazine Bohemia ran grisly
photographs of people tortured or killed by Batista's police and
editorials insisting the revolution was not socialist.
	   Even the U.S. government tentatively welcomed Castro, though
shadows appeared within days as circus-like people's courts _
apparently with popular support _ began taking revenge on alleged
war criminals of the Batista regime.
	   About 200 people were executed within three weeks, causing
international protests. Historian Hugh Thomas estimated 5,000
people might have been executed by 1970, though in more recent
years capital punishment has been rare.
	   ``Fidel always had support, always had and has it,'' said
Faustino Cruz Acosta, then a 44-year-old contractor from
Jovellanos, 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Havana on the route
of Castro's January 1959 procession to the capital.
	   If one of the revolutionary leaders returned to visit, ``the
whole town would come out to see him again,'' Cruz said. ``Whether
they eat or do not eat is another matter.''
	   The new, proudly nationalist government clashed frequently with
the United States as it steadily moved to the left _ enacting land
reforms, nationalizing U.S. oil companies, trading with socialist
countries.
	   U.S. officials who at first welcomed Castro began backing
efforts to topple him. That led to the CIA-organized Bay of Pigs
invasion in 1961 _ at the same time Castro declared for the first
time that Cuba's revolution was socialist.
	   With U.S. trade cut off, the government leaped toward a
Soviet-style economy even as Castro took control of the Cuban
communist party. Opposition parties were banned and opponents were
muzzled, accused of backing Yankee efforts to topple the
government.
	   Within a few years, most private farms and all private
businesses had been expropriated.
	   Cruz's family lost about 120 acres (50 hectares). In exchange,
he receives a pension of 130 pesos a month _ now worth about dlrs
6.50 on the free market.
	   Many people fled and others remained neutral or silent. But
Castro kept the allegiance of many Cubans thrilled by his defiance
of the United States or happy at the sweeping social programs that
dramatically improved Cuba's health and education.
	   In 1961, 300,000 volunteers spread across the island to educate
Cuba's 985,000 illiterates using textbooks with phrases such as
``We win liberty, guided by Fidel.''
	   Half of Cuba's 6,000 doctors fled Cuba shortly after the
revolution. But today the country boasts a surplus of doctors _
62,000 for a population of 11 million.
	   Almost every neighborhood has a free family doctor who has
morning office hours and goes house-to-house in the afternoons.
	   Dr. Ernesto del Pino, a 26-year-old internist at a Havana
neighborhood clinic, makes less than 300 pesos _ dlrs 15 _ a month.
But he receives rice rations good for about one serving a day, plus
some beans, some oil, a bit of ground meat.
	   ``Without the revolution, it would not have been possible for me
to study medicine,'' he said.
	   The farmers market a block from the clinic sells beans for 16
pesos (80 cents) a pound, cassava for 1 peso (5 cents) a pound,
tomatoes or cabbage for 6 pesos (8 cents) a pound and some meats
for about 20 pesos (dlrs 1) a pound. One pound equals 0.45
kilogram.
	   Cuban salaries now average about 200 pesos a month _ about dlrs
10. Some pensions are as little as 60 pesos _ dlrs 3.
	   With free housing, Cuban rations were once generous enough that
most people could save money on such salaries. But the collapse of
communism in eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991 ended huge
economic subsidies from the Soviet bloc and forced dramatic
cutbacks.

HAVANA: dramatic cutbacks.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Castro's government adopted measures it had once seen as
socialist heresy: foreign capitalist investment, legal use of
dollars, small-scale private businesses and some private sale of
farm produce.
	   Today dollars from tourism and more than dlrs 500 million a year
sent to relatives from Cubans abroad help keep the economy afloat.
	   The government blames dollars and tourism for an upsurge of
street crime and prostitution _ vices that had almost been wiped
out after the revolution.
	   Yet even those who practice a bit of private capitalism often
admire Cuba's socialist heroes.
	   ``Che means a lot to us,'' said Luis Madero, who farms a small
private vegetable patch beside a monument to revolutionary hero
Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara in the central city of Santa Clara.
	   He admires Guevara's practice in the early 1960s of leaving his
office as planning minister in Havana to ``pass the day working as
a laborer.''
	   The refugee exodus began with Batista and his cronies, then
spread across the wealthy and middle classes in 1960 and 1961 as
Cuba veered toward socialism. By the early 1990s, Cubans were
fleeing largely to escape a stultifying economy.
	   The refugees and their offspring total roughly 1 million today.
	   The Havana they left behind is still largely intact physically,
if crumbling.
	   Ten families live in the former house of Rafael Diaz Balart, an
undersecretary in Batista's government and the father of the
vociferously anti-Castro U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz Balart.
	   A peeling memory of paint clings to the once-elegant house that
rises above a rutted street overhung with untrimmed trees.
	   On one side of the house Rosa Rodriguez and Orlando Echeverria
share a small apartment with their 16-year-old daughter.
	   Rodriguez's father, Emilio, was given the apartment as a wounded
veteran of the struggle against Batista. But Emilio abandoned Cuba
in 1980. Money he sends from New York has helped the family buy a
stereo and puts food on the table.
	   ``If my family calls for me, I will go,'' Rodriguez said when
asked about leaving Cuba. ``But not for me.
	   ``This one,'' she said, nodding at her daughter, ``is crazy to
leave.''

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from Fidel Castro's first speeches following the
triumph of the revolution at the beginning of 1959:
	   ___
	   I am not interested in power nor do I envisage assuming it at
any time. All that I will do is to make sure that the sacrifices of
so many compatriots should not be in vain, whatever the future may
hold in store for me. ...
	   We shall exile hatred from the republic, that hatred which is a
damned and evil shadow bequeathed to us by ambition and tyranny.
...
	   There will be freedom for those who speak in our favor and for
those who speak against us and criticize us. There will be freedom
for all men.
	   _Jan. 1, 1959, in Santiago.
	   ___
	   Let us not deceive ourselves into believing that what lies ahead
will all be easy. Perhaps all that lies ahead will be more
difficult. ...
	   The worst enemies of the Cuban revolution in the future may be
the revolutionaries themselves. ... We must be more demanding of
the rebel soldiers than of anyone.
	   _Jan. 8, 1959, at Camp Columbia, Havana.
	   ___
	   The problem is that the people of Cuba want to mete out justice
and the enemies of the Cuban revolution do not want this. ...
	   When the total number of ruffians who will be shot is
calculated, they come to fewer than the number they (ousted
dictator Fugencio Batista's forces) murdered in a single town. ...
	   No one has a right to import standards for the people of Cuba
from abroad.
	   _Jan. 17, 1959, at presidential palace, Havana.
	   ___
	   The revolution is not weakened by attacks. On the contrary, it
waxes and gains strength. ...
	   Those who agree with the justice that is being carried out,
those who agree that the henchmen should be shot, raise your hands.
... Gentlemen of the diplomatic corps, reporters of the entire
continent: The jury of a million Cubans (has voted).
	   _Jan. 21, 1959, in Havana.
	   ___
	   The Cuban government does not wish to be the enemy of the
government of the United States, nor the enemy of any government in
the world. ... (But Cuba) has the right to follow its own political
line, the same right that the United States has to follow its own,

Sextuplets born in China; two die
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A set of sextuplets has been born in northeast
China's Liaoning province in an extremely rare case of multiple
natural conceptions, but two of the babies have died, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
	   Of the four boys and two girls born last Wednesday to a
33-year-old woman in the Liaoning capital of Shenyang, one boy and
one girl died Saturday evening of lung hemorrhage, according to
staff at the No. 2 Hospital at the China Medical University.
	   ``We've lost one baby boy and one baby girl. They were the
lightest ones of the six,'' Xinhua quoted Dr. Mao Jian of the
hospital's Newborn Intensive Care Department as saying.
	   Hospital workers said the other babies were in stable condition,
but not yet out of danger.
	   ``Conditions of prematurely born babies change extremely
rapidly. Though the rest of the babies have overcome respiratory
difficulties, there could possibly be other problems,'' Mao was
quoted as saying.
	   The Xinhua report said the sextuplets were naturally conceived,
and cited experts saying the likelihood of a woman giving birth to
sextuplets was one in 400 billion.
	   The babies were delivered by Caesarean section when their mother
Yao Hong, who was then 28 weeks pregnant, experienced delivery
problems. The largest of the infants weighed 1.17 kilograms (2 1/2
pounds), Xinhua reported.
	   The boy who died was the lightest of the six babies and weighed
only 495 grams (17.3 ounces). The girl, who weighed 610 grams (21.4
ounces), died despite a blood transfusion and the use of a
respirator, the report said.
	   ``It's not surprising to me. The two babies were too small when
born,'' Xinhua quoted the father, Li Quanyou, as saying after being
told of the deaths.
	   The hospital went on alert following the birth, the first set of
sextuplets to be born at the hospital. Thirty doctors and nurses
were continuously monitoring the condition of the babies, the
report said.
	   It said the couple had a 12-year-old daughter and that the
father, Li, was a twin.

For newborn and others, Hurricane Mitch means sickness, hardship

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When Hurricane Mitch swept through Central
America, the areas it hit hardest were among those least able to
take it. Thousands were killed and millions were left homeless in
Nicaragua and Honduras, two of the hemisphere's poorest countries.
The storm pushed people already in desperate condition even further
toward misery and starvation. The Associated Press spent time with
one such family. Here is their story.
	   ___
 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ Finally, when the fiery sun was
beginning its descent toward the banana trees and the swarms of
flies were at their densest, Johanna stopped crying.
	   The 3-month-old had been wailing nonstop all day. Now, the only
sign she was alive was her cream-colored, vein-streaked tummy,
which rose and fell with each tiny breath.
	   Her mother poked Johanna's cheek. There was no response. She
tweaked the infant's jaw, flapping her mouth open and shut. Johanna
didn't move.
	   On the highway in northwestern Honduras, there was no escape
from the sun. Mother and daughter were waiting for food near a
lean-to where they have lived since Hurricane Mitch filled their
rented room with mud.
	   Johanna's mother knew that if they went inside, the family might
go hungry. But she sighed and returned to the 5-foot (1.5-meter)
-high tent of sticks and plastic sheeting, scattering flies as she
lowered her baby onto the torn, mud-caked mattress.
	   In the lean-to, it was even hotter, but the sun didn't beat
down. And they didn't miss out on any food _ the relief truck never
came.
	   ___
	   Johanna's mother is 17. Her name is Maria Elena Aguilera, but
everyone calls her Maria Magdalena.
	   Maria's mother wanted her to be a nun. She took her to church
every Sunday, and made her sing in the choir.
	   But when Maria was 15, a man a decade older began coming by. To
Maria, Jose Hipolito Burgos seemed worldly. He was from the same
squalid neighborhood, but he talked of the plantation where he cut
green bunches of Chiquita bananas.
	   His hands were rough and dirty, but they were strong.
	   Maria's mother tried to run Jose off, but she couldn't stop the
two from meeting for walks on Saturday afternoons.
	   It was on one of their walks that Jose said to Maria: ``I want
to steal you.''
	   She didn't say yes, but she didn't say no. When he came for her,
she went along.
	   ___
	   The fights, Maria said, began almost immediately after she moved
in.
	   ``Trash!'' ``Good-for-nothing!'' Jose would scream. Maria knew
better than to talk back, but sometimes he would hit her anyway,
she said. (He said he didn't want to talk about it.)
	   Sometimes she would cry herself to sleep. Sometimes she would
flee to the house of her older sister, Guillermina.
	   Always, when she left, Jose would show up the next day. ``My
heart,'' he would say, ``Let's go.''
	   She always would.
	   ___
	   It was Aug. 3, and Maria was sweating with pain. Her belly felt
like it was about to explode.
	   So although it was an entire day's wages, her husband paid 60
lempiras (dlrs 4.50) for an ambulance to a hospital in the nearest
city, San Pedro Sula.
	   Johanna Guadalupe was born almost as soon as the ambulance
pulled up to the emergency room, a healthy 7-pound (3-kilo) girl.
	   The next day, mother and child went home by bus. They had to
transfer twice.
	   ___
	   Separating the Chamelecon River and La Lima's Sept. 23
neighborhood _ known as ``the 23'' _ are a barren dike and a soccer
field, and whenever it rains hard the water overflows.
	   Twice before, Johanna's parents had lugged their mattress, their
threadbare couch, their two boxes of clothes and their radio up to
the highway, the highest point nearby.
	   When the river began rising Oct. 29 after three weeks of rain
brought by Hurricane Mitch, the family set out again, putting up a
lean-to on the highway and figuring they would be back home soon.
	   As expected, the streets turned to mud, but the water didn't
stop rising. It covered the houses; only the leaves peeked out from
the banana plantations. It reached the bottom of the highway
embankment, then climbed that as well.
	   The people on the highway were terrified. With water on both
sides, they had nowhere to go.
	   And then, although the rain still lashed down, the water
stopped. The residents of ``the 23'' and their tents sat on an
island of cement, surrounded by water.
	   They had been saved.

	   ___
	   The day after the neighborhood flooded, trucks rolled in to
carry people to safety. Johanna's family went along, leaving
Maria's brother-in-law to watch their possessions.
	   Along with hundreds of people, the family was dropped at a
convent in San Pedro Sula, where each was assigned a spot on the
concrete floor.
	   There was no food the first day and not much after that, so for
the first time in her life, Maria went with her sister Guillermina
to beg.
	   A friend who went with them rang doorbells, and a fat man gave
her some beans and a little milk for her baby.
	   Maria and Guillermina watched, but couldn't bring themselves to
try. Their children went hungry.
	   After three days, the family returned to the highway. There was
nothing to eat, and Jose joined other men in swimming into the
nearby field to drag back bunches of bananas.
	   Some he sold to passing trucks. The rest the family ate.
	   It was all they had for a week.
	   ___
	   Home is the northern side of the divided highway between San
Pedro Sula and El Progreso.
	   Traffic in both directions shares the south side of the highway
for a half-mile (one kilometer). Drivers gawk at the filthy
children playing between the tents, and at the horses grazing in
the garbage on the highway embankment.
	   Rotting banana peels, plastic wrappers and human feces litter
the area, and wash into the tents when it rains. Flies are
everywhere.
	   Little aid has arrived since Mitch struck. When aid comes, the
scramble is frightening.
	   One afternoon, a truck pulled up to the edge of the settlement
to hand out bananas. Hundreds of people _ including Jose _ lined
up, jostling one another for the food.
	   In the line, one gang member elbowed another. The rival gang
member drew a gun and took a shot, grazing his enemy in the leg.
	   ``They wanted to kill each other over a banana,'' Jose scoffed.
	   The driver sped away. There would be no aid that day.
	   ___
	   Guillermina, who has two children, was criticizing Maria again.
	   ``Hunger is what that baby has. And not for that juice you give
her. She needs milk.''
	   Maria started to protest, but quietly set water to boil for
powdered milk.
	   ``If that baby is sick, what are you doing bathing her?''
Guillermina said. ``You're young. You don't know anything about
suffering. You're just beginning to know what suffering is.''
	   Maria clutched Johanna tighter and gave her a long kiss. When
she brought her face up, tears were streaming down her cheeks.
	   She blew on Johanna's face to cool her, then wiped her own eyes
with her forearm.
	   ``It's hard here for the baby,'' she said. ``I think she's in
bad shape.''
	   ___
	   The next morning, Johanna was still crying and her forehead was
wet with sweat.
	   So Maria put black shoes on her baby's tiny feet and flip-flops
_ her only shoes _ on her own and headed for La Lima's health
center, a government clinic staffed by two medical students.
	   At the clinic, the waiting room and the porch were crammed with
women and babies. The receptionist weighed and measured Johanna: 11
pounds (5 kilos), 23 inches (58 centimeters). Small for three
months.
	   After an hour, Jose showed up and sat down to wait with his
family. He soon dozed off. The sun rose in the sky. Maria chatted
with other women.
	   Occasionally, Maria checked with the receptionist. Wait, she
said. Sixty-seven women were ahead of her.
	   After six hours, a nurse told Maria to take Johanna inside.
Medical student Bianca Sandoval asked a few questions and listened
to Johanna's chest with a stethoscope.
	   She said she wasn't sure what was wrong with Johanna, but
prescribed some antibiotics, as well as something for fever and
some rehydration packets.
	   She told Maria that Johanna should have only breast milk.
	   Maria said OK and looked at the floor, too ashamed to say that
she had stopped breastfeeding a month earlier.
	   ___
	   Jose is building a new house.
	   The landlady of the tiny room the family rented wanted more
money, but Jose can't afford it _ he still owes dlrs 22 on a sickly
horse.
	   So he made a deal with a friend: They would build a one-room,
wood-slat shack against a row of concrete houses the friend owns,
and Jose would pay dlrs 9 a month rent.
	   They started by chopping down the fruit tree that stood in the
middle of the lot. Jose said he could turn the stump into a table.
	   Maria hasn't been to the site, but she's excited anyway.
Anything to get out of the tent.
	   ``The highway is dirty and full of sickness,'' she said.
	   Jose continues to work odd jobs, renting a cart to sell bananas
to little restaurants or to collect garbage for tips. He knows
he'll never be rich, but he's confident his family will survive.
	   ``No one humiliates me. Any job they give me, I say, `Let's
go.''' Jose said.
	   ``Thanks to God my family has never had to go hungry. I pray to
God that they never will.''

Children the weakest victims of Afghanistan's protracted war
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The little girl shyly opens a tiny
tattered white purse to reveal her treasure _ a carefully folded
piece of traditional Afghan unleavened bread.
	   Food is a precious commodity on the streets of Kabul, especially
for the city's weakest residents, the children orphaned by
Afghanistan's long war.
	   Sameera is 8. Two years ago, her parents and brothers died
during one of the relentless rocket assaults that ravaged Kabul for
four years while rival Islamic factions fought for control of the
capital.
	   Sameera, too, was injured.
	   Leaning on a friend for support, Sameera removes her sock to
show a gaping hole in her ankle. ``Shrapnel,'' she says matter of
factly. Then she gently pats her shin, thigh and chest to show
where other pieces of an exploded rocket shredded her body.
	   She smiles and points to the wrecked buildings behind her.
``That's my home down the street,'' she says. She lives with her
aunt.
	   Sameera is with a band of children, all parentless, skipping
home from a morning of clandestine classes where they were learning
to read. The Taliban religious army, which now rules Kabul with a
strict hand, has barred girls from attending school.
	   International aid groups estimate 28,000 children live on the
streets of the city, many of them scavengers like Sameera's friends
who start out before daybreak to collect wood and garbage to sell
and burn.
	   In a survey a year ago, the United Nations Children's Fund found
that two of every three children interviewed had seen someone
killed during the fighting in Kabul. About seven in 10 had lost a
close relative to the war.
	   Even sadder, virtually every child surveyed expected to die a
violent death, the report said.
	   Many children in Kabul spend theirs days scavenging and their
nights fighting off the cold and nightmares.
	   Seven-year-old Zia's father died when a rocket hit near their
home. The boy found the mutilated body on the doorstep, and most
nights and often during the day he relives his father's death.
	   ``Now when I see the electricity pole where he fell, I see my
father,'' he says through an interpreter. ``I cry at night. It
still is a shock to my brain.''
	   Zia attends a school for street kids run by a Swiss-based group,
ASHIANA. The organization gives the children two hot meals and
three hours of classes every day.
	   While talking with a reporter, Zia stuffs a piece of bread in
his tattered jacket and whispers he will give it to his brother at
home.
	   Because of the Taliban's ban on girls attending school, the
ASHIANA group each month distributes flour, tea, sugar and rice to
young girls who are living on the street. Mohammed Yousuf, an
administrator with ASHIANA, says the group has registered 650 boys
and about the same number of girls.
	   At Kabul's largest orphanage, where 400 children live, there is
no money for shoes for the smallest children. They huddle around a
single wood-burning stove for heat and most have a constant cough.
There is little medicine and several children lie bundled in dirty
woolen blankets, coughing and shivering.
	   One little girl, barely 5, apparently has a degenerative nerve
disease that leaves her weak and wracked by muscle spasms. But the
orphanage staff can neither identify the illness nor do they have
medicine to treat her.
	   ``Sometimes she is just screaming ... we have to carry her to
the bathroom. Her legs are too weak,'' says Dil Jan, an elderly
woman who has worked at the orphanage for 17 years.
	   ``Before it was always the fighting ... now there is no
fighting, but there is no bread, no heat, no clothes for the
children. It's becoming worse and worse.''
	   The International Red Cross supplies fuel to the orphanage, but
other aid groups that once helped out have left Kabul in protest
over the Taliban's order to relocate to war-damaged university
dormitories.
	   ``We have sick children, but we don't even have the cost of a
taxi to take them to the hospital,'' says Maulvi Mohammed Asif, the
orphanage's director.
	   ``To see this,'' Asif says, looking around at his orphanage,
``it is a humanitarian failure.''

Report: Queen Victoria's love letters found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Love letters exchanged between Queen Victoria and
her gamekeeper, John Brown, have been discovered in an attic in
Scotland, a British newspaper reported Monday.
	   The cache, which also included photographs of the couple, had
been stored for many years in a trunk belonging to one of Brown's
descendants at a home near Balmoral Castle, the royal estate in
Scotland, The Times said.
	   The unusual relationship between Queen Victoria, who was
mourning the death of her husband Albert, and her servant sparked
many rumors in the mid-1860s _ and was also the focus of the hit
1997 movie, ''Mrs. Brown.''
	   While researching the movie, the executive producer Douglas Rae
and writer Jeremy Brocks were alerted to the letters by one of
Brown's descendants, who is now living in Canada, the newspaper
said. The woman, who was not named, gave the filmmakers access to
the letters, which had been hidden in her sister's home in
Scotland.
	   ``We sat and read all the correspondence between Victoria and
Brown and there is no doubt in my mind they were written by two
people who were very, very close and shared an intimate
friendship,'' Rae was quoted as saying. ``We even found a Valentine
card from the queen which read `to my best friend JB from his best
friend VR.'''
	   Rae said the family allowed them to use background material
gleaned from the letters in the movie, but specific details were
kept secret.
	   ''The family has decided nothing will be made public while the
present members of the royal family ... are still alive,'' Rae was
quoted as saying.
	   The discovery of the letters was announced to coincide with the
television premier of the film in Britain.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Five hours of secret talks and a ``final'' offer
from the commissioner didn't do much.
	   With 1 1/2 weeks left until the possible cancellation of the
entire season, NBA owners and players still can't make a deal.
	   The opposing sides held a secret meeting _ David Stern called it
an ``attempt to salvage the season'' _ Sunday at a hotel outside
Denver. It ended with the sides still apart on several key issues.
	   ``I really don't think there will be a season,'' said Jeffrey
Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer. ``We've gone as far as
we can go. We're done.''
	   The league improved its proposal in several areas, and the union
offered further restrictions on the salaries of the highest-paid
players.
	   ``We advised the union that no further offers will be made,''
Stern said in a statement that described both sides' proposals as
final offers.
	   Union director Billy Hunter disagreed.
	   ``We offered a comprehensive proposal to the NBA,'' Hunter said.
``The NBA countered our proposal and we indicated to them that we
were willing to negotiate further, which unfortunately they were
unwilling to do at this time.''
	   Despite the dire forecasts from the league, there remains time
to save the season. The league's Board of Governors will meet Jan.
7, and the commissioner has said he will recommend canceling the
remainder of the season if no accord is reached by that date.
	   The dispute is threatening to cause the first cancellation of an
entire season for the first time in the history of North American
professional major leagues.
	   ``I think the season is virtually gone,'' Mishkin said. ``I've
been here for 20 years, and I've never seen this kind of
intransigence from the union.''
	   The league improved its offer in several areas:
	   _ On the percentage of revenue to be shared with players, the
league moved one point to 53 percent in year four, 53.5 percent in
year five and 54 in year six.
	   _ The league agreed to keep the dlrs 1 million exception in its
current form, whereby it can be used once every two years to exceed
the salary cap to sign an additional player.
	   _ Owners agreed to the union's proposed limit of a 10 percent
escrow tax on player salaries in years four, five and six of the
agreement.
	   _ The NBA increased its proposed minimum and maximum salaries,
with the biggest increases for players with between seven and nine
years of experience.
	   _ Owners offered a 25 percent raise for players under the rookie
scale who have their option picked up for a fourth year.
	   ``Unfortunately, this was not enough for the union,'' Stern
said.
	   The exact concessions offered by the union weren't immediately
clear, although the players were thought to have changed their
offer on a maximum salary to include all players with less than
nine years' experience instead of seven years' experience.
	   The union said Hunter will discuss the union's latest proposal
in detail Monday.
	   Plans for Sunday's meeting, held at a hotel near Denver's
airport, weren't finalized until Saturday night. The league was
represented by Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and special
assistant Bob Lanier. The union as represented by Hunter, president
Patrick Ewing and chief outside lawyer Jeffrey Kessler.
	   The meeting developed following Wednesday night's secret session
in Los Angeles between Stern and Hunter.
	   No further talks are scheduled, and a deal must be made by
mid-January to salvage a 45 to 50-game schedule.

for 56 percent in year four and 57 percent in year six. He said the
league refused to budge off many of its demands, including an end
to opt-out clauses and sign-and-trade deals, changes to the group
licensing agreement and a loss of Larry Bird rights for any player
traded during the final year of his contract.

	   At Irving, Texas, the Dallas Cowboys became the first team to
sweep all of its NFC East games in a season, defeating Washington
behind Emmitt Smith's two touchdown runs, giving him the NFL career
record.
	   Dallas finished the season 10-6 overall and 8-0 against the NFC
East, sweeping Washington for the first time since 1994. The New
York Giants almost accomplished the eight-game sweep last season,
but they were 7-0-1.
	   Under new coach Chan Gailey, the Cowboys turned their record
around from a 6-10 season that cost Barry Switzer his job.
Washington had a four-game winning streak snapped and completed the
season at 6-10 under Norv Turner.
	   Dallas will meet Arizona (9-7) in Texas Stadium on Saturday in a
first-round NFC playoff game.
	   Smith broke the NFL record for career rushing touchdowns on a
1-yard run in the second quarter. A 51-yard pass from Troy Aikman
to Michael Irvin set up the score, the 124th rushing TD for Smith,
breaking a tie with Marcus Allen.
	   Smith struck again on the Cowboys' next possession as he broke
three tackles on a 26-yard touchdown run.

Singapore: No takers now that busking is OK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ After years of banning buskers from Singapore's
clean and orderly streets, the government has decided the
occasional, licensed musician or juggler would add color and draw
visitors to the city-state.
	   But now it's too late.
	   Very few want to do it, as the idea for performing for money on
the street has acquired a negative image in people's minds. It is
also associated with begging or poverty.
	   There has been little response to the National Arts Council's
recent request that colleges and arts schools encourage their
students to perform on the streets, government television reported
Monday.
	   Parents ``think it's not a very nice and decent thing to do,''
said Robert Casteels, head of the Music Department at the La
Salle-SIA College of the Arts.

	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) _ Rookie defenseman Tom Poti scored early
in the second period and Mikhail Shtalenkov made 24 saves for his
second shutout of the season as the Edmonton Oilers beat the
Vancouver Canucks 3-0 Sunday night.
	   Pat Falloon and Kelly Buchberger also scored for the Oilers
(15-16-3).
	   The Oilers ended a 0-for-35 power-play drought when Poti opened
the scoring at 2:34 of the second period with his third goal of the
season. It was Edmonton's first power-play goal since Dec. 8 in
Nashville.
	   The Oilers, who outshot the Canucks 34-25, are 3-0 this season
against Vancouver.

Sextuplets born in China; two die
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hospital confirming birth, deaths

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A set of sextuplets was born in China to a mother
who hadn't used fertility drugs, but two of the babies died several
days after birth, hospital workers said Monday.
	   Of the four boys and two girls born last Wednesday to a
33-year-old woman in the Liaoning province capital of Shenyang, in
northeast China, one boy and one girl died Saturday evening of lung
hemorrhage, said Sun Ya, a researcher at the No. 2 Hospital at
China Medical University.
	   ``They were the lightest ones of the six,'' the state-run Xinhua
New Agency quoted Dr. Mao Jian of the hospital's Newborn Intensive
Care Department as saying of the two babies who died.
	   The other infants were in stable condition, but not yet out of
danger.
	   ``Conditions of prematurely born babies change extremely
rapidly. Though the rest of the babies have overcome respiratory
difficulties, there could possibly be other problems,'' Mao was
quoted as saying.
	   The hospital said the babies were the first naturally conceived
sextuplets in China. The Xinhua report cited experts saying the
likelihood of a woman giving birth to sextuplets was one in 400
billion.
	   The babies were delivered by Caesarean section when their mother
Yao Hong, who was then 28 weeks pregnant, experienced delivery
problems. The largest weighed 2 1/2 pounds, Sun said.
	   Sun said the hospital had been swamped with visitors and
requests for media coverage since news of the birth was disclosed.
	   Earlier this month in Houston, a woman gave birth to octuplets.
On Sunday, the smallest of the babies weighing just 10.3 ounces
(288 grams) died of heart and lung failure. Their mother, Nkem
Chukwu, had used fertility drugs.

	   BRANDON, Manitoba (AP) _ Goaltender Roberto Luongo played an
outstanding third period, helping Canada tie Slovakia 0-0 Sunday at
the World Junior Championships.
	   Luongo brought the crowd of 6,000 packed into the Keystone
Centre to its feet, and stopped 36 shots overall for his shutout in
Canada's first game of the tournament.
	   Slovak goaltender Jan Lasak stopped 31 shots from Canada, which
gained its first scoreless tie in tournament history.
	   Canada, which is attempting to improve on its eighth-place
finish in Helsinki in January, takes one point into Monday night's
game against defending champion Finland in Winnipeg.
	   Luongo made two stellar glove saves on Slovak defenseman Peter
Smrek from the blue line during a Slovak power play in the third
period. Luongo then stopped Martin Cibak on a breakaway.
	   Slovakia, which has more players from the Quebec Major Junior
Hockey League than Canada, placed ninth in the last tournament. But
the Slovaks were coming off of a 3-2 win over their border rivals,
the Czech Republic, on Saturday which gave them confidence.
 &UR; Belarus 2, Kazakhstan 2
	   At Portage La Prairie, Manitoba, Nikolai Antropov scored with
2:08 left in the third period to lift Kazakhstan into a 2-2 tie
with Belarus at the world junior hockey championship on Sunday.
	   Antropov, the Toronto Maple Leafs' 1998 first-round draft pick,
beat Andrei Fralou to give Kazakhstan the tie in its first game in
the tournament. Sergey Miroshnichenko scored the other Kazakhstan
goal on a first-period power play.
	   Andrei Shavialiou and Yauheni Kryvamaz scored in the third
period for Belarus (0-1-1), who lost 4-3 to Switzerland on
Saturday.
	   In Sunday's other game in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada tied
Slovakia 0-0.
	   In other games Saturday, it was: Sweden 4, Russia 2; Finland 6,
U.S. 3; and Slovakia 3, Czech Republic 2.
