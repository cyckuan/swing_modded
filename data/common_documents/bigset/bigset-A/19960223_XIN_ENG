KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A two-day post Beijing women
conference seminar opened today in Entebbe, 40 kilometres south

<HEADLINE> IFOR General Meets with Serb Army Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) Sector Southwest commander held talks
with the Serb Army's 1st Krajina corps commander in Banja Luka
today on military aspects of the implementation of the Bosnian
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
British Gen. Michael Jackson and Serb Gen. Momir Talic held
their last meeting on January 24, also in Banja Luka, six days
before Muslim police arrested two Serb army officers, which had
led to the suspension of relations between the Serb Army and the
IFOR.
</P>
<P>
The British general said he had agreed with the corps commander
on concrete steps and all modalities for taking over the areas of
Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo, towns placed under Serb control in line
with the Dayton accord, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The two towns in central Bosnia were captured by Croat forces
in October last year. Before handing them back to the Serb control
on February 19, the Croats had looted and burned down many houses
in these towns.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Jackson said they had discussed the important date of D
plus 120 days since the signing of the accord when the armies of
all sides should withdraw to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Talic said the talks had been very fruitful and there had
been no problems so far in implementing military aspects of the
peace accord in the part regarding the 1st Krajina corps and the
IFOR's 4th armored division under Gen. Jackson's command.

LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Two British Navy airmen were
killed earlier today when a Royal Navy Sea Harrier fighter plane
crashed in thick fog over western England.
</P>
<P>
Western Country ambulance service said that the two men were
found dead in the wreckage of the jet, which crashed four miles
southeast of Wellionton near Taunton.

<HEADLINE> London City to Take New Security Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Corporation of London is
planning to take new security measures in an attempt to preempt an
escalation of the IRA's mainland terrorist campaign, it was
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times said that Corporation officials are urgently
consulting businesses, police and neighboring local authorities
on a scheme that would include more checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Security officials in London fear that the latest IRA campaign
is not a one-off but could be developing into something more
brutal and longer term.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the current IRA campaign in mainland Britain
has a potentially much harder edge to it than any previous
violence that the City remains one of the crucial potential
targets.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that the IRA may have trained young recruits to
carry out a variety of terrorist attacks, ranging from bombings to
assassinations and even mortar attacks.
</P>
<P>
The growing security view is that unless the IRA could be
persuaded to restore its ceasefire, its hardliners will decide
that there is no alternative to a big escalation of the terrorist
campaign, with little attention being given to early warnings or
the number of casualties, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Proposes to Exchange Prisoners with SLA Militia, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced here today a proposal to release 19 militiamen of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA), now held by the Shiite
fundamentalist group, in exchange for some prisoners jailed by
the SLA militia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the southern suburb of the Lebanese
capital, Secretary General of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah Hassan
Nasrallah announced that all the prisoned SLA militiamen are
in the hands of the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
"I affirm that the militia of Lahd has not any prisoner
with other Lebanese and Palestinian parties," the Hezbollah
leader said in the Khomeini Cultural Center. "All the
prisoners who are members of Lahd's militia are held by the
Islamic Resistance."
</P>
<P>
Major general Antoine Lahd is commander of the 3,500-strong
militia.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of his prisoners could be solved in exchange for
all the male and female, Lebanese and Palestinian detainees in
the Khiam prison, and that is our suggestion," Nasrallah added.
</P>
<P>
He refused to call those detained by Israel and Antoine
Lahd "prisoners" since "they were not taken from the
battlefields but arrested or seized at border-crossings or on
roads, or taken from their houses, shops, farms and fields."
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that there are more than 200 Lebanese
people locked by Israel and its client militia in the hilltop
jail at Khiam in Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah confirmed that there are two bodies of Israeli
soldiers who were held by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, but
denied that his party has any information on the missing
Israeli navigator, Ron Arad.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a separation between the problem of the
prisoned SLA militiamen and the case of the missing Israeli
soldiers, he proposed a settlement for the second problem by
exchanging the missing Israeli soldiers with the Lebanese and
Palestinian detainees in the prisons inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
He rejected to link his proposal with a progress in the
Middle East peace process, saying the file is open just on
the occasion of the Aid Al-Fitr (the Moslem festival marking
the end of the fasting month of Ramadan).
</P>
<P>
"The problem of the detainees and the prisoners has no
relations with a progress of the negotiations or its stalemate
but on the occasion of the al-Aaiyad (festivals) the file
is opened," the Hezbollah leader said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the press conference, Hezbollah distributed a
list of the 19 SLA militiamen captured by the Shiite militant
group.
</P>
<P>
Israel says it has convincing informations that two Israeli
soldiers, Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, died after their
capture by Hezbollah guerrillas in an ambush in south Lebanon
on February 17, 1986.
</P>
<P>
It also says a third serviceman, air force navigator Rod Arad,
might be alive and held by a contingent of the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards based in east Lebanon. Arad was captured
after his plane was shot down in South Lebanon on October
16, 1986.

UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Leticia Ramos-Shahani,
a leading advocate for population policies in the Philippines, and
Pathfinder International, a U.S.-based non-governmental
organization, will share the 1996 Population Award.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Julio Armando Martini, chairman of the
Committee of the United Nations Population Award.
</P>
<P>
Leticia Ramos-Shahani, a member of the Philippine Senate, was
chosen for her more than 30 years of leadership in the field of
population. She is the leading exponent of the issue of population
and its implications for social development, public health and
environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
She is also active internationally as a member of the Asian
Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, the
Global Committee of Parliamentarians on Population and Development
and the International Green Cross. Moreover, she has served in the

Nairobi, Kenya, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Pathfinder International, founded in 1957, was chosen for its
38 years of sustained effort in developing and improving family
planning programs and creating awareness of population issues. It
worked hard to provide funds, contraceptive supplies and technical
assistance long before the U.S. government began supporting
population programs.

<HEADLINE> Saddam's Daughters Granted Divorces from Husbands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's two daughters have been granted divorces from their
husbands Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother who defected to
Jordan last August, local sources said today.
</P>
<P>
But the source did not say who has given Saddam's two
daughters - Raghad and Rana - permission for their divorces. It
said that a judge will most probably give a final verdict to their
divorces.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's two daughters presented a demand on Thursday to get
divorce from their husbands.
</P>
<P>
"They are refusing to stay married to men who betrayed the
homeland, the trust and the lofty values of their noble families,"
the official Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two daughters of the president said in their report that
they did not know the fact of their husbands' defection in Jordan
after Hussein Kamel appeared in the press conference. They
immediately asked to see daughters of King Hussein of Jordan and
informed the monarch's daughters that they did not know the real
intentions of Hussein Kamel.
</P>
<P>
The president's two daughters also demanded to meet King
Hussein to tell him the truth and so he could allow them to return
to Iraq. But the meeting with King Hussein failed under the
pretext that the monarch had no time and he was busy, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel and his brother, along with their families,
returned to Iraqi territory on Tuesday evening after the Iraq's
supreme body, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) and the
Ba'th Socialist Party decided to accept their return.
</P>
<P>
Three days before they set their feet on Iraqi territory,
Hussein Kamel sent a letter to President Saddam, demanding their
return and the president presented his letter to RCC for decision.
</P>
<P>
The agency said on Tuesday that the RCC and Iraq's Command of
the Arab Ba'th Socialist Party have decided to accept an appeal
put forward by Hussein Kamel and to allow him to return to Iraq as
"an ordinary citizen."
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel, after his arrival in Jordan in last August,
vowed to topple Saddam's government. Opposition Iraqi groups in
exile, however, shunned him because he had been part of Saddam's
inner circle.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel was the former head of Saddam's weapons programs,
and his brother Saddam Kamel was the deputy head of Saddam's
palace security before his departure.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that NATO remains the cornerstone of
Europe's security and defence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the special session of the Western European Union
(WEU) Assembly today, Major said that the end of the Cold War does
not mean that Europeans need not to be ready to defend themselves
and keep the Atlantic Alliance together.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, "NATO and American presence remain the bedrock
of our common security. We must keep the Alliance strong, both for
collective defence and for new operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Major made it clear that Europe will also have to
shoulder more responsibilities of safeguarding European security
more directly by mounting smaller-scale operations.
</P>
<P>
The Western European Union (WEU) is uniquely well qualified to
shoulder this responsibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the current WEU presidency state, Major promised that
Britain would make great efforts to make the WEU fully
operationally capable as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the significance of building a better
dialogue with WEU's associate partners in central Europe and the
urgent need of giving substance to the WEU's relations with Russia
and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Kuwaiti Economic, Trade Ties Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The economic and trade relations
between China and Kuwait developed rapidly during the past year
and the trade balance tilted for the first time in favor of
Kuwait, a Chinese diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yongliang, economic and trade counselor in the Chinese
embassy here, made the remarks in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua on the eve of the Kuwaiti national day, which falls on
February 25.
</P>
<P>
The initial statistics of the first 10 months of 1995 showed
that the value of China's imports of chemical fertilizers and oil
from Kuwait totaled 100 million U.S. dollars while China's
exports of different items to Kuwait were estimated at 80 million
U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation between the two countries were given
a new momentum after the signing of a protocol on establishing two
oil complexes and extending pipelines at a cost of 400 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The protocol which was signed by the Kuwaiti Oil Company and
the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) was described by
the Kuwaiti government as a "new leaf in the history of
Chinese-Kuwaiti economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Yang attributed this development to the two countries' desire
to strengthen their friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the first country in the Persian Gulf region to
establish diplomatic ties with China and adopted the "one-China"
principle, thereby gaining the love and respect of the Chinese
people and government.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC took part in putting out the fires of the Kuwait oil
fields following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The Chinese fire
fighters extinguished the fires of 10 oil fields in Barqan area.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti company for foreign petroleum explorations
possesses 14.7 percent of shares of Yaqing oil field, south China,
whose investment cost 1,200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the most important overseas markets for Kuwaiti
fertilizers and the total value of the exports of the Kuwaiti
Petrochemicals Company to China was estimated at some 330 million
U.S. dollars between 1980 and 1993. The company owns 30 percent of
the shares of the Chinese-Arab Company for Chemical Fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-Kuwaiti relations are expected to witness a
remarkable progress in the fields of economy, technology and
trade.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expounds Position on Its EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government
today reacted sharply towards reports from Brussels, saying that
Greece's moves to stop Ankara receiving European Union (EU)
funds could jeopardize the island's prospect of joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said Cyprus will not permit its EU
application "to become an object of extortion" over Greco-Turkish
differences.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cyprus government has received no
official notice that the recent developments in Brussels will
have any kind of consequences on its application to join the
EU.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman indicated that "if they address us,
we will disagree strongly with them."
</P>
<P>
Similar views were expressed by the President of the House
of Representatives, Alexis Galanos, when commenting on press
reports. According to the reports, EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek
stated that despite no legal connection between Turkey's customs
union with the EU and the start of Cyprus' accession talks,
the two issues are politically connected.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in July 1990. It signed
an association agreement in 1972 and a customs union agreement
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers decided on March 6, 1995, to
start accession talks with Cyprus six months after the end of
the EU 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.

<HEADLINE> UK,Ireland Seeking New N. Irish Peace Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish governments
were seeking a new formula leading to all-party negotiations in
Northern Ireland and were hoping to announce it at a summit
meeting next week, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The formula was intended to merge Dublin's proposal for
preliminary talks, Britain's proposal for elections to a
constitutional convention and the idea of a referendum set out by
moderate nationalists in Northern Ireland, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The framework of a new formula emerged after a series of talks
between British and Irish governments as well as between officials
of the two countries and the parties concerned in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
However, with UK security chiefs predicting further bombings in
the IRA's campaign on the British mainland, officials were said to
be extremely cautious about expecting further progress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, serious obstacles remain in reaching an agreement,
notably how to treat Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing which has
refused to condemn the bombings or the end of the ceasefire.

Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs
yesterday that parties would be obliged to endorse principles of
the 1993 Anglo-Irish declaration, which has led to the first
ceasefire, to be granted entry to talks.
</P>
<P>
An Irish official also said that the ceasefire must be restored
before the governments of the two countries can get a political
framework into which Sinn Fein could enter.
</P>
<P>
A summit is expected between British Prime Minister John Major
and his Irish counterpart, John Bruton, next Wednesday.

<P>
The meeting has been delayed because both governments are
adamant it must lead to a substantive announcement demonstrating a
common approach to a political settlement, in spite of the
resumption of IRA violence.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Israel Agree on Joint Tourist Packages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The tourism ministers of
Cyprus and Israel discussed here today ways of promoting tourism
between the two countries and reached an agreement on the
promotion of joint tourist packages in third countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kyriakos Christofi, Cyprus
Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, said that around 2.2
million tourists visit the island annually while 2.5 million
visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
Noting that tourists to Cyprus and Israel come from different
markets, Christofi said the joint tourist packages, agreed on by
the two countries, aim at bringing those who visit Cyprus to
Israel and vice versa, thus benefiting both countries, as it will
open up new markets for them.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the same issue, Israeli Minister of Tourism, Uzi
Baram, said that it was agreed to "promote joint package
destinations in the U.S., Japan, South Africa, Britain, Germany
and Korea."
</P>
<P>
"In this context, we studied the problems connected with the
air links between Cyprus and Israel for tourists coming from the
third countries," he said, stressing that solutions must be found
for prices and routes.
</P>
<P>
"We will coordinate our action in the frame of the
regional tourism association MEMTTA, where Cyprus holds the
chairmanship," Baram said.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two ministers also discussed the
possibility of exchanging information and expertise as well as
the establishing of a joint committee on specialized issues
relating to tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister, who arrived here this morning for a
two-day official visit, had separate meetings today with President
Glafcos Clerides, Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides, Primate of
the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos, and
Nicosia Mayor Lellos Demetriades.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Baram will also meet owners and directors
of hotels and travel organizations and award the certificates to
Cypriot participants in the "Tourism for Peace Conference", held
in Israel last September.
</P>
<P>
The conference was initiated by the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, and the certificates to be given out were
signed two days before his assassination.

<HEADLINE> Israel Declines to React to Espionage Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel has shunned public
response to a report of U.S. Congress which indirectly accuses
Israel of scientific and technological espionage activities in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Prime Minister's Office noted today that
the report published only in The Washington Times and that the
Israeli embassy in the U.S. has not been approached in this
matter.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by the General Accounting Office,
"Country A," which The Washington Times Thursday said referred
to Israel, "routinely resorts to state-sponsored espionage, using
covert intelligence-collection techniques to obtain sensitive
U.S. economic information and technology."
</P>
<P>
The FBI and CIA, according to the report, consider the
technology leaks "a significant threat to national security."
</P>
<P>
Israelis in the U.S. were reportedly involved in stealing
"sensitive technology" applicable to the manufacturing of
artillery gun tubes, and in obtaining secret information by
monitoring the Pentagon's communications, The Washington Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
Companies involved in such activities are connected to
corporations in Australia, Austria, England, Canada, Denmark,
France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and
Switzerland, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, a Defense Department memo alluded to American
Jews as foreign agents for Israel. At a hearing of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, Chairman Arlen Specter quoted the memo as
saying that many of the U.S.'s "military friends" represent
America's "economic industrial threat."

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Starts Home Loans War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Nationwide Building Society,
Britain's third largest mortgage lender, Thursday sparked a new
round of mortgage rate wars by cutting the cost of borrowing to a
30-year low.
</P>
<P>
In a move which it estimated will cost 200 million pounds (306
million US dollars) in a full year, the society cut its home loan
rate by 0.45 percent to 6.99 percent from April 1, while
increasing rates for savers by an average of 0.25 percent on March
1.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide's move is meant to show that it thinks it is better
to remain a building society than converting to a bank.
</P>
<P>
All its nearest rivals, Halifax, Woolwich and Alliance and
Leicester, plan to become banks next year, releasing free share
bonuses for their members.
</P>
<P>
The rate changes will cost the Nationwide half of its expected
profits for the year to April 1996-97 and cutting its margin
between savings and borrowing rates to about 1.7 from about 2.2.
</P>
<P>
Its chief executive Brian Davis said that had Nationwide chosen
to become a bank, it would have paid out about 200 million pounds
in dividends to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The new mortgage rate is the lowest since February 1965 and is
the third rate cut for borrowers so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two largest lenders responded with a mortgage
rate reduction, which would have forced the rest of the market to
follow.
</P>
<P>
Both Halifax Building Society and Abbey National, the home
loans and banking group, cast doubt on whether Nationwide could
sustain its move to narrow its net interest margin by 0.7
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Ebola Outbreak in Gabon Seems to Be Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of the deadly Ebola
disease in Gabon appears now to be brought under control after
infecting at least 20 people with 13 deaths since early February.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Philippe Stroot told
a press conference today that the number of cases and deaths from
Ebola remained essentially unchanged during the past four days.
</P>
<P>
All of the Ebola cases were reported to have originated in the
village of Mayibout, located in a remote area of northern Gabon.
Suspected cases are currently under surveillance in the same
region, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO attributed the relatively limited spread of the Ebola
outbreak in Gabon to several key factors. One was the rapid
response by the Health Ministry of Gabon to quickly isolate the
actual and suspected cases of the highly infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor was a large-scale information campaign
conducted by the local government to inform the public about
Ebola, its mode of transmission and ways to avoid infection.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in contrast to last year's large-scale Ebola epidemic
in Zaire which struck an urban zone, the outbreak in Gabon
occurred in a rural area with low population density, a natural
advantage in limiting the further spread of infection, the WHO
said.
</P>
<P>
Having established sufficient control measures, an
international medical team is now conducting a retrospective
investigation of the outbreak in Gabon to try to make clear how
the outbreak took place, and what is the natural host of the Ebola
virus.

NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- India's major opposition

The party's central leadership decided to continue the

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Up in US Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
plunged in December but rebounded 4.4 percent in January despite a
weakening economy, the Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The department said in report that housing starts had declined
by 5 percent in December, helping to push housing starts last year
down by 7.3 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Construction of new homes and apartments totaled 1.45 million
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate last month, up from 1.39
million in December.
</P>
<P>
New construction rose in all regions except the South last
month, while in December, they fell in all regions except for the
West.
</P>
<P>
The report combined the data from December and January, which
had been delayed by the partial federal government shutdown at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the January rebound, a membership survey in early
February by the National Association of Home Builders suggested
builders remain cautious about the housing outlook.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits -- often a gauge of future
activity -- fell 7.1 percent in January, to a 1.37 million annual
rate.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yeltsin Airs His Re-election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A caring father of needy
children and the true guarantor of reforms are images Boris
Yeltsin has tried to spruce up for his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
In his annual state-of-the-nation message delivered today
before the both houses of parliament and the cabinet, Yeltsin
drove home the message that the reform process had to be
readjusted pushed forward in order to ensure the welfare of his
people.
</P>
<P>
"The main lesson is that the reforms could have yielded a much
bigger outcome had not the reformers ignored a direct dialogue
with the people," said Yeltsin inside the Marble Hall of the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He laid bare the government's failure to attend to the social
well-being of Russians and threw down the gauntlet to his election
archrival, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, who has time
and again criticized Yeltsin for poor social protection, haphazard
privatization and the 14-month war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the coming election is "an extremely
important event" in Russian history. "If we can manage to
maintain political stability, the tasks of the present transition
will be fully accomplished," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the country will then embark on a path of
steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Though troubled by heart problems twice late last year,
65-year-old Yeltsin announced eight days ago in his hometown of
Yekaterinburg that he would run for a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Local observers, who took today's state-of-the-nation message
as Yeltsin's platform in the run-up to the June election, said
that the president seemed to have made clear to both his friends
and foes his intention to continue with current reforms.
</P>
<P>
"More investment and modern management, profit from
privatization and full-fledged protection of property rights --
all these will be the principal tasks of privatization this year,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The president told the parliament and cabinet that Russia has
completed the first and most difficult phase of the transition
from a planned economy toward a market-driven economy and the
second phase of stabilizing its finances.
</P>
<P>
Russia has entered the third and last phase which is expected
to stimulate production and investment, raise effeciency and
productivity and accomplishing a large-scale restructuring of the
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin attributed to poor discipline among top executives and
the prevalence of group interests above national interests such
shortcomings as unrealistic defence budgets, overdue payments,
soaring inflation, tax evasion and mismanagement of state property.
</P>
<P>
He promised to pay wages in time, to improve housing, to
support small enterprises, to compensate for losses and to insure
private savings in commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
But for all this to materialize, Yeltsin made it more than clear
that political stability, or rather consistency, and public
support would be necessary.

<HEADLINE> End of Fertilizer Monopoly Welcomed in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's commercial farmers
today praised the government for ending the fertilizer
distribution monopoly of Sable Chemicals, but called for measures
to avoid dumping of cheap fertilizer imports.
</P>
<P>
Commercial Farmers Union President Peter Macsporran said for
the first time farmers could buy directly from Sable, the sole
producer of ammonium nitrate and one of the top three
manufacturers in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are going for a free market system and while we ask for a
liberalized system for agricultural products, we can't at the
same time call for restricted supply of inputs such as
fertilizer," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In theory, this latest development should benefit us and
farmers can buy directly from the manufacturer. Hopefully prices
will not rise that much due to market forces as competition in
distribution will be introduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government announced this week that Sable's monopoly as
the sole distributor of fertilizer ends on March 1, after which
those interested in buying and distributing fertilizer could do
so.
</P>
<P>
The termination of the fertilizer monopoly was in line with
the government's policy of addressing the problem of monopolies
and other unfair business practices.

<HEADLINE> 10 Years Needed to Recover Oil Polluted Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The recovery of the Welsh
coastline polluted by 65,000 tons of oil spilled from the tanker
Sea Empress may take 10 years, a government pollution expert
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
David Bedborough, chief scientist from the marine pollution
control center, said that in comparison, the recovery from the
80,000 tons of oil spilled by the supertanker Braer off Shetland
in 1993 had taken a year.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Smith, chief scientist with the Countryside Council for
Wales, said that the situation for wildlife was "very serious".
</P>
<P>
He said that monitoring the spillage may last 10 years and
maybe longer as there were beaches where everything had been
destroyed by the slick, especially Angle Bay and other beaches
to the south of Milford Haven.
</P>
<P>
These beaches had been spawning grounds for sea bass and
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
Dolphins and porpoises have been spotted moving through the
slick around the wildlife sanctuary of Skomer. Monitoring missions
have been flown out to find what damage has been done to the
scooter ducks off Carmarthen Bay.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that marine mammals such as seals may ingest
some oil but it should not be fatal to them.
</P>
<P>
The Sea Empress was carrying 147,000 tons of oil when it was
stranded on rocks off the Welsh coast last Thursday. The remaining
oil is expected to be pumped out of the vessel which will then be
towed to a port for repairs.
</P>
<P>
The British government has rejected calls for an independent
inquiry into the oil spill but promised that marine accident
inspectors will scrutinize the salvage operation to prevent
further spillages.

<HEADLINE> Harare Water Rationing Remains in Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Harare's water situation is
worse than the time it was at last year and the city councillors
have recommended that water rationing remains in force until dam
levels rise further.
</P>
<P>
The city's Director of Works Tongai Mahachi told the council
on Thursday that at the same time last year lake Chivero, which
is the city's major water reservoir, was 80 percent full compared
to the current level of 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we consumed from 80 percent to 22 percent of the
water in the time before the onset of the 1995/96 rainy season.
So at this rate we are worse off and we have to be cautious about
removing punitive measures," Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
Water rationing, together with penalty charges for consumers
who used more than the stipulated monthly limit, was introduced
in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Most other cities in the country have already lifted the water
restrictions which were introduced at the height of the drought
last year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Harmless Laser to Shave Legs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Women who are bothered by their
hairy legs may be able to shave them by laser which, scientists
claim, will remove hairs once and for all and is "relatively
painless".
</P>
<P>
A prototype leg shaver, known as the Ruby Laser, was developed
in Wales by Professor Marc Clement of the Swansea Institute of Higher
Education, who discovered it by accident 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He was experimenting with lasers when he struck his arm
with a beam of laser light. He later found that the area hit by
the laser was bald and hair never grew back.
</P>
<P>
Clement and his colleagues started to make their prototype leg
shaver three years ago. The device, designed to remove unwanted
hair, has produced "extremely successful" results during trials by
plastic surgeons and may be available for clinical use in a few
years.
</P>
<P>
A third of the women who had their legs shaved by the Ruby
Laser six months ago reported that no hair grew back, while
another third of the women reported that less than half of their
hair re-grew.
</P>
<P>
Only a tenth reported that their hair was not removed at all.
</P>
<P>
The shaver is reported to work well on darker hairs because
they contain more light-sensitive pigment. But more experiments
are needed to test its effectiveness with redheads.
</P>
<P>
The shaver emits a 5-millimeter-thick beam of red light
directed at hair follicles. The laser light is absorbed by
granules around the root of the hair. The granules are "fried" to
prevent hair from re-growing.
</P>
<P>
The laser shaver is said to be speedy, efficient, and
relatively painless compared to traditional methods of
depilation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Constitutional Amendment Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Concerns over the proposed
constitutional amendment which seeks to deny Zimbabwean women
automatic right to live with their foreign husbands in the
country continue to pour in from various Zimbabwean organs.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Legal Resources Foundation today said the
proposed amendment overruled the supreme court ruling last year
which declared that a Zimbabwean woman married to a foreigner was
entitled to have her husband reside in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said it was inconsistent to provide for freedom
of discrimination on the grounds of gender and yet allow women to
be discriminated against on such an important issue as that of
who they may marry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile various organs met last week in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city to discuss the controversial issue.
These included the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace,
women's action group, Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association, Women
in Laws and Development, among others.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the organizations said, "we are
concerned that women seem to be used as one of the strategies for
such a limitation by denying them the right to stay and live with
their foreign husbands."
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa has said the proposed
amendments are based on a U.N. convention.
</P>
<P>
But the groups disagree, accusing Dabengwa of misinterpreting
the 1957 U.N. convention which sought to protect women married to
foreign husbands from being rendered stateless.

<HEADLINE> CBI Urges Rate Cut to Boost British Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) called today for an immediate quarter-point interest
rate cut to boost the British economy after slashing its growth
forecasts for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling its latest quarterly economic analysis, the
employers' organisation downgraded its prediction for 1996 growth
from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent, blaming a sharp drop in exports
and in construction plus destocking by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said: "We would
recommend a quarter-point cut in rates when the Chancellor of the
Exchequor and Governor of the Bank of England meet on March 7,
followed by another cut later."
</P>
<P>
The CBI analysis casts further doubt over the Treasury's three
percent growth prediction for 1996, although it is more upbeat
about prospects for 1997, when growth should hit three percent if
tax cuts are delivered in the next Budget.
</P>
<P>
It believes consumption will grow by 2.8 percent this year,
against a Treasury forecast of 3.5 percent, but pick up to 3.2
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Barker said that given the slowdown in the economy and the
risks posed by the weakness of key export markets, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer should move "soon" to underpin the consumer
revival.
</P>
<P>
"Prolonged economic weakness both domestically and in export
markets has resulted in further slakening of inflationary
pressures," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates could be reduced by half a point without
imperilling the government's inflation target," she added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Growth Slows Down Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased
by just 2.1 percent in 1995, the weakest performance since the
last recession, according to a U.S. Commerce Department report
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that the rise in the gross
domestic product(GDP), the broadest measure of economic health,
for all of last year was the slowest since the economy actually
shrank by 1 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The GDP had expanded by 3.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
U.S. commerce Department also said that Growth in the fourth
quarter was only an annual rate of 0.9 percent, a much slower
increase comparing with a 3.6 percent growth in the third-quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
It said the fourth-quarter increase was reduced by 0.25 of a
percentage point by the adverse effects of two partial government
shutdowns. They occurred as President Clinton and the
Republican-controlled Congress could not reach agreement on a
seven-year balanced-budget plan.
</P>
<P>
Other factors dragging down the fourth quarter's growth were
weakness in consumer spending and a big decline in business
inventories as businesses made an intense effort to reduce their
stockpiles of unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
The consumer spending, which accounts for two-third of the GDP,
rose at a small annual rate of 0.8 percent, following a 2.8
percent increase in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that growth in the current
January-March period will show little pickup from the fourth
quarter rate and the economy will avoid a recession.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve(Fed) has cut the interest rate for
three times since last July to spur the slowing U.S. economy and
the Fed is expected to further reduce the interest rate in coming
months.

<HEADLINE> India's CBI to File Sensitive Documents in Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) will file some "sensitive documents" in the
hawala case before a special court tomorrow to support charges
against three former cabinet ministers, the Press Trust of India
said today.
</P>
<P>
These documents, now in the custody of the Supreme Court, would
support the charges against former parliamentary affairs minister
V.C. Shukla, former human resources development minister M.
Scindia and former agriculture minister B. Jakhar.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers, who resigned last month in the wake of
CBI's seeking permission from the government to prosecute them in
the hawala case, an 18 million dollar bribery scandal, had been
accused of receiving huge payoffs to further the business interest
of some illegal foreign exchange traders (hawala traders).

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Industrial Index Loses Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean industrial
index, which analysts had hoped would reach the 5,000 benchmark
point of Friday, dropped 53 points to close the day at 4,898.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, it went up 32 points to a new record high of
4,950.7.
</P>
<P>
The index, measured against 58 quoted industrial counters, has
been on a bull-run during the past three weeks, achieving daily
record highs for more than 20 consecutive days on the back of
renewed investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Leading the rally have been the heavyweight agro-based
counters, responding to sustained rains which have fallen in
Zimbabwe since mid-January, giving rise to hopes that the key
agricultural sector will recover from last year's drought.
</P>
<P>
Already, analysts are predicting gross domestic product
growth, which fell to less than 2 percent in 1995, will this year
rise to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, despite hopes of economic recovery, deep-seated
problems, caused largely by high government spending, punitive
interest rates and rising inflation, remain.
</P>
<P>
The absence of news on progress by Zimbabwe to win back
crucial donor aid from the International Monetary Fund, has also
put a damper on business optimism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the seven-counter mining index on Friday also
dropped 7 points to close at 1,449.3, amid weak trading in the
gold and nickel counters.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China remains the largest
partner for Hong Kong's re-export trade, according to official
statistics released here today.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports accounted for 83 percent of the value of the total
exports and 39 percent of the total value of external trade of
Hong Kong in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figures for 1994 were 81 percent and 39 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the Census and Statistics Department, as a source,
re-exports originating in China accounted for 57 percent of Hong
Kong's re-export value in 1995. As a destination, China's share
was 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Much of the re-export trade involving China is related to
outward processing, as raw materials and semi-manufactured goods
are exported to China for processing, with the final products
subsequently returned to Hong Kong and re-exported to overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
Other main origins of Hong Kong's re-exports in 1995 included
Japan (12 percent), Chinese Taipei (7.5 percent), the United
States (5 percent) and South Korea (3.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
Other main destinations in 1995 included the United States (21
percent), Japan (6.3 percent), Germany (4.1 percent) and Britain
(2.9 percent).

TOKYO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto left tonight for Santa Monica, California, for his first
summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hashimoto is expected to touch on bilateral
trade disputes, the political situation on the Korean Peninsula
and the issue of U.S. military bases in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, billed as a "getting to know you" summit, is
scheduled to last for an hour on Saturday afternoon, Japanese
time.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is likely to focus on security issues "in some
detail", Japanese government officials said, while Washington will
be emphasizing trade.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Monday that the objective of the summit is to
reaffirm the Japan-U.S. security arrangement, strengthen bilateral
relations and build mutual confidence at the personal level.
</P>
<P>
He will also seek Washington's cooperation in resolving the
controversy over U.S. bases in Okinawa, arguing that the reduction
of U.S. bases there is vital in gaining the public's understanding
of the importance of bilateral security ties.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Compound Causes Weight Loss in Cancer Patients: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have found a
substance that causes life-threatening weight loss in almost half
of all cancer patients, the science journal Nature reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-identified wasting compound breaks down muscle tissue
and is suspected of inhibiting the human immune system, allowing
tumours to thrive, according to Professor Michael Tisdale of
Aston University in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
The wasting mostly affects cancer patients with solid tumors
such as those of the pancreas, lung, stomach and colon.
</P>
<P>
Between 10 and 25 percent of cancer-related deaths is caused by
wasting alone, said Tisdale, who reported the discovery.
</P>
<P>
But scientists also reported that an extract from fatty fish
may help to prevent weight loss.
</P>
<P>
Trial treatments to remove the wasting compound are being
conducted on pancreatic cancer patients in Edinburgh.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
carry out a protection plan to stop the use of cyanide in fishing
that is destroying the country's coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
Three private organizations have also joined forces to help the
government in carrying the plan by signing an agreement on
stopping the degradation of reefs caused by the use of cyanide in
fishing, according to the Pusaka Alam Foundation here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the three organizations -- the U.S.- based
Nature Conservancy, the Pusaka Alam Foundation and the Wallacea
Development Institute -- will launch a year-long campaign to raise
public awareness of coral reef degradation caused by harmful
fishing practices.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesian waters, these practices are often carried out by
local fishermen employed by foreign fishing companies. The use of
cyanide for catching the napoleon fish and groupers is common
among Indonesian fishermen, who pump cyanide into coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
According to E. Siswoyo, a member of the Wallacea Development
Institute's Executive Committee, most of the fishing companies and
boats that use destructive fishing practices are from Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Makes Pitch for Reelection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today made a pitch for his reelection campaign by implying in a
speech to parliament that his return to power would be key to
Russian reforms and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In his annual address to the two-chamber parliament, which was
widely seen as his campaign manifesto, Yeltsin said the
presidential election scheduled for June 16 will be "an extremely
critical moment" in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
He called on Russians to take "a responsible approach" to the
election.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to maintain political stability, the tasks of the
final stage of the present transition period will be fully
accomplished" and the country will embark on a path of steady
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, declared over a week ago in his hometown of
Yekaterinburg that he would seek reelection with the aim of
guaranteeing the continuation of reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform process had gone through the first two
stages and had now entered the third and final stage, in which
Russia should boost production and investment, raise efficiency
and restructure the economy on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to protect the social and economic
security of ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the Chechen problem had become a major headache
for Russia and he was ready to hold talks with all political
parties on ending the 14-month Chechen war. But he ruled out
negotiations with rebel Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.

JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
started a pilot project for an accreditation system designed to
improve the quality and services of hospitals, Health Minister
Sujudi said today.
</P>
<P>
Ten hospitals have been assessed for the government's

</P>
<P>
The results of the tests will rate hospitals according to their

Five aspects are being assessed for accreditation:
administration and management, medical services, treatment
services, emergency care, and medical records.

<HEADLINE> Russia Entering Final Stage of Reform: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
today that Russia has entered the third and final phase of its
economic reforms and stressed the need to protect the social and
economic rights of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the bicameral parliament in the
Kremlin, Yeltsin said that Russia had "completed the first, the
most difficult phase in its transition toward a market economy --
liberalization of the economy as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He said the country was now completing the second phase --
financial stabilization -- and entering the third.
</P>
<P>
In the third and last phase, the government would stimulate
production and investment, raise efficiency and productivity and
achieve large-scale restructuring of the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the president admitted that the economic situation was still
complicated and the country had failed to begin "a strategic
structural maneuver in favor of technology-intensive products".
</P>
<P>
Listing other shortcomings in the past year, he said that "the
defense budget has proved unrealistic; the debt crisis has not
been overcome; the collection of taxes and customs duties has been
poor, and a system of managing state property has yet to be
established".
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, had also failed to make 1995 a year of
effetive agrarian reform. "Not a single task set for the reform of
the agrarian sector has been accomplished," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president blamed the failures on poor discipline among top
executives and group interests prevailing over the interests of the
nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also admitted that the government was unable in 1995 to
curb inflation which was a prerequisite for bailing Russia out of
its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was possible and necessary to bring the rate of price
increases down to 25 percent a year in 1996, he added.

<P>
The mountain is now covered once again with snow, and the
streams, which dried up momentarily, are running again, and girls
are washing clothes in them again.
</P>
<P>
On the cobblestone pathways around the town, groups of women
are on their way to the bazaar, dressed in special clothing with a
seven-star pattern, a traditional symbol of the ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The Naxi are a minority that migrated from north China in the
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.), finally settling in Lijiang
during the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Li Xi, who is head of the local museum, said that the ethnic
minority has been threatened by calamities before, both those of
nature and of man, but the people remain calm in the face of any
disaster.
</P>
<P>
"The people strive especially for cultural survival," Li said,
"and always welcome cultural characteristics from the outside
world."
</P>
<P>
Lijiang's classical music, which is a combination of Taoist
music and Naxi folk music, preserves elements of Chinese musical
forms of 1,300 years ago, which have disappeared in most other
areas.
</P>
<P>
The culture's 500 murals, which were done over the past 300
years, melding Taoist, Buddhist, and Lamaist themes for the first
time with distinctive Han and Tibetan ethnic styles, are treasured
items.
</P>
<P>
The Naxi ethnic minority is also the only one to use a
pictographic system in the modern age.
</P>
<P>
"Lijiang's ancient books and murals have not been damaged by
the earthquake," said Li Xi.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, none of the 26 musicians who can play the ancient
music was injured, and the ancient musical instruments, which were
buried, have basically survived the quake, according to Xu Ke,
head of the local ancient music association.
</P>
<P>
"The city not only has a body, but a soul, which cannot be
destroyed by an earthquake alone," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Lijiang told UN inspectors that they will continue
to push for having the city's heritage listed among the World
Heritage.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhan, general secretary of the Chinese Committee of the
International Council on Monuments and Sites, said that Lijiang is
still in the running for the honor, because the city's design,
water courses, and scenic spots have all survived.

their early 20s, wearing ethnic costumes, were playing a melody
from the Song Dynasty (960-1279) called "Lang Tao Sha ('Waves wash
the sand').
</P>
<P>
The performance took place in Dayan Town, an ancient town of
the Naxi minority, in Lijiang County in the northwestern part of
southwest China's Yunnan Province. Lijiang was struck by an
earthquake that measured seven on the Richter scale early this
month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of UNESCO officials who came to inspect the
quake-damaged area, Xuan Ke, 68, a Naxi musician, said, "The
traditional art forms of the Naxi people were not destroyed by the
quake."
</P>
<P>
Dayan Town, an 800-year-old town at the foot of the snow-capped
Yulong Mountains, which has a well-preserved ancient style of
architecture, was at the center of the quake.
</P>
<P>
Water flows from the Heilong (black dragon) Pool in three
streams into the northern part of the town and flows among the
grey-tiled houses with whitewashed walls in the 1.4 square
kilometer town.
</P>
<P>
According to some of the older residents, when the quake hit on
the evening of February 3, snow up on the Yulong Mountains were
sprayed up into the sky and the water in Heilong Pool bubbled over.
</P>
<P>
When Deputy County Magistrate Chen Gang realized that a strong
earthquake had hit Lijiang, her first thought was: "The ancient
town of Lijiang must have been destroyed."
</P>
<P>
But something miraculous occurred. When she went there she saw
that the structures of most of the ancient houses in Dayan were
still standing and only the walls had been knocked down.
</P>
<P>
The wooden framework is the sole reason for the houses'
survival. "This means that the form of the ancient town has not
been affected," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Three of the major streets in Dayan were damaged. Three-meter
wide Guanyi Street, which was the most heavily damaged, was
covered with debris from house walls on both sides of the street.

<HEADLINE> France Registers Record Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- French exports leapt 9.2
percent in 1995 to contribute toward a record trade surplus of 105
billion francs (20.9 billion U.S. dollars), a senior trade
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The previous high was 87 billion francs (17.4 billion dollars)
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Yves Galland, minister-delegate to the ministry of economy and
finance, told a press briefing that exports from France occupied
an 8.65-percent market share among the 25 member states of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
French exports generated revenue of 1.427 trillion francs
(285.4 billion dollars) while imports rose 7.9 percent to 1.322
trillion francs (264.4 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The country enjoyed a trade surplus with all other European
Union members including Germany but it was in the red with the
United States and Japan, according to Galland, who is the de facto
minister of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that France will keep up its export and import
momentum in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Agrees To Compensate S. African Investor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government said
today that it is willing to compensate a South African forest
investing company and to negotiate a way out of their dispute.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government suspended an agreed investment plan
of a Mozambican-S. African joint venture, MosaFlorestal Co., to
plant 32,000 hectares of euclyptus in Matutuine region of
southern Mozambique, citing possible damage to local environment.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Agricultural Minister Carlos do Rosario insisted
that the move is purely out of ecological consideration, denying
it has anything to do with the construction of an
800-million-US-dollar tourist center by an American named James
Blachard III at the location.
</P>
<P>
Euclyptus is easy to catch fire and a plantation of those
trees are easy to touch off forest fire if no strict regulations
are imposed against it, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision was vehemently opposed by the South
African investor who cried out for an alleged loss of 4 million
US dollars that the suspension has caused for the company.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised that his government could either
compensate the company for the loss or to provide another piece
of land for the plantation plan.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Development of Education, Top  Priority in Kuwait  (by Yu Kaiyuan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Kuwait
is extremely concerned with the development of educational
services which consume over 10 percent of the country's gross
national income, the highest such expenditure in the world.
</P>
<P>
For instance, expenditure on education during the period from
1990 to 1993 has amounted to some 1,584 million U.S. dollars,
representing about 11.7 percent of the overall public
expenditure. Likewise, the average cost entailed per student in
the various stages of education has increased from 4,530 dollars
to 4,990 dollars from 1989/90 to 1992/93.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Government believes that education plays a decisive
role in attaining the cherished development targets, in promoting
and improving the national labour force, and in providing the
country's needs of technical, administrative, scientific and
vocational cadres.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Kuwaiti community has adopted the principle
of education for all, rendering basic education which covers the
primary and middle stages free and compulsory. It has gone even
further by offering school needs free, besides free meals and
clothing during the various stages of education, such services
being suspended a short time ago for parents who are capable of
providing. However, the State of Kuwait continues to provide
financial support to students in the higher education stage who
are in need of grants-in-aid, relieving their parents of the
living expenses of their sons and daughters throughout their
scholastic life. Moreover, all sequences of higher education in
Kuwait are free.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the State of Kuwait is providing free education to
illiterate adults who have missed the opportunity of going to
schools during their childhood, thus, reducing the rate of
illiteracy from 48.3 percent of the population in 1970 to 11.5
percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has also turned its attention to vocational training of
such special groups as the handicapped, enabling them to rely on
their own selves and to become productive elements rather than
satisfying their needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1994 national report on population and
development in Kuwait, public educational establishments have so
enlarged as to provide its services in 1992/93 to 100 percent of
children who have reached school age. Primary and medium level
schools have absorbed a total of 146,700 boys and girls, as
compared to 104,000 in 1980/81.
</P>
<P>
As to higher education, Kuwait has two establishments. First,
the University of Kuwait was initiated in 1966/67 with 26
sequences in the Arts colleges and 19 sequences in the Sciences
colleges. In 1993 the University of Kuwait had some 14,500
students of diverse nationalities enrolled in the various
sequences, Kuwaiti students representing 81 percent of the total
student body.
</P>
<P>
The second establishment is the Public Authority for
Applied Education and Training. It is at present in charge of four
applied educational colleges which comprise several sequences. The
number of students enrolled in the applied educational colleges
during the scholastic year 1992/93 amounted to 12,000 male and
female students.
</P>
<P>
To provide the necessary cadres for the country's development,
Kuwait has set in the new five-year development plan (1995/96 -
1999/2000) several targets for the short and medium terms. The
objective is to rely widely on the national work force in most
development sectors. When the five-year development plan
completed, the rate of Kuwait work force in certain productive
sectors will have exceeded 90 percent.

LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks are continuing to
expand into London, with a record total of 541 branches,
subsidiaries and representative offices in the city last year,
figures published today show.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five foreign banks opened offices in the city in 1995,
according to a survey conducted by Noel Alexander, a London-based
management consultancy specializing in banking.
</P>
<P>
Europe remains the most heavily represented region on the London
banking scene. At the end of last year, 228 European institutions
had banking operations or offices in the city.
</P>
<P>
Japan came second, with 52 Japanese banks represented in the
city, but will drop on the list as Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank of
Tokyo are scheduled to merge this year.
</P>
<P>
The American presence in London has recovered in recent years
after having declined from a peak in the early 1980s. The number
of U.S. banks rose to 51, with four more setting up offices here
last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey listed 38 Arab banks and 172 banks from other
regions of the world, including four established by Russia last
year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 foreign banks left London last year, six of them
prompted by mergers or takeovers of parent banks.

<HEADLINE> 800 Taiwan-funded Firms in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province had approved some 800 Taiwanese-backed enterprises by the
end of 1995, involving a total investment of 1.4 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, which encircles both Beijing and Tianjin, two of the
country's three municipalities, and borders on the Bohai Sea in
the east, has become a popular area for Taiwanese business people
in recent years as economic exchanges between two sides of the
Taiwan Straits grow.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last year, eight
Taiwan-funded projects each had an investment exceeding 10 million
US dollars. Cooperation has broadened out to building materials,
electronics, the chemical industry, and processing of farm produce
rather than the labor-intensive areas such as garments and food,
as in the past.
</P>
<P>
While funds have been put a great deal in small and
medium-sized projects, Taiwanese businessmen are also taking a
positive approach to some large projects and to infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang Taihe Market, which is to become China's largest
electronics products marketplace, involves a total investment of
300 million yuan (36 million US dollars) and is 90 percent
financed by Taiwanese, and is expected to have an annual turnover
of three billion yuan upon completion.

Israeli military sources say there are still warnings about
"terror raids" from Islamic extremists.
</P>

Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities have declared Nablus and
Kalkilya, two West Bank self-rule cities as "closed military
zones." Israelis are not allowed to enter.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Concerned About Zanzibar's Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said he was stunned by Zanzibar opposition's
refusal to recognize President Salmin Amour and his government.
</P>
<P>
"It's simply unacceptable," said Mkapa at a press conference
to mark his first 100 days in office on Wednesday, referring to
the statement released by Seif Hamad, vice-chairman of the
opposition Civic United Front (CUF) in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa reiterated that the political conflict in
Zanzibar must be resolved amicably through the Isles House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing what we have to do. What more attention do you
want me to give. I can't reverse the victory of Dr. Salmin Amour.
I have no such powers," said Mkapa, brushing aside the
accusations that his union government did not give enough
attention to the political crisis of the island.
</P>
<P>
"And what can I do about the CUF? These people say they don't
want negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa warned the CUF, which controls most of Pemba Island, of
the danger of retarding the development of the isles. Pemba is
one of the two major isles of Zanzibar off the Tanganyika
mainland in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
He called on the CUF to pursue its aims peacefully instead of
resorting to violence and other extremist means.
</P>
<P>
The Union President said although some foreign envoys had
expressed reservations over the electoral process in Zanzibar's
certain constituencies, none of those he met had rejected the
overall results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mkapa confirmed that under the Union
Constitution, the Zanzibar President is a member of the Union
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Amour failed to attend the first Union
Cabinet meeting because the Isles leader had other pressing
business.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait: Outstanding Achievements in Record Time (by Yu Kaiyuan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the fifth
anniversary of Kuwait's liberation from Iraqi occupation and of
the Kuwaiti national day, the Government of Kuwait is in a
position to boast of having accomplished great achievements in
rebuilding the country in a record time.
</P>
<P>
Once again, I was asked by friends who after roaming about in
the beautiful and neat streets of Kuwait: where are the remains of
the destruction caused by the war? They had already seen the
photos of the grave ruins and debris printed in newspapers and
broadcast by television. Such scenes are still vivid in their
memories as if they had taken place a few days back. But, in fact,
all such manifestations as well as fear, concern and pollution
have totally disappeared, and the Kuwaiti people are enjoying a
happy life under the umbrella of political stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Kuwaiti economy is undergoing steady development.
For example, oil production, the mainstay of national economy, had
suffered the greatest damage on account of the deliberate havoc
done by the retreating Iraqi troops which, having lost the Gulf
war in 1991, put on fire 700 oil wells, dynamited oil refineries
and tanks, and destroyed shipping docks.
</P>
<P>
In view of this devastation, Kuwait was compelled to spend 5-10
billion U.S. dollars in restoring all its oil facilities, the
production of crude oil had regained its 2.2 million barrel per
day level and the capacity of refineries returned to its pre Iraqi
invasion volume.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is presently seeking to expand its oil establishments to
further its role in the world oil market. It has signed a contract
at the end of last year with the Chinese Company for Petroleum
Engineering for the construction of two storage centers in its
western oil fields at a total cost of 400 million dollars, with a
view to increasing oil production capacity to 3 million barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
Besides oil production and refining, prompt measures are being
taken to put up a petrochemical complex in Kuwait at a total cost
of 2 billion dollars. Production of this petrochemical complex is
due to start in 1997. It is planned to produce 650,000 tons of
ethylene a year, to be transformed into 450,000 tons polyethylene
and 350,000 tons of ethylene glycol. These products are to be
marketed basically in the East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The state of Kuwait is sparing no effort at present to
diversify the sources of its income, and to reduce its dependence
on oil which is extremely sensitive to fluctuation of prices.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Council of Ministers has recently approved the
five-year development plan (1996-2000) to rectify diverse economic
and social conditions within the framework of economic reform,
including the restructuring of national economy, promotion of the
private sector's role, mending the deficit and maintaining a
balanced state budget.
</P>
<P>
Observers here unanimously believe that the Kuwaiti economy
will undergo better development so long as it seriously adheres to
the development plan. The plan entails the rationalization of
expenditures, increase of the non oil revenues through the
promotion of non oil industries, raising the prices of services
such as electricity, water, fuel and medical services, besides the
reduction or the total lifting of subsidies on certain consumer
goods.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Dissidents' Alternative Transition Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's dissident political
organization has proposed a three-stage transition process to be
conducted within one year, as an alternative to the three-year
transition scheme of the Sani Abacha government.
</P>
<P>
The first stage, expected to last one month, includes release
of all political detainees and Moshood Abiola, the presumed
winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election, to
head a government of reconciliation and national unity, the
National Democratic Coalition (nadeco), which was declared
illegal in 1993, said in a proposal.
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the proposal envisaged to last six months
would include the convening of the sovereign national conference,
which would produce a new constitution and restructure the
federation.
</P>
<P>
The final stage would include the promulgation of the new
federal constitution, establishment of new interim structures of
government and the holding of general elections at all levels to
be accomplished within five months.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was unveiled by nadeco's co-chairman and
frontline nationalist, Anthony Enahoro, at a reception held at
the Ikeja residence of detained Abiola Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha in his independence
day broadcast on October 1, 1995, unfolded a multi-phased
transition-to-civil-rule program, which will culminate on October
1, 1998 in the swearing in of a democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
Nadeco challenged the federal military government to subject
the two programs to a referendum to determine which would gain
wider acceptance from the people.

opportunities spawned by the Philippines' buoyant economic growth
are encouraging more British investors to do business here.

Industry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, British firms were keen in engaging in
projects in the power, oil and gas, petrochemicals and transport
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Several British firms are interested to bid for control of he
metropolitan waterworks and sewerage system, which the government
plans to auction this year.
</P>
<P>
British businessmen invested 957 million US dollars in the
Philippines in 1995, most of which were in the form of portfolio
investments.

<P>
MADRID, February 23 (Xinhua) -- French 1988 Olympic gold
medallist Franck Piccard said in Sierra Nevada, Spain, on Friday
he planned to retire from Alpine ski racing after the world
championships there.
</P>
<P>
Piccard, 31, said he made the decision because his knee and
ankle problems had made him "really tired".

Piccard won the super-giant slalom gold in the Calgary Winter
Olympic Games and was the downhill silver medallist in Albertville
in 1992.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Opposes Having His Portrait On Tanzanian Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa has said he would not have his portrait on the Tanzanian
currency.
</P>
<P>
He told newsmen in the State House here on Wednesday that he
had instructed the Treasury not to put his picture on the
currency notes and coins now carrying the portraits of the First
and Second Presidents, Julius Nyerere and Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa gave no reason for this decision, but it is believed to
be part of his determination to maintain a humble and simple
posture, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa indicated that he would like to have new designs for the
currency, but said the proposals had not been concretized.
</P>
<P>
"I have some ideas but it is too early to reveal them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president was commenting on reports that he was reluctant
to authorize the use of his picture on the currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mkapa said his administration would
continue with the transfer of the government seat to Dodoma in
phases.
</P>
<P>
The decision to transfer the political capital from Dar es
salaam to Dodoma in Central Tanzania was made about 20 years ago.
However, it is very difficult to realize the ambition because of
lack of fund to support the project.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to take at least one concrete step every year to
facilitate the transfer," he said, explaining that this would
start with improvement of communications to be followed by social
services.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said ministries without multi-sectoral structure would
be the first to be wholy-based in Dodoma.

<HEADLINE> South Mogadishu's Fuel Market Catches Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A huge fire gushed into a
fuel reservoir in the Black Sea area near Bakara Market of South
Mogadishu, Somalia, with at least two people dead and six others
wounded last night.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire still remains obscure, but eyewitness at
the scene said a man from the fuel business dealers had lit a
cigarette in the open air very close to drums of petrol which as
a result jumped into flames.
</P>
<P>
the fire which started from a reservoir about 150 meters from
the Black Sea intersection made about 10 drums to explode and fly
into the air to different directions around the area.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of families have deserted their houses to save their
lives and children. Likewise, all business centers surrounding
the scene of the fire were vacated either by looters or the
rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of young men rushed to the scene for different
objectives. Immediately, the roads leading to the fuel market
were filled with people, no one could distinguish the honest
rescue mission from the looting ones benefiting from the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's main Bakara Market, only 250 meters from the fire,
was immediately sealed off by militiamen hired by the business
community for the security of the market. Bakara Market suffered
its worst damage in early July last year when the most serious
fire caught the market making Somalia's business community to
loose millions of dollars worth of material and money in cash.
</P>
<P>
On november 26 last year, a warehouse containing 2,200 tons of
food items belonging to the World Food Program caught fire in
North Mogadishu, destroying 99 percent of the food stock.
</P>
<P>
Last night's fire on the fuel market also took place at a time
when the fuel prices in Mogadishu rose by 30 percent yesterday
and at a time when more fuel was arriving. Mogadishu citizens
suspect that the fire was made intentionally so as to keep the
fuel prices so high.

<HEADLINE> HK Inflation Hits Eight-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Cheaper food and Chinese
newspapers dragged inflation down to an eight-year low in the
first month of 1996 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index A (CPI) slipped to 5.9 percent in
January, the lowest inflation rate ever recorded since September
1987, according to figures released today by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The moderated rise in the cost of living is partly contributed
to a stronger US currency, which has slowed the increase on import
 prices.  Prices of foodstuffs, some Chinese newspapers,
miscellaneous consumer services, transport and consumer durables
also showed less rapid increases in January.
</P>
<P>
Broadly based on lower income earners, CPI (A) calculates 50
percent households in the territory whose monthly expenditures are
 between 3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (500 to 2,050 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Composite CPI, which is compiled on the combined expenditure
pattern of all households in Hong Kong, also saw a slower rise of
6.8 percent in the first month of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Reassures Honest Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has said his government would continue fighting
corrupt businessmen but reassured that Law-abiding investors had
nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
The president told a news conference marking his 100 day in
office here on Wednesday that the government had nothing against
honest businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration was keen to ensure businessmen
paying the right taxes and that there would be no compromise on
this.
</P>
<P>
"Only tax evaders and corrupt businessmen would be scared by
this" he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa was reacting to reports that some investors
were hesitant to launch projects in the country while imports had
declined because businessmen feared a government clampdown.
</P>
<P>
"I have said this repeatedly. The third Phase Government has
no vendetta to wage against businessmen," he maintained.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, that it was essential for all imports to
be taxed to create fair competition with local products and raise
government revenue.
</P>
<P>
In the wide ranging interview, President Mkapa explained that
the privatization of public companies was moving slowly because
most of the institutions were run down and unattractive to
buyers.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that there are no takers," he said, adding
that when any one made offers they were nominal.
</P>
<P>
Most of the perspective buyers wanted the installations
rehabilitated before they could make offers but the government
had no capital to meet such condition.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also explained that many of the companies were
over-staffed and divestiture often led to lay offs, which were
politically undesirable.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on efforts to revive East African Co-operation, the
president said that care would be taken to ensure that the agreed
form did not disadvantage Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> International Drug Dealer Arrested in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- An international drug dealer
and his pregnant Dutch girlfriend were arrested in Cyprus on
suspicion of involvement in drug dealing, according to local
press here today.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus' Drug Squad and Larnaca airport customs officials
arrested Jeannette Gerharda Maria Ter Braak upon her arrival in
Cyprus Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ter Braak, who is six months pregnant, came to the island to
meet her Yugoslav boyfriend Milan Stojanovic, who was also
arrested.
</P>
<P>
German and French police have told their Cypriot counterparts
that Stojanovic was convicted of drug dealing in France in 1986
and is still wanted by French police in connection with other
offences.
</P>
<P>
Another Yugoslav, Dragan Mirtovic, believed to be Stojanovic's
half-brother, was arrested a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
Stojanovic is believed to be the boss of an international
drugs ring with connections to street dealers on the island. Ter
Braak is suspected of collecting the money. She was found
carrying 99,000 Canadian dollars hidden in her underwear at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were given a five-day remand order by the
Nicosia District Court.
</P>
<P>
The Drug Squad has launched a probe through Interpol with
French, German and Dutch police in an effort to discover how the
money found on Ter Braak was obtained.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Reforms Doomed If People Not Benefited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin
believes that reforms in Russia are doomed if the interests of the
ordinary people are ignored.
</P>
<P>
In his annual State of the Nation Address, Yeltsin told a joint
session of parliament in the Kremlin that "to carry out reform by
infringing on the social and economic rights of Russians means to
ruin the reform and put the fate of democracy in Russia in
jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
"The main thing which we failed to do is to reliably protect
the social and economic rights, to guarantee to the citizens the
inviolability of their rights," Yeltsin said. He was referring to
the problems of back wages, low minimal living standards and the
widening gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to work like this any longer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia had no time in 1992 to conduct reforms less
radically because the economic crisis was already in full swing.
</P>
<P>
"There was no other way to save the economy at that time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Without the reforms, "Russia would not only have lost any
historical perspective, but would have also faced the threat of a
complete economic collapse."
</P>
<P>
Four years later, he said, "we are close to the moment when
reforms should begin to bring evident fruits which most citizens
would feel."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the results could have been much
better had the government clearly explained its policy to the
people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government also failed to strictly control
market mechanisms which triggered numerous embezzlements and
violations as well as "an unjust shifting of the burden of reforms
from the strong to the weak."

<P>
However, he said the economic crisis is coming to its end as
Russia enjoys greater stability and economic prospects have become

</P>
<P>
"Certain successes have been achieved in curbing inflation, but

noted.

Yeltsin, 65, who declared a week ago that he would run for a

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Sirivudh, a
half-brother of King Norodom Sihanouk's, was sentenced to 10 years
in prison here Thursday for criminal conspiracy against Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen and illegal possession of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that the prince, now in exile in
France, did not appear in court for fear that he would not be safe
in the country and the verdict would not be fair.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh, a former deputy prime minister and foreign minister,
was arrested on November 21 on charges of plotting to assassinate
Hun Sen. He was exiled in late December after King Sihanouk
intervened.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh's lawyers rejected the charge that the prince
organized an armed group to kill Hun Sen and said the prince has
two months to appeal the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Be Admitted Into ESAF Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's
determination to improve revenue collection and management of
government finances in a short time will heighten chances of
admission into the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Evangelos Calamitsis, Director for the IMF African Department,
made the statement at a press conference here on Thursday at the
end of a three-day visit in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IMF would help the Tanzanian government as
much as possible if positive results were attained by the end of
next June.
</P>
<P>
ESAF funds are lent by the IMF at low interest rates,
currently at 0.5 percent, to low income developing countries
undergoing a "superior stage" of the structural adjustment
process, notably in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
"President Mkapa is very determined and willing to produce
results in a short time," said Calamitsis, who had a conversation
with the president in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF African Department chief, who is on a tour of
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya, said that Tanzania might
qualify soon for ESAF disbursements as long as it improves its
finances before the next budgetary exercise in July.
</P>
<P>
currently 20 African countries, including Zambia, Benin, Cote
d'lvoire, Ghana, Malawi, Chad, Uganda, Burkina Faso and Guinea,
have been already admitted into ESAF funding, according to IMF.
</P>
<P>
He has left here for Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Calamitsis also held talks with Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye, Finance Minister Simon Mbilinyi,
representatives of the donor community and various other agencies
as well as the Dar es Salaam business community.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Lists Major Economic Tasks for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today
listed the fight against inflation, promotion of domestic
production, investment and higher living standards as major tasks
for his government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the problems in the current stage of the development
of the Russian economy, it is necessary to finally defeat
inflation and bring it down to 25 percent in 1996," Yeltsin told a
joint session of parliament in the Kremlin in his annual State of
the Nation Address.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to strictly adhere to this line," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"Investments and modern management to the enterprises, revenues
from privatization to the state, full-fledged protection of
property rights to shareholders -- such would be the principles of
privatization this year."
</P>
<P>
He said that the traditional export-oriented production of
natural resources should be self-sufficient, while state subsidies
should go to export-oriented high-tech sectors such as aircraft
construction, space, nuclear energy and power engineering
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that the task is to find a balance between
locally-produced and imported goods, to arrange it in such a way
that "our producers would face competition in such a scope which
stimulates, but not suppresses their activities."
</P>
<P>
However, "the main thing is the social policy," Yeltsin pointed
out. "To considerably increase the guarantees of social and
economic rights of citizens is one of the major tasks in 1996."
</P>
<P>
The five tasks he outlined are:
</P>
<P>
-- To timely pay wages and other budget-envisaged benefits;
</P>
<P>
-- To considerably improve housing conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- To support small businesses;
</P>
<P>
-- To begin compensating the savings lost in the first years of
reforms;
</P>
<P>
-- To introduce a system of insuring private deposits in
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called for political and public support in introducing
the tasks.
</P>
<P>
"If we preserve political stability, we shall fulfill the tasks
of the last stage of the transition period."
</P>
<P>
"The task is to considerably advance the well-being of the
citizens. After the completion of the stage Russia will get onto
the trajectory of a stable economic development," Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
The president stated that "from 1997 we shall begin a drastic
change in the budget policy," and that "its aims are investments
in the man, in his physical and moral health."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin delivered the message to the nation eight days after he
declared in his home town of Yekaterinburg that he would run for a
second term of office in June.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, his message is also seen here as his re-election
campaign platform.

<HEADLINE> Former Presidential Aide Sentenced to Three Years in Prison </HEADLINE>

<P>
SEOUL, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
sentenced former South Korean presidential security aide Kim
Chong-whi to three years in prison with a five-year reprieve plus
a fine of 290,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kim was charged with receiving bribes totaling 290,000 dollars
from defense contractors in connection with the country's arms
acquisition programs while in office as senior presidential
security aide.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul District Court said that the defendant deserves
punishment for accepting bribes while in office and then going
abroad while he was being investigated.
</P>
<P>
However, the court said, in view of his contributions to
normalizing relations with some countries including the former
Soviet Union and other security policy developments, a five-year
stay of execution is granted.
</P>
<P>
Kim fled to the United States in early 1993 when the Seoul
District Prosecutor's Office began to investigate him, but was
arrested upon his return home late last year.

<P>
ANKARA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Foreign Ministry
recalled its Ambassador to Greece Umit Pamir for the tension of
the Aegean dispute between Turkey and Greece, local press
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued Thursday night by the Turkish
Foreign Ministry said that Turkey took this measure after Greece
recalled its Ambassador to Turkey Dimitrios Nezeritis one week
ago.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the fact that Turkey recalled Pamir was to
discuss the worsened ties between the two NATO members including
the crisis of Imia islets in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Turkey strongly accuses Greece of creating trouble for Turkey
on international forum , especially in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal has taken a diplomatic
initiative to persuade the EU countries to remain neutral on the
Aegean dispute between the two NATO rivals.
</P>
<P>
Baykal has said that the only way of eliminating tension in the
Aegean was to establish a dialogue between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries staged a military confrontation
in the Aegean last month over the disputed Imia islets.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton prevented a conflict between the
two NATO members through his mediation between the leaders of the
two countries.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Malacca state
government of Malaysia will enhance bilateral economic ties with
China in an effort to attract more investors from China and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
Malacca Chief Minister Mohamad Zin Abdul Ghani told the press
today that an agreement on the matter was signed by his state
government and a trade delegation from Guangzhou, China.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Association
delegation in Malacca, Mohamad Zin said, "the bilateral ties are
appropriate as Malacca and China have many similarities
particularly in terms of culture, tradition and economic
activities."
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese delegation was satisfied with this visit to
the state and as a result, several businessmen from the Malacca
Chinese Chamber of Commerce have been invited to form a joint
venture with the Chinese businessmen to produce mineral water in
China.
</P>
<P>
Other areas the investors from both sides could participate in
were the industrial and tourist sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister also said he would visit China officially
this year to look at the investment opportunities, investors from
Malacca could tap there.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations between China and Malaysia have been
developed greatly in the past few years. The trade volume between
the two countries has reached 3.3 billion US dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: No Troops Pullout, No Talks with Dudayev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A peaceful plan for Chechnya is
still being drafted by the Kremlin, but there would be no
immediate troops withdrawal and talks with separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev, President Boris Yeltsin said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his annual state of the nation message to a joint session of
parliament in the Kremlin, Yeltsin stressed that "the central
issue today -- is how to pave the way to a quiet life in the
Chechen republic."
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have been fighting armed Chechen separatists
headed by Dudayev for over 14 months in the North Caucasian
republic.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said there were many peaceful proposals, though most of
them were "extremely abstract" or "irresponsibly radical."
</P>
<P>
"To demand the president to 'end the war' or 'to withdraw
troops' is not a solution, not even a path to peace, but a direct
road to the spreading of the war across the whole of the Caucasus
and, possibly, outside it," Yeltsin stressed, adding that "most
population of Chechnya are simply afraid that federal forces...
would leave it at a time."
</P>
<P>
He said that a final peace program, which "will include not
only a certain single step, but a complex of measures" will be
eventually found in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for talks with any political forces interested in
restoring peace in Chechnya. But we are not going to make a deal
with bandits," Yeltsin said, referring to Dudayev and his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for compromises on the status of Chechnya within
Russia, but not to the detriment of the safety of the citizens,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chechen rebels using the slogan of "national
liberation struggle" to cover their concealed motive "to gain
freedom for brigandage, mostly in the North Caucasian region."
</P>
<P>
He also blamed some mass media for echoing what Dudayev's
propaganda says and portraying the wanted bandits as "fighters for
independence."
</P>
<P>
"The Russians still do not have an objective picture of the
developments in the Chechen republic," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Trying to dispel doubts of the military who often say they do
not understand what they were fighting for, the president said:
"All of us and, first and foremost, the servicemen should clearly
understand: the force... is and remains to be used against bandits
who possess enormous stockpiles of weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The federal troops help the legitimate authorities of the
Chechen republic to launch a normal life and ensure the safety of
the population."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the Chechen separatists, clearly realising that
they would not be able "to keep afloat" in peaceful conditions,
had chosen the tactics of "blatant terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Expected to Become Major Phosphorus Chemical Industry Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Chemical
Industry has decided to build southwest China's Guizhou Province
into an important phosphorus chemical industry base, today's
Economic Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Guizhou, minister Gu Xiulian said that
the province has a great potential for the development of chemical
industry, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The province is rich in phosphorus resources and has complete
chemical industry departments. In 1995, Guizhou's chemical
industry developed at a speed of 17 percent, above the country's
average speed of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou's Kailin Company, a big supplier to more than 380
enterprises in the country, has about 600 million tons of
phosphorus reserve at its disposal and owns 76 percent of the
country's high-grade phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
Phosphorus is a vital element for the production of
chemicals. The ministry has given priority to the development of
chemicals for agricultural use in the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of every 100 kg of grain in farm yield is achieved
by applying 40 kg of fertilizer, the minister said, adding that
the province should make great contributions to the increase of
the country's agricultural production.

LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Cargill Hybird Seeds
will introduce two new brands of maize seed on the Zambian market
in the next farming season, "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted General Manager of the seeds company Stuart

the capacity to withstand unfavorable conditions in wet areas
like the streak virus and still give a positive yield.
</P>
<P>
"The disease is a very common one especially in wet areas of
Zambia. The seed is an improved version and will guarantee
farmers yields worth for their money," Donald said.
</P>
<P>
"We test and improve seed quality in our laboratories and also
use laboratories at the seed control and certification institute
for testing," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The chilly cold that snapped
 Hong Kong at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday (February
19-21) has claimed 14 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ten more people were found dead Thursday due to the cold spell,
 bringing the death toll from the winter monsoon to 14, according
to the local media.
</P>
<P>
The latest victims, including six men and four women aged
between 50 and 91, were either elderly people living alone or
street sleepers. Some had been weakened by illness such as lung
problems.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, four people died in the frosty temperature of around
 five degrees Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The chill brought Hong Kong the coldest Lunar New Year in
decades, when the mercury dipped to the lowest of zero degree in
some parts of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the first day of the holiday, was the coldest over the
past 45 years, Tuesday was the coldest second day of the Chinese
New Year for 113 years, and Wednesday was the coldest third day
since 1933.

<HEADLINE> Stamps Tell History of HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Visitors can get a glimpse
of Hong Kong from the stamps displayed at the Hong Kong Philately
Exhibition '96, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
A philatelic collection, composed of special and commemorative
stamps issued by Hong Kong, offers a full knowledge of different
aspects of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two collections of stamps are exhibited at the four-day
show as well as one hundred frames, each with 16 stamps. The
exhibits cover a wide range of subjects such as politics, economy,
 history, social customs and the nature both in China and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The most precious stamp at the exhibition, with an estimated
value of more than one million HK dollars (128,200 US dollars), is
 one issued in the 1940s in the East China Liberated Area under
the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese stamp features a red star with a Chinese character
"gao" (news dispatch). It was used by journalists and
correspondents free of charge during the period of the Liberation
War (1945-49). Experts said that there are probably only ten
pieces of the stamp in the world.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors are members of four local philatelic societies, the
organizers of the event. Overseas postal administrations and
philatelic dealers also take part in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Post Office today issued a specially designed
souvenir pack containing the year of the rat stamps to commemorate
 its participation in the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> hke022317--Roundup: 4 European Leaders Not to Attend ASEM Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of four
European countries will not be able to attend the Asia-Europe
meeting (ASEM) to be held on March 1-2 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
They are prime ministers of Spain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece,
for various political or personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Heads of government of 10 Asian and 15 European countries have
been invited to the first ever summit of the two continents, to be
hosted by Thailand, at the Queen Sirikit National Convention
Center, Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
From Asia are the seven members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam; and China, Japan and
the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
From Europe are the 15 members of the European Union --
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The president of the European Commission will also participate
in the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initiated by Singaporean Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong for the strengthening of linkage between the two
continents in political, economic and social fields.
</P>
<P>
While the trans-Pacific linkage appears to be strong through
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the
trans-Atlantic linkage through the Group of Seven (G-7), ties
between Asia and Europe have not been developed to its full
potential.
</P>
<P>
The two continents could benefit from closer economic
cooperation and from clearing misunderstanding on issues such as
human rights, labor standards and dumping.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's GAP Agricultural Output to Yield 6.6 Billion Dollars by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia
Project (GAP) is planned to boost agricultural output to 6.6
billion u.s. dollars by the year of 2010, up from 800 million
dollars in 1985, the Turkish Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the GAP Development Regional
administration as saying that while the Euphrates and Tigris
rivers constitute 28 percent of total Turkish water resources,
the 1.7 million hectares of land which will be irrigated by the
project constitutes 20 percent of the total arable land in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that once irrigation begins of 3.1
millions of hectares in the region there will be a massive but
gradual structural change.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Turkey opened the T-1 tunnel which irrigates the
Sanliurfa, Harran and Akcakale valleys in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's average agricultural production yields about 16
billion dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation dam and the 672 Mega-Watt hydro-electric power
station are part of the gigantic 32-billion-dollar GAP project
which, when completed in 2005, will have 21 dams, 17 hydro
electric plants and a network of tunnels and canals to irrigate
1.7 million hectares of land in the Gaziantep region.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey's neighboring Syria has been strongly
criticizing Ankara's GAP project on the Euphrates, saying that
this has led to a sharp decline in the flow of water to Syria,
which uses it for drinking and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has called for a permanent water-sharing agreement to
replace a provisional accord under which Turkey allows the flow
of only 500 cubic meters of water per second to Syria.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Calls for More Investment Privileges  for Zone 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has called for changes in promotional privileges for
investment in zone 3 so as to attract more projects.
</P>
<P>
Zone 3 covers 60 of the country's 76 provinces outside the
highly developed central region centered on Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment (BOI), chaired by the prime minister,
offers most favorable tax breaks and import duty concessions to
investors who establish businesses in zone 3, which covers the
country's remote and underdeveloped rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The goal of distributing growth to rural areas has not been
realized because investors have not responded fully to the BOI's
zone 3 program, which was launched three years ago, Banharn said.
</P>
<P>
Banharn told a seminar Thursday that the zone 3 idea may need
more time to prove itself and a review of the policy is needed to
encourage more investment.
</P>
<P>
Lack of infrastructures for industries in zone 3 is one of the
main reasons for mediocre response. Bangkok and its nearby
provinces are still investors' first choice.

<HEADLINE> Oman Consulting GCC members to Hold Meeting on Qatar Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Oman has stepped up efforts
to hold an emergency meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC,
foreign ministers after Eid el Fitr holidays at the request of
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Official Omani sources in Muscat said the meeting will be
convened to support steps taken by Qatar to protect its security
and territorial integrity from foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
Today's Gulf News based here quoted sources at the Omani
Foreign Ministry as saying that as several GCC foreign ministers
have gone abroad, the meeting is expected to be held after Eid
holidays due to end in Oman Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been some difficulties to hold the GCC
meeting called by Qatar last Tuesday following the announcement of
an aborted coup on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Some Gulf officials said Thursday that several members of the
GCC were not immediately in favor of Qatar's request to hold the
emergency meeting of the group's foreign ministers. Some of them
have asked Oman, GCC's current head, to hold consultations with
Qatar to investigate its claims of "outside involvement" in the
anti-government plot.
</P>
<P>
A report published today quoted a senior Gulf official as
saying that "We are still waiting to hear from Oman and what
proof Qatar has of foreign involvement before we decide of the
meeting."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the former Qatari Emir, Sheikh Khalifa, who was
replaced by his eldest son Sheikh Hamad in June of 1995, denied
Thursday he was behind the plot.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has accused the former Emir of masterminding the failed
counter-coup and has asked to convene an emergency GCC
Ministerial Council meeting to inform them of the aborted coup
"backed by outside support."
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al Thani said
Wednesday in an interview with AFP and BBC: "the first
confessions show that the plotters were foreigners. We know the
limits of his (former Emir) team. That's why he needed help from
foreigners and we hope the (plotters) don't come from brother
countries."

<HEADLINE> Sweden Wins HK Lunar New Year Soccer Meet (Corrected) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Sweden won a hard-fought
battle against Japan to take the 50,000 U.S. dollars Carlsberg Cup
Lunar New Year soccer tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier match, Poland edged hosts Hong Kong 1-0 to take
third place.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish victory came only after they outpointed their
Japanese counterparts in the penalty-kicks, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played a scoreless first half and the 90-minute
regular play ended 1-1. The goals were scored by Sweden's Martin
Pringle and Japanese Kazuyoshi Miura.
</P>
<P>
An expected "sudden death" did not come in the extra time as
the teams tried by every means though they still failed to score
any more.
</P>
<P>
As Japanese team's third attempt shot by its star forward
Takuya Takagi hit the upper part of the bar, the game was actually
over.
</P>
<P>
Amidst the woos by a near-capacity crowd in the 38,000-seat
Hong Kong Stadium, the Swedes, third placers at the 1994 World Cup
finals in the United States, cooled themselves down and put in
just goal after goal in an accurate manner in the penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
"The play went into extra time and then penalty-kicks. The
Swedish team won the game. I have nothing to say," the
disappointed Japanese coach Shu Kamo said at the post-match press
conference.
</P>
<P>
But Kamo said he was satisfied with his players for what they
did in the tournament and praised: "The Swedish team played a
well-organized and better game today."
</P>
<P>
As for Swedish coach Tommy Svensson, it could hardly be
something pleasant.
</P>
<P>
"I have a big problem of injuries. I had four forwards before
the tournament and now I have none," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the first half of the extra time, we met some problems as
the Japanese team played very well. It's a very tough team and we
had to play really hard."
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Japanese mid-fielders who, he said, had
more ball possession during the match. "But we deserved to win,"
Svensson said.
</P>
<P>
According to Svensson, the Swedish team will leave for
Australia to play two games against the Australian national team.
</P>
<P>
In April, the team will visit Northern Ireland for pro matches
before hosting Belarus for its World Cup qualifying early June.

<HEADLINE> Over 6,000 Ugandans Displaced At Border Area With  Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 6,000 civilians living
close to the Sudanese border in Koboko, Arua district, northern
Uganda, have fled their homes following intensified cross border
shelling of Ugandan territory.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said that many schools in Koboko
have failed to open for the first term due to increasing
insecurity at the border area.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of villagers from the entire Ludara division near
Koboko have been displaced and are moving towards Koboko town
inland.
</P>
<P>
Initially, there were an estimated 3,000 displaced civilians,
but the number has doubled now, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this month, Sudan troops and West Nile
Bank Front (WNBF) rebels have been shelling Ugandan territory
with long range artillery, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Last week, about 2,000 WNBF rebels crossed to Uganda from
their bases in the Sudan to attack a unit of Ugandan government
troops located about 500 meters inside Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government troops retaliated by firing about 50
artillery bomb shells at the enemy, hitting their bases inside
the Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Common Residences Vital to Property Development: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China should accelerate the
development of real estate by building more average residences,
according to a report by the Real Estate News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Ma Hong, a noted economist, as saying that
China's property development should place emphasis on average
residential construction, instead of blindly building tower
offices, villas and hotels.
</P>
<P>
Excessive spending on luxurious projects has brought few
benefits to common people or the national economy, said Ma, who is
honorary president of the Research Center to Advise on Economic
Technological and Social Development under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"At present some people are complaining real estate development
has fallen into dire straits because of macro-control policies, "
he said. "Actually they have put the cart before the horse."
</P>
<P>
Blind development has caused overstocking of commodity houses,
which has in turn resulted in vicious cycle in the national
economy, he said. "The government is obliged to take macro-control
measures to regulate the development of the industry."
</P>
<P>
As a big developing country, however, China should speed up and
expand the development of real estate because it has not yet
become a pillar industry in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The economist was on a recent visit to a residential quarter
covering 246 mu (about 16.4 ha) in the Pudong New Area in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The quarter is developed by Ruida, a company run by the the
center's Shanghai branch. Ma expressed his satisfaction over
Ruida's development strategy which pays much attention to the
development of common residences.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Renominated as U.S. Fed Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today he will renominate Alan Greenspan for a third
four-year term as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).
</P>
<P>
President Clinton also named White House Budget Director Alice
Rivlin as vice-chairman of the Fed and chose St. Louis economist
Laurence Meyer to fill a vacancy on the seven-member Fed board.
</P>
<P>
These nominations have to be confirmed by the Congress.
Greenspan, 69 and a Republican, is expected to be approved by the
Republican-controlled Congress but it is unclear whether Alice
Rivlin and Laurence Meyer, both Democrats, will be approved.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, appointed as Fed chairman by President Reagan in
1987 and renominated by President Bush in 1991, has held the
position for eight years. He has won widespread support from
Republicans for his stand for "slow growth, low inflation" on the
Senate Banking committee.
</P>
<P>
At the announcement ceremony in the Oval Office today,
President Clinton praised Greenspan effusively, saying" he has
inspired confidence with good reason."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton has questioned the Fed's slow-growth policy which
is crucial to his re-election.
</P>
<P>
On February 16, President Clinton said that current
U.S. economic conditions "will permit higher growth rate in the
next 10 years than the last 25." He also called for a debate in
the Fed over how fast the U.S. economy can grow without triggering
higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
Under Greenspan's control, the Fed has contended that at
present the U.S. economy cannot grow faster than around 2.5
percent a year without generating inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
But President Clinton said earlier that a slight increase in
the economic growth rate to 2.7 or 2.8 percent could generate
enough revenue to erase the budget deficit and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Recent technological advances in such areas as computers could
well have boosted U.S. productivity enough to allow for faster
growth without inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
By nominating Rivlin and Meyer for the Fed posts, it is clear
President Clinton wants to start the debate over growth and aim
for higher economic growth rates to boost his re-election chances.
</P>
<P>
Rivlin took over as director of the U.S. president's Office of
Management and Budget in 1994 when Leon Panetta was named Chief of
Staff of the White House. She will take over the No.2 post at the
Fed left over by Alan Blinder who returned to Princeton University
last January. Meyer will fill the vacancy of a Fed member created
by the resignation of Boston banker John LaWare last April.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's first choice for the vice chairmanship, investment
banker Felix Rohatyn, withdrew from consideration last week after
Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee let it be known he was
unacceptable.

ZAGREB, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Admiral Leighton Smith, chief
commander of the NATO peace-keeping forces in Bosnia, today
proposed the United Nations postpone lifting sanctions against the
Bosnian Serbs for 48 hours.
</P>

General William Carter, chief of staff of the NATO
implementation force (IFOR), said that the IFOR was waiting for an
official confirmation from the Serb authorities that they would
resume contacts with NATO in joint military and civil commissions.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have only news reports saying that such a decision
(on the resumption) had been reached at last night's session of
the Bosnian Serb Parliament. We need an official confirmation,"
Carter added.
</P>
<P>
General Smith indicated that sanctions against Serbs would be
lifted since they had basically abided by the military terms of
the Dayton agreement.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
compensate the families of Iranian victims who died in mid-air
after an Iranian airliner was shot down by a U.S. warship in 1988,
the State Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Iran have settled Iran's claims against
the United States which were filed before the International Court
of Justice concerning the shootdown of Iran Air Flight 655 on July
3, 1988," Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The cases in question were dismissed from the International
Court of Justice then, because no money could be paid to the
government of Iran under the terms of the settlement," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The incident killed all 290 people on board, and 248 of them
were Iranians.
</P>
<P>
With an offer of voluntary payment made by then-President
Ronald Reagan immediately after the incident, the United States
will proceed with payments that will average roughly 300,000
U.S. dollars per family, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been paying the families of the non-Iranian
victims -- Italians, former Yugoslavs, and other nationalities.

WELLINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand ranked as one
of smallest contributors in foreign assistance in 1994, shows the
latest OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and

</P>
<P>
The report places NZ as the second lowest contributor in
foreign assistance that year when aid was calculated as a
percentage of the gross national product.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, NZ's aid amounted to 0.24 percent of
the GNP, only ahead of the United States which contributed 0.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
On average, OECD nations provided 0.3 percent of the GNP as
aid.
</P>

However, the report noted NZ's development cooperation had been
strengthened through a deepening of the policy dialogue with
partner countries in the South Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Transporters Begin Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A private transporters'
organization in Nepal today began an indefinite strike as the
government failed to meet its demand for more than 50 percent rise
in public transport fares.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs earlier called
a nationwide strike to halt public traffic in the country from
today unless the government fulfilled its 17-point demand
including the increase of ticket fees before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
But talks between the Ministry for Transport and FNTE which
began last month soon after the organization presented its demand
to the government, were deadlocked as the ministry did not agree
the 50 percent hike in transport fares.
</P>
<P>
The transport organization has maintained that it had been
compelled to increase the fares as a result of the increase of
prices of fuel, vehicle parts and traffic taxes.
</P>
<P>
Besides the increase of fares, the organization also demanded
an amendment to the present Transport Management Act, a ban of
entry of Indian vehicles into the country and lifting the
compulsory use of electronic meters in taxis.
</P>
<P>
The government and consumers' organizations have urged FNTE to
call off the strike and resume talks for solving the problems.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry for Transport Thursday made an appeal to transport
entrepreneurs and workers to operate all means of transport as
usual in order to ensure normal public life.
</P>
<P>
But FNTE sources said they would mount their strike program as
planned until the government agrees to fulfill their demand for
transport fare increase.
</P>
<P>
However, another national transport organization, the National
Transport Entrepreneurs Federation, said Thursday that it was
opposed to the nationwide transport strike called by FNTE.

WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will try to push forward economic integration
in Latin America on his forthcoming tour of the region, a State
Department official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The United States is "frustrated" over the lack of progress on
the regional economic plan presented at the Summit of the Americas
in Miami in December 1994, Assistant Secretary of State Alexander
Watson said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, the first U.S. secretary of state to tour Latin
America since 1988, will leave Sunday for an eight-day visit to five
Latin American countries - El Salvador, Chile, Argentina,
Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trip, "we'll be emphasizing the agenda that came
out of the Summit of the Americas, not just the principles but
also the specific actions that we're taking on the 23 action items
that still forms the basis and the framework for our policy in the
hemisphere," said Watson.
</P>
<P>
"And we'll be talking about how to further the process of
commercial integration, trade integration in the hemisphere that
was set forth so boldly in Miami," Watson added.
</P>
<P>
Latin America is the largest single collective market for
U.S. exports and about 50 percent of all imports in the region
come from the United States, Watson noted.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Announces Major Shake-up of French Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac on
Thursday announced a shake-up plan for the French armed forces,
moving from conscription to an all-professional army over six
years, cutting the size of its nuclear arsenal and reorganizing
military industry.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the French army was at present unsuited to the
current situation and could not really and effectively fulfill its
missions.
</P>
<P>
During a 50-minute interview with the French Television 1 and
2, the president said that only a professional army would be able
to send large forces overseas at short notice.
</P>
<P>
Recalling France's difficulties in mustering an adequate force
for the 1991 Gulf War, he said: "France must have the capacity to
project abroad in rapid and organized conditions a significant
force of about 50,000-60,000 men. Today it can only manage 10,000."
</P>
<P>
The size of the French armed forces will be reduced from
500,000 to 350,000 by 2001 and the number of Army regiments from
124 to 83 or 85, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He contributed the reform to both military purpose and a
consideration of economic and financial hard-time.
</P>
<P>
France will spend 15 percent less on military equipment at the
end of the six-year transition, according to Chirac.
</P>
<P>
France's defense budget for 1996 was 190 billion French francs
(about 38 billion U.S. dollars), comprising 100.6 billion francs
(20 billion dollars) administration budget and 89 billion francs
(18 billion dollars) equipment budget.
</P>
<P>
On France's nuclear policy, Chirac said the six underground
tests it conducted in the South Pacific, which ended early this
year, had guaranteed France's nuclear deterrent for the next 50
years, providing it with the ability to simulate nuclear
explosions by computer.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France would dismantle the Hades short-range mobile
missiles but maintain and upgrade its strategic nuclear submarines
and airborne nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the French Navy will order a fourth new-type
strategic nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
France will maintain its major arms programs, including the
Rafale combat planes, the Tiger and NH90 helicopters and the
Leclerc main battle tanks, Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
On the adjustment of the French military industry, Chirac said
the purpose is to build the French defense industry into one of
most advanced in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the shake-up would have no effect on the
50,000-strong Eurocorps, which groups forces from Belgium, France,
Germany, Luxembourg and Spain, or on Franco-German arms programs.
</P>
<P>
He assured Bonn that France would abide by its commitment to
the Eurocorps, although some French troops stationed in Germany
would return home.
</P>
<P>
The military shake-up will leave certain influence on French
economy, especially on the employment situation, and Chirac said
he would discuss the issue with related community members,
parliamentary deputies and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
He believed that difficulties emerging from the defense reform
could be overcome amid global economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: IMF's Timely Loan Helps Russia's Economy  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) agreed Thursday to an extended three-year
10.2-billion-U.S. dollar loan, more than had previously been
expected, but less than the Russian government's request for at
least 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after Russia agreed to abolish export
duties on oil and gas within months.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, who arrived here
Wednesday, received President Boris Yeltsin's written guarantee
that Russia will stick to the terms of agreement with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Russia will scrap oil
and gas export tariffs from June 1, 1996, as a condition of the
agreed three-year loan which starts this year.
</P>
<P>
He later said he was satisfied with the loan and viewed it as
an indication of growing international confidence in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here described the IMF loan decision as "timely
support" for Yeltsin who is facing a strong challenge from the
communists in June's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he was satisfied with the results of his
talks with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the IMF hopes the consistent implementation by
the Russian government of the IMF three-year program will help
achieve stable economic growth, relaxation of the tensions in
society and a rise in employment.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, also pleased with the IMF decision, said Russia
would continue its cooperation with the financial body.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his determination to continue economic reforms in
the country and maintain strict budgetary discipline.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his support for the government and the
Central Bank in their efforts to achieve financial stabilization,
low inflation and a strong rouble.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is due to give his state of the nation address to the
two-chamber parliament later today and is bound to use the
occasion and the IMF loan decision to further his election
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Indigenous Cultural Vestiges Found in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A big cave containing
important vestiges of the "Comechingona" indigenous culture has
been discovered in Argentina, Juan Jose Bia, director of the Amboy
Museum said today.
</P>
<P>
The cave, located in a small place about 120 kilometers from
the capital of Cordoba province, was found containing utensils,
arrow points, ceramic fragments, and remains of extinguished
animals such as guanaco bones, nanduti eggs, and remains of
armadillos.
</P>
<P>
Bia, a paleontologist, said these vestiges could be 600 years
old. They were among the most important discoveries because they
gave more details about the characteristics of the indigenous
settlements in the province of Cordoba.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope of finding remains of human beings in the
cave, since it was a Comechingona ritual to bury their dead inside
the caves they had inhabited.
</P>
<P>
The caves, which were eight meters long and two meters high,
had a three-meter overhanging projection that served as eaves.

ALMA ATA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Two coastguard patrol boats,

</P>
<P>
The two boats were equipped with sophisticated modern

WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will meet with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
in California on Friday to make the necessary preparations for
Clinton's visit to Japan in April, the White house said today.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry described the
proposed meeting in Santo Monica, California, as a "get-acquainted
session."
</P>
<P>
"This will likely be one of the first meetings between a
president of the United States and a Japanese prime minister that
is not defined simply by the trade issue," McCurry said at a news
briefing today.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an opportunity for the president and the prime
minister to really reflect on the broad scope of that
relationship, to look at things like the common agenda that we
pursue with the Japanese," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is leaving here on Friday for California, where he will
meet with Hashimoto, who was once Japanese trade minister.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Japanese trade disputes have lost urgency and will not be
at the center of Friday talks, the White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on trade issues has been reduced primarily because
of lower U.S. trade deficit with Japan. For the first 11 months of
1995, the deficit was 55.8 billion U.S. dollars, down from 60.1
billion dollars for the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Japanese government announced that its trade
surplus in January this year stood was 50 percent lower than the
figure in January 1995.

BONN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Herve De Charette today asked European Union (EU) members who
would not join the European monetary union to closely cooperate
with it when the single currency is implemented in 1999.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said at a meeting of the German Industry and
Commerce that those countries which remain outside the monetary
union cannot have a free hand in devaluating their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Instead, their currencies should be maintained within a
moderate margin of the exchange rate of the single currency, known
as Euro, to stabilize the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister blamed the fluctuations in the
exchange rate as the source of monetary chaos, a "poison" for
employment and "brake" on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Insisting on the timetable set for the single currency in 1999,
De Charette said France would honor its commitment and meet the

<HEADLINE> Edwards Says 18.50m Leap Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- World triple jump record-holder
Jonathan Edwards said on Thursday that it could be possible for
him to improve his own record to 18.50 meters as early as this
summer.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Briton first leaped 18.18 meters to beat the
10-year-old mark of 17.97 meters held by American Willie Banks and
in August set the present 18.29 record at the world championships
in Gothenburg, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who had jumped a wind-aided 18.43 meters, said if he
fine-tuned his speed and technics in a favorable wind condition,
he could possibly add seven more centimeters legally.
</P>
<P>
"If those qualities come together, a legal 18.50 is feasible,"
he said after announcing a sportswear sponsorship deal.

<HEADLINE> Greece Threatens to Block Turkey-EU Customs Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece today threatened to
jeopardize a planned customs union between Turkey and the European
Union (EU) unless Turkey drops its claims of sovereignty over a
set of small islands in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Greek Premier Costas Simitis, in a search for support
from the European Union (EU), voiced the threat during talks with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl here today.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, who arrived here on a one-day visit, said that if the
territorial dispute can't be resolved on the basis of
international law, Greece will not cooperate on the implementation
of the next stage the customs union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey entered a customs union with the EU last month. But the
implementation of the agreement must be approved by EU member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between long-time rivals Greece and Turkey erupted
last month over a sovereignty dispute over the small islands,
called Kardak in Turkish and Imia in Greek. The dispute almost led
to war until the United States intervened.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has advocated settling the status of more than 1,000
islets and rocks in the Aegean through bilateral negotiations, but
Greece has insisted on taking the case to the International Court
of Justice.
</P>
<P>
NATO members Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over
several other issues, including air space and continental shelf
rights, the militarization of the Greek islands in the Aegean and
the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

BONN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The development of computer and
telecommunications industries as well as media will create 10
million new jobs in the world by 2005, German Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrodt said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an information conference of the Free Democratic
Party, Rexrodt forecast 1.5 million news jobs in Germany during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of mobile phones has provided the country
with 28,000 jobs over the past three years, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which has a population of 81 million, has suffered the
burden of high unemployment for a long time.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the unemployment rate reached 9.5 percent, which meant
that 3.7 million people were jobless.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt said Germany's information industry will benefit from
the privatization of the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
He expected the hardware manufacturing sector of the computer
industry to remain highly efficient but said the software sector
will have to make greater effort to catch up.

BUCHAREST, February 22 (Xinhua) - Eight people were killed
today after an Antonov-24 aircraft crashed during a test flight in
northwest Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-made plane crashed near the city of Baia Mare, 595

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan government
and the guerrilla resumed their peace dialogue here today to end
more than 35 years of civil war in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The talks is the first for the government of President Alvaro
Arzu, who came to power in January.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United Nations Commission for Guatemala
said the main point on the agenda is to continue discussing the
agrarian situation and the country's indigenous people's
socio-economic rights.
</P>
<P>
Another issue to be discussed is to have the ceasefire
maintained in the Central American country, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Six members of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union
(URNG) participate in the talks, while the government's Commission
for Peace is also represented by six members, including Gustavo
Porras who heads the government commission.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government started peace talks with the
guerrilla in April 1991.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between the government and the guerrilla had
been suspended since November last year because of the general
elections and the subsequent power transfer in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflict in Guatemala is the only one persisting in
Central America after the Salvadoran government signed a peace
agreement with the guerrilla of that country on February 16,
1992.

<P>
PRAGUE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- All four top seeded teams who
are taking part in the Thomas and Uber Cup world team badminton
qualifiers here moved to the semifinals on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Men's England squad, overcoming a 2-1 behind to Finland after
Peter Knowles lost to Robert Liljequist 2-0, won in the final two
matches through its doubles teams with a come-from-behind 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Denmark had an easier time on the court, disposing
of Scotland 5-0 to move to the next round without losing a match.
</P>
<P>
Denmark and England are now set to square off against each
other in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Second-ranked Sweden also advanced to the semifinals easily
following a 4-1 over Canada, while the fourth semifinalists, the
Netherlands entered with a 3-2 win over Russia.
</P>
<P>
In women's Uber Cup action, the top seeds played to form with
Denmark cruising into the semifinals with a 5-0 drubbing of Wales
followed by a 4-1 victory over Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Top seeded Denmark now faces England in the semifinals, like
their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
England, without its world's third ranked women's doubles
player Joanne Wright because of her flu, still managed to win its
group by beating Canada 4-1.
</P>
<P>
However, England is not expected to go on to beat Denmark in
Friday's semifinals and English misfortune in having a weakened
team may open up a chance for Russia to get to Hong Kong in May
for the cup's finals instead.
</P>
<P>
England and Russia may well meet in a play-off on Saturday to
decide which country gains the third and last qualifying place in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Russians won their group on Thursday by surviving equally
dangerous opponents, beating the Netherlands 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The second semifinal match pits Russia against number two
seeds Sweden, who defeated Ukraine 4-1 and Hungary 5-0 before
advancing.
</P>
<P>
After the semifinals on Friday and the finals on Saturday,
three teams will qualify for the finals of both competitions in
Hong Kong.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Army of Serb state
Republika Srpska resumed cooperation with IFOR today, Tanjug news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb army staff said later today in a communique that "in
line with the decision adopted by the 57th session of the Serb
state national assembly, the cooperation with IFOR is being
carried out normally at all levels and in the spirit of the Dayton
agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament decided Wednesday to restore full
cooperation with international community representatives in line
with the Dayton agreement and with the results of the Rome summit
on the implementation of that agreement.
</P>
<P>
The deputy commander of the Serb army Zdravko Tolimir met with
the commander of the IFOR ground troops General Michael Walker on
Tuesday, signalling the official resumption of the contact between
the Serb army and the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Serb army and IFOR was suspended on
February 8 due to the arrest of two senior Serb officers by
Muslims on January 30 and their subsequent extradition to the
Hague international tribunal for war crimes in former Yugoslavia.
Muslim police arrested General Djordje Djukic and Colonel Aleksa
Krsmanovic in an IFOR-controlled zone of separation near Sarajevo
as they were going to a meeting with IFOR representatives.

LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major's majority in the House of Commons has been reduced to two
as a Tory parliament member has resigned from the party tonight,
reported BBC TV.
</P>
<P>
Peter Thurnham, who has been a Tory parliament member since
1983, announced that he would sit the House of Commons as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
Before quitting the Tory party, Thurnham and his wife had a
meeting with Major. He complained that the Conservative party's
values and standards of public service are falling.
</P>
<P>
Thurnham is the third parliament member deserting the Tory
party since last October.
</P>
<P>
The first one is Alan Howarth who switched his allegiance to
the Opposition Labour and the second one is Emma Nicholson who
defected to the small Liberal Democrat party last December.
</P>
<P>
On February 17, Thurnham issued a statement saying that he was
increasingly concerned about falling values and standards of
public service in the Tory party.
</P>
<P>
He said that the modern Conservative party was divided and
failing to fulfill public expectations.
</P>
<P>
It was predicted that his defection would deal another blow at
the Tory party which has long been depressed morally.

the rich, create social injustice and fail to address the
education and health issues.
</P>
<P>
The charge was supported by the other two opposition parties,
the Alliance and New Zealand First, which voted with the Labor.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO commander of the peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, Admiral Leighton Smith,
asked today the United Nations to postpone by 48 hours the
decision on suspending sanctions against the Serb state, an IFOR
official said.
</P>
<P>
IFOR General William Carter told a press briefing in Sarajevo
that Smith asked for a 48-hour delay to assess whether there is a
full compliance with the Rome summit decision on implementation of
the Dayton peace agreement, on renewing contacts with IFOR, as has
been decided by the Serb general assembly, Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Serb army staff announced today that "in accordance with
the decision of the 57th session of the Serb general assembly,
cooperation with IFOR was normal at all levels and in the spirit

</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the Serb army and IFOR was broken off on
February 8 following the arrest of two senior Serb officers by
Muslims on January 30 and their extradition to the Hague tribunal
for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Smith stated Wednesday he was satisfied so far with the
compliance of the Serb army in terms of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Smith's report, sent to the NATO commander in Europe, General
George Joulwan, will be the basis for a U.N. Security Council
decision on the suspension of sanctions against the Serb state.

<HEADLINE> Serb Refugees Leaving Sarajevo Difficult to Find Shelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Serbs from Sarajevo districts
to be placed under Muslim-Croat federation control under the
Bosnian peace agreement are finding it increasingly difficult to
find accommodation.
</P>
<P>
A local official of Hadzici municipal authorities Vesna Mrkajic
said today that it was becoming hard to find accommodation for
Serbs from that Sarajevo district in Bratunac in eastern Bosnia,
according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, five Serb Sarajevo suburbs will be
reverted to the control of the Muslim-Croat authority on March 20.
But fearing possible retaliation or unsafety, thousands of Serb
Sarajevans have left their hometowns to settle down in other Serb
towns in eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Ten crowded buses left Hadzici for Bratunac on Wednesday night,
despite the fact that even those Serb refugees who arrived in
Bratunac five days ago were still unable to find shelters, Mrkajic
said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Bratunac Housing
Commission, 150 out of 320 families of the Serb army members
killed in the war were provided with accommodation in Bratunac
today.
</P>
<P>
Another 7,000 refugees from Hadzici are expected in Bratunac
shortly, although the town can only provide accommodation for
3,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the President of Srebrenica municipality in eastern
Bosnia Milenko Canic said today that preparations were underway in
the town to accommodate a part of the population of the Sarajevo
district of Ilias.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnia peace agreement preserves Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a
single country with two political entities - the Muslim-Croat
federation and the Serb state Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The Serb government has asked the international community to
enable the Serbs who wish to leave Sarajevo to do so unhindered.
</P>
<P>
The Serb government has estimated that around 50,000 Serbs
would leave the Serb Sarajevo in the next few days as the Muslim
police start to patrol in some of the Serb districts in Sarajevo
on Friday.

UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Ms. Louise Arbour of
Canada has been nominated as judge for the International Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia by the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali made the announcement
today after briefing the Security Council on a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
"Judge Goldstone has informed me he is returning to South
Africa in October," he told reporters before the Security Council
Chamber. Mr. Goldstone is the current judge of the International
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said that he had chosen Ms. Louise Arbour of
Canada to replace Judge Goldstone as of 1 November 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the nomination needs to be approved by both the Security
Council and the General Assembly. They have to hold concurrent
meetings to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that the purpose of the the U.N. Chief to make
the announcement so early was to allow the new judge to have more
time to get herself acquainted with the new job.
</P>
<P>
According to a bio presented by the Canadian mission, Judge
Arbour is now a member of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

<HEADLINE> CIA Defends Use of Journalists for Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Intelligence
Agency must retain the authority to recruit journalists for spy
missions or let its agents pose as journalists in cases involving
"very unique and special threats" to U.S. security, CIA Director
John Deutch said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This would happen only in very rare circumstances, he told the
Senate Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
Deutch insisted that he and the CIA's deputy director have
authority to waive a 1977 regulation which bans attempts to
recruit American journalists or use news-gathering organizations
as cover. the CIA policy is, he said, that "we will not use
American journalists except under very, very rare circumstances."
</P>
<P>
He listed some circumstances "where I think it would be very
difficult not to take advantage of every possible way of defending
American lives."
</P>
<P>
His defense of using journalists as CIA agents drew protests
from American media circles.
</P>
<P>
"An absolute ban on the use of journalists as covers for spying
should be in place,...There should be no exception," CNN president
Tom Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"They (CIA) have a function, we have a function, and I think
mixing them exposes our people all over the world to a level of
danger that's extremely worrisome," said, Louise Boccardi,
president of the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported today that the policy regarding
journalists also applies to clergy. It allows CIA to waive the
19-year-old ban on employing clerics or missionaries for
clandestine work overseas in "extraordinary circumstances."

Bosnia and expressed the hope that the Serbs will fulfill their
pledge.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a good report," Perry told reporters. "But we'd like
to see deeds in addition to the words. We'll wait a few days to
see how those deeds turn out."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief also said the U.S. peacekeeping troops were
watching to see if there were more terror training camps in the
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The American forces are part of the 60,000 NATO troops
enforcing the U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
U.S. chief Balkan peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke said on
Wednesday that the NATO peacekeepers were aware of at least four
to eight other sites in Bosnia like what they described as a
terrorist training camp raided last week.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb leaders have decided to restore full
cooperation with NATO and international representatives in the
Balkans after a boycott because of a dispute over war crimes
investigations by the international tribunal based in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Says UN-Iraq Negotiating Process  Is in Middle Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (xinhua) -- There are still several
steps before the United Nations and Iraq come to conclude an
agreement on oil-for-food plan, according to the spokeswoman of
the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing this noon, Sylvana Foa said that
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali would explain to the
Security Council the U.N.-Iraq negotiating process, which would
move through 12 different steps.
</P>
<P>
The first step was the adoption of Resolution 986 on April 14,
1995 by the Security Council, she said.
</P>
<P>
The second step was the negotiations held between April 1995
and January 1996, at which the secretary-general convinced the
Iraqi government to begin consultations, she said.
</P>
<P>
The third step was appointment of Under-Secretary-General Hans
Corell and Ambassador Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari to head the two
delegations and the 14 sessions of technical talks which produced
a paper reflecting the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Step four was that secretary-general and Hans Corell discussed
the paper and that Iraqi delegation returned to Baghdad to discuss
with their principals.
</P>
<P>
"Step five, and this is where we are at the moment, is that
procedures for implementation will be adopted by the 661
Committee" at the meeting on February 29, she said.
</P>
<P>
The following steps would involve selection of a bank to hold
the escrow account, selection and appointment of independent oil
inspection agents to assist the committee, redeployment of U.N.
personnel to draw up procedures on how to effect distribution of
humanitarian aid, the Iraqi government submitting a distribution
plan to the secretary-general for him to evaluate and approve,
making the pipeline operative, actual conclusion of the agreement
and the secretary-general's report to the Security Council, the
U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed economic sanctions, including
oil embargo, on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The five-year long sanctions have damaged Iraqi economy and
hurt a whole generation of children in Iraq. According to a latest
report of the World Food Program, four million or one fifth of the
Iraqi population suffer from severe malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation there,
the Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export petroleum worth two billion dollars in six
months for import of food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government, however, refused to implement the
resolution, saying the strict monitoring and other conditions for
oil export violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
United Nations and Iraq held technical talks on oil-for-food
plan from February 6 to 19.

<HEADLINE> US Mediator Confident of Ulster Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- George Mitchell, chairman of
the international panel of overseeing arms decommissioning process
in Ulster, said this afternoon that he was confident that the
British and Irish governments would get the damaged peace process
in Northern Ireland back on track.
</P>
<P>
The former US senator, who now acts as a mediator among the two
governments and political parties in Ulster, had talks with
British Prime Minister John Major on how to salvage the troubled
peace process since the Irish Republican Army (IRA) announced an
end to its ceasefire and started a bombing campaign on February 9.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Mitchell said that all parties involved in the
conflict had agreed on the importance of moving promptly to
all-party negotiations, but "the differences are in how we get
there".
</P>
<P>
He said that the British and Irish governments are working very
hard to resolve their different approaches to achieve their common
goal and he believed they would succeed.

<HEADLINE> China Signs Int'l Tropical Timber Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Qin Huasun, China's
permanent representative to the United Nations, signed here today
an international tropical timber treaty at the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
China is the 29th signatory to the International Tropical
Timber Agreement 1994.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was adopted on 26 January 1994 at Geneva by the
United Nations Conference on Tropical Timber, 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was the successor agreement to the International Tropical
Timber Agreement, 1983, which expired on 31 March 1994. It was
opened for signature at United Nations Headquarters from April 1,
1994.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of adopting the treaty is to encourage member
countries to make national policies aiming at perpetuating the use
of tropical forests, so that by the year of 2000, all member
countries can use timber from tropical forests protected by such a
perpetuating system.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will come into force after its approval by 16 timber
consumer countries and timber export countries.

<HEADLINE> WEU to Assume More Responsibility for Euro-Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union
(WEU) Assembly started an extraordinary session here today, urging
the WEU to shoulder greater responsibility for European defense
and security.
</P>
<P>
The two-day special session is designed to discuss the
Assembly's approach to the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to
be held next month in Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
A common European defense and security policy will be high on
the agenda of the IGC conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's meeting, WEU Secretary-General Cutileiro
said that Europe must assume greater responsibility for its
defense and security and strengthen its capabilities for military
action.
</P>
<P>
The IGC conference would have to decide which institutional
arrangements can best serve this goal by contemplating the three
options set out by the WEU, he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the European Union (EU) and the WEU will
have to be strengthened to provide a more effective and coherent
response to the security risks and challenges facing Europe.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will for a long
time be the cornerstone of Europe's security and defense, but NATO
can only play a proper role if the WEU, NATO's European pillar, is
further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The operational reinforcement of the WEU is another critical
requirement. Despite the important progress in recent years in
transforming the WEU into an operational organization, there is
still much room for further improvement.
</P>
<P>
Present at the session are delegations from 27 countries,
including associate members and observer states.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Praises Mexico For Anti-narcotics Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher today praised Mexico for extraditing a
suspected drug smuggler to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I want to reiterate the appreciation of the United States and
President Clinton for the decisive action taken by the president,
by the foreign secretary and other Mexican officials to arrest the
drug king Juan Garcia Abrego," Christopher told reporters before a
meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Jose Angel Gurria.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Mexican authorities are continuing their
investigation against his criminal organization," Christopher
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the need for cooperation on drugs was one of the
subjects he would discuss with Gurria.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act, Clinton must certify to
Congress by March 1 which countries are fully cooperating with
anti-narcotics programs.
</P>
<P>
If a country is "decertified," it becomes ineligible for most
types of U.S. aid, and the United States will vote against any
loans to that country in some multilateral banks.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the United States had yet to decide whether to
"certify" Mexico as an ally in the war against narcotics.

<HEADLINE> African Capital Markets Forum To Be Inaugurated In June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The inauguration of the African
Capital Markets Forum (ACMF) and an international conference on
reviving private investment in Africa will be held in Ghana's
capital Accra in late June.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Sylvester Akele, the
Assistant Director of Corporate Affairs, Securities and Exchange
Commission of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The two events had earlier been scheduled for this month in
Accra.
</P>
<P>
Akele explained that the inauguration of the two events have
been re-scheduled as a result of logistics problems in view of
the large number of international financial organizations and
countries interested in the events.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the ACMF are to promote the establishment of
formal capital markets in Africa, accelerate the development of
existing markets and promote cooperation among African capital
market institutions.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an African capital markets forum was first mooted
at the international conference on promoting capital markets in
Africa which took place in the Nigerian capital Abuja in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The decision to establish the ACMF was one of the resolutions
of the conference, which attracted speakers and participants from
all over Africa, Europe, the United States and Canada.

JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Government ministers
from South Africa and Lesotho today met in Maseru, the capital of
Lesotho, to discuss cross-border raids and stock theft.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the recent killing of 14 Lesotho men
who had allegedly stolen cattle after crossing into South
Africa's Eastern Cape Province illegally, the South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
This was significant because of the acrimonious nature of the
problem which had resulted in the loss of human lives, stock and
other property on both sides of the border, said a joint
statement issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ministerial meetings were an expression of the political will
by both governments to resolve the problem and their condemnation
of the unlawful acts that had characterized the situation, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's delegation at the meeting included Defense
Minister Joe Modise, Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi
and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad. Lesotho's delegation was
led by Foreign Affairs Minister Ken Maope.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was a follow-up to another one held in Cape
Town on February 15 between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Take Women's Struggle To Rural Areas: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today urged women activists to take the struggle
for gender equality to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a Conference on Gender and Women's Empowerment
in the capital, Mandela said: "There is work to be done in the
rural areas as well to try to get women out of this idea men are
superior to them."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela stressed the struggle for gender
equality was urgent and would benefit both men and women.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of women's emancipation is part of our national
struggle that demands equal effort from both men and women," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Mandela also presented the United
Nations Development Fund for Women Anniversary Award to African
National Congress parliamentary member and veteran activist
Albertina Sisulu on behalf of South African women.
</P>
<P>
He described Sisulu, 78, as having personified the struggle,
from her role in a march by women to the Union buildings in
Pretoria in 1956 to her joint presidency of the United Democratic
Front, saying she had given her entire life to liberation.
</P>
<P>
"Today she is laying a firm basis for our young democracy and
for reconstruction and development," said the president, adding
that "you belong to a category of people we can't do without."
</P>
<P>

UN Conference On Women in China last year in recognition of its
efforts towards women's advancement.

some of the deeply saddening and really horrifying things".

The queen, accompanied by her husband Prince Consort Henrik
and their son Crown Prince Frederik, arrived in South Africa on
Sunday for her first state visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
"I also learnt the courage not only of people hit by apartheid
like President Nelson Mandela and his group, but also the courage
of a man like de Klerk," said the queen.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, if you did not have two people like Mandela and de
Klerk it could not have turned out like that. This is why the
future must be bright for South Africa," the queen added.

She described Mandela as "a most dignified person with
tremendous charisma", saying South Africa was "extremely lucky to
have a man of his stature, breadth of view and generosity of
