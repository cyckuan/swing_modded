<HEADLINE> Dhaka Refutes Mushrraf's Allegation of Interference in Internal  Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Saturday refuted
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf's allegation
of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's interference in the
internal affairs of Islamabad by a statement she made at the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami told the official
Bangladesh News Agency that what Sheikh Hasina said at the U.N.
Security Council was nothing but a policy statement.
</P>
<P>
"The statement of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was a policy
statement enunciating the belief, ideal and conviction of the
people, the government of the prime minister herself regarding the
dispensation of governance as Bangladesh envisages for the next
millennium and the future," the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Sami's comments came in the wake of Musharraf's allegation on
Friday that he had refused to meet Hasina at the United Nations
because she had meddled in the internal affairs of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the statements made by Bangladeshi prime minister at
the United Nations were a direct interference in our internal
affairs," Musharraf told a press conference in Karachi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Discarding General Musharraf's observation outright, Sami said
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's statement was a "visionary one." he
said the statement was made in the "context of the long struggle
that Bangladesh has made for ensuring a democratic system."
</P>
<P>
Sami made it clear that the statement was not directed to any
individual foreign country and that no country should interpret it
as that.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for U.N. action against
regimes that grabs power by overthrowing elected constitutional
governments at the U.N. Security Council on September 7.
</P>
<P>
Hasina on September 12 reiterated her stand about military
takeover ousting civilian administration at a press conference in
Dhaka, noting that it was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
"It was only repetition of what I have been saying for a long
time," she said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in Kashmir, Killing 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indian security forces repulsed a militant attack on a post and
averted possible tragedies with the timely detection of two
powerful explosive devices, PTI said, quoting an official
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In a major incident, he said, four militants, three Indian
securitymen and a villager were killed and six securitymen injured
in a shootout in Doda district last night.
</P>
<P>
Indian troops also gunned down five hard-core militants at
Mengana village early Saturday, said a defense spokesman at the
area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of Indian Army Staff V. P. Malik, who arrived
in Kashmir Friday for a inspection tour, reportedly declared
Saturday that the situation along the line of control, de facto
border between Indian and neighboring Pakistan in Kashmir, was
still alive and clashes had increased considerably.
</P>
<P>
He told the media in Kashmir that there had been a sharp
increase in border firing which was aimed at pushing maximum
number of terrorists from across the border, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the situation was well under control and
Indian troops were maintaining constant vigil along the line of
control.
</P>
<P>
The central government alerted all states Friday to take
suitable security precautions in the wake of intelligence inputs
on the movement of about 100 militants with arms and explosives
from Pakistan to carry out bomb blasts across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Home Affairs asked all state governments to
follow a "strong security drill" against the devious plans of
terrorist groups to target vulnerable places.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry said the ministry had asked the state
government to maintain a "very close and careful eye" on all kinds
of subversive forces through "regular patrolling, surprise checks
and close interaction and coordination among all concerned
agencies" to monitor, check and cross-check all developments and
anticipated events on a strong note of urgency.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Says Donator Conference to Be Deferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said Sunday that the donator countries conference will be
postponed "according to the feedback from most potential donators."
</P>
<P>
Hoss made the announcement at Beirut airport after returning
from New York where he attended the 55th United Nations General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked with many deputies of donator countries on the
sidelines of the U.N. conference and U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan is consulting with other countries and will brief me later on
the final result," Hoss said in a news conference at the airport.
</P>
<P>
"According to what I heard and what I was suggested, if we hold
the donator conference soon, we will not attain the result we have
expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think we will have to wait some months for the meeting,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing prime minister said he was told that it is better
to postpone the conference until after the new Lebanese government
is formed.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' government was defeated in the parliamentary elections
early this month, in which former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and
his allies won a majority. Hariri is poised to recapture the
premier portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent government will resign on October 17 when a new
parliament is to be formed. After that, President Emile Lahoud and
law-makers will consult on the premiership and the new government
will not emerge until late November.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon urged Arab and Western countries to give donations and
assistance for its reconstruction, especially in the southern part
which was liberated in May after Israel withdrew its troops, ending
its 22-year occupation there.
</P>
<P>
A donator countries conference was held in Beirut in July on the
ministerial level. But most countries failed to announce the
specific amount of donation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese authority had planned to hold a similar meeting in
October in a bid to get substantial support.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has vowed to absorb about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of
donations. So far it just received about 50 million dollars form
some Arab countries. Many donators prefer to give the donation to
the new government as a gift.
</P>
<P>
Hoss denied that the postponement has any linkage with the
United States' request for settling and nationalizing Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance on this issue is very explicit. We stress on the
return of the refugees because it is the core of the Palestinian
cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which is hosting over 400,000 Palestinian refugees,
hopes the current Palestinian-Israeli peace talks will pave the way
for the return of the refugees or agree to provide financial
compensation to Lebanon if the refugees were to be nationalized.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Judiciary Assigns Judge to Handle Unrest Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary
has dispatched a special judge to the western city of Khoramabad to
handle legal proceedings over an unrest last month that left one
policeman dead and many people injured.
</P>
<P>
The legal proceedings will be based on a report provided by the
State Inspectorate Organization (SIO), judiciary chief Ayatollah
Hashemi Shahroudi said, quoted by the official IRNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Although the report on the investigation of the unrest was
bitterly criticized by reformers, the judiciary chief said it was "
valid and well documented." He added that he had forwarded the
report to the justice department in Khoramabad.
</P>
<P>
Days of violence in Khoramabad left one policeman dead and
dozens of people wounded after two pro-reform intellectuals,
critics of the cleric system, were blocked by a pro-conservative
mob from addressing a student group - Office to Foster Unity (OFU)
- late August.
</P>
<P>
The OFU, the most influential student group that supports
President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs, was forced to cut
short its annual conference in the city because of the violence
that broke out between supporters of reforms and conservative
radicals.
</P>
<P>
OFU students claimed to have been beaten by the pro-conservative
Basij (voluntary Islamic militia) as well as members of the
nation's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, but both groups
were cleared in the report released by the conservative SIO on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SIO, instead, put the blame on reformist Deputy Interior
Minister Mohsen Tajzadeh and demanded that Tajzadeh be interrogated
in court for "willful negligence."
</P>
<P>
Pro-reform groups, officials as well as Majlis (parliament)
members have all criticized the SIO report, terming it as illegal.
They insist that the SIO has exceeded its authority in criticizing
Tajzadeh.
</P>
<P>
Reformists have hinted that the troubles in Khoramabad were
orchestrated in a conservative campaign to undermine Khatami in the
run-up to next year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who defeated his conservative rival in 1997, has
announced that he will seek a second term in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Political struggle between the conservatives and reformers have
heated up since the February 18 parliamentary election, in which
Khatami's allies won an overwhelming victory.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives still control the system through their
dominant power in the judiciary, the military, and many other state
organs.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the conservative judiciary has closed more than 20
pro-reform newspapers and arrested several reformist journalists on
charges of violating Islamic principles and advocating pro-American
reforms.

<HEADLINE> No Progress in Palestinian-Israeli Talks: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Sunday that the Palestinians and Israel have not
made progress in the peace talks on the thorny final-status issues,
especially Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
There has been no changes that could be considered as progress
in trying to find solutions to the question of sovereignty over
Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Cairo Saturday evening from New York and met with
President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday to submit a report on the United
Nations Millennium Summit and the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations "were just marking
time," Moussa said after the meeting. But he added that the two
sides were in agreement that they should continue peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a United States envoy is due in the Middle
East next week to try to push forward the peace talks. He did not
name the envoy.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Egypt would hold contacts with the
Palestinian, U.S. and Israeli sides in an effort to help advance
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the status of Jerusalem lies at the heart of the
negotiations. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, occupied by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, as the capital of their future
independent state, while Israel declares the entire city its "
eternal and undivided capital."

<HEADLINE> UK Fuel Deliveries Gathering Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's major oil companies
said Sunday that deliveries were gathering pace to end Britain's
petrol shortages and up to two-thirds of filling stations were
back in operation.
</P>
<P>
As polls suggested the British government's popularity has
plummeted, the Conservative Party leader, William Hague, hailed
fuel price protesters as "fine, upstanding citizens."
</P>
<P>
Hague highlighted a survey putting the Conservatives ahead of
Labor -- by two points -- for the first time since 1982, and
another which put the parties neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The protest that we had in this country was conducted
by fine, upstanding citizens of this country, who had just had
enough."
</P>
<P>
"The government doesn't seem to have learned anything at all,"
he said. "The government has failed to say sorry, failed to
recognize there is a crisis at all."
</P>
<P>
UK government ministers were playing down the significance of
their worst showing in the polls for eight years and hinting at
possible concessions.
</P>
<P>
But they insisted that the government was right not to give in
to the blockades and protests.
</P>
<P>
The weekend's fuel situation has been eased by many motorists
staying at home. Despite the increasing number of restocked
garages, petrol companies stressed it could still take time before
a return to normality.
</P>
<P>
The oil giant BP has placed newspaper advertisements saying it
aims to have petrol available at 70 percent of its filling
stations by Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggest the British government is considering plans to
make oil tanker supplies an "essential service" so it can order
drivers to deliver fuel or risk prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The task force set up by Home Secretary Jack Straw to try to
prevent a recurrence of the fuel crisis is to discuss the
proposals on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Congratulates Cooperation With Spain in Anti-Terrorist Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Sunday congratulated what he called "excellent cooperation"
between France and Spain in the big police operation against the
Basque terrorist group ETA this weekend in France.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar, Chirac
said that the arrest of the number one of ETA, Ignacio Gracia
Arregui, and 15 other leading figures of the terrorist group in
the French territory "brings a new testimony to the solidarity"
between Paris and Madrid.
</P>
<P>
"I also congratulate the excellent cooperation which was shown
on this occasion between the authorities and services of our two
countries and which makes up an example of European cooperation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac promised that France will fight "without fail" with
Spain against terrorism under all covers.
</P>
<P>
In what is the biggest police operation against ETA in France
launched from Friday to Sunday, French security forces dismantled
a network of ETA leaders in charge of logistics and specialists in
bombing attacks in the Basque country in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
French police also seized a large amount of explosives and
discovered a workshop for making false identity cards and police
cards as well as some other logistics materials for launching
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Interior Ministry said on Sunday that with the
newest arrests, the political and logistics apparatuses of ETA
have been practically dismantled.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take part in the
Chinese-African cooperation forum scheduled to be held in Beijing
next month, an Egyptian official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane in Iraq for Short Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane, which made a
direct flight from Moscow to the Iraqi capital Baghdad, arrived at
the newly reopened Saddam International Airport Sunday for a one-
day visit, an Iraqi TV report said.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Arnold Baker, head of the 11-member Russian oil
delegation, said that he will hold talks with Iraqi oil officials
to strengthen cooperation in the oil field.
</P>
<P>
Baker denounced the on-going United Nations sanctions and the
unilateral imposition of air embargo on Iraq by the United States
and its allies. "There is no legal justification for the air
embargo," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plane touched down at 13:00 local time (0900 GMT) and no
foreign media were informed about its arrival beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a staunch ally and the largest trading partner of Iraq,
has been calling for an early removal of the U.N. sanctions,
triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Russia has held that it is unnecessary to get the
authorization of the U.N. Sanctions Committee to fly any civil
flights to or from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been making efforts to get the sanctions on Iraq
lifted. Iraq owes millions of dollars of debts to Russia, the
successor of the former Soviet Union, and now pays it with oil.
</P>
<P>
One day after the Saddam International Airport was reopened on
August 18, a Russian plane made a direct flight from Moscow to
Baghdad, the first since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, to show
Russia's solidarity with Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges to Speed up El Al Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Sunday instructed the ministries of finance and transport
to speed up the privatization of Israel's national flag carrier El
Al so that the airline can fly on the Jewish holiday Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Barak issued his instructions to Finance Minister Avraham
Shochat and acting Transport Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak when the
three met to discuss this issue, Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Barak announced his "civil reform" plan on August 19 under which
he is to abolish the Ministry of Religious Affairs, introduce civil
marriage and ask all schools in the country to teach English,
mathematics and civics.
</P>
<P>
Later, he proposed to let El Al fly on Sabbath and operate more
bus service on this Jewish holiday.
</P>
<P>
Barak's reform plan has triggered strong objection from the
ultra-Orthodox parties, with Shas and National Religious Parties
saying that Barak was declaring a religous war in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here on Sunday, Minister without Portfolio
Michael Melchior announced his plan for "civil reform," saying his
plan could be accepted by all political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his plan, Melchior suggested, among other things, to close
all shops on Sabbath, declare Sunday as the national holiday to
enable the Israelis to go shopping, to introduce secular marriage
and forbid "third degree immigrants" (non-Jews) to immigrate to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Melchior said his plan was made on the basis of Barak's reform
project and could be accepted by all political parties.
</P>
<P>
"I have already discussed my plan with most of the party leaders
and this plan could receive a majority support in the Knesset
(parliament)," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Israelis only observe Sabbath (from sundown Friday till sundown
Saturday) as the weekend holiday and Sunday is the working day in
the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Specifies Ways to Boost Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
called Sunday for population growth to be slashed, illiteracy to be
wiped out, and the role of women boosted in order to promote social
and economic development.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at a national conference on social
development in Egypt, Mubarak called on the women to play a more
active part in the political and social life.
</P>
<P>
In the speech broadcast live on state television, the Mubarak
also urged for an end to illiteracy in the next five years.
According to official figures, 45 percent of Egyptians are
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned against the further growth of the population, now
estimated at 65 million, which he said is one of the most serious
threats to the plan for economic and social reform the government
undertook in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
He called for intensified efforts to reduce the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's population has increased by 3.7 million from the 61.5
million recorded in the 1996 census, an annual rate of over 2
percent, according to government figures released late last month.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is aimed at forging a general strategy
for Egypt's national development and social renewal over the next
five years.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urged to Declare U.S. Ambassador "Persona Non Grata" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli legislator Uzi
Landau Sunday called on Prime Minister Ehud Barak to declare U.S.
Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk "persona non grata" following the
envoy's controversial remarks about "sharing Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Landau, from the right-wing
Likud party, said that Indyk's recent remarks on the issue of
Jerusalem were just "out of his line," and it will be a proper
response by Barak to declare the ambassador no more being welcome
in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Receiving an honorary doctorate at Hebrew Union College in
Jerusalem last Thursday, Indyk, who returned to the region to serve
his second term as U.S. ambassador to Israel in January, said:
"There is no other solution (on Jerusalem) but to share the holy
city."
</P>
<P>
"It is not, and cannot be, the exclusive preserve of one
religion, and the solution cannot come from one side challenging or
denying another side's beliefs. Here too, mutual respect is the
foundation for any agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The remarks touched on the most sensitive nerve in the current
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel claimed
the holy city as its "eternal and undivided capital," while the
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in the
1967 Mideast war, as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
The peace summit between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David in July collapsed
mainly over the issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy in Israel late Thursday clarified Indyk's comments
by saying "Our policy (on Jerusalem) has not changed. Jerusalem is
holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the future of Jerusalem should be negotiated
between the parties, and Ambassador Indyk was making the obvious
point that tolerance and coexistence will be required by all for
there to be a genuine and lasting peace," embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
However, Landau obviously didn't think so. He said on Sunday
that what Barak must do now is to behave like leaders of all other
sovereignty countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Landau threatened, the incident will further prove
that Barak agrees with Indyk's remarks and wants to share the city
of Jerusalem with the Palestinians. It breached the prime
minister's election pledges that he will never divide Jerusalem,
Landau said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the real target Landau aimed at was
not the U.S. ambassador but Barak himself, as even Landau
understands that Israel, which depends on U.S. financial and
military aid every year, will never dare to humiliate U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
The Likud is against compromises made to the Palestinians by
Barak at Camp David and is currently trying to oust the left-wing
prime minister from office in an early election.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi returned home Sunday, saying his visit to the United
States is "successful" in consolidating bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the United States, Meles attended the United
Nations Millennium Summit in New York. The summit, held during
September 6-8 under the theme "the United Nations in the 21st
Century", brought together about 150 heads of state across the
world.
</P>
<P>
In addition to discussion with U.S. officials on ways of
reinvigorating the existing bilateral cooperation between the two
countries, Meles also conferred with leaders of the United Nations
and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with officials of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, Meles was assured that the two institutions
were ready to continue their development assistance to Ethiopia,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meles said early this week that his mission to the United
States was mainly focused on explaining to the U.S. government
Ethiopia's readiness to accelerate economic development and social
progress as well as to seek ways for the continuation of U.S.
assistance to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that an Ethio-U.S. transport and flight agreement
will be signed soon.

<HEADLINE> Libya Provides Foodstuffs for Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Libya has donated 15 tons of
foodstuffs and clothes to Zambia to help the government look after
over 220,000 refugees from Angola and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Khalifa Omar Swixie, Libyan Ambassador to Zambia, handed over
the donation which arrived here on Sunday aboard a military cargo
plane to Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs
Peter Mwamfuli at the Lusaka international airport.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian assistance from President Muammar Gaddafi is
in recognition of the efforts made by Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and his country to host a great number of refugees, Swixie
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Libya also appreciates the great stand and efforts made
by Chiluba and his government in bringing an end to the conflicts
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the donation, Mwamfuli said the assistance from Libya
is timely. The Zambian government is
finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the high influx of
refugees fleeing from the war-torn DRC and Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mwamfuli, while the Zambian government remains
committed to looking after refugees who have found themselves in
this unfortunate situation, the responsibility places a huge
burden on it.
</P>
<P>
"The current economic hardships being faced by the government
renders it difficult to adequately provide effective assistance to
the refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the gesture by Libya shows that the responsibility of
looking after refugees is not only for Zambia but also for the
entire international community, in the spirit of burden sharing
and solidarity.

<HEADLINE> 900 Congo Refugees Enter Tanzania Monthly: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An average of 900
refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are
entering Tanzania's western Kigoma Region each month, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, fleeing sporadic attacks in their country, are
entering the region through several entries along the border, said
UNHCR field officer for Kigoma Region Adam Rajab at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 476 refugees from the DRC entered the region
during the first half of this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the field officer noted that the inflow of refugees
from Burundi has dropped tremendously mainly due to reports that
their main entry point at Kagunga village in Kigoma Rural District
is mine infested.
</P>
<P>
Between 30 to 40 Burundian refugees find their way to Kigoma
per month, he said. "I think they are trying to establish new
routes, some have managed to find their way in through the DRC."
</P>
<P>
According to Rajab, a new refugee camp which has the capacity
of accommodating 30,000 people was opened in Kigoma Rural District
on Friday to supplement the existing two that are already full.
</P>
<P>
The DRC refugees entering the region during the first half of
this month would be in the first batch of refugees to be sent to
the new camp, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new camp has brought the number of refugee camps in the
region to 10. Three of them host DRC refugees, while the other
seven house refugees from Burundi.

<HEADLINE> France Dismantles Leading Network of Spanish Basque Terrorist Group ETA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- France has dismantled a leading
network of leaders and members of the Spanish Basque terrorist
group ETA by making 17 arrests in a large-scale anti-ETA operation
launched since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the arrest on Friday of the number one of ETA, Ignacio
Gracia Arregui, and his French girlfriend in a village in Pyrennes-
Atlantique in southwest France, French security forces arrested 15
other ETA leaders and members Saturday and Sunday, French
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested are Angel Picabea who was in charge of
trafficking weapons and explosives from France to Spain, Jesus
Maris Zabala and Ignacio Santesteban, who were specialists in tele-
commanding bombing attacks, and Jose Luis Turrillas, chief of the
logistics supply network of ETA.
</P>
<P>
French police also seized 50 kilograms of explosives and tons
of dynamites ETA has stolen from a stock in Cote d'Amor in western
France.
</P>
<P>
Several units of security forces and police forces, including
the National Anti-terrorist Division of the Central Direction of
Judicial Police and the Renseignement Generaux police intelligence
force, joined the operation.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government has thanked France, saying that the
political apparatus of ETA in Spain has been dismantled with the
arrests in France and 18 other arrests made last week by Spanish
police in Spain.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said in a communique issued
on Sunday that the French government is determined to fight
terrorism under all covers and to cooperate with the Spanish
government in the fight against ETA.

<P>
PARIS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
Sunday urged the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin to increase the minimum salaries for workers and further
cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made at the annual l"Humanite Festival" held in
Courneuve north of Paris, PCF National Secretary Robert Hue said
that the latest drop of support rate for the government is a "
serious warning."
</P>
<P>
The recently announced government plan to cut 120 billion
francs (17 billion U.S. dollars) of taxes from 2001 to 2003 is "
very insufficient" and the government should raise the minimum
income and the payment for social protection and retirement, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the fuel tax should be further cut after the
concession made by the government to truckers who protested the
rise of fuel prices two weeks ago.

The PCF is part of the ruling leftwing coalition of France.

<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China came
back from a luckluster performance in the first set to crush Japan
3-1 and won the title anew in the 10th Asian Junior Women's
Volleyball Championship in the Northwestern Philippine city of
Dagupan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Cai Bin said his team put more firepower in the
offensive after Japan won the first set 25-18, to rule in the
second, third and fourth sets, 25-12, 25-16 and 25-20, and
preserve the title it last won two years ago in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He conceded his team did not play well in the attack in the
first set, explaining why Japan won in that stretch but the
pendulum of the game changed from there when his tall players, Bai
Yun, Liu Xiaojia took the offensive
</P>
<P>
Bai spiked 15 points and Liu added another 12 to break the back
of the shorter but determined Japanese squad and combined with He
Quing, Yang Xinjia and Hu Lifang to erect an insurmountable lead.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is a very good team. They played well and were very
tough," said China's team captain He Quing.
</P>
<P>
It was Japan's only loss in the tournament, for a 4-1 card thus
salvaging a second-place finish in the eight-team tournament
hosted by Dagupan City.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, with a 3-3 slate, edged out Thailand earlier in
three straight sets to finish third with the latter wounding
fourth for a 2-4 card.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei nipped the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
also in three sets, to finish fifth with two victories and three
defeats with the latter wounding sixth place for its third defeat
against only two victories.

The taller Kazakhstan team prevailed against an unprepared
Philippines for seventh place for its only victory in the

have contracted farmland to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,600 people will move out of the dam area this year to
Shanghai, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong and six other
provinces and cities, which have decided to provide each new
settler with 1,000 to 5,000 yuan for building their houses.
</P>
<P>
The dam area is going to be submerged once the gigantic project
is completed in 2009, and when the water level of the Three Gorges
Reservoir rises to a height of 175 meters, 26,000 hectares of
farmland is expected to be covered by water.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tian Jiyun, a vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has
asked officials in Fujian Province, east China, to continue to
keep an open mind and further promote the reform.
</P>
<P>
He made the call during a six-day inspection tour from
September 12-17 to Fujian, where he visited the cities of Xiamen,
Zhangzhou and Quanzhou cities, known as the "golden-triangle" in
southern Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Tian held a discussion today with major provincial and city
leaders, urging them to "seize opportunities to step up
development."
</P>
<P>
The successful story of Fujian and other parts of China has
showed that the Party's reform and other related policies are
absolutely correct, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, Fujian saw an average annual GDP
growth rate of 13.8 percent; and in Xiamen, one of China's special
economic zones, the figure was 18.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Tian noted, there is still a big gap between China and
developed countries, and even greater efforts still need to be
made to change that fact.
</P>
<P>
He asked the officials to pay more attention to agriculture and
rural areas, further promote the reform of state-owned enterprises,
and continue to encourage the development of private and overseas-
invested enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On the corruption issue, Tian said that corruption will be
removed under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with
Jiang Zemin at the core.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Rejects Iraqi Allegations of "Stealing" Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday refuted
recent Iraqi allegations that it is "stealing" oil from a desert
border zone between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohamed Khalid Al-Sabah said
after a weekly cabinet session that the cabinet followed with grave
concern the recent Iraqi allegations and it strongly rejected
these "baseless accusations."
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid accused
Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil by drilling oil wells in a joint
border zone.
</P>
<P>
Rashid, who is also an Iraqi armed forces general, also said his
country "will take suitable measures to guarantee its oil wealth."
</P>
<P>
In response, the Kuwaiti minister said "the Iraqi campaign is
part of the policy that has always been adopted by the Iraqi
regime, and embodies its aggressive schemes and its permanent
attempts to create tension and instability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, he said, urges the international community to take
serious steps against "the threats of the Iraqi regime and to adopt
the needed measures to ensure a non-reoccurrence of the Iraqi
threats against Kuwait and other states in the region."
</P>
<P>
Since Thursday, senior Kuwaiti officials have accused Iraq of
trying to create a new regional war and warned Baghdad against any
military actions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under strict United Nations sanctions since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War in which
the U.S.-led allied forces drove Iraqi troops out.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Anan Anantakul, former
permanent secretary of the interior ministry, was elected the new
secretary-general of the ruling Democrat Party of Thailand here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Anan's election is expected as other strong candidates
including the party's deputy leader Abhisit Vejjajiva quitted the
race just before the party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the Democrat leaders may consider that Anan will
help the party gain support from the province officials in the
upcoming general election in the last quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The post was left vacant by former vice prime minister and
interior minister Sanan Kachornprasart, who was forced to resign
from both his government and party posts in April due to a scandal
of false report on his assets to the anti-corruption committee.

<P>
Anan was nominated by Democrat leader Chuan Leekpai, the prime

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Lofty Oil Prices Raise Fears for Asia's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite the recent agreement
by OPEC to boost output by 800,000 barrels per day, crude oil
prices on the international market are still staying above 30 U.S.
dollars a barrel, raising fears that Asia's economic recovery may
be derailed.
</P>
<P>
Many economists share the view that the impact of soaring oil
prices won't be enough to cause a turnaround in the region's
economic recovery in the near future as growth is still robust,
exports are expanding, trade balances are mostly positive,
inflation is largely in control, and domestic demand is picking up,
though a little bit slowly.
</P>
<P>
But Asian countries are feeling more and more the heat from the
surge in oil prices as the region remains highly dependent on oil.
With recovery on track, Asia's oil demand is rising. It is
estimated that in the first half of this year, oil consumption in
the region has already jumped by 600,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
High oil prices have raised oil import bills of most economies,
except Malaysia and Indonesia, which are net exporters of the
commodity.
</P>
<P>
Take South Korea and the Philippines for example. In the first
seven months, South Korea's oil import bill reached 14.1 billion
dollars, more than double that of the same period last year. JP
Morgan in Singapore estimates that South Korea's oil imports this
year will rise to 23 billion dollars from last year's 14.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' oil imports in June surged to 344 million
dollars, compared to only 197 million dollar for the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that high oil prices are likely to raise Asia'
s collective import bill by about 20 billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Rising oil import bills have led to a fall in some countries'
trade surpluses, thus weakening their abilities of serving debts
and increasing imports. The South Korean government forecasts that
the country's trade surplus this year will shrink to 10 billion
dollars from last year's 24.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines also says that this year's
trade surplus for the country will probably nose-dive to 8.5
billion dollars from 24 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter estimates that every rise of one
dollar in the oil prices would shrink East Asia's trade surplus by
more than two billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rising oil prices are pushing up overall costs,
exerting pressure on the region's central banks to hike interest
rates which will slow down the pace of recovery.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Indonesia's inflation in July went up to 4.56
percent from June's 2.14 percent. The Indonesian central bank has
hinted that the country's yearly inflation will reach 7.67 percent,
exceeding the 5-7 percent target.
</P>
<P>
Philippines' August inflation rose to 4.6 percent from the
previous month's 4.2 percent, while Thailand's is also likely to
increase to 2.6 percent from 2 percent. And Malaysia is
considering a hike in fuel prices in a bid to ease the burden of
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, high oil prices are putting downward pressure on
already weakened currencies of most countries in the region. Over
the past several months, most Asian currencies, especially those
of Thailand and the Philippine, have experienced continued decline
against the greenback due largely to economic and political issues
in respective countries as well as a surge in the dollar on strong
U.S. productivity High oil prices have put them in a more weaker
position.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the Philippine central bank, which had kept saying
it would keep the interest rate unchanged, was force to raise the
overnight borrowing rate from 10 percent to 11 percent and the
lending rate from 12.5 percent to 13.5 percent to stem the
straight fall in the peso. Last Wednesday, the peso was quoted at
a 32-month-low of 45.69 pesos against a dollar. The peso has
depreciated 11 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rising oil prices has raised the production costs
of enterprises, export-oriented ones in particular. Exports have
long been the main driving force of economic growth in East and
Southeast Asian countries. The depreciation of many local
currencies has already increased enterprises' costs of importing
raw materials and parts and bit into their profits. High oil
prices have added to their production costs, doing harm to much-
needed corporate reforms.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong forecast that if oil prices remain
at 33 dollars per barrel next year, the regional economic growth
could drop by 0.5 percentage point, and the impact would be more
severe in some economies. It said growth in China's Taiwan, South
Korea, Thailand and the Philippine would be trimmed by a range of
1 to 1.2 percentage points in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the recovery of Asian economy is not in immediate
danger, but it needs a closer watch.

ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling
Taliban Sunday rejected the "Six-Plus-Two" concern about the
Afghan conflict, according to news reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"We reject what the Six-Plus-Two has said in its meeting in New
York yesterday," Taliban Foreign Minister Maulvi Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil was quoted by the News Network International, a

called on the warring factions to observe a cease-fire and settle
the conflict through talks.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, who chaired the
meeting, said that Taliban are bent upon finding a military
solution to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, ruling over 80 percent of the Afghan territory, have
been fighting against the north-based opposition alliance for the
control of the remainder.

</P>
<P>
Fikret Unlu, State Minister in charge of Youth and Sports, said

<HEADLINE> Population Control Will Help Develop China's West: State Councilor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The population control policy
should be enhanced so as to promote the current "developing the
west" drive, said Wang Zhongyu, state councilor and secretary-
general of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remark at a recent meeting about population and
family planning.
</P>
<P>
"To effectively control the increase in population and improve
the people's cultural level have become an urgent issue for
promoting the social and economic development of the western
region," Wang said. "The population issue is one of the key
problems that need to be settled in carrying out the west-
development strategy."
</P>
<P>
He said, due to slow economic growth, the lack of financial
resources and other reasons, the population in China's west has
remained a strong increasing trend.
</P>
<P>
He urged related departments and officials to greatly improve
their family planning work, especially at the grass-roots level,
in the coming three to five years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that two things are the most important in
improving the family planning work: one is publicity, the other is
better service.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the role played by officials at all levels,
asking them to place more importance on the issue of population
control and family planning.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Lawmakers Back Assault on Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- House Majority Leader Eduardo
Gullas said Sunday that the House of Representatives supports the
military operations against the bases of the Abu Sayyaf on the
southern island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
"We are throwing our full and unqualified support to the
President's bold move to put a decisive end to the hostage-taking
activities of the Abu Sayyaf," Gullas said.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered pre-dawn military operations
against the Abu Sayyaf on Saturday to rescue the remaining 19
hostages held by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Describing the attack as "a calculated risk well worth taking,"
Gullas said, "the government really has no choice but to move
swiftly to stop the Abu Sayyaf from taking more foreign and local
hostages."
</P>
<P>
The president flew to Zamboanga, near Jolo, Sunday afternoon to
personally monitor the operations and boost the morale of the
troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
He instructed the armed forces and police force involved in the
operations to exhaust all the means to safely secure the 19
hostages-- one American, two French journalists, three Malaysians
and 13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a quick solution to the crisis situation. We
should destroy the Abu Sayyaf so that they can no longer engage in
kidnap-for-ransom activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf rebels have reportedly amassed millions of dollars
in ransom for the release of 20 of the 21 mostly foreign hostages
they seized from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23.
While freeing some of their captives, they took new hostages for
ransom.

<HEADLINE> China to Perfect Road Network in West Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China will link up the road
network in its western region by introducing advanced road
construction technology over the next two decades, a high-ranking
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of the road network will bring prosperity to
western areas as the Silk Road did to the region in ancient China,
said Zhang Chunxian, deputy minister of communications at the
annual meeting of China's Association of Science and Technology,
which opened today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by 2010, China is expected to complete the
construction of nine artery roads in the west, build about 150,000
kilometers of roads linking with each village. Meanwhile, the
government will pool 700 billion yuan (84.3 billion U.S. dollars)
to renovate 350,000 kilometers of roads.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has approved an annual budget of at least 200
million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) for the next two decades to
tackle problems related to road construction in the west and to
train professional construction workers.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 10 to 15 years, Zhang said, China is likely to
make breakthroughs in the development of new road construction
materials and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that information technology will be applied to the
management of high-level expressways, and the designing and
construction of highways and tunnels in mountainous areas will be
improved greatly by then.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China's forest coverage rate
has reached 16.55 percent thanks to the nationwide afforestation
efforts to improve the ecological environment, according to an
expert report delivered here today.
</P>
<P>
The report was made by Jiang Zehui, president of the Chinese
Academy of Forestry Sciences at today's opening ceremony of the
annual meeting of the China Association of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of the 1990s, China has greatly enhanced
its tree-planting efforts, especially in the 10 major ecological
improvement projects including the construction of the famous
Three-North (northwest, north and northeast) green shelter belt
system, which is believed to be the world's largest ecological
effort," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years China also made significant improvements
in nature conservation.
</P>
<P>
"We have made notable progress in the protection of wetlands,
wild animals and bio-diversity, while achieving some good results
in combating desertification," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
She said forests are playing an increasingly important role
especially in the country's ecologically weak western regions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 million hectares of trees have been planted in
China over the past few decades, making it the world's No. 1
planter of trees.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Claims 10th Victim In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An 81 year-old Israeli woman
died in Nahariya Hospital in northern Israel of complication of the
West Nile virus on Sunday, becoming the 10th Israeli victim of the
mosquito-borne virus since August, according to the Health
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not give the name of the victim, but said so
far some 119 infections, more severe among the elderly, have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
The disease, transmitted mainly by mosquitoes biting infected
birds and then people, generally manifests itself as a mild
illness, with patients experiencing a fever, headache, muscle pain,
general weakness and occasionally a rash, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Blood tests carried out by Israel's Veterinary Services have
confirmed that at least 15 horses in the center of the country are
infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
The animals were tested last weekend after they manifested signs
of weakness and instability.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials have said it is not clear whether there
is an outbreak of the virus, which has been known to exist in
Israel for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
There is no preventive medication against the virus in Israel
and the only available means of protection is pest control.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Chief of General Staff Should Resign: His Predecessor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Chief of
General Staff Rafeal Eitan said Sunday that his current successor
Shaul Mofaz should resign following his disparaging remarks against
his outgoing deputy Uzi Dayan and Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Eitan, also a former minister and legislator, emphasized in a
Israel Radio interview that Mofaz should know that the prime
minister has the right to determine political moves, and if Mofaz
feels he has been cheated, he should resign, rather than level
attacks against Barak and Dayan in an improper venue.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz said last Friday when he was presiding over a ceremony in
which his deputy Dayan was replaced by Major General Moshe Ya'alon
that "there is no trust between me and Uzi and there never was."
</P>
<P>
Dayan, who developed a chilly relationship with Mofaz, named by
Barak as head of Israel's diplomatic planning unit -- the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Dayan's appointment by Barak as National Security
Adviser in uniform, Mofaz accused Barak and Dayan of "going behind
his back" to make the arrangement to keep Dayan as a possible
successor to the chief of general staff post, which will be vacated
by Mofaz next summer. Mofaz hopes that Ya'alon will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
"I will be able to congratulate Uzi only when he retires from
the Israel Defense Forces," the furious chief of general staff
added.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz' rhetoric has drew criticism from many politicians and
military officers, with some even calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
But Barak, bringing forward his scheduled meeting with Mofaz to
Monday, tries to ease the tensions with Mofaz over the defense
budget for the year 2001, which Mofaz claimed is not enough for the
modernization of the Israel Defence Force.
</P>
<P>
Yet some reports said Mofaz's remarks were mulled in advance,
indicating he was preparing for his political life after his
retirement. He may join the hawkish opposition Likud, the reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Wipes Out Major Ring of Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces have
recently wiped out a major ring of bandits who were involved in
murders and drug trafficking, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bandits, including their notorious ringleader Agi Bameri,
were killed in an armed encounter with security forces in
Iranshahr, a city in the southeastern province of Sistan-
Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
The gang was involved in the murder of seven personnel of the
Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, eight policemen as well as 12
civilians in recent years, local police was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was also implicated in in the production and distribution of
narcotics and hostages taking in the border region.
</P>
<P>
During the armed clash with the bandits, the security forces
confiscated a large quantity of illicit drugs, two vehicles and
some weapons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report did not tell the specific number and nationalities of
the bandits, but they were probably from Afghanistan, Iran's war-
torn neighbor and the world biggest opium producer.
</P>
<P>
Due to the instability in Afghanistan and the rampant drug
trafficking, narcotics trade and addiction as well as border
security have become a major concern for the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of its borders with
Afghanistan as part of the stepped-up efforts to fight drug trade.
Iran's Majlis (parliament) has also earmarked 200 billion rials
(about 24.4 million U.S. dollars) in credits to block the eastern
borders from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 20,000 Iran's security forces have been deployed
along the borders with Afghanistan, and 100-200 security troops are
killed by smugglers each year.

<HEADLINE> Huge Price Rise Planned for Bread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bakers in Maputo have
announced that they intend to increase the price of bread by no
less than 66 percent as from Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Sunday's edition of the daily paper "
Noticias", at a meeting on Wednesday bakers decided to increase
the price of a 250 gram loaf of bread from 1,500 to 2,500 meticais
(at current exchange rates there are 15,550 meticais to one U.S.
dollar).
</P>
<P>
Victor Miguel, spokesman for the Bakers' Association, justified
this enormous price rise on the grounds that the cost of raw
materials (notably flour and yeast) has increased, as has the
price of woodfuel, electricity, water and labour (with the July
increase of 26 per cent in the minimum wage).
</P>
<P>
Miguel said that the price of a 50 kilo sack of wheat flour
rose by 15 per cent in 1999, followed by two price rises this year
of 12 per cent and 17 per cent. The current cost of such a sack is
300,000 meticais (19.3 U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wheat is imported, and Miguel said the two milling companies,
CIM and SOCIMOL, always justify their price rises by referring to
international prices and the devaluation of the metical against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Since we have no alternative to these two milling companies,
we have to accept the prices they fix", said Miguel.
</P>
<P>
Miguel thought the government should liberalize the import of
wheat flour (i.e. cut the customs duty) so that bakers could
bypass the milling companies.

<HEADLINE> Day-2 Roundup: Netherlands Break Three World Records, Romanian Lifters Expelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- As Romania's weightlifting
team was expelled from the Sydney Olympics, four more world
records were shattered in the second-day competitions with three
by the Dutch stars, raising the new world records to 13 after two-
day competitions on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
IOC director general Francois Carrard explained that Romania's
whole weightlifting team was ordered off the Games under the rule
of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) as it produced
three lifters who failed drug tests this year.
</P>
<P>
"The federation has a rule that if three test positive, the
entire team is suspended," Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
Traian Ciharean and Andrei Mateias were expelled on Friday
after failing pre-Games dope tests, and Razvan Ilie was withdrawn
from the Romanian team for doping earlier this year, as
weightlifting is the only Olympic sport in which all athletes were
tested for drugs before the Sydney Games, according to IWF.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's swimming pool produced three more world records,
bulging the new world records to eight through Dutch stars Inge de
Bruijn, Pieter den Hoogenband and American Tom Dolan as the United
States walked away with two golds and Italy and the Netherlands
split the other two.
</P>
<P>
Inge de Bruijn won the 100m butterfly in 56.61 seconds, beating
her own world mark of 56.64 set in July. And it was the third
time for the Dutchwoman to break the world mark this year.
</P>
<P>
Guo Qinglong, a FINA official from China, tipped De Bruijn to
bring down more world records later in the Games, commenting "Look
at her shape. She is perfect for swimming. She doesn't have an
unnecessary ounce of fat."
</P>
<P>
"I was flying through the water. It felt like a trance," said
De Bruijn. "This is what I've been working for years and now I'm
standing at the top."
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband clocked 1:45.35 in the 200m freestyle
semifinals, bettering Ian Thorpe's world record of 1:45.51. "I
was so surprised. Then again, I was so relaxed in the water," the
Dutch wonder boy said. "It felt amazing. Now it promises to be a
great final."
</P>
<P>
American Tom Dolan retained his Olympic 400m individual medley
crown in a world record time by pulling away from the second leg
to win in four minutes 11.76 seconds, beating his 4:12.30 world
mark set at the 1994 world championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Domenico Fioravanti won Italy's first-ever Olympic gold in the
men's 100m breaststroke, setting an Olympic record of 1:00.46.
</P>
<P>
The other world record was also beaten by a Dutch athlete
through Leontien van Moorsel in the women's 3,000m individual
pursuit with a clocking of three minutes 30.816 seconds in a semi-
final.
</P>
<P>
However, Sunday will be remembered as a sorrow day when the
Olympic flag was at half-mast in Sydney as the IOC and the whole
sports world expressed their sincere condolences to IOC president
Juan Antonio Samaranch on the death of his wife.
</P>
<P>
When the IOC announced on Sunday another nine Olympic athletes
recorded suspected positive tests, including two in the athletes'
village, Iranian boxer Anosherawan Nourian could be the latest
athlete expelled from the Sydney Olympic Games for failing a
doping test, the International Amateur Boxing Association said.
</P>
<P>
And the Americans finally walked away from the deadlock on gold
medal tally from Australia, Japan and France with four as both the
hosts and France tied anew on three and Japan and Turkey leveled
on two each after Sunday's competitions.

<HEADLINE> Textbooks of Japan Military Academy During W.W.II Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A set of well-preserved
textbooks used by the Japanese military academy was found recently
in Anshan, northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
What surprised people about the books is that most of the
specific battle examples, tactics, and war history contained in
them were selected from the actual battles that Japanese invaders
had launched in China.
</P>
<P>
The topographic examples and geology were featured with the
geographic landform, climate, and railways in Liaoning, Jilin, and
Heilongjiang provinces in northeast China, and Qingdao in east
China's Shandong Province which were occupied by Japanese invaders
in 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The set, made up of 22 textbooks, was once used by Zhang
Yuanlie, a student of the Japanese military academy. They were
found behind the ceiling of a Japanese styled house.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Calls for Scientific Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Unless scientific steps are
taken, the ambitious program to afforest China's vast and dry
western region would be in vain, warned a Chinese scholar at the
annual conference of the China Association for Science and
Technology, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zehui, president of the China Academy of Forestry, said
that the barren west, which usually reminds people of dry river
valleys, hot underground springs, karst hills and deserts, demands
a scientific reforestation program.
</P>
<P>
China has embarked on several large environmental programs such
as "green for grain," sand control and natural forest preservation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that concerned government departments and
institutions have done scientific planning and backed up these
programs scientifically.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that China has had an edge on the research of
afforestation in dry, coastal and mountainous biosystems, but it
needs to improve the scientific management of forested areas to
ensure the survival of the trees.
</P>
<P>
She said that a modern forestry industry needs advanced science
and technology as well as public attention on forestry cultivation,
which can help improve the different functions and economic value
of forests.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the meeting, a special team of experts
was set up under the State Forestry Administration to help with
the afforestation of the western region.
</P>
<P>
China's forest coverage rate has increased to 16.55 percent
from 8.6 percent in 1949, when the People's Republic was founded.
The country now has the world's largest afforested area.

GAZA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- At least four Palestinian
youngsters and one Israeli soldier were injured Sunday in Gaza when
clashes erupted between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Credit Demand Fall Creates Idle Fund with Bangladeshi Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Fall in credit demand has
created idle funds with commercial banks in Bangladesh, compelling
the banking authorities to invest in low-income government bonds,
top-level bankers in a private commercial bank said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Funds are lying idle with all the commercial banks despite a
nine percent growth in deposit. This suggests fall in credit
demand," said a banker.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of call money or inter-bank lending rate is also
an indicator of low investments, he said, adding that the call
money rate is between five and 6.5 percent, lower than the central
bank's lending rate of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In August, nearly 926 million U.S. dollars of liquidity was
lying with the commercial banks, which was the highest amount in
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
"The commercial banks are now investing in the low-earning
government bonds as huge funds are lying idle with the commercial
banks," another banker said.
</P>
<P>
High lending rate which ranges between 14 and 16 percent is
blamed for the present situation, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Stresses Safety of Hostages in Rescue Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Sunday underlined the safety of the hostages in guidelines
issued for the on-going military operations against the Abu Sayyaf
in the southern island of Jolo, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the Edwin Andrews Air
Base in Zamboanga, near Jolo, Estrada said all means should be
used to secure the safe recovery of the 19 remaining hostages held
by the Abu Sayyaf, the ABS-CBN news channel reported.
</P>
<P>
The president, who flew to Zamboanga Sunday afternoon to
personally monitor the operations and boost the morale of the
troops in the field, issued four guidelines for government troops
and policemen in the operations to rescue the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate and paramount task is the safety of the hostages.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National
Police should exhaust all means to safely secure the victims of
the Abu Sayyaf group captors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who ordered a pre-dawn military attack Saturday
against the Abu Sayyaf rebels, said the second guideline is a
quick settlement of the hostage crisis which has entered its fifth
month.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a quick solution to the crisis situation. We
should destroy the Abu Sayyaf so that they can no longer engage in
kidnap-for-ransom activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf rebels have reportedly amassed millions of dollars
in ransom for the release of 20 of the 21 mostly foreign hostages
they seized from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23.
While freeing some of their captives, they took new hostages for
ransom.
</P>
<P>
They are now holding one American, two French journalists,
three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos. One of the Filipinos is the
last remaining hostage of the Sipadan group.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that there should be least harm to
civilians and damage to civilian properties in the operations and
demanded close cooperation and coordination among various
government agencies involved.
</P>
<P>
In a following press conference held there by the armed forces
and the police, armed forces Chief of Staff Angelo Tomas Reyes
said pursuit operations are still going on against the fleeing Abu
Sayyaf rebels and proper measures will be taken to prevent them
from escaping out of Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
Since military operations began at 1 a.m. Saturday, six
engagements have occurred between the government forces and the
rebels, he said.Six Abu Sayyaf rebels were killed and 20 suspected
Abu Sayyaf members captured while four government soldiers were
wounded, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said there have been no reports of civilian casualties
but Jolo town mayor Rashdi Abubakar said earlier Sunday in an
interview with the ABS-CBN that four civilians wounded in the
cross-fire were sent to the provincial hospital in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said some 200 civilians were injured in the
fighting in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Reyes belied reports that some of the hostages had been
executed by Abu Sayyaf rebels, including American Jeffrey
Schilling, saying all the hostages are alive according to their
assessment based on intelligence reports and field indicators.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 16 (Xinhua)-- Cuban State Council President
Fidel Castro Ruz Saturday met visiting Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan on bilateral relations and other issues of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
Castro congratulated China on its remarkable achievements in
economic development, and hoped that the Sino-African Cooperation
Forum, to be held in Beijing in October, will be a full success.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has attached great importance to relations with China,
Castro said, adding that he believed the friendly cooperative
Cuban-Sino relations will see further development in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Sino-Cuban relations have entered a period of
stable and comprehensive development, with a frequent exchange of
visits of high-level officials and strengthened friendly bilateral
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries cooperate closely and support each other in
global affairs, and the Chinese government thanks Cuba's support
to China over the issues, such as human rights, Taiwan, Tibet and
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China will support Cuba, as always, in opposing
foreign intervention, safeguarding its national sovereignty and
independence, and developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit,
Castro and Chinese President Jiang put forward a conception for
the further development of Sino-Cuban relations from a strategic
viewpoint, giving a strong push for the continuous development of
bilateral ties in the new century, Tang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Seoul and Pyongyang Sunday
agreed to hold their first defense ministers' meeting in Cheju
Island, South Korea, on September 25-26, said the South Korean
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Defense Minister Cho Song-tae and his Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) counterpart Kim Il Chol will
each head a 20-member delegation to attend the two-day meeting,
said a Defense Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, Kim Il Chol, who is also vice chairman of the
DPRK National Defense Commission, delivered a letter of agreement
on the meeting to Cho through the Military Armistice Commission of
the United Nations Command based in the truce village of Panmumjom.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Kim said Pyongyang decided to hold the meeting

South-North Joint Declaration reached by South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang on June 15.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Pyongyang is expected to raise the military
issues on the reconnection of the railway between Seoul and DPRK's

<HEADLINE> 3 More World Marks Tumbled in Olympic Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Dutch stars Inge de Bruin and
Pieter van den Hoogenband and American Tom Dolan all produced new
marks on Sunday, raising the total of swimming world records at
the Olympic Games to eight in the opening two days of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
The United States walked away with two gold medals Sunday night,
while Italy and the Netherlands split the other two.
</P>
<P>
Inge de Bruijn won the 100m butterfly in 56.61 seconds, beating
her own world mark of 56.64 set in July.
</P>
<P>
Martina Moravcova of Slovakia won silver in 57.97 seconds,
while 33-year-old American Dara Torres, who came back after
keeping herself away from swimming for seven years, took bronze in
58.20.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn broke the 100m butterfly world mark for the third
time this year.
</P>
<P>
"I was flying through the water. It felt like a trance," said
De Bruijn. "This is what I've been working for years and now I'm
standing at the top."
</P>
<P>
Guo Qinglong, a FINA official from China, tipped De Bruijn to
bring down more world records later in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Look at her shape," Guo said. "She is perfect for swimming.
She doesn't have an unnecessary ounce of fat."
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband clocked 1:45.35 in the 200m freestyle
semifinals, bettering Ian Thorpe's world record of 1:45.51.
</P>
<P>
"I was so surprised. Then again, I was so relaxed in the water,
" the Dutch wonder boy said. "It felt amazing. Now it promises to
be a great final."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, who broke a world record and helped Australia erase
another on Saturday, qualified second in 1:45.37.
</P>
<P>
"His record didn't affect my performance," Thorpe said. "I'm
happy with how I'm going."
</P>
<P>
American Tom Dolan retained his Olympic 400m individual medley
crown in a world record time.
</P>
<P>
Dolan pulled away from the second leg, winning in four minutes
11.76 seconds to beat the 4:12.30 world mark he set at the 1994
world championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Fellow American Erik Vendt lifted silver in 4:14.23 and
Canadian Curtis Myden got bronze in 4:15.33.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best place in the world for swimming," Dolan said.
"There was no way I was going to win a gold medal if I didn't
break a world record."
</P>
<P>
Domenico Fioravanti won Italy's first-ever Olympic gold in the
men's 100m breaststroke, setting an Olympic record of 1:00.46.
</P>
<P>
Ed Moses, a 20-year-old American, came second in 1:00.73, while
Roman Sloudnov of Russia was third in 1:00.91.
</P>
<P>
Brooke Bennett led a U.S. 1-2 finish by clocking 4:05.80 in the
women's 400m freestyle final.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Claudia Poll, defending Olympic champions over 200m,
took bronze in 4:07.83.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Boxer Could be Expelled from Olympics for Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Boxer Anosheravan Nourian of
Iran could be the the latest athlete expelled from the Sydney
Olympic Games for failing a drugs test.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA) said the
light-welterweight had tested positive for a banned substance in
an out-of-competition dope test.
</P>
<P>
"The full report has not been received and AIBA will have no
further comment until the results are in hand," it said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
said that there were two athletes facing expulsion but refused to
name them.
</P>
<P>
IOC director general Francois Carrard told a news conference: "
Overall there are nine problematic cases. Out of the nine, two of
them are in the athletes' village."
</P>
<P>
The competitors provided the problematic samples in random
tests carried out by the new World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). They
were not tests carried out during the Games which opened on Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Draws United States in Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China sent a signal of
Olympic women's soccer gold medal intentions on Sunday by
dominating a 1-1 draw with world champions the United States.
</P>
<P>
A breathtaking equaliser by captain Sun Wen from a 66th-minute
freekick was no less than China deserved after falling a goal
behind from a kick from USA captain Julie Foudy seven minutes
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
American's favouritism for gold was only emphasised by an
imperious 2-0 victory over Norway Thursday, but after this
impressive performance China has made it clear it may take a
revenge for defeats in both the 1996 Atlanta Olympics gold medal
game and the 1999 World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
In the other Group F match in Canberra, Norway moved back into
contention for a berth in the semi-finals with a 3-1 win over
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Goals from Dagny Mellgren, a penalty by long-serving midfielder
Hege Riise and a last-minute strike by Marianne Pettersen were
enough to end the Africans' Olympic campaign.
</P>
<P>
Norway plays China in its final Group F match Wednesday while
United States takes on Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Australia Encouraged to Bid for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World football governing body
FIFA has encouraged Australia to bid for the World Cup, adding
another great sporting festival to the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Michel Zen-Ruffinen, the secretary-general of FIFA, said
Australia met all the requirements for holding the World Cup,
which he described as "the greatest sporting show on earth."
</P>
<P>
Zen-Ruffinen was in Canberra to watch Olympic football women's
match between Nigeria and Norway and men's game between Slovakia
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The man who is the second most powerful figure in FIFA after
president Sepp Blatter, said Australia already had two stadiums
with large capacities -- Stadium Australia and the Melbourne
Cricket Ground -- which are necessary to any World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for eight stadiums," Zen-Ruffinen said. "The
others must have, at the very minimum, the ability to seat 25,000
spectators."
</P>
<P>
He said Bruce Stadium appeared to very close to that minimum
requirement.
</P>
<P>
Zen-Ruffinen said if Africa staged the 2010 World Cup, as
appeared likely, the Oceania Confederation could look forward to
holding the competition in 2014.
</P>
<P>
"The rotation we have established will continue, but Oceania
will not have it all its own way. Brazil is likely to be a
contender. We hear that Canada is interested. It will be strategic
decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zen-Ruffinen also added that relations between FIFA and the
International Olympic Committee had improved over recent years. "
We are very pleased to be part of the Olympic Games and I know the
IOC wants us to continue."

</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Russian sweetheart enjoyed a great day,

<HEADLINE> China Holds U.S. to a 1-1 Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 17 (xinhua) -- Immensely gifted Sun Wen
lived up to her tag as world footballer as she scored on a
spectacular free-kick to salvage a 1-1 tie with title defender the
United States here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China enjoyed another savior in goalkeeper Gao Hong, who
blocked out a penalty by American midfielder Kristine Lilly in the
68th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were awarded a penalty kick when China's central
defender Fan Yunjie handled the ball as she tried to interject an
attack by Cindy Parlow.
</P>
<P>
U.S. head coach April Heinrichs, though happy with her players'
performance, said: "If we had performed better, we could have won
the game."
</P>
<P>
The Americans got off to a good start when they took the lead
in the 38th minute through a header by skipper Julie Foudy.
</P>
<P>
China never found the chance to hit the equalizer until the 67
th minute when they earned a freekick right to the top of the box.
Then Sun, who scored an freekick in the last game against Nigeria,
displayed her flair of scoring as she curved the ball into the top
left corner of the goal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese captain attributed her talent of goal-busting to
hard work. "It's no secret, I found the touch in countless
practice," she said, "after every workout, I always practice free-
kicking."
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Ma Yuanan was very pleased with the hard-won
draw. He said: "I am very satisfied with my players' performance
as well as their never-say-die spirit. They proved they are better
than their opponents in technique and teamwork."

the damage of a number of houses, but he did not disclose the exact
location suffering the attack.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi security forces launched immediate investigation and found
the equipment for firing missiles and shrapnels of an exploded
missile, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly blamed the missile attacks on Iranian agents
backed by the Iranian government, which has firmly rejected the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
Since the outset of this year, three such attacks have taken
place, killing five people, including a child, and injuring 46
others. Iraq has held Iranian agents responsible for these attacks.
</P>
<P>
For years, Iraq and Iran have been trading accusations for
harboring each other's opposition groups engaged in terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
The opposition groups and the prisoners of war resulted from the
1980-1988 between the two neighbors have become major obstacles to
the normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in
Iraq, a major Iraqi military group, has vowed to continue attacks
until the Iraqi regime is toppled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Muhaheddeen Khalq Organization (MKO), which
maintains a large guerrilla force in Iraq, has intensified attacks
on Iran amid heated power struggle between the conservatives and
reformists in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian opposition group shelled Iranian military
headquarters in Tehran on March 13, injuring at least four people.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls For High Turnout in Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak issued a republican decree Sunday calling on voters to cast
ballots in the upcoming election of parliament, the People's
Assembly, starting next month.
</P>
<P>
The polling for 444 parliament members will be held in three
stages between October 18 and November 15, said the decree, which
was carried by the country's official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will run from October 18 to 25, the second from
October 29 to November 5 and the third from November 8 to 15, it
added.
</P>
<P>
About 21 million voters, accounting for 32.3 percent of the
population, in the south, the north and Greater Cairo will take
turns to go to the polls, according to arrangements worked out by
the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Egypt's 134-year parliamentary history,
this year's elections will be held in stages, other than on a
single day, and under the supervision of judges according to a
ruling in July by the Supreme Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
Egypt does not have enough judges to monitor a nationwide vote
in one day. Previously civil servants manned ballot booths.
</P>
<P>
Under Egyptian laws, the parliament has 454 members, of whom 444
are elected by voters and the other 10 are appointed by the
president. The ruling National Democratic Party led by Mubarak took
about 94 percent of the seats of the last parliament elected in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament is due to open on December 14 under the
decree.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Shutdown Call Paralyzes Chittagong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Cargo handling in Chittagong,
the largest port in Bangladesh, came to a halt Sunday following a
day-long shutdown called by the student fronts of the opposition
political parties in the district to protest against the
harassment of opposition leaders and activists by the police.
</P>
<P>
Kazi Abdul Momen, terminal manager in Chittagong told Xinhua
that 30 ships were at berths and in the outer anchorage but cargo
handling remained suspended because transports were not available.
</P>
<P>
The halt was called by the All-Party Student's Union (APSU),
protesting against arrests, torture and harassment of the leaders
and activists of the opposition political parties by the police.
</P>
<P>
The APSU is a combination of the student groups of all the
opposition political parties including the student front of the
main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by former
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday a pro-government student was killed in Chittagong
by unidentified gunmen and home-made bomb blasts rocked the city,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said 10 people were arrested Saturday in connection
with the killing of the student of Bangladesh Chhatra League (
Bangladesh Students' League), the student front of the ruling
Awami League.
</P>
<P>
Police believed the student was killed by pro-opposition
student activists to create panic in the city and make the strike
call a success.
</P>
<P>
Police and border guards now are guarding the city to halt
fresh violence.

items in leading British newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:

economy.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British doctors believe that a baby girl has been born with
new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow
disease. If confirmed, this would be the first know example of
vCJD being transmitted from mother to child, and will heighten
fears that the disease can be transmitted through blood.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission is secretly planning to scrap "green
polices" devised to promote renewable energy as an alternative to
petrol.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tom Dolan Wins 400m Individual Medley in World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- American Tom Dolan shattered
his own world record to take the men's 400m individual medley
title at the Olympic Games here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Doan, 25, clocked in his winning timing of 4:11.76 to beat his
own world mark of 4:12.30 set on September 66, 1994 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second-day swimming competitions, 12 world
records were broken in the pool at the Millennium Games.
</P>
<P>
Dolan's compatriot Erik Vendt took the silver medal in 4:14.23,
while Canadian Curtis Myden finished third in 4:15.33.
</P>
<P>
Double winner of the U.S. Olympic trial in both the 400m and
200m individual medleys in Indianapolis in August in 4:13.72 and 2:
00.81 respectively, Dolan finished twice second in the U.S. Spring
Nationals this year in the same events in 4:17.28 and 2:01.21.
</P>
<P>
Dolan established his dominance in the men's medley swimming
when he set the world record for the 400m individual medley at the
1994 World Championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he won a gold medal in that event at the Atlanta
Olympic Games and two years later defended his world title in
Perth.
</P>
<P>
He is the current American champion in the 200m and 400m
individual medley.
</P>
<P>
A severe asthma sufferer, Dolan has not let his condition and a
recent knee injury hinder him as he aims for golds again in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"When I am not competing or training, I try to have fun and do
anything that takes my mind off the sport," he said prior to his
arrival in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Dolan underwent arthroscopic knee surgey in Colorado Springs to
repair a complex tear in his medial meniscus in his right knee in
May 1999.
</P>
<P>
He was injured playing basketball as part of dry-land training
exercises at a training camp at the U.S. Olympic Training Center.
</P>
<P>
Dolan's knee surgery in May 1999 meant that he had to withdrew
from the Pan Pacific Games.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 World Championships, Dolan was wearing a pair of
goggles with black straps when he broke the world record for the
400m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
He wore the same pair at every meet after that until they broke
at the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now he puts on a new suit and a
new pair of goggles for every race.

</P>
<P>
"It's amazing. This is so much better than '96, and this is the
best place in the world for swimming," said the double winner of
the U.S. Olympic trial in both the 400m and 200m individual
medleys in Indianapolis in August. In 1996, he won a gold medal
in that event at the Atlanta Olympic Games and two years later
defended his world title in Perth.
</P>
<P>
Dolan finished twice second in the U.S. Spring Nationals this
year in the same events in 4:17.28 and 2:01.21.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, current American champion in the 200m and 400m
individual medley, established his dominance in the men's medley
swimming when he set the world record for the 400m individual
medley at the 1994 World Championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
A severe asthma sufferer, Dolan has not let his condition and a
recent knee injury hinder him as he aims for golds again in Sydney.
"When I am not competing or training, I try to have fun and do
anything that takes my mind off the sport," he said prior to his
arrival in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Dolan underwent arthroscopic knee surgey in Colorado Springs to
repair a complex tear in his medial meniscus in his right knee in
May 1999, sustained while he played basketball as part of dry-land
training exercises at a training camp at the U.S. Olympic Training
Center.
</P>
<P>
His knee surgery in May 1999 meant that he had to withdrew from
the Pan Pacific Games.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 World Championships, Dolan was wearing a pair of
goggles with black straps when he broke the world record for the
400m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
He wore the same pair at every meet after that until they broke
at the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now he puts on a new suit and a
new pair of goggles for every race.
</P>
<P>
Dolan started swimming because his older sister was a swimmer.
"Whatever she did, I wanted to beat her." However, he didn't
aggressively pursued swimming until his freshman year of high
school.
</P>
<P>
Yet, he has accumulated a pile of honors in his career as the
1994 and 1995 USA Swimming Swimmer of the Year, the 1994 Phillips
Performance of the Year Award, the 1995 NCAA Swimmer of the Year.
He is also the spokesperson for the American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
With his asthma and the poor air quality, Dolan could barely
breathed in Atlanta, yet he eventually became the first American
since 1976 to win the 400m individual medley in Atlanta Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Dolan was 18 when he competed in the 1994 World Championships.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Wins Women's 400m Freestyle in Syndey Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- American Brooke Bennett
outraced all other finalists to take the women's 400m freestyle
title at the Millennium Olympics here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old American clocked in 4:05.80 for the top honour,
with her compatriot Diana Munz taking the silver in 4:07.07,
leaving the bronze medal to Claudia Poll of Costa Rica in 4:07.83.
</P>
<P>
"I think it means a lot to come back four years later and win
gold," said Bennett, "And I'm very excited with that time."
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it so bad, going into our trials all I could think
about was missing it in 1996 and how much it would mean to go to
the Olympics in the 400m and 800m."
</P>
<P>
"To have this victory, I am feeling so good I can't wait for
the 800," said Bennett, born on May 6, 1980, who won the 800m
freestyle at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in August with a
timing of 8:23.92, where she finished second in the 400m freestyle
in 4:08.76.
</P>
<P>
Munz was also satisfied with her second-place finish, saying
that "It's fantastic, I'm so excited for the U.S. I mean, it's
unbelievable. You know Brooke and I were going in there and we
don't care who gets first and second, it didn't matter who gets it.
"
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 Pan Pacific Championships in Fukuka, Japan, Bennett
won two gold medals in the 800m and 1,500m freestyles apart from a
silver medal in the 400m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 Pan Pacific Championships in Atlanta, the American
woman swept all the 400m and 1,500m freestyles titles, apart from
a second-place finish in the 800m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Bennett was only 14 when she made her first World Championships
team and was touted as the next janet Evans after winning the 800m
freestyle gold at the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Four years on, she is again the favorite after swimming the
fastest time in seven years for the 800m freestyle of 8:23.92, and
she is the reigning world champion in the event.
</P>
<P>
Bennett joined her first swim team at the age of 5 after some
advice from swimming great Mark Spitz, who was a friend of her
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
And she has won the 1996 Spring Nationals Kiphuth Award and
Phillips Performance Award, the 1995 USOC Sportswoman of the Year
for Swimming.
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that moving out of her parents' farm in Plant City
to the Tampa suburbs and having a normal life outside swimming has
helped her regain motivation after the hype surrounding her
victory in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bennett has a tattoo of the sun and moon, and the Olympic rings,
as it's a family thing with her mother Rachel a tattoo of a
butterfly and her father Keith a tattoo of the American flag on
one shoulder and Brooke's name scrawled around a lighting rod on
the other.

<HEADLINE> Pechalov Wins, Suleymanoglu Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Nikolay Pechalov of Croatia
grabbed the gold medal with one attempt remaining in the men's 62
kilograms category Sunday while Turkey's legend Naim Suleymanoglu
failed to become the first man to win the fourth consecutive
weightlifting Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu was disqualified after the snatch competition
because he didn't list any weights in his three snatch attempts
for 145 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Pechalov, winner of the European championships in April in
Sofia, hoisted a total of 325 kilograms, by lifting 150kg for the
snatch and 175kg for jerk.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy that I have fulfilled all the dreams in my
life," the Croat lifer said. "Tell the people of Croatia I am very,
very proud."
</P>
<P>
Leonidas Sabanis of Greece, who took the silver medal of the
world championships last November, won the same medal of silver
after lifting 147.5- and 170-kg for a total of 317.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Sevdalin Minchev of Bulgaria was third, same award as he won in
the world championships last year, also got 317.5 kgs but he was
behind Sabanis because of body weight.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' Gennady Oleshchuk also lifted 317.5 kgs and had to
settle for fourth for his heavier body weight.
</P>
<P>
World titlist Le Maosheng finished with a disappointed fifth
with a lift of 315 kgs.  "I was too eager to take the gold
medal and felt too much pressure before the competition," said Le,
China's hope for a weightlifting gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"After my snatch I was very worried, " said Le, who snatched
only 140 kgs on the first attempt but failed in following tries.
</P>
<P>
Le, who was world jerk record holder, completed only 175 kgs,
far away from his world mark of 180.5 kgs.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised for Le's performance tonight," China's head
coach Yang Hanxiong said. "I was impressive for the lifters of
Europe who performed so well that we have to learn from them and
make a study for their training methods."
</P>
<P>
This was a sad day for Turkey, which took the first gold medal
of the Games by Halil Mutlu in the men's 56-kg class, and its hero
Suleymanoglu, known as "Pocket Hercules" for his success in the
weightlifting career.
</P>
<P>
The 1.52m tall failed for three times in a row on the same
weight of 145 kilograms in the snatch, which dashed his dream of
winning fourth weightlifting gold medal in the Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
He left the gold chance to Pechalov, who tried for a new world
record of 185 kgs but failed. The Bulgarian-born Croatia lifter
gave up his third and last attempt in the jerk.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu, the only one to win a gold medal at three
consecutive Olympic Games, has dominated the lightweight divisions
from 56 kgs to 62 kgs categories for the best part of two decades.
</P>
<P>
Aside from his Olympic achievements, he has won seven world
titles, six European championships and broke a staggering 46 world
record.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Suleymanoglu said before the Games: "In fact I
believe I can win the gold in Sydney more easily than in Atlanta.
The silver or bronze is nothing for me. I am only satisfied with
the gold."
</P>
<P>
In fact, he is now the biggest loser of the ongoing Olympic
Games.

<HEADLINE> Official: China Confident of Winning Four Women's Weightlifting Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese sports official
said here on Sunday that China is confident of winning four
weightlifting gold medals at the 27th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Wei Di, head of the Chinese Weightlifting Training Camp, said
that the Chinese women should bag four gold medals from as many
events in which they will compete.
</P>
<P>
The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) ruled that one
nation can only send at most four women to take part in the
Olympic Games. "Or China could sweep all the seven gold medals at
stake," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 48kg competition, which ended Sunday afternoon,
Bulgaria's Izabela Dragneva claimed the gold with a modest weight
of 190kg, well outside of the world record of 197.5kg, set by
China's Liu Xiuhua.
</P>
<P>
"There are at leat five athletes in China who can lift 190kg or
over," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
China will compete in the four categories of 53kg, 63kg, 69kg
and over 75kg.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Iraq have signed a
protocol on technical cooperation in the field of electricity and
unconventional energy, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Ali el-Saeedi and
Director of the Iraqi Electricity Commission Salah Yusuf Kazir
inked the protocol, the English-language paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will exchange expertise
and information on replacement, renewal and maintenance of power
stations, and hold relevant and needed technical consultations.
</P>
<P>
It covers cooperation in generation, transfer and distribution
of electricity in remote areas, as well as training Iraqi
technicians and engineers at specialized centers affiliated to the
Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Energy.
</P>
<P>
The protocol called on the private sector in both countries to
step up joint investment in the manufacture and export of
electrical equipments, in addition to meeting the needs of Arab and
African countries in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has a desire to make use of Egyptian expertise in building
power projects and utilizing unconventional energy, the pro-
government paper said.
</P>
<P>
El-Saeedi said after the signing ceremony that Egyptian
companies
are ready to help rehabilitate outdated relay stations of
electricity in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Kazir, who arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for a week-long visit,

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Warns Iraq Against Military Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait, infuriated by
recent Iraqi allegations and threats against it, continued on
Sunday to warn Iraq against any military actions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheikh Salem A-Sabah, in remarks to
local Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam, said the "Iraqi leadership will
pay high price this time if it commits a military foolishness
against Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
"Circumstances are drastically different today than in 1990...
The repeated Iraqi regime's threats are not scaring us whether they
were serious or for political consumption," Sheikh Salem said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Baghdad to change escalating and threatening speech
and initiate to ease suffering of the Iraqi people through
complying with international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid accused
Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil by drilling oil wells in a desert
border zone between the two countries, echoing Iraq's grievance 10
years ago that served as a motive to launch an invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Rashid, who is also an Iraqi armed forces general, also said
that his country "will take suitable measures to guarantee its oil
wealth."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's other cabinet ministers have also reacted strongly to
the Iraqi allegations, blaming Baghdad of trying to trigger a new
regional war.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 sparked the 1991 Gulf War, in
which the U.S.-led forces ejected Iraqi troops. U.N. Security
Council also imposed sweeping sanctions on Iraq in 1990 as a
punishment.

<P>
Fioravanti, who retained his European title in Helsinki in July
this year, had set the pace in both heats and semifinals on
Saturday ahead of world record holder Roman Sludnov of Russia and
fancied American Ed Moses.
</P>
<P>
Moses led at the turn, with Fioravanti fifth, but the Italian
caught him on the return length of the 50-meter pool to win in one
minute 00.46 seconds, inside the 1:00.60 Olympic record set at the
1996 Atlanta Games by Belgium's Frederik DeBurghgraeve, who
retired from the sport earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Moses took the silver in 1:00.73 and Sludnov the bronze in 1:00.
91. Sludnov set the world record of 1:00.36 at the Russian Olympic

After the final, Fioravanti said:"I'm very happy with the time.
I hope I will do well in the 200 meters."

<HEADLINE> Suleymanoglu Fails to Win Fourth Consecutive Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Naim Seuleymanoglu of Turkey
failed to become the first man to win his fourth consecutive
weightlifting Olympic gold medal when he failed all three attempts
in the 62-kg snatch competitions at the Olympic Games here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu, known as "Pocket Hercules" for his success in the
weightlifting arena, failed three times in a row to snatch up the
weight of 145 kilograms, which ruled him out of further
competition in the event, shattering his dream of winning the
fourth weightlifting gold medalist in the Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
The weightlifting legend of Turkey left the gold chance to his
opponents Nikolay Pechalov of Croatia who is leading the snatch
with 150 kgs and Leonidas Sabanis of Greece with 147.5 kgs. And
the Croatian eventually became the winner at the Millennium
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu, the only one to win a gold medal at three
consecutive Olympic Games, has dominated the lightweight divisions
from 56 kgs to 62 kgs categories for the best part of two decades.
Aside from his Olympic achievements, he has won seven world titles,
six European championships and broken a staggering 46 world
records.
</P>
<P>
Revered all over the world, Suleymanoglu was named one of the
25 greatest athletes of the 20th century last year, awarded by the
International Sports Journalist Association.
</P>
<P>
Standing 152 centimeters tall, the 32-year-old Suleymanoglu
faced his toughest Olympic test when Pechalov and Sabanis failed
only once each in the snatch from 145 kgs, 147.5 and 15o kgs.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Games, Suleymagolu said: "In fact I believe I can
win the gold in Sydney more easily than in Atlanta. The silver or
bronze is nothing for me. I am only satisfied with the gold."
</P>
<P>
About the pressures of being a national hero, he said that "
It's big risk. Because if I've promised I will win then I will
have to."
</P>
<P>
Unlucky, he now is a loser and will go home in empty hands, the
world's most celebrated weightlifter.

CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has intensified his
contacts during the last two days in New York with Palestinian,
Russian, Jordanian, Algerian and Turkish ministers or officials on
the Middle East peace process in an effort to effect a breakthrough
on the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nile water level in Lake Nasser registered 179.28 meters
on Saturday, gaining four centimeters more than Friday's level. And
the water stored in the high dam reached 145,180 cubic meters, the

</P>

Al Gomhuria:

century. Representatives from 36 countries are to take part in the

</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Transport Ibrahim el-Demiri does not
dismiss the possibility that electromagnetic waves could have

crash off the U.S. east coast in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, he insists on access to the details not included in U.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, heading home after talks
Thursday and Friday in New York and Washington, did not lead to any
breakthroughs, a spokesman in Israeli Prime Minister's Office said
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami will remain in the U.S.
to take part in the opening of the U.N. General Assembly this week,
while Gilad Sher, the other leading Israeli negotiator, is to
arrive home Sunday. Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and
Mohammed Dahlan already have returned to the region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said that
contacts between the sides will continue, although he did not say
when or where. He said Israel still has not discerned any
flexibility on the part of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior Israeli officers at the General Staff were sharply
critical of the comments made by Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz on
Friday against his outgoing deputy Uzi Dayan and Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, during a ceremony in which Major General Moshe
Ya'alon was appointed deputy chief of staff in place of Dayan,
Mofaz accused his outgoing deputy of disloyalty. He also accused
Barak and Dayan "went behind my back."
</P>
<P>
Most senior staff officers believe that the comments by their
chief of staff are harmful and embarrassing to the Israel Defense
Forces and some of them described Mofaz's behavior as "disgraceful
and embarrassing," and as "inappropriate in the army."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli swimmers broke a national record Saturday on the
first day of the Olympic Games in Sydney, but delegation members
failed to reach the finals in all of their events.
</P>
<P>
The first day of competitions began on a terrible note for
Israel when Alex Danilov was disqualified in the men's 10-meter air
pistol qualifications because his gun was found to be lighter than
the rules require.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting event, swimmers Adi Bichman, Vered
Borochovsky, and Tal Sticker tried their luck. Disappointingly,
none of them made it past the heats.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- August's consumer price index (CPI) in Israel fell by 0.6
percent, more than had been expected, but fuel prices rose Saturday
night for the twelfth time this year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics released its monthly CPI report
Friday. The figure was the lowest since February 1999, when the CPI
dropped 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices dropped some 8 percent in August, but the
current increase of 1.66 percent, added to the 2.2 percent hike at
the start of the month, is part of an international price increase.

<HEADLINE> Eighteen Abu Sayyaf Rebels Arrested: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 Abu Sayyaf members
have been arrested as military operations against the bases of the
rebel group in the southern island of Jolo, Sulu Province, entered
its second day Sunday, a cabinet minister said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, citing reports reaching his
office, said navy operatives arrested at least 18 Abu Sayyaf
members who tried to escape from the ongoing military operations
in Jolo and confiscated some firearms.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered a pre-dawn military attack
Saturday against the Abu Sayyaf rebels in Jolo to rescue 19
hostages, including six foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the military operations in Jolo are confined to
specific areas where the rebels are believed to be keeping the
hostages -- one American, two French journalists, three Malaysians
and 13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
He said that at least four government soldiers were wounded in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jolo town Mayor Rashdi Abubakar said Sunday that
four civilians wounded in the cross-fire were sent to the hospital
in Jolo, according to the ABS-CBN TV station.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said some 200 civilians were injured in the
fighting in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
On earlier reports that some of the hostages had been executed
by Abu Sayyaf rebels, including American Jeffrey Schilling,
Mercado said they believe that those hostages are still alive.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Abu Sayyaf is trying to flee with the hostages,
"he said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada flew to Zamboanga city, near Jolo, Sunday
afternoon to assess the situation in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib Andang, alias Commander Robot,
reportedly called for a cease-fire Saturday after the military
assault began, but there is no confirmation of the report by the
military, which imposed a news blackout following the start of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Under the cover of warplanes and helicopter gunships,
government troops continued their attack on Abu Sayyaf camps on

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Volunteers to Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A plan to strengthen
voluntary work in the fight against disease and poverty has been
unveiled as Kenyan gears to celebrate the International Year of
Volunteers in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Volunteerism is even more important in the fight against
problems like malaria, HIV/AIDS, environmental degradation, drug
abuse and poverty. In the past volunteers have been in the
forefront in promoting peace, democracy and human rights," said
the United Nations Development Program's resident representative
in Kenya, Macleod Nyirongo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's volunteers have decided to mark their year by helping
eliminate malaria because it is a major cause of death and poverty.
</P>
<P>
A secretariat to coordinate the activities, the National
Coordination Committee, has been set up. It was already charged
with raising 46.5 million shillings (about 600,000 U.S. dollars)
through raffles, sports events, charity walks and direct appeals.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, a tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is the
top killer disease in Kenya. Each year, about 30 percent to 50
percent of child deaths are caused by the epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Burundians Urged to Implement Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Minister
for Home Affairs, Mohamed Khatib, has urged all Burundians to
translate the peace agreement signed by various warring parties
into a workable program for the good and prosperous future of
their country, the independent Sunday Observer reported here.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the Association of European Parliamentarians for
Africa (AWEPA) two-day Regional Peace Conference on the Situation
of the Burundian Refugees and Diaspora in East Africa held here on
Saturday, the minister was quoted as saying that the agreement has
taken shape, and it is therefore the responsibility of Burundians
to respect and support the peace accord and ensure that it is
effectively and efficiently implemented.
</P>
<P>
The minister said every Burundian is responsible for the
implementation of the peace accord as a way of rebuilding a
peaceful country, which for along time has been facing political
unrest.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was need for effective implementation of the
accord and the international community should ensure that it
supports the efforts of bringing back durable peace in Burundi to
enable Burundians to carry out their socioeconomic development for
the betterment of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord has been signed by 16 Burundian parties.
However, the major armed Hutu rebel groups refused to accept the
accord and continued fighting.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, if implemented, would put in place a
transitional government in three or six months, create a new upper
house of parliament and split the country's army equally between
Hutus and Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
It is the result of two years of negotiations that began in
June 1998 to end ethnic strife in Burundi, whose seven million
inhabitants are 80 percent Hutu but where minority Tutsis dominate
military, political and economic power.

<HEADLINE> Romanians Ready to Stay at Games with Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian weightlifting
team is ready to pay a 50,000 U.S. dollars fine to stay at the
Sydney Games, avoiding an immediate ban on its members for doping
offences, its Olympic delegation said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy team chief Aurel Predescu said International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) rules allowed a national federation
to pay such a fine in order to avoid a suspension from
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Under IWF rules, a national federation is automatically banned
for one year if three or more of its weightlifters fail doping
tests during a calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Romanian lifters Traian Ciharean and Andrei Mateias were
expelled on Friday after failing dope tests, while a third man,
Razvan Ilie, tested positive in May. The IWF said on Sunday all
Romania's weightlifters had therefore been banned from the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters quoted Predescu as saying that the Romanians had
asked for tests on the B samples of the urine taken from Ciharean
and Mateias in their pre-Games tests. "If the second tests are
positive we will pay the 50,000 U.S. dollars," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Housing Policy Expected in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
prepared to draft a national housing policy aimed at the provision
of housing for all, the Sunday Nation newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There is a shortfall of 120,000 housing units in urban and 300,
000 in the rural areas of Kenya with a population of over 28
million, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomes the private sector to help fill the gap
because it cannot fully meet this high demand alone.
</P>
<P>
"For the country to realize the expected future output of
housing stock, the government will call all actors in both public
and private sectors," said Erastus Mwongera, Permanent Secretary
at the Ministry of Roads and Public Works, when closing a seminar
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The policy is designed to provide adequate low-cost shelters
and a healthy environment. Experts here define a housing unit as a
two-bedroom structure which can accommodate six people.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the cumulative shortfall of housing had
turned most urban areas into "virtual squatter settlements".
</P>
<P>
The ministry welcomed the controversial housing project by the
Nairobi City Council to demolish seven aging and dilapidated
residential districts. About 26,000 new housing units are
projected for construction.
</P>
<P>
Mwongera said that the housing policy has been approved by the
cabinet, adding that they are now preparing necessary documents to
facilitate tabling in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Women's Lifter Makes Olympic History by Winning Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Izabela Dragenva
made Olympic history on Sunday when she booked the first women's
Olympic weightlifting gold medal at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old, former world and four time European titles,
grabbed the gold medal, also her country's first in the ongoing
Games, in the women's 48 kilograms category with a total of 190
kilograms as women made their Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. It's so amazing," Izabela said at the new
conference. "I never, ever thought that I would win."
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting. I'm very proud to be a woman," she added.
Her pre-game favorite teammate Donka Mincheva, world and European
champion in the event, was sadly disqualified for her three-time
failure in the snatch. Mincheva is also the world record holder
of 113.5 kgs in the event jerk.
</P>
<P>
Izabela snatched 85 kgs in her third attempt and jerked 105 kgs
at the second try, giving up her third attempt on her way to the
historic victory.
</P>
<P>
The women's weightlifting was accepted to be part of the
weightlifting program at the Sydney Olympic Games by IOC in Cancun,
Mexico, on 15th November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nott Tara of the United States took the silver medal with an
identical total of 185 kilograms with Lisa Rumbewas Raema of
Indonesia, who won the bronze because of her weight heavier than
Tara.
</P>
<P>
"I am overwhelmed right now. I tied my American record. I was
hoping for 105 kgs, but I didn't need it. This is such an honor.
It is something I've worked for four years," said Tara, winner of
the 1999 Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
Tara was second with a lift of 82.5 kgs when the snatch
competition was finished. The American, whose best result in the
world championship was sixth in the event in 1998, succeeded her
first two attempt in the clean and jerk at 100- and 102.5-kg.
</P>
<P>
Rumbewas was bad in the snatch by lifting 80 kgs but she was
good enough to come back for the bronze with 105 kgs in jerk. The
Indonesian tried a weight of 107.5 but failed.
</P>
<P>
Izabela ensured her winning position after her second clean and
jerk attempt when she had no challenger in front her. Her
performance in the jerk was perfect, lifting 100 kgs and 105 kgs
without any problem.
</P>
<P>
Izabela won her first world champion in the 48-kg class in 1991
and four-time European champion, two in the 50-kg and two in the
54.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- India's foreign exchange
reserves declined sharply by 264 million U.S. dollars to 35.355
billion dollars during the week ended September 8, 2000, compared
with the previous week.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the decline was
solely due to a fall of 264 million dollars in the foreign
currency assets to 32.523 billion dollars for that week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves are down nearly 8 percent from their
mid-April peak of 38.341 billion dollars, largely reflecting the
central bank's efforts to augment dollar supplies to prop up the
rupee.
</P>
<P>
The RBI said variations in reserves also reflected changes in
the value of the rupee against other currencies such as the euro,
British pound and Japanese yen which were also part of the
reserves basket.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- For the second day running,
fencing superpower Italy will not have a competitor in the last
stages of a fencing event at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In the first semifinal later Sunday (5:30 local time), Tatiana
Lougonova of Russia will clash with Gianna Habluetzel-Buerki of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Lougonova won a World Cup event this year at Ipswich, England
and in 1997 was European champion. On her way to the semifinal,
she disposed of Atlanta silver medalist Valerie Barlois-Leroux of
France 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Habluetzel-Buerki, now a young mother, has had several placings
in major events under her maiden name of Harbluetzel.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal epee favorite and double Atlanta Olympic
champion Laura Flessel-Colovic will face five-time team world
champion Timea Nagy of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Her enormous agility and diving attacks on her opponents' feet
make Flessel-Colovoc not just extremely effective but also highly
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
Nagy was earlier seen as Hungary's No. 3 in this event. However,
her more highly rated teammates Ildiko Mincza and Gyongyi Szalay
both fell in the round of 16 and 32.
</P>
<P>
The prospects are good for a Flessel-Logounova final with the
colourful Frenchwoman likely to repeat her Atlanta victory.

SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tough physical games were seen
on the first day of the Olympic men's basketball competition on

the rebound and passed to Lithuania's back court as time was
running out on the clock.

"Before that 3-pointer I had missed three attempts from the ace,
" said Meneghin, "But My teammate on the bench said 'Ok, try it.'
So I shot it and it went in."
</P>

Italy trailed most of the second time while the Lithuania
played a tough mixed defense of zone-and-press. The breathless
pressures forced by both sides in defense left only one player in
each team scoring in double figures.

<P>
Forward Gregor Fucka led the Italian team with 13 points while
Saulius Stombergas was the top scorer for Lithuania with 14.

SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Michael Diamond of Australia
was crowned at the Sydney Olympic Games as he scored the most of
147 points in the men's trap event here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There's no place like home, and to win in front of a home
crowd is something special," said Diamond, adding that "It's my
first major event without him (his father), he didn't team me for
20 years for me to fail at such a big event."
</P>
<P>
Ian Peel of Britain took the silver medal in 142 points, and he
was satisfied with his placing, saying it was the "pinnacle of my
career, and I'm over the moon, and I can't believe it."
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult out there, as the support was always going
to be with Michael (Diamond)," said Peel, "The pressure came on
and I missed one, but I got all of the rest. Brilliant."
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Giovanni Pellielo of Italy who scored
140 points.
</P>
<P>
"I've worked for this for three years, I'm very happy to win a
medal, and I'm very happy with bronze," said Pellielo, "It was a
tremendous contest, and I wasn't sure I won a medal until the end.

</P>
<P>
-- India and the United States have now taken a few steps
further toward enhanced political and strategic cooperation with

Afghanistan, of a joint working group on U.N. peacekeeping and the
adding of a new dimension to the discussions currently under way
to counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times
</P>
<P>

MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered a pre-dawn
military attack Saturday against the Abu Sayyaf rebels in the
southern island of Jolo to rescue 19 remaining hostages and end
the five-month-long crisis that placed not only the country's
economy on hold but its integrity at stake.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S Defense Secretary William Cohen, shortly before leaving

Sayyaf bandits holding 19 hostages, including one American, in
Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Post:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cuban President Castro Visits Maradona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
on Saturday paid a visit to former Argentine soccer star Diego
Maradona, who narrowly escaped death and injury in a car crash
earlier this week in the city's suburbs, according to a Reuters
report from Havana.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader spent more than an hour chatting with 39-year-
old Maradona, who has been resting in a Havana health center hotel
since he survived a head-on collision late Wednesday between the
jeep he was driving and a tourist bus.
</P>
<P>
Maradona presented the 74-year-old Cuban leader with a signed
copy of an autobiography he planned to launch September 28 in
Argentina, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Their private meeting took place at the La Pradera health
center hotel in western Havana, where Maradona has been undergoing
treatment for cocaine addiction since arriving in Cuba in January.
</P>
<P>
The former captain of the Argentine national team had to be
freed by rescuers from the twisted wreckage of his four-wheel-
drive jeep after it smashed head-on into an oncoming tourist bus
after travelling the wrong way down a road at night. Neither the
driver of the bus, which was not carrying passengers, nor an
Argentine friend riding with Maradona, were injured in the
accident.

<HEADLINE> China Calms Down Rising Cotton Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China will auction about 200,
000 tons of cotton reserve around October 1 to calm down rising
price, said an official with the National Cotton Trade Market.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned cotton growers not to anticipate extraordinarily
high prices and stow their produce.
</P>
<P>
Although China's cotton production is expected to fall short of
demand this year, the government will use its huge cotton stocks
to balance supply and demand, said Zhu Lanfen, director of the
Enterprise Reform Department of the State Textile Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Insiders estimate China has about two million tons of cotton in
stock.
</P>
<P>
China produced 3.1 million tons of cotton yarn in the first
half of this year, up 16.8 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
A national cotton conference hosted by the All-China Federation
of Supply and Marketing Co-operatives in August decided that a
suitable cotton price will be around 8,600 yuan (about 1,036 U.S.
dollars) per ton. It is higher than last year's suggested cotton
price of the co-operative at 7,600 yuan (about 915.7 U.S. dollars),
and also about 10 percent higher than last year's actual
purchasing price at about 7,800 yuan (about 939.8 U.S. dollars)
per ton.

"Eximbank will provide quality and highly efficient financial
services for Chinese companies going outward," said Yang Zilin,
president of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank will expand loan services to Chinese companies that
engage in processing trade or contract projects in foreign
countries, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to provide first priority credit for export of
equipment, technology and raw materials that are demanded by the
overseas investment projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the country's only export-oriented policy bank established
six years ago, Eximbank has broken new ground for China's
exporters.
</P>
<P>
It financed the first large export project of
telecommunications products by lending 250 million U.S. dollars to
a domestic telecommunication maker for a massive export contract
signed with a Pakistani buyer.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the bank offered the first loan for exports of China's
aviation products. Eximbank lent 2.6 billion yuan (313 million U.S.
dollars) by the end of last year to domestic airline companies who
produced plane parts for world-renowned airplane manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
It lent 2.5 billion yuan (301 million U.S. dollars) in 1999 to
finance project contracts worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 15
countries.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Grants Loans to Rural Credit Co-ops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (
PBC), China's central bank, announced last week it would relend 33.
3 billion yuan (four billion U.S. dollars) to rural credit co-
operatives.
</P>
<P>
The central bank asked the co-operatives to make full use of
the funds to support agricultural production and increase farmers'
income.
</P>
<P>
The move showed that the State is enhancing its efforts to
increase rural consumption, which remains bearish while urban
residents have begun to spend more.
</P>
<P>
According to State statistics, the growth of retail sales in
rural areas in the first six months of the year was 1.8 percentage
points lower than the growth in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
As farmers account for two-thirds of the country's total
population, if consumption in rural areas cannot be stimulated,
the full expansion of domestic demands, a strong engine for
economic growth, will not be realized.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' weak buying enthusiasm is mainly attributed to their
low income. The growth of farmers' income has dropped in recent
years, from nine percent in 1996 to 3.8 percent in 1999. The per
capita cash income for farmers in the first six months rose only 1.
5 percent to 1,013 yuan.

</P>
<P>
"One thing I have confidence in is that I can sprint," said the
Canadian who started competition at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
Whitfield who finished only seventh in the ITU World
Championships in Montreal, Canada, in 1999, said that "my coach
said that great things happen themselves. That is what I thought
to myself through the race -- great things happen. And it did."
</P>
<P>
He also finished ninth in the ITU World Cup in Noosa, Australia
in 1999, and ninth again in the ITU World Championships in Perth,
Australia in 1997.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian weightlifting
team has been expelled from the Sydney Olympic Games with
immediate effect for doping offences, the International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
IWF general-secretary Tamas Ajan said:"We have asked the
Romanian team to withdraw. The ban is immediate and the team will
take no further part in the Games, " according the Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Under IWF rules, a national federation is automatically banned
for the remaining of the season if three or more of its
weightlifters fail doping tests during the season.
</P>
<P>
Romanian weightlifters Traian Ciharean and Andrei Mateias were
expelled from the Romanian team on Friday after failing pre-Games
dope tests, while a third man, Razvan Ilie, was withdrawn from the
Sydney team for doping earlier this year.

SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World record holder and
current Pan Pacific chmapion Tom Malchow of the Uinted States will
go into Monday's heats of the men's 200m butterfly as the favorite
to win an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Malchow's world record of 1:55.18, the fastest time swum this
year, is 0.45 seconds ahead of the next best performance this year,
swum by three-time Olympian Franck Esposito of France.
</P>
<P>
Competing in his second Olympic Games, Malchow will be trying
to add another medal to the silver he won as a 19-year-old at the
1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Malchow's strongest competition will come from Esposito, a
bronze medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games and fourth-
place finisher in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Current world champion Denys Sylantyev of the Ukraine, who
recorded the third-fastest time of the year, will be looking to
improve on his sixth place finish in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta gold medalist Denis Pankratov of Russia is back to
defend his title, while Britain's James Hickman, 1996 Atlanta
Games and 1998 World Championships finalist, also will challenge
the field.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Weightlifting Team Expelled from Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian weightlifting
team was expelled from the Sydney Olympics with immediate effect
on Sunday after three lifters failed drug tests this year.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee director general Francois
Carrard said the expulsion was ordered by the International
Weightlifting Federation.
</P>
<P>
Under federation rules, any nation is suspended from
competition for the rest of that year if three or more of its
weightlifters test positive for banned drugs. A third Romanian
weightlifter tested positive earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Romanian weightlifters Traian Ciharean and Andrei Mateias were
expelled from the Romanian team on Friday after failing pre-Games
dope tests, while a third man, Razvan Ilie, was withdrawn from the
Sydney team for doping earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The federation has a rule that if three test positive, the
entire team is suspended," Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
Traian Ciharean, a bronze medalist at the Barcelona Olympics,
and Adrian Mateias failed dope tests that were administered to all
257 Olympic weightlifters. They were expelled from their team.
</P>
<P>
According to the IWF, weightlifting is the only Olympic sport
in which all athletes were tested for drugs before the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Razvan Ilie, a 1999 world champion in the
snatch at 77 kilos (169} pounds), tested positive and was thrown
off the team before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian weightlifting federation last year began
automatically banning for life any lifter who fails a drug test.
</P>
<P>
Three weightlifters from Chinese Taipei have also tested
positive this year but IWF secretary general Tamas Ajan said their
case was different and they would not be subject to a year's ban.
</P>
<P>
He said this was because two of those who failed dope tests,
women weightlifters Chen Jui-lien and Wu Mei-yi, had been tested
by their organization only.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Helicopter Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China has set a goal to turn
itself into one of the world's major general-use helicopter
producers by 2030, according to today's China Daily Business
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Liang Zhenhe, deputy general manager of the China Aviation
Industry Corporation II, said that China's general aviation market
was almost closed to the use of helicopters, and China needs to
map out a long-term and stable plan for the development of the
country's helicopter industry.
</P>
<P>
China at present has less than 80 general-use helicopters in
operation, which means every one million people owns about 0.06
helicopters, far less than the worldwide figure 3.9, said Liang.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts noted that development of a helicopter
industry is an important measure to increase the production
capacity of China's military products, and will help create a new
growth factor for the economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that China would need about 1,800 helicopters
worth some 4.9 billion U.S. dollars by 2013.
</P>
<P>
"We are now striving to obtain an airworthiness certificate
from the Chinese aviation authorities to enter China's general
aviation market," Liang said.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese regulatory
authorities will loosen their control on the corporate bonds
issuance procedure under a new management provision that is
expected to come out by the end of the year, reported today's
China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission will no longer limit
the issuance volume of corporate bonds under the new provision,
nor will it examine and give opinion on every issue, said a senior
financial expert.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization of the corporate bonds issuance is the
government's effort to reduce administrative power on corporate
bonds and subject them to the market demand, which is in line with
the international practice," Dong Chen, an analyst with the China
Securities, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the securities watchdog turns down about 40
percent of applications every year, and the to-be-established
second board will also be too crowded with over 2,000 companies on
the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the rescinding of government limitations will
significantly stimulate the development of China's corporate bonds
market with issuance volume increasing by several folds every year
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arrested for Blackmailing Professor and Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Police have arrested
a suspect for allegedly blackmailing a professor and a researcher
with threatening letters.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinda is suspected of delivering a letter to the home of
a professor at a Beijing-based university on June 8, saying that
he has been hired to kill the professor.
</P>
<P>
Zhang promised to give up his murder plan and reveal the name
of the man who hired him if the professor deposited 30,000 yuan (3,
614 U.S. dollars) into a designated bank account.
</P>
<P>
A research fellow at another Beijing-based university received
a similar letter on August 25 attempting to blackmail him for 8,
000 yuan. The researcher was warned that his home would be burnt
if he did not pay the money.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Police grouped the two cases together for investigation
and seized Zhang at his home in Zaoqiang County, Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang admitted that he once worked as a home decorator for the
professor and the researcher. He decided to blackmail them with
threatening letters since he believed that senior intellectuals
like them must be very rich.
</P>
<P>
The case is under further investigation.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Turns Garbage into Tiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A new machine developed in
Tianjin can turn garbage into colorful road pavement tiles within
seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
The machine can crush unsorted garbage and turn it into
innocuous construction materials, such as bricks used to build
fences and dike dams. One ton of garbage can be processed into 26
square meters of tiles.
</P>
<P>
The port city of Tianjin near Beijing will invest 26.5 million
yuan (3.2 million U.S. dollars) in establishing an automated
production line which can process 300 tons of garbage daily and
produce two million square meters of colorful tiles annually.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to produce an annual output value of 50
million yuan and 10 million yuan in pre-taxation profits.
</P>
<P>
Nankai district of Tianjin will produce no discharges of
garbage once the project is completed and put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Garbage is usually buried or burnt in China, which requires
more land and causes further pollution. Experts say the garbage-to-
tile technology is a good news for Chinese since it does not
require much investment or operation costs to turn heavily mixed
garbage into useful items.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Argentina to Settle Chicken Conflict Through WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The controversy around
Brazil and Argentina chicken trade continues after several rounds
of negotiations, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) looks as
the only way out.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Common Market (Mercosur) Joint Parliamentary
Commission presidency was quoted Saturday by the press as saying
that the Brazilian government could appeal to this multilateral
mechanism, since the Argentines refused to solve the problem in
the Mercosur Arbitration Court.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Brazilian Development Ministry's Foreign Trade
secretary Lytha Spindola admitted that the WTO was one of the
options for the country, but the Brazilian government decided to
try first a solution within the Mercosur framework.
</P>
<P>
The Argentines set a minimum price for the Brazilian chicken
exports to their country, causing a new dispute between the two
countries. Brazil decided to ask the Mercosur Arbitration Court
after the failure of the bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Agriculture Minister Marcus Pratini de Moraes said,
on another front of the trade war with Argentina, that Brazil
could revise the wheat import policy, in case the Argentines show
no more flexibility in the terms to include sugar in the Mercosur
free trade area.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Brazil could buy more wheat from
Canada and the United States, instead of getting it from Argentina,
now the biggest supplier of this cereal grain to Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Cost Brazil Billions of Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is one the countries
with the biggest number of vehicle accidents with run-overs
costing the country almost 10 billion U.S. dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed during an international seminar on road safety,
held Friday in Brazil with the attendance of members of the Global
Road Safety (GRSP), the World Bank, the several levels of the
Brazilian government, and representatives of non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The losses, according to the seminar, are mainly caused by the
deaths, hospital expenses, and the number of mutilations, that in
many cases, physically disabled the victims.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Brazil is very serious and demands the
participation of all the sectors of society to find a solution,"
Dijo Jose Cardita, advisor of the GRSP, an entity created in
February of 1999 during the World Bank convention.
</P>
<P>
The GRSP offers consultation services in the transports area
for the World Bank, with the goal of reducing human and economic
losses caused by accidents.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank representative for Latin America and
the Caribbean Paul Guitink, the large number of accidents and run-
overs is one of the factors that hamper the economic growth of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We lend every year almost 15 billion dollars to those
countries, but the losses they have with the traffic surpass 60
billion dollars every year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative expects private interests to take
part in programs that might help reduce this problem, mainly with
preventive campaigns of education for safety of transit.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Beef Up Security In Border Areas With Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will triple the
number of police agents deployed in its Amazonian border region
with Colombia, to combat drug traffickers and Colombian guerrillas
attempting to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Federal Police will increase the numbers of
police agents deployed in all the Amazonian region from the
regular 1,035 to 3,000 and will have the support of 25,000
soldiers men, who are already operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Police was quoted by the local press on Saturday as
saying that the Brazilian police will be coordinated by other
countries, including Venezuela, but it will concentrate its
operation in the border areas with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government is concerned with the negative effects
of the Plan Colombia, fearing that the U.S. supported operation
might draw foreign drug traffickers and guerrillas into Brazilian
territory and also cause environmental damage to the Amazonian
region by the use of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcement of police forces in the border is one of the
measures taken by the Brazilian authorities after the announcement
of the Colombian program.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Intensifies Operations Against FARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Armed Forces
Saturday intensified operations on the outskirts of the capital to
prevent new armed incursions from the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the launch of more operations, Colombian Army's
Commander General Fernando Tapias asked local authorities to take
necessary measures to prevent guerrillas from using the civil
population as human shields.
</P>
<P>
Several people kidnapped by FARC are now in Sumapaz, a rural
area southeast of Bogota and operations are in process to prevent
guerrillas from taking more kidnapped persons to that region,
Tapias said.
</P>
<P>
Four guerrilla members were killed, he added.
</P>
<P>
FARC, the largest and oldest surviving rebel force in Latin
America, with 15,000 members and about 40 percent of Colombia's
territory under its control, is active in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It is engaged in slow-moving peace talks with the government,
but no cease-fire deal has been agreed upon as part of the peace
process that aims to end a decade-old conflict in which 35,000
people have died.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- People in Tianjin, a port
city neighboring Beijing in north China, are required to use only
degradable plastic bags or tableware from October 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has issued a decree
to deal with white pollution, which is caused by excessive use of
plastic bags and dishware.
</P>
<P>
Production and sales of non-degradable plastic bags and
tableware is halted. Plastic producers who violate the decree will
be fined 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is one of the cities in China that have suffered
severely from white pollution. One million plastic bags and
tableware are thrown away every day.
</P>
<P>
Plastic bags and tableware became popular only a few years ago,
as people felt it was convenient and clean to use them. Their use
can be seen almost everywhere across the country. Farmers use
mulching film to cultivate crops, passengers on trains use plastic
dishware, and customers use plastic bags to carry their goods.
</P>
<P>
An advertisement broadcast across the country advises people to
knot the plastic bag to avoid whirling after being cast off.
</P>
<P>
Some sales promotions handed out free hop-pockets to encourage
people to use less plastic bags.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
succeeded in peeling off frescos dating back over 1,000 years and
originating from the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The frescos were discovered in a tomb located in the downtown
area of Anyang City, central China's Henan Province, earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The complete and clear paintings cover more than 20 square
meters. They visualized the life of the occupant before his death.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists highly value a portrait of a noble woman who had
a willow leaf-shaped ornament on the face.
</P>
<P>
Underground frescos belonging to Tang Dynasty were rarely seen
in Henan Province. Archaeologists decided to peel off the frescos
for better protection since the original site is no longer safe
for the ancient frescos.
</P>
<P>
It took them some four months to strip the three to four mm
thick fesco from the walls without damaging them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China has recently developed
one of the key component for digital video disk (DVD) pick-ups,
one of the core technology for DVD players and computer CD-ROMs,
that will break the technology monopoly of Western companies.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made by a group of scientists headed by
Chen Lianghui, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) as part of the country's high-technology development plan
Program 863.
</P>
<P>
The core component China has managed to develop is a 650
nanometer semiconductor laser diode. The other two core components
are lens and decoding chips.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuzhang, also a CAS research fellow, said the market
potential for the technology is huge in and outside China.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for DVD players around the world is expected to
reach 120 million, including 10 million from China, and 80 million
DVD players will be used for personal computer CD-ROMs," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li, also executive vice director of the National Engineering
Research Center for Optoelectronics Devices, said the researchers
are planning to commercialize the technology by setting up a joint
venture with a domestic company.

<HEADLINE> China Develops High-Brightness LED </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists on the Chinese
mainland have recently developed the country's first high-
brightness light-emitting diode (LED) using a patented technique,
breaking the technology monopoly held by a small number of
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made by a group of scientists headed by
Li Yuzhang, a researcher with the Institute of Semiconductors
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) as part of the country
's high-technology development plan Program 863.
</P>
<P>
The diode developed by CAS scientists is capable of emitting
very bright red, orange and yellow light, and the brightness of
the red and orange light is as good as the best in the world, said
Li.
</P>
<P>
 Li, also executive vice-director of National Engineering
Research Center for Optoelectronics Devices, said the special
technique is called "metal organic chemical vapor deposition (
MOCVD)".
</P>
<P>
Light-emitting diode, widely used in display panels for
electronic advertisement boards, stock market boards, and in
indicators for vehicles and medical instruments, is more effective
than incandescent lamps because it is more energy-efficient and
has a lifespan of over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Li said the market potential for the technology is huge both in
and outside China.
</P>
<P>
There are over 100 plants in China assembling about 15 billion
units of LED this year with imported parts, while the demand for
LED in the world market exceeds 100 billion units.
</P>
<P>
Li said the institute is planning to commercialize the
technology by manufacturing LED.
</P>
<P>
He said scientists across the world are attempting to develop
LED that emits bright white light, and major breakthroughs in the
endeavor will lead to a revolution in lighting technology by
drastically cutting global power consumption.

Self-Taught Graduates to Have Their diplomas Put on Line
</P>
<P>
The Office for Adult Education of the Ministry of Education
will place on the Internet the certificates of graduates who have
passed a national examination for self-taught students.
</P>
<P>
This action has been taken for the convenience of employers who
want to prove the authenticity of the educational background of
self-taught students, an official from the office said in Beijing
on September 2.
</P>
<P>
It will be a blow to those who have been profiteering from
manufacturing and selling counterfeit diplomas and should curb
this booming underground business in many Chinese cities,
including the national capital of Beijing, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More People with Ethnic Background Take Teaching Posts
</P>
<P>
Over 900,000 people with ethnic backgrounds are now taking
teaching positions in China, accounting for 7.7 percent of the
country's total population of teachers.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education said that due to
efforts made by the central government, including establishing
normal colleges, reinforcing training and improving the status of
teachers' living conditions in predominantly ethnic areas, more
people from ethnic backgrounds want to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, about 288,820 middle school teachers in China were of
different ethnic backgrounds, 107 times that of 1949 when the
People's Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
More Talent Attracted to Teaching Profession
</P>
<P>
China will bring in more qualified personnel into its education
system in the coming years to improve the professional skills of
the country's teachers, the Ministry of Education said today.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that teachers possess the necessary skills, China has
set up a number of independent normal colleges to train primary
and high school educators.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1999, China had a total of 227 normal colleges
and universities with 845,000 students, according to ministry
statistics.

China Awards Excellent Teachers
</P>
<P>
China has awarded more than 40,000 teachers and education staff
since it started a yearly nationwide activity in 1986 to honor
excellent educators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 1,000 various assistance funds for
teachers have been set up, covering all provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions in China, according to the Ministry of
Education.

</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the Compulsory Education Law in 1986, the
Education Law in 1995, the Vocational Education Law in 1996 and
the Higher Education Law in 1998, China began to build up a legal
system to protect teachers' rights.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Teachers Law for the first time thoroughly regulated

<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Penny Heyns of South Africa is
looking to back-to-back Olympic gold medals in the 100m
breaststroke at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
However, the current world and Olympic record holder can expect
strong opposition from Megan Quann of the United States, Masami
Tanaka of Japan and Staciana Stitts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Heyns' qualifying time of 1:06.52, a world record, was set back
in August 1999, while the times of Quann (1:07.12), Tanaka (1:07.
27) and Stitts (1:07.79) were all recorded at their respective
Olympic trials this year.
</P>
<P>
Swimming next to Heyns in Heat 6 will be 15-year-old Leisel
Jones of Australia, the youngest swimmer on the Australian team.
</P>
<P>
Agnes Kovacs of Hungary, the 1998 world champion in the 200m
breaststroke, is the fifth seed at 1:07.92. Also racing will be
Jones's training partner tarnee White of Australia, who qualified
ninth fastest with a time of 1:09.05.

<HEADLINE> Wrong Gear Costs Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A wrong gear selection cost
world record holder Arnaud Tournant a chance of a medal in
Saturday's men's 1km time trial final.
</P>
<P>
Riding last in a field of 16 riders, the dual world champion
finished fifth behind eventual gold medalist Jason Queally, who
surprised even himself with a personal best winning time of 1:01.
609.
</P>
<P>
Tournant said he was pleased with his perparation for the final
, but could not produce the form with which he broke the world
record of 1:00.148 in Mexico City in June this year.
</P>
<P>
"During training in France, I was all right but tonight it just
didn't work," he said after the disappointing ride. "I tried a
bigger gear, but it's better to keep to what you know you can do."
</P>
<P>
Tournant's choice of the wrong gear obviously slowed him down
in the last of the four laps, posting a split time of 16.329,
which was the eighth slowest after having the fastest time at the
half-way split.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets Saudi Prince on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on Sunday met with visiting Saudi Arabian Prince and Emir
of Riyadh province Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, the highest Saudi
official to visit the kingdom in years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, King Abdullah affirmed the close brotherly
ties between the two countries and stressed Jordan's keenness to
further cement relations with Saudi Arabia in all fields, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Their talks focused on ways to bolster bilateral relations, to
support a joint Arab action on issues confronting the region,
particularly the Middle East peace process, Petra said in a
dispatch.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Prince Salman lauded what he called a strong and
longstanding relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince arrived here earlier in the day on a three-day
visit. He brushed aside allegations that ties between Saudi Arabia
and Jordan have been lukewarm in recent years upon his arrival at
Amman airport.
</P>
<P>
Asked about inter-Arab relations, the Saudi prince said that "if
there is any strains in Arab relations, definitely it is not
between Jordan and Saudi Arabia."
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials are privately displeased over the
failure of Saudi Arabia to translate into action its pledges to
provide economic assistances into the kingdom after late King
Hussein died of cancer in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that ties between the two countries have not
been restored to the level prior to the 1990 Gulf Crisis, which was
triggered by Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had been isolated by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other
countries for its sympathy with Iraq during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had been the largest donor to Jordan before the
Gulf crisis, providing the kingdom with hundreds of millions of U.
S. dollars in various aid packages.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General's
special envoy Catherine Bertini arrived here on Sunday for a week-

</P>
<P>
As a follow-up to her regional tour to the Horn of Africa in

Kenya is experiencing the worst drought over the past 40 years
and about 3.3 million people in the country are facing the threat
of famine.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Warns Against Foot and Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has warned that the country could face disaster if the
outbreak of foot and mouth disease on a pig farm at Camperdown in
the KwaZulu-Natal midlands this week was not contained.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists in the eastern city of Pietermaritzburg
on Sunday, South African Agriculture Director-General Bongiwe
Njobe said strict emergency measures have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Department of Agriculture as well as police,
defense force members and members of the Pietermaritzburg fire
department have been called in to enforce a three-week quarantine
in a bid to prevent a national disaster, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said between 90 and 100 farms at Camperdown have been put
under quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Foot and mouth disease is an international trade-sensitive
disease and a large spectrum of South Africa's agricultural
exports -- from tobacco and grains to citrus products and meat --
could be affected if measures to contain the disease fail, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
She said she is satisfied that everything possible has been
done to contain the disease.
</P>
<P>
"This included placing the area under quarantine and
immediately killing off the infected animals," she said.
</P>
<P>
The South African government Sunday also placed an immediate
ban on swill (kitchen refuse) bought from ships after it was
established that the disease was carried in pig feed from a ship
in Durban harbor. The pig feed was possibly imported from India,
Thailand or the Middle East where this type of foot and mouth is
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
Swill is a major source of pig fodder and all port authorities
have by Sunday been notified to stop any further distribution of
it, Njobe said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal agriculture officer Narend Singh said
the government is trying to trace the origin of the swill and an
investigation was already launched.
</P>
<P>
He said a decision would be made on Monday to determine if
there should be a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at existing legislation to see if anyone can be
held criminally liable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease in South Africa was
in 1956 when about 3000 heads of cattle were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Liberal Democratic Party Holds Annual Party Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lib Dem leader said although he was disappointed on several
fronts with Prime Minister Tony Blair's administration,
Conservative leader William Hague's alternative was as an "
increasingly headcase agenda" of populist ideas which would leave
Britain ungovernable.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's declaration came the same day opinion polls suggested,
for the first time in eight years, that Labor had lost its lead
over the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The polls fueled speculation of a hung parliament after the
next election -- expected to be held next spring -- in which the
Lib Dems would hold the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a fringe meeting of the New Radicalism group,
Kennedy said one of the conference's key goals must be to hammer
home the message that Hague was unfit to govern.
</P>
<P>
"There is disillusion with the government, self-evidently," he
said. "But we really have to start confronting people with the
increasingly headcase agenda of William Hague."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against reading too much into the latest polls,
forecasting they would turn out to be a "blip" caused by the
sudden springing up of the fuel crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Last week was obviously a spectacular, unusual week," he said.
"Therefore, we would expect some blip by way of response in terms
of public opinion."
</P>
<P>
A number of conference delegates raised the contentious issue
of relations with Labor, calling on the Lib Dem leadership to pull
out of the Joint Cabinet Committee (JCC) in which they hold talks
on constitutional issues with government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy played down the JCC's significance, saying it had met
just twice in the past year.

<HEADLINE> British Conservatives Take Lead over Labor: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A poll by MORI published in the News of World on Sunday gave
the Conservatives a two point lead over New Labor, while a second
poll published in The Sunday Times by NOP puts Labor and the
Tories neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
The polls were among the first published following last week's
mass protests over the level of duty on fuel.
</P>
<P>
Labor took its eight-year poll lead over Conservatives after
the pound crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World poll puts the Tories on 38 percent, Labor
on 36 percent with the Liberal Democrats on 18 percent, while the
Sunday Times puts Labor and the Conservatives neck and neck on 37
percent, with the Lib Dems also benefiting from Labor's woes on 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
Also worrying for the British government is the number of
voters who said that they found the prime minister out of touch
with the public, while Chancellor Gorden Brown is seen by over 70
percent of voters to blame for the high fuel prices.
