<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Visit Turkish Cypriot Side in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit is expected to attend the anniversary celebrations for the
Turkish intervention on Cyprus on July 20, 1974, said Turkish
sources here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who asked not to be named, said that Ecevit will
be accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Develet Bahceli and
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
During his tour on the island, Ecevit and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktas will discuss the integration between Turkey
and northern Cyprus and the G-8 countries' call for the resumption
of the Cyprus talks with no preconditions.
</P>
<P>
At their summit held in Germany, the seven most industrialized
nations and Russia in a statement issued Sunday urged United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to invite the leaders of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides for talks in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, Denktas and Ecevit are expected to
declare their opposition to any formula that does not envisage a
solution on a "two-state basis."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since July 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Poll Shows Growing Concern On Moral Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. public has a growing
concern about moral leadership after President Clinton's sex
scandal, according to a bipartisan poll released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party has almost a 20 percentage-point edge over
Democrats when asked which party best represents morality.
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans are tied at 39 percent apiece when
voters were asked which party they would vote for if the election
for Congress were held today.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Texas Governor George W. Bush, the
Republican front-runner for 2000 presidential elections, has a 52
percent to 37 percent lead over Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Republican pollster Ed Goeas and
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, surveyed 1,002 registered voters
between June 6-8.
</P>
<P>
Both Goeas and Lake agreed that the public attitudes were
affected by President Clinton's impeachment fight and Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
"Democrats paid a big price" after the scandal and impeachment
fight, Lake said. "It has diminished our credibility on
morality."

ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Forestry Minister Nami
Cagan announced here Thursday that Turkey will take all necessary
measures to prevent forest fires throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In a circular sent to all organizations affiliated with the

used for any purpose other than to report fire, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that in order to monitor forest fires efficiently,
watch towers will be constructed.
</P>
<P>
Emergency roads through the forest should be repaired so as to
be open to transport when needed, Cagan said, adding that during
the forest fires, a management chief will be dispatched to the
area to take control of the team in the field.

MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian defense official
said here Thursday that Western media reports about Russian
volunteers assisting in what he called punitive operations against
Kosovo Albanians are good for NATO.
</P>
<P>
"May these claims be on the conscience of the Pentagon and
NATO. The point is that the West, especially NATO, did not want

in Kosovo," the Interfax news agency quoted Colonel-General Leonid
Ivashov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's main international
cooperation department, as saying.

"No one has been sent to Kosovo by the defense ministry, and
our military has taken no part either in combat actions or in the

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed, 4 Wounded in Israeli Attacks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese were killed and four
others wounded when they tried to evacuate workers from the fire
set by Israeli air raids on a Lebanese electricity plant.
</P>
<P>
The country's privately-owned MTV TV station reported that the
three dead are all fire fighters and the wounded are civilians
and security forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes staged two sorties on Lebanon's electricity
plant in Gumhur, about 10 kilometers east of Beirut, setting the
plant on fire, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was cut off by the air raid in parts of Beirut and
its suburbs and the country's central Mountain Lebanon Province.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also raided Lebanon's eastern ancient city
of Baalbek, cutting off the city's electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman admitted the raid,
saying Israeli jets struck Lebanon's Gumhur Electricity Plant,
adding the blast served as a response to the cross-border rockets
attacks by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Hezbollah slammed several Katyusha rockets
and mortar bombs into northern Israel to avenge an Israeli
shelling which wounded a Lebanese woman in the day.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth civilian wounded by Israeli shelling in five
days.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Israel reached an understanding in April 1996
after an Israeli 16-day onslaught on Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered agreement bars any attacks on civilians or
from civilian area on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Thursday spoke highly of the military cooperation between
Mozambique and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president made the comment at a press conference
after his talks with visiting Botswanan President Festus Mogae in
Mozambican capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that the Mozambican army has got much support
from its Botswanan army in the restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
He added that Mozambique had also helped Botswana build up its
armed forces in the past.
</P>
<P>
Botswana joined in the U.N. peace-keeping force in Mozambique
in monitoring the implementation by the Mozambican government and
the opposition Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) of the
general peace accord reached in Rome in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some Botswanan officers with rich experience in regional and
world peace- keeping are working as instructors in Mozambique,
Chissano said, adding that their instruction is bearing fruits.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed the cooperation between the
two nations in such fields as defense, animal husbandry, trade and
training.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said that Mozambique plays an important role in the
development of the Botswanan economy. Botswana imports much goods
through Mozambique's central port of Beira.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan president arrived in Maputo Tuesday on a
three-day working visit to Mozambique.

<P>
GAZA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Thursday urged Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak to follow
the suit of late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the call in a press briefing here after returning
from a brief visit to Egypt in the day.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as "very important," Arafat said he
exchanged views with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on ways of
pushing forward the Middle East peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
As for Barak's reported intention to form a coalition
government with the right-wing Likud Party, Arafat said "We do not
interfere in Barak's affairs, but we hope that he will keep his
word that he is Yitzhak Rabin's successor."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that he will follow the line of the late prime
minister and the Labor Party," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was elected Israeli prime minister in the May
elections, pledged to revitalize the peace process on all tracks
during his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid-initiated peace process, must be based on fair,
permanent and comprehensive peace for the region as a whole, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing Jewish settlement activities on the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Arafat said "such ploys are doomed to failure as
our people are fully vigilant for them."
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist on November 4,
1995.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Plenary Assembly of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum
has elected Ken Mutukuwa of Zambia as its full-time
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Mutukwa, a member of parliament of the Zambian National
Assembly, emerged from a competition from seven other people,
including Tanzania's deputy speaker of parliament, Philip Marmo,
reports reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His appointment came after the Tanzanian Vice-President Omari
Ali Juma proposed at the opening session of SADC Parliament Forum
Wednesday to have a full time secretary-general and draw
strategies to have its legislative powers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mutukwa scored highest points during an
interview conducted by a special SADC Parliamentary Forum Search
Committee in Harare, Zimbabwe.

Mutukwa, 52, holds a junior degree in arts and three senior
degrees, including a doctorate in philosophy.

A man with a vast experience in the diplomatic field, Mutukwa
used to serve as Zambia's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations in New York. He also held senior posts in the East
and Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI) and U.N.
Environment Program.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Flag Protection Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted 305-124 to approve a constitutional
amendment Thursday that would ban flag desecration.
</P>
<P>
Backers of the amendment said flag is a symbol of the United
States and burning or defacing in any way was a direct affront to
the entire nation while opponents argued that any restriction will
be violation of the First Amendment's free-speech right.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time since 1995 that the House had mustered
the two-thirds vote needed to approve the amendment, but the
measure still appeared to be difficult to win approval in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Any amendment to the Constitution need two-thirds approval in
both chambers of Congress and ratification by 38 of the 50 states.
So far 49 states have already passed resolutions backing the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the flag amendment in 1995 and 1997, but the
Senate fell four votes short of approval in 1995 with a 63-36
vote. The Senate is expected to take up the matter later this
summer.
</P>

White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton "opposes
any form of disrespect for the American flag ... but he believes a
constitutional amendment is misguided."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Rise 1.4 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Thursday that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods rose 1.4
percent in May, led by a big gains in aircraft, autos and other
transportation products.
</P>
<P>
Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods increased 2.8 billion
dollars last month to a seasonally adjusted 197.6 billion dollars,
the Department reported.
</P>
<P>
The rise followed a steep 2.3 drop in April and a 2.9 percent
gain in March. May's increase was the ninth in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment rose a hefty 9.5 percent in
May, following a 12.6 percent decline in April and a 4.7 percent
gain in March. The transportation sector is often volatile from
month to month because it includes such big ticket purchases as
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
May's report said the rebound in transportation orders was led
by a big increase in orders for aircraft and airplane parts. U.S.
automakers are enjoying a good year of sales -- near record
levels.
</P>
<P>
However, if excluding the increase in transportation, overall
orders for durable goods would have fallen 0.7 percent in May, the
biggest decline since a 2.7 drop in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets have grown increasingly nervous in recent
weeks that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates
at their meeting next week to slow growth and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the
global economic turmoil has been steel. Today's report offered a
glimmer of hope that the worst of the crisis may be over.
</P>
<P>
However, in its second report released Thursday, the Commerce
Department said that steel coming into the U.S. from other
countries continued to increase. Japan, Brazil and other foreign
countries shipped 3 million metric tons of steel to this country
in May. That is 30 percent higher than the final 2.3 million
figure for April. Still, total shipments were 18 percent below
November's levels.
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, the category which includes steel, rose by 0.7
percent in May, following a 1.4 percent gain April. It marked the
first back-to-back monthly gains in this sector in more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders for industrial machinery, which includes
computers and office equipment, declined 2.5 percent in May,
following big gains of 3.6 percent in April and 3.5 percent
in March.
</P>
<P>
Last month, shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign
of current demand, also increased 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department said Thursday that the
number of new claims for unemployment benefits increased 3,000
to 302,000 last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Thursday
approved a three-component, 160-million-U.S.-dollar project
designed to benefit almost 1.7 million of poor people in China.
</P>
<P>
The Western Poverty Reduction Project focuses on Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Gansu and Qinghai. The project provides
significant health, education, employment and farming benefits to
people in remote and inaccessible villages.
</P>
<P>
But the bank's board of executive directors "agreed that no
work be down and no funds be disbursed for the 40-million-dollar
Qinghai component of the project until the board decides on the
results of any review by the independent Inspection Panel," the
bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome was supported by the Chinese government and a
majority of board members representing the bank's 182 member
governments," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Consistent with its longstanding goal of alleviating poverty,
the World Bank is contributing a total of 160 million dollars to
the 311-million-dollar Western Poverty Reduction Project -- 100
million dollars in concessional funds from its International
Development Association, and 60 million dollars from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The project follows 31 other poverty-oriented projects in
China. The World Bank has lent 680 million dollars of a total of
1.3 billion dollars in such projects, for the benefit of 6.3
million people.
</P>
<P>
"The partnership between China and the World Bank has already
had a measurable impact, and has helped to achieve significant
results (in poverty reduction) in China as a whole," the bank
statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Web Sites Vulnerable to Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Government web sites and
computer networks are increasingly vulnerable to hackers' attacks
as a result of lack of trained personnel, experts warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has not many trained people to defend its web
sites and the trained ones seldom work in government for long,
three panelists told the House Science Committee's Subcommittee on
Technology.
</P>
<P>
The security agencies "train people at government expense and
the private sector waves a bigger paycheck and takes them away,"
said Keith Rhodes, technical director with the General Accounting
Office.
</P>
<P>
In addition, government security experts often find their
advice isn't followed, said Raymond Kammer, director of the
National Institutes for Standards and Technology, which recommends
security measures for federal computers.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that federal agencies implement vigorous
security programs," Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
Hackers recently attacked the web sites of the Department of
Energy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Senate, the
Interior Department and the White House.
</P>
<P>
Hackers are often nearly impossible to trace unless they boast
of their actions.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Commission on
Population and Development on Thursday resumed its negotiations on
key elements for further implementing the Cairo Program of
Action.
</P>
<P>
The Commission acts as the preparatory committee for the
General Assembly's upcoming special session that will review the
Program of Action adopted by the International Conference on
Population and Development (Cairo, 1994). The special session will
be held at headquarters from June 30 to July 2.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session this morning, the Commission's Chairman
Anwarul Karim said he hoped that, in the days ahead, the spirit
which had resulted in the Cairo Program of Action would be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The Commission had before it this morning a revised draft
resolution which covers a wide range of population and development
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The topics include reproductive rights and health, family
planning and sexually transmitted diseases and adolescent sexual
and reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
At its last session, held from March 22 to April 1, the
preparatory committee approved organizational matters for the
special session, but was unable to agree on key proposals for the
further implementation of the Cairo program of Action. It,
therefore, decided to resume its session to act on those
proposals.

National Solidarity Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to the ordinance, the social stamp taxes that will

inter-active games and 10 percent for the other types of games.
</P>
<P>
The National Solidarity Fund will be used to round off the
funds meant for the state's paying the child benefits, additional

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of Eritrea Thursday
welcomed calls by the U.N. Security Council issued Wednesday for
an immediate and unconditional cease-fire between Eritrea and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrea said that the demands for a cease-fire must be
targeted at Ethiopia, according to a press release issued
Thursday by the Eritrean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday issued a statement
demanding that " both parties immediately and unconditionally
agree to a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council statement also called upon the two sides
"to cooperate fully and constructively with the high level
delegation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
implement the framework agreement."
</P>
<P>
Wile welcoming the recommendations of the Security Council,
Eritrea emphasized that Eritrea did not initiate the hostilities
and "has repeatedly announced its readiness to implement the OAU
framework agreement in good faith," the Eritrea Foreign Ministry
said in the release.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry also pointed out that "Eritrea
objects to these preconditions and vehemently calls for the
implementation of the framework agreement without any alteration
to appease Ethiopia's unacceptable preconditions and new
demands."
</P>
<P>
The border war between the two Horn of African states broke out
in early May 1998. Although both sides have agreed to the OAU
framework agreement, they differ over the details of the peace
plan and its implementation.

<HEADLINE> 567 Russians Fall Victim to Contract Killings This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 567 people were murdered
in contract killings in Russia over the first five months this
year, a senior Interior Ministry official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is more than double the 232 killed during the same
period last year, the Interfax news agency quoted Anatoly Khairov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The financial collapse of August 17, 1998 increased the
frequency of contract killings, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, contract killings were a rarity, with all law
enforcement agencies joining the search for the culprits, he said.
"Now hundreds of them are committed. Explosives, automatic rifles,
grenade launchers are used in contract killings."
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of killers are being recruited from among
former Interior Ministry, special services and special police
personnel, Khairov said.
</P>
<P>
Failure to pay debts is one of the chief reasons for such
killings, and quite of few victims were businessmen active in the
profitable fuel, energy and financial fields, he added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
announced Thursday that it has approved budget for the purchase of
an additional 20, 000 tons of relief food to be distributed among
people affected by food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia
was quoted by the state-run Ethiopian News Agency as saying that
the stated amount of relief food would be withdrawn from the
emergency food reserve at once and apportioned among the people
living in areas severely affected by food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the budget would later be used to purchase
grains to replenish the reserve.
</P>
<P>
The commission appealed three weeks ago for 358,950 tons of
emergency food grain aid to 4.6 million people from June to
December, this year in order to alleviate the food shortage
affecting areas where small rainy season from February to May
failed.
</P>
<P>
It said the assistance made so far by international donors is
not enough.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to School All Kosovo Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Thursday pledged to give every primary
school age child in Kosovo, a Serbian province, the opportunity to
be back in school by the start of the academic year in September,
despite huge challenges posed in the wake of widespread carnage
and destruction of the province's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, which has been helping to provide education for tens of
thousands of refugee children in Albania and Macedonia, said the
educational system within Kosovo has been devastated, with many
schools destroyed and an undetermined number of teachers injured
or killed.
</P>
<P>
Many schools, among other things, have been destroyed in the
wake of the 79-day bombing of Yugoslavia, staged by the U.S.-led
NATO. The air strikes were suspended shortly before the U.N.
Security Council adopted a resolution on Kosovo on June 10, and
the end of unilateral military action was officially announced by
NATO after Yugoslavia withdrew all its troops, police forces out
of the province as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
A rapid assessment by UNICEF in an area west and south of
Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, showed that out of 13
schools inspected, five were destroyed and four burnt. Only three
were deemed safe and usable.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF plans a crash cooperative effort with all of its
partner organizations to provide temporary repairs to moderately
damaged primary schools to prepare them for the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. children's agency will provide educational kits or
"school-in-a-box," which contains both classroom and student
supplies, and will mobilize teachers, including those with whom
UNICEF is working in the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has already distributed more than 100,000 pamphlets
and posters to alert people affected by the conflict to the
danger of landmines and will intensify mine awareness activities
in the local languages to primary schools and communities.

MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A nine-vehicle Russian convoy will
set out on Friday from Bosnia to the Pristina airport where
Russian paratroopers are stationed, Russian Airborne Troop
Commander Colonel-General Georgy Shpak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The column will carry humanitarian materials such as food,
water and medical supplies, the Interfax news agency quoted Shpak
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Six vehicles will be loaded and three will arrive in Belgrade
empty to take humanitarian aid cargo sent by the Moscow
authorities on board an Emergency Situations Ministry aircraft,"
the general said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 tons of food and medical supplies will be
airlifted to Belgrade at about 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Shpak said that the situation in Pristina is normal.
"Everything is quiet and there are neither excesses nor
provocations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to specify when paratroopers will be moved from
Russia to Kosovo once Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, approves a presidential proposal to send a Russian
contingent to the Yugoslav province in an extraordinary session
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said earlier that the troops
could get moving as early as next Monday.
"We are at a state of three-hour readiness," Shpak said.

<HEADLINE> No One Can Force Turkish Cypriots into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf
Denktas said on Thursday that he could not be forced to accept
resumption of the talks on the Cyprus issue unless clarification
was made to the status of the two sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Denktas underlined that as long as the Greek Cypriot side was
considered the sole legitimate government of the island and the
Turkish Cypriots as a "community" demanding some rights from the
government, there could be no Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
On the G-8 countries' call for unconditional resumption of
Cyprus talks, Denktas said that a meeting between himself and
Cyprus President Glafkos Clerides "is not possible at this
stage."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the G-8, grouping the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Russia, made the call
in the final statement issued in their Cologne summit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They urged Annan "to invite the leaders of the two parties on
Cyprus to negotiations in the fall of 1999."
</P>
<P>
They also urged Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to commit
themselves to the principles of no preconditions during the
negotiations, all issues to be on the table, full consideration
of relevant U.N. resolutions and treaties, and to continue
negotiating until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union was once the grave digger of negotiations,
the same failure awaits the G-8," said Denktas.
</P>
<P>
"No one can pull my ear and force me to sit at the negotiation
table," Denktas said in his letter to Annan who declared in a
report to the U.N. Security Council Wednesday that he would heed
the call of the G-8 and invite Denktas and Clerides for talks
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that
the acknowledgment of the existence of "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" is the only way to the resumption of bilateral
talks in the long-divided Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Denktas declared the breakaway state "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus," which is now recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Hopes Congo (K) Peace Talks Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka-based Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Thursday expressed its hope
that the forthcoming peace talks on the Democratic Republic of
Congo would end the war in that country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman for the COMESA Council of Ministers, Nicholas Biwott,
admitted in Lusaka that trade in the sub-region had been affected
by the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and stability are compatible with the objectives of the
COMESA and we hope the peace talks will be successful," he said,
adding that an end to the DRC conflict will enable trade to flow
freely in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the COMESA has lined up a number of activities aimed
at creating a free trade area by October 31, 2000, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said that member states are being urged to intensify
their efforts to eliminate non-tariff barriers and other obstacles
to trade.
</P>
<P>
Since the elimination of intra-COMESA tariffs could worsen the
uneven levels of development between the member states,
appropriate compensatory mechanisms must be explored, he added.
</P>
<P>
Other activities lined up include the publication of COMESA
tariffs by member states and member states participation in each
other's trade fair from October 1999 to 2000, he said.

ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada Thursday appealed to African governments to build up their
local insurance capacities to ensure the competitiveness of the
African Reinsurance Corporation (ARC).
</P>
<P>
Opening the 21st annual meeting of the ARC general assembly in
Addis Ababa, Negasso said that African governments, enterprises

corporation "to give it more of their business".

"This is a noble pan-African goal that seeks to build an

The Ethiopian president pledged his country's commitment to the
 development of the African Reinsurance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The corporation was established after a decision made by
African leaders at the Organization of African Unity summit in
1973.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Ranks First as Arab Red Meat Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudan ranks the first as Arab
producer of red meat, said a report by the Sudanese Ministry of
Animal Resources.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is among the richest countries in animal wealth, with an
estimated 112 million heads of sheep, the Sudanese News Agency
Thursday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The demand on red meat overpowered supply and there would be a
gap of 5.2 million tons in the Arab red meat market in 2000, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is self-sufficient in red meat whose production went up
from 686,000 tons in 1992 to 1.331 million tons in 1997, up by 53
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan-produced meat is known for being free from hormones
and chemicals that are widely used in the animal feed industry in
other countries, with 90 percent of the feed coming from natural
pastures in the northern and equatorial areas.
</P>
<P>
The meat production of these areas covers more than 90 percent
of the local consumption, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government is still making efforts to open new
slaughterhouses and storage and cooling facilities in a bid to
meet the needs of the Arab world that imports up to 1.1 million
tons of meet annually.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has fine breeds of cattle and sheep. While the Arab Gulf
states prefer the mutton of the desert sheep, Egypt and Libya
prefer the camel meat.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's immigration
authorities will reform procedures in issuing passports in a move
to control illegal immigrants, a senior immigration official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Tanzanian Immigration Services, Herbert
Chilambo, told reporters in Dar es Salaam that from the beginning
of next month affidavits will have to be obtained from the area of
birth of a person applying for a passport.
</P>
<P>
Chilambo said the affidavits will have to be attained with a
confirmation letter from an immigration official of the district
or region where the person was born, before a request for passport
is considered.
</P>
<P>
The procedure will also be applicable to birth certificates
from the registrar of births and deaths, said the director.
</P>
<P>
He warned illegal immigrants and some members of the public not
to cheat the government by assisting certain people in obtaining
the passports fraudulently, otherwise strong legal actions will be
taken against the practices.
</P>
<P>
The immigration services chief also urged the general public to
help the government reveal people who work and live in the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new booklet entitled "Tanzania and Her Foreign
Guests" which clarifies on procedures involved in issuing
passports has been inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the booklet is to lighten people's complaints
over immigration officials or middlemen and solve problem of
corruption, Chilambo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Thursday night
raided Lebanon's electricity network, cutting off electricity
supply in parts of the country, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes staged two sorties on a Lebanese electricity
plant in Gumhur, about 10 kilometers east of Beirut, setting the
plant on fire, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was cut off by the air raid in parts of Beirut and
its suburbs and the country's central Mountain Lebanon Province.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman admitted the raid,
saying Israeli jets struck Lebanon's Gumhur Electricity Plant. He
said the blast served as a response to the cross-border rockets
attacks earlier by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Hezbollah slammed several Katyusha rockets
and mortar bombs into northern Israel to avenge an Israeli
shelling which wounded a Lebanese woman in the day.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth civilian wounded by Israeli shelling in five
days.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Israel reached an understanding in April 1996
after an Israeli 16-day onslaught on Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered agreement bars any attacks on civilians or
from civilian area on both sides of the border.
</P>

Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy

<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Thursday raided
villages in south Lebanon to avenge an earlier rocket and mortar
attack by Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli fighter jets fired at least four missiles on a
road near the village of Zibqine just north of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There has been no immediate reports of casualties from the air
raids, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came as a retaliation for a cross-border
offensive by Hezbollah guerrillas who fired several Katyusha
rockets and mortar bombs into northern Israel and wounded four
Israelis, including one soldier.
</P>
<P>
The group said in a statement that it fired the rockets to
avenge Israel's targetting of civilians in south Lebanon where a
40-year-old woman was wounded earlier in the day in the village of
Kabrikha north of the occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth civilian injured by Israeli shelling in the
same village in five days.
</P>
<P>
Two civilians were wounded in the village on Wednesday and
three on Sunday.

airspace over Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar and Muthana provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes attacked some civilian installations,
leaving four civilians injured, said the spokesman, adding that
Iraqi air defenses counter-attacked the enemy planes and forced
them to flee to their bases.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
military and civilian targets in the two no-fly zones in Iraq,
causing severe civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> BMW Braces for More Big Rover Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- BMW chairman Joachim Milberg warned
Thursday that the German carmaker was bracing for big losses -
reaching the same 1.1 billion dollars proportions of 1998 - this
year unless the pound sterling's value starts to drop.
</P>
<P>
Milberg said that the high value of the pound was proving
costly to BMW, which is trying to reduce the losses at Rover.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of 1999, Rover sales had plunged 34
per cent to 102,000 cars, while BMW's sales were up 12 percent to
313,000 cars, Milberg reported.
</P>
<P>
Land Rover sales were up 29 percent to 71,600, so that on
balance, BMW group sales were down by one percent at around
486,700 in the first five months.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure comes a day after BMW and the British government
wrapped up a long-term deal in which the German carmaker is to
invest some 5.3 billion dollars to revamp Rover in what was called
the biggest investment ever in Britain's car industry.
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the money is to go to revitalize Rover's
outdated factory at Longbridge, near Birmingham, with plans to
boost productivity, introduce new lines of cas, and ultimately to
return Rover to the black by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Ivashov: House Will Approve Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian Defense Ministry
official said here Thursday that the upper house of parliament
will eventually approve the dispatch of peacekeeping troops to
Kosovo despite some opposition concerning cost.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov, head of the International
Military Cooperation Division of the Defense Ministry, said the
Federation Council will be able to collect the needed 90 votes to
sanction President Boris Yeltsin's request to send troops to the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federation Council
discussed the issue Thursday but failed to make a decision whether
to recommend the house to approve the move mainly because it would
put an extra strain on the already cash-strapped country.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivashov said that Yeltsin himself would supervise the
financing of the Russian contingent. "The 50 million to 60 million
U.S. dollars they are talking about is needed not for tomorrow,
but for a year," the Interfax news agency quoted Ivashov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's session, many influential members of the
Federation Council voiced their objection to the sending
peacekeepers to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kemerovo Governor Aman Tuleyev said Russia should have gone no
further than providing military assistance to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo will be
ineffectual, because they will not have their own sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, our peacekeepers will be in a hostile environment
and will begin to be killed. All we will do is lose men in
Yugoslavia," Tuleyev said.
</P>
<P>
Samara Governor Konstantin Titov focused on the difficulty in
getting the needed money for the operation.
</P>
<P>
"Where will the millions of dollars for the upkeep of our men
come from? If we have this money, why are we begging from the
International Monetary Fund and requiring humanitarian aid?" Titov
asked.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia's prestige would not be harmed if it stays away
from the peacekeeping operation in Yugoslavia. "An economic dwarf
must not pose as a great power," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council will sit in another session Friday to
discuss the issue.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Enters Into Vicious Circle In Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe warned
Thursday that the country has entered into a vicious circle of
price indexation, which means that it has become impossible to
fight inflation unless workers are prepared to settle for lower
wage increases this year.
</P>
<P>
Price indexation is when major stakeholders predetermine prices
on basis of expectations, leading to an inflation spiral, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the high inflation now seemed to be self-propelling and
pricing policies were no longer related to changes in cost of
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Workers had been demanding more than 40 percent salary
increases, when considering the 20 percent cost of living
adjustment awarded in January, this year.
</P>
<P>
Some, like those in the banking sector, had already been
awarded a 48 percent salary increment for this year, while the
civil service is at war with the government over an awarded total
of 42 percent increase for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The average wage increases for 1998 was around 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
A situation of price indexation, the bank said, was
characterized by discretionary pricing behavior.
</P>
<P>
"Recent experiences demonstrate the prevalence of this practice
across most sectors. In this regard, price adjustments for goods
and services have tended to follow the previous round of price
increases," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"This, in turn, has created vicious circle of future rounds of
price adjustments with prices adjusted for the year-on-year
inflation, rather than monthly inflation increases," it said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation for May which stands at 53
percent is expected to reach 65 percent within the next three
months given the increasing inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> German Industrialist Calls for Creation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An influential German industrialists
lobby called Thursday for the creation of a free trade zone in
southeastern Europe in order to boost and stabilize the regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
The envisaged zone should include Albania, Slovenia, Macedonia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania,
said Federation of German Industry (BDI) executive director Ludolf
von Wartenberg.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of such a region would be that in addition to the
member countries producing for a larger overall market, it would
be easier for them to attract outside investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wartenberg said such a zone could be created once regional
political stability had been reached. He argued that economic
development in the area could scarcely be carried out without the
inclusion of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Wartenberg said that in the rebuilding of southeastern Europe
better attention must be given to the interests of German
business. He called it a mistake that while Germany had assumed
one-third of the costs of rebuilding Bosnia, German firms had
gained only four to eight percent of contracts there.
</P>
<P>
The BDI is the umbrella organization for Germany's various
industrial associations. By BDI statistics, German firms have
traditionally played a strong role in southeastern Europe, with
almost 500 firms active in the area prior to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
German trade with the region last year reached 13.2 billion
dollars, with German exports of 7.1 billion dollars outweighing
imports of 6.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: More Than 120,000 Child Soldiers Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A new report on Child
soldiers has found that more than 120,000 children under 18 years
of age are being used as soliders across Africa. Some of these
children are even no more than 7 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The report, released recently by the Coalition to Stop the Use
of Child Soldiers, said the most affected were such countries as
Burundi, Congo (B), Congo (K), Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,
Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
These African children are among at least 300,000 children
under the age of 18, girls as well as boys, are currently taking
part in hostilities around the world.
</P>
<P>
"African children are being targeted across the continent as
tools of war," said Reed Brody, the chairman of the coalition. He
called upon the African governments to stop recruiting children
into their own armed forces and to end all support to rebel groups
that used children as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"These research should provoke outrage from civil society and
governments like," said Iain Levine, a U.N. official in the field
of human rights, "We hope it will compel action to end this
horrific problem."
</P>
<P>
Children are often recruited by government and rebel armed
forces to beef up its own military strength in the armed
conflicts. Some children do volunteer to join the armed forces,
but tens of thousands of children are forced to join up, sometimes
at gun point.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, forced recruitment of youth continues in some of
the suburbs around the capital and throughout the country,
especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands more are enrolled in governmental armed
forces or armed opposition groups and made to fight at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
While many are lawfully recruited, others are kidnapped,
press-ganged or in one way or another coerce to join.
</P>
<P>
Although most child soldiers are between 15 and 18 years of
age, significant recruitment starts at the age of 10, and the use
of even younger children has been recorded, said the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Girls, too, are recruited, often forcibly, though in smaller
number than boys. They tend to be used as cooks, for example.
Surprisingly, the girls are used in the front line. In fact, they
turn out to be nothing but cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
Displaced communities and refugees in camps are at particular
risk of being exploited by armed entities: families have been torn
apart, and as a consequence, their children are left to their own
devices; community support structures have broken down, and the
general situation is one of profound social and economic
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Refugees are often at the mercy of armed grounds using camps as
easy recruitment grounds. The particular vulnerability of
displaced children to recruitment by armed groups, especially
those living in camps close to the conflict, is increasingly
recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of African countries have set 18
years as the minimum age for recruitment, whether voluntary or
through conscriptions. Notable exceptions are Angola, which
recently reduced conscription age to 17, and Uganda, which appears
to allow children over 13 years of age to enlist in certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which currently accepts volunteers at 17 years,
plans to raise its minimum recruitment age to 18 years in the
coming months.

<HEADLINE> India Armed Forces Continue Pounding Intruders' Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian combat jets and artillery
guns Thursday continued their pounding "intruders' positions" in
Batalik sub-sector of Kashmir, an Army spokesman said here at a
regular briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Fighter planes of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and artillery guns
bombarded Pakistan bunkers on mountain tops beyond "Point 5203" in
Batalik inflicting heavy casualty on the enemy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Air strikes, which were resumed after three days Thursday due
to bad weather, were "very effective and accurate", a spokesman of
the Indian Air Force said.
</P>
<P>
Indian fighter planes were being "sporadically opposed by the
enemy" by anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles, yet no
damage had been caused on the fighter planes so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to both sides' casualties, the army spokesman said
that while 340 Pakistan soldiers including 12 officers have been
killed in the Kargil operations so far, the Indian troops lost 165
men including 10 officers. Besides, 335 were wounded and nine were
missing in action.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Army movement were "defensive in nature, but we are
well poised to thrust any designs." he further said.
</P>
<P>
Indian launched a large-scale military operation in early May
to "flush out Pakistan-backed infiltrators" into Kargil sector of
Kashmir and the fighting is till going on.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday warned India if
the current tension along the LOC escalated into a war it would
cause irreparable losses to both sides and renewed his offer for
talks to resolve not only Kargil but the fundamental issue of
Kashmir. India has rejected Pakistan's talks offer before "all
intruders were flushed out from its territory".

<HEADLINE> Pak Calls for US Fair and Balanced Approach to Kashmir Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Thursday urged the
United States to have a "fair and balanced" approach to the
current tension at the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed
Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be a balanced approach, you cannot forget India's
continuous violations of the LoC," Pakistani Foreign Office
Spokesman Tariq Altaf told a briefing here with reference to U.S.
Commander-in-Chief General Anthony Zinni's visit and the American
approach to the current LoC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"They have brought in a point of view, which if I may say, as
projected, is a narrow point of view," Altaf commented.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a narrow point of view of the situation
will encourage India to talk of war.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, is for de-escalation and for a balanced
approach.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said Pakistani officials' meetings with general Zinni are
a part of the consultative process.
</P>
<P>
"It is a consultative process that is going on, an engagement
effort for de-escalation of the situation in Kashmir and for
focusing, as it must be done, on the larger question."
</P>
<P>
Altaf underlined that "as long as the large question is not
dealt with, peace and security will elude us."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan holds that the current conflict in the Kargil sector
in Kashmir should be considered in a larger scope of the whole
Kashmir dispute rather than the conflict itself.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about Washington's views on
"infiltrators" in Kargil, he stated, "this is their point of view
and they could have taken a more balanced view."
</P>
<P>
"That kind of narrow view ... will only encourage India to talk
more of war and wider conflict and talk of only one option -
conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I am sure," he continued, "that is not what the world
wants to see - the world wants to see a de-escalation, the world
wants to see respect of the sanctity of the LoC."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is talking differently, he said. "We are talking of
de-escalation."
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's violations of LoC, the spokesman said
responsibility devolves on both countries to respect the
provisions of the Simla Agreement equally and mutually.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman enumerated the Indian violations of the LoC -- at
Chor Batala in 1972, at Siachin in 1984, at Qamar in 1988 and
interception of the supply in Neelum valley in 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Besides, "Continuous violations by artillery shelling have
killed many mujahideen (holy war fighters) with the purpose of
demoralization of the Kashmiris - all this is a continuous
recorded history of India's violations of the LoC," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, to focus on one incident, which can recur here and there
again because it is a question of Kashmiri mujahideen struggling
for their rights and being repressed as a reaction to that, is not
a focus which is fair and even," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"It is a focus which will only urge one side to continue on the
war path." he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports On the Rise: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in May
increased 8.4 percent from the same month last year to 4.69
billion U.S. dollars, Finance Ministry's Deputy Spokesman
Charnchai Musiknisakorn said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was much higher than the previous 6.5 percent
increase announced by the Customs Department earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Charnchai said the Thai exports in the first five months of
this year rose 23 million dollars, or 0.1 percent compared to the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs Department, the rate was minus 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said imports in May rose to 3.51 billion
dollars, an increase of 142 million dollars, or 4.2 percent, when
compared to the same period last year, but declined 227 million
dollars, or 6.1 percent from April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said that
decreased value of Thailand's exports in the first three months of
this year resulted from strengthened baht in recent months.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that increasing exports would lead to
Thailand's completely lifting out of the already two-year-old
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Endorses Proposal for Air Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot cabinet has endorsed a
proposal to liberalize air transport, Cyprus' Communications and
Works Minister Leontios Ierodiakonou announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The development comes as a pilots' union of the national
carrier, Cyprus Airways, began at Wednesday midnight a 48-hour
strike affecting around 10,000 passengers and 32 flights.
</P>
<P>
The union had staged a 24-hour strike on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ierodiakonou said the cabinet firmly believes that the strike
is "illegal, contrary to regulations and shows indifference
towards the interest of the people."
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet has also taken other decisions on the
matter and drafted a policy framework, but he refrained from
disclosing any details.
</P>
<P>
The most profitable Cyprus Airways destinations which the
government has stepped in to protect are those to London, Athens
and Tel Aviv, Ierodiakonou said.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy "was and will continue to be, if the
situation improve, to protect Cyprus Airways. However, if we
ascertain that this irresponsible attitude continues, then the
decision to go ahead with liberalization of air transport will be
finalized."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shas Wants to Resume Coalition Talks With Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's religious Shas Party
announced on Thursday that it wants to resume the talks with
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak over its joining the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after the party's highest power
institution, Council of Torah Sages, met for three hours on
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Barak wanted to bring Shas into a broad-based government, as
the party won 17 seats in the May elections and became the third
largest party in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
But the coalition talks between the two sides were stalled
early this week after Shas insisted on holding the interior
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not accept the request for fear that it would harm
his coalition negotiations with another important party.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya Party, which represents the interests of the
Russian immigrants, has accused Shas of blocking the immigration
from Russia and wanted to control the ministry itself.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya got six seats in the May elections, and was
Barak's first choice to be a member of his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baliya leader Natan Sharansky threatened to walk out
of the coalition should Shas be offered the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
Shas's announcement on Thursday was viewed as a signal that
the party would give in on its demand for the interior portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement, the negotiators of Shas and Barak
are expected to resume their talks soon.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder aide proposed to head Balkan Stability Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on Thursday proposed his chief-of-staff, Bodo Hombach, as the head
of a Balkan Stability Pact aimed at rebuilding the region's
economic and political structures.
</P>
<P>
"Only a personality with necessary political experience can
come into consideration," said Uwe-Karsten Heye, the spokesman of
the German Government in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is a full time job," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Heye said leaders from the 15 European Union (EU) states still
had to approve Hombach and that this could happen at the EU-Latin
America summit in Brazil on June 28-29.
</P>
<P>
Hombach is a key Schroeder confidant and regarded as an
architect of the government's announcement this week of a
three-year austerity package and corporate tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to his nomination, Hombach said the post would be his
"dream job" and a major challenge. "But I am motivated to take on
this task", he said.
</P>
<P>
If named to the post, Hombach's first task would be to organize
a major Balkans summit in Sarajevo, according to Heye.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit aims to coordinate donor nations,
international organization and countries in the region in a bid to
resolve economic and political problems and lead the Balkan states
to closer ties with the EU and NATO.

<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hailing from a country once
dismissed as "the land without music", British conductor Sir Simon
Rattle was considered an unorthodox choice to carry the baton for
the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Renowned for his love of contemporary composers and his shock
of tousled grey hair, the 44-year-old prodigy has often caused a
stir in the music world by playing Mozart symphonies alongside
20th century works, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
He turned down job of leading the world's most prestigious
orchestra 10 years ago saying he was young. Now he is ready to
step up into the job in 2002 and follow in the footsteps of the
greats like Herbert von Karajan.
</P>
<P>
Rattle was named on Wednesday as the youngest chief conductor
in the 117-year history of the orchestra and the first from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Berlin newspapers embraced Rattle's appointment as the sixth
chief conductor in the Philharmonic's 117-year history.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Govt Concedes to Rebels at Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government has
made concessions to the rebels by offering them more posts in the
cabinet to save the peace talks going on in Togolese capital of
Lome, reports reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou
Koffigoh as saying that the peace talks on ending Sierra Leone's
civil war were back on track.
</P>
<P>
The minister who has been chairing the peace talks since May 25
said that the talks resumed Thursday after adjourning since last
Friday, adding the talks could end successfully in days.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is studying the new
offer of four cabinet posts and four lower-level positions after
the rebels rejected a package of three cabinet posts Wednesday,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the RUF appeared to have taken the offer very
seriously and asked to discuss it internally before giving its
response on Thursday."
</P>
<P>
Prospects for an end to the nine-year civil war in the West
African country were dampened Wednesday after RUF leader Foday
Sankoh said that the RUF was insisting on a transitional
government in which it held the vice- presidency and more cabinet
posts than it was offered.
</P>
<P>
However, many ministers and lawmakers of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah's regime oppose power-sharing with the rebels who are
blamed for terrorism in the country.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has been battling Freetown governments since 1991 with
tens of thousands of people killed and countless numbers of
civilians maimed.
</P>
<P>
A report published by New York-based Human Rights Watch
Thursday said that the RUF rebels gunned down entire families in
the streets during their invasion of Freetown in January.
</P>
<P>
It described human rights violations during Sierra Leone's
civil war as some of the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mediators including British and U.S. representatives travelled
to Sierra Leone Monday to see what President Kabbah had to offer
the rebels during the on-going peace talks.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has called on the international community to pay as
much attention to refugees and internally displaced persons in
Africa as they are doing in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued here Thursday, the
call came from the OAU Commission on Refugees after a one-day
meeting Wednesday in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the situation of internally displaced
persons in the continent especially in Angola, Sierra Leone, the
Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo "was very
critical and pathetic".
</P>
<P>
The commission urged donors to rush emergency assistance to the
affected people by way of providing food, medicine and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to launch an OAU award to honor
deserving Africans or any African organization which makes
outstanding contributions to refugees in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The commission was briefed on the situation of refugees,
returnee and displaced persons in the continent by the OAU
fact-finding mission dispatched to more than 20 countries affected
with displacement and refugee problems within the continent.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), as of January 1999, there were 21.1 million people of
concern to it worldwide, among them, one-third was in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians of both houses
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia decided on Thursday to lift
the state of war for the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a joint emergency session of the
parliament. The state of war was introduced on March 24 when NATO
launched air strikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
The lower house voted for the lifting of the state of war with
one abstention while the upper house voted unanimously for the
lifting of the state of war.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the state of war was proposed to the parliament
by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lift the state of war will come into effect on
the coming Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most parliamentarians spoke in favor of the federal
government's proposal during their debate and they agreed that the
decision on lifting the state of war would contribute to speedier
and more successful national development and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The federal government was also discussing lifting the war-time
laws and regulations to suit the post-war reconstruction.

LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- British lawmakers on Thursday
called on the government to force people who sell foods containing
genetically modified (GM) products to make sure customers are
aware of what they are buying.
</P>
<P>
"People are in danger of purchasing GM foods without realising
it. The government is at fault in law," the parliamentary Joint
Committee on Statutory Affairs Chairman David Tredinnick was
quoted by a Reuters report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These regulations have got to be tightened up so that the
consumer receives sufficient information without having to ask the
seller," the committee chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Under existing rules in the UK, a seller of food containing GM
products does not need to tell the consumer unless specifically
asked.
</P>
<P>
But British restaurants and fast food outlets have been ordered
to tell consumers if their meals contain GM products.

<HEADLINE> Blair Seen to Seek Arms Compromise in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
preparing for "make-or-break" talks to rescue peace in Northern
Ireland, said on Thursday that a June 30 deadline for setting up a
local administration was absolute.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is pretty wise to the fact that this is for real," a
spokesman for Blair was quoted as telling reporters after he met
the leader of the province's main Protestant party on Thursday to
seek a compromise on guerrilla arms. "It should be crystal clear
to everybody...what the price of failure would be."
</P>
<P>
"The two sides have to face up to their responsibilities" under
last year's Good Friday Agreement, Reuters quoted him as saying.
"This comes down to a question of trust, a question of
confidence."
</P>
<P>
"Both prime ministers will do all they can to make this work.
They have put enough effort into it. But ultimately (it is up to)
the parties themselves. It's their agreement and they have got to
make it happen," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, first minister-designate of Northern Ireland's
planned all-party executive, met Blair in his Downing Street
office for around half an hour early on Thursday before returning
to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party, using the slogan "no guns, no
government" has refused to sit in government with the Irish
Republican Army's political wing Sinn Fein until the guerrilla
movement begins handing over weapons.
</P>
<P>
Blair told his cabinet on Thursday that given goodwill, it
ought to be possible to resolve the dispute, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
would fly to Northern Ireland on Friday. They would probably
return home for the weekend and then return to Belfast on Monday
to try to break the deadlock by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair's government has prepared a slot in the July 1
parliamentary timetable to approve devolution orders setting up
the Northern Ireland assembly, if the talks reach agreement,
according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has set a deadline of June 30 for agreement
on setting up the executive, a key plank of the complex peace deal
negotiated in April 1998, but the issue has been stalled for
months by a row over the handing over of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Since Blair set his deadline, however, he has deliberately not
spelled out what will happen if the talks fail.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan B," his spokesman told reporters, saying that
"if there is a political vacuum it will be filled by the
extremists on both sides who do not want the agreement to work."
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern seem to be trying to bridge the gap by finding
an agreed sequence of pledges by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, under pressure from his own divided supporters to hold
firm, warned this week that Unionists were losing faith in Blair.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream guerrilla groups in Northern Ireland have been
observing truces but the Good Friday accord has failed to stop
sporadic violence or heal divisions between Protestants and
Catholics. Tension is rising in the province ahead of the June 30
deadline and the summer "marching season" in particular.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
threatened the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with
what it called "serious consequences" if Pyongyang makes any new
test of missile launch.
</P>
<P>
"It would have very serious consequences" for Pyongyang's
relations with Japan and South Korea, as well as the United
States, said Stanley Roth, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
Asian and Pacific Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks upon hypothetic reports that, following
last year's launching of a satellite with its own made missiles,
the DPRK may soon test even longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Roth did not elaborate what serious consequences are, only
saying it would cast a pall over the current diplomatic activity.
</P>
<P>
Roth described the current Beijing talks between the DPRK with
South Korea and the United States as an unusually high degree of
diplomatic contacts.
</P>
<P>
"This range of activity has to be viewed as a positive sign,"
he said.

<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) - British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Thursday that Britain has agreed to put thousands of
soldiers on standby for rapid reaction service in U.N.
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"We will be giving to the U.N. an undertaking that when called
upon we are prepared to commit (troops) for an operation," Cook
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We will earmark some so they are ready to be used when the
time comes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain was the first major military power to take such a step
which could help stem conflicts around the world, the foreign
secretary added.
</P>
<P>
Cook said a relatively small number of British troops could
offer the United Nations much needed specialist skills, including
communications and engineering expertise as well as command and
control facilities.

<P>
BELGRADE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said on Thursday that United Nations troops and KFOR would
secure the safety and protection of all local citizens.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark at a press conference during his visit
together with NATO supreme allied commander Europe General Wesley
Clark and KFOR commander General Michael Jackson in Pristina, the
capital of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Solana told the press that he had received assurances from
leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army that they would respect the
obligation to disarm and become demilitarized, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief urged ethnic Albanians not to allow themselves
to be guided by ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local Serbians not to abandon their homes in
Kosovo. "There was no need for anyone to go, as the KFOR would
take care of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to give peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the western military alliance made the visit after
the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy
visited Pristina a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> British Public against Gold Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the British public
are against the government's plans to sell more than half of the
country's gold reserves, according to the industry-funded World
Gold Council (WGC).
</P>
<P>
The WGC, citing surveys of public opinion in France, Germany,
Italy, the U.K. and the United States, said on Thursday that the
public in five of the world's leading economies remained
supportive of the role of gold as a reserve asset for governments.
</P>
<P>
The surveys were conducted in 1998 and 1999 and in Europe,
sampling 1,000 citizens representative of the general population
in each country providing an error margin of around 2.5 percent.
In the U.S., the survey sample was 800 for a margin of error of
around 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
George Milling-Stanley, manager of gold market analysis at the
WGC said the surveys showed that in many instances, public policy
seemed to be out of step with public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the public's support for gold on both sides of
the Atlantic and the fact that people want to maintain or increase
their nations' gold reserves, will come as a surprise, perhaps
even a rude awakening to several governments, central bankers and
gold market commentators," Milling-Stanley was quoted by local
media reports as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Among the findings in the surveys were that 67 percent of
Americans wanted gold to be the country's primary reserve asset
while more than 67 percent of Britons believed the country's gold
reserves were an important support to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent of respondents in France, 67 percent in Germany
and 68 percent in Italy believed the European Central Bank should
acquire more gold to augment its reserves in support of the euro,
the WGC statement said.
</P>
<P>
The gold price has weakened by around 11 percent since May 7
when the U.K announced plans to sell 415 tons of gold reserves.
Planned IMF and Swiss central bank sales have also affected market
sentiment.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Sink Amid US Rate Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 24 (Xinhua) - European stocks slumped Thursday as
the twin pressures of US interest rate jitters and a retreat on
Wall Street overcame early buying enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
The UK's leading shares closed lower for a third consecutive
session after extending losses in the afternoon session by
tracking Wall Street's 100 point opening decline.
</P>
<P>
With the Dow Jones index 102.26 points lower as the London
market closed, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed down
79.8 points at 6416.7.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector, which accounts for nearly 20 percent of the
FTSE 100's market capitalisation, was the worst affected, falling
1.88 percent in the session.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's electronic Xetra Dax fell 1.3 percent, or 71.51
points, to finish at 5327.60, weighed down by the weak Wall Street
start and a 3.7 percent slide in index heavyweight Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the decline to the Dax's failure to breach
the psychologically significant level of 5500 earlier in the
session.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the blue chip CAC 40 ended down 1.06 percent at
4434.2. France Telecom closed down 2.86 percent as it continued to
be the victim of profit taking after sharp gains earlier this
month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows at 4.3 Percent Rate in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Friday that despite having a big trade deficit U.S. economy still
grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first quarter of the
year due to the strong consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The revised increase in the gross domestic product from January
to March was slightly better than the 4.1 percent rate estimated a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percentage point improvement reflected a slight
revision in the trade deficit, which was 6.5 billion dollars lower
than the Department estimated previously.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate of the economy has trigged concerns that the
Federal Reserve will begin raising short-term interest rates at
its meeting on June 29-30 in an effort to keep the expansion from
triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
Though many analysts believe that growth slowed in the current
April-June quarter to around 3.5 percent, they feel the drop was
not enough to keep the central bank from raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at an annual rate of
just 1.2 percent in the first quarter. That was only slightly
higher than the 1.1 percent previously estimated. It went up 0.9
percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that consumer spending in the first quarter
rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, the best showing in more
than a decade although it was slightly below the previously
estimated 6.8 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
According to the new GDP report, the record trade deficit
shaved 2.23 percentage points from economic growth in the first
three months of the year, slightly lower than an estimated loss of
2.53 percentage points in last month's report.
</P>
<P>
Also, business investment -- spending on new equipment and
plants -- grew at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the first
quarter, even better than last month's estimate of 7.9 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
Spending for new homes and apartments increased at a 15.4
percent rate, the best showing in a year. Because of rising
mortgage rates in recent weeks, analysts believe the housing
market will cool in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of
81.9 billion dollars in the first three months of the year,
pushing the country's total output of goods and services to 7.76
trillion dollars, after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Voices Concern Over Serb Exodus from Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Government and Foreign
Ministry follow with particular concern the reports about the
exodus of Serbs from Kosovo and the acts of violence against the
local Serb population and their property, Bulgarian Foreign
Minister Nadezhda Mihailova told Parliament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The desecration of Serb cultural and historical monuments in
Kosovo -- part of the European cultural heritage -- is equally
unacceptable to us. Such actions are not and cannot be justified,"
Mihailova said.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria firmly upholds the view that those who are
responsible for such acts of violence on both sides must be
neutralized and punished. This is the only way to build the
foundations of just peace and democratic institutions and to
achieve inter-ethnic tolerance and coexistence in Kosovo," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"The principal means to this end - the establishment of peace
and democratic institutions - is the international civilian and
military presence in Kosovo under the auspices of the United
Nations, which is indispensable for the comprehensive and durable
settlement of political settlement in Kosovo," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister noted that later on Friday the parliament
will debate an agreement with NATO concerning the transit of
allied troops and military gear via Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria's approach to a solution of the Kosovo crisis
proceeds logically from the country's new foreign-policy
philosophy and practice, which is centered on the values and
principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights,"
Mihailova said.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Pakistan's Offer for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- India's caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee Friday rejected Pakistan's offer for talks,
saying India will only hold talks when Pakistan respects the Line
of Control (LOC) along the two countries' border.
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to hold any talks till every inch of our
territory is vacated and Pakistan commits itself to respect the
LOC," he told a rally organized by the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) in Patna, 1,015 kilometers southeast of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday renewed his
offer of talks with India for defusing a war-like situation along
the LOC.
</P>
<P>
"I invite the government of India to choose the path of
rationality and understanding," Sharif said while addressing
troops at the height of 11,600 feet (3,536 meters) in the Gultari
sector of Kashmir along the LOC.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that India would not tolerate any aggression
despite its earnest desire to normalize ties with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He also asserted that India had scored its "greatest-ever"
diplomatic victory over Kargil with even the Western powers
solidly backing it. He claimed that Pakistan had been totally
isolated globally because of its "misadventure".
</P>
<P>
Indian troops Friday continued launching major offensives to
dislodge "Pakistan intruders" from the strategic heights of Tiger
Hills in Drass-Mushkoh in Kargil, Defense Ministry sources said
here.

<HEADLINE> UN's Annan Urges Big Business to Help Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) - United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged big business to join the battle against
AIDS, warning that its own interests were at stake.
</P>
<P>
"The struggle against AIDS is a moral imperative...It is also a
commercial imperative. It makes good business sense," Annan said
in a lecture held in London to commemorate Britain's late Princess
Diana, who campaigned to raise awareness of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said AIDS was wiping out economic gains in
developing countries and the economic impact could spread in the
same devastating way as the virus itself.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is unravelling fragile and hard-won success stories
throughout the developing world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey in Kenya which predicted that AIDS-related
deaths and illness would cut gross domestic product by 15 percent
within six years, Annan detailed how AIDS threatened employees and
employers alike.
</P>
<P>
He urged the large companies in the world to invest in AIDS
prevention and therapy programs, education projects, medical tests
and research.
</P>
<P>
"Corporate engagement can make a difference," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: HK People Enjoy Freedom Under Rule of Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Basic Law, Fan said, Hong Kong residents, regardless
of their origin and status, can seek solutions in accordance with
the set rule of game when they come up with problems. This rule is
open and transparent, and that is precisely how Hong Kong works.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the Basic Law is a fundamental statue,
laying down principled provisions. Its implementation requires
continuous study and discussion," said Fan, noting that it is
quite natural for people to have different interpretations of some
provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Differing views about some provisions of the Basic Law can be
aired and discussed among members of the Legislative Council,
between the government and the court, and among the residents.
</P>
<P>
This, she said, fully demonstrates that Hong Kong is an equal
and free society with the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
She said people in Hong Kong are free to criticize the
government and celebrities through the media, so long as their
behavior accords with the law.
</P>
<P>
People in Hong Kong enjoy full freedom of speech and the law
protects freedom of the citizens. This is experienced by the six
million Hong Kong residents and is also witnessed by the people
the world over, she added.
</P>
<P>
"However, the freedom must be based on the rule of law, and
different views must be expressed through lawful channels," Fan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
People must abide by the law as the first step of upholding the
rule of law, she said. The right of freedom and the right for
choice provided for by the Basic Law can only be realized without
infringing upon other's interests.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Spells Out Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki said Friday that he will not change the basic economic
policy of the country, but agreed to address any impediments to
investment and job creation.
</P>
<P>
The Reconstruction and Development Program and the Growth,
Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy will remain the
basic policy objectives of the new government to achieve
sustainable growth, development and improved standards of living,
Mbeki said in his state-of-the-nation address to parliament.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we will actively address any remaining
impediments to investment and job creation. Where the structural
changes already achieved allow us to evolve new policies, we will
do so."
</P>
<P>
The RDP and GEAR were employed by the Nelson Mandela government
as guideline economic policies, but targets set down in the
blueprints were not reached.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki urged efforts to increase both the level of investment
and the savings ratio.
</P>
<P>
He said investment in the public sector is closely associated
with the restructuring of state assets.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in this area has been made over the last five years.
We are now at a stage where further important restructuring can
and will take place."
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications sector, he said, there will be
further developments with the issuing of new licenses.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Swissair has won the bid for partial
privatization of South African Airways (SAA). Swissair will
acquire 20 percent of SAA at a price of 1.4 billion rand (233
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, the liquid fuels and petro-chemical industry will
be given priority, with the ministries of minerals and energy,
trade and industry and public enterprises acting together," said
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring of state assets in this field will include
finalization of discussions with the Mozambican government with
regard to a gas pipeline from their gas fields to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the government will continue to intensify its work
to facilitate investment by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In order to further improve the effectiveness in these areas,
he said, an International Investment Council will be established
shortly.
</P>
<P>
Four working groups will also be established bringing government
together with big business, the black business sector, commercial
agriculture and the trade unions, according to the new South
African president.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the development of small, medium and micro
enterprises remains a top priority of the government.
</P>
<P>
There are two other areas that have an impact on investment,
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates remain high. The Reserve Bank and the Ministry
of Finance will continue to address this matter carefully,
conscious of the negative impact these high rates have on higher
rates of investment and growth."
</P>
<P>
The other area that has attracted considerable comment is the
labor market and its actual or perceived impact on investment and
job creation, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki pledged to continue to give priority to the issue of job
creation. " If perceptions or realities influence the process
negatively, these must be addressed," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"Job creation, the opening up of opportunities for all our
people to earn an honest livelihood as well as the protection of
the rights of all our working people, remain matters of critical
concern to the government."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mbeki also stressed the need to develop poor
rural areas, to fight HIV-AIDS, and to improve education and
training.

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Square to Reopen Next Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tiananmen Square, in the heart of
the Chinese capital of Beijing, which is being refurbished at
present, will be reopened to the public next Monday, it was
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The refurbishing project started October 31 last year, and has
been completed to show visitors a "brand new face", said Xia
Shangwu, director of the Tiananmen Square Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers were seen busily doing the final cleaning
of the ground and the greenery. The light-blue partition which has
been surrounding the square during the renovation work is still
standing.
</P>
<P>
The 880-m-long and 500-m-wide square is one of the most
important places for the Chinese government and people to hold key
political, diplomatic and celebratory activities. It is regarded
as the biggest city square in the world, as well as one of the
most famous tourist attractions in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The renovation included paving the square with pink granite,
improving the lighting and audio facilities, increasing the green
coverage and updating the fountain system to replace facilities
originally installed in 1959, Xia said.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the major construction projects in Beijing
leading up to the grand celebrations for the country's 50th
birthday on October 1," he said, adding that "The project will
guarantee the use and normal functions of the square for at least
the next 50 years."

<HEADLINE> France Concerned Over Israel-Lebanon Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday expressed his concern over the latest escalation of
conflict between Israel and Lebanon, while calling on the two
sides to adhere to their 1996 cease-fire agreement and to protect
the lives of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said in a letter to his Lebanese counterpart Emile
Lahoud that France stands by Lebanon in what he called "the new
test".
</P>
<P>
He said he believes this new escalation could be put under
control with an intervention by the Group of Surveillance in Cease-
fire, which consists of France, the United States, Israel, Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that we will be able to find a way to ward off
this new escalation by adhering to the Arrangement of April 1996,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the Group
Surveillance of Cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon will meet as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply deplore the deaths of civilians on both sides," said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau Secret. She said
the present situation is the most serious one since April 1996
when Israel completed its "Grapes of Wrath" air operation against
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman pointed out that it was the first time since
then that Israel has launched attacks against the Lebanese capital
Beirut and against civil service targets, such as electric power
centers.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed and 62 injured in the air raids by
Israeli warplanes against Lebanese targets from Thursday night
till Friday morning, said the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Four fire fighters and rescuers were killed in the electric
power center in Jamhour, 10 kilometers east of Beirut, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Israel said two Israeli people were killed in rocket attacks by
Hezbollah guerrillas against Galilee in northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Condemns Israeli Raids Against Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Friday strongly
condemned the current Israeli attacks against Lebanon and called
on the international community to bring an end to the aggression.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said his country sharply blasted
the "flagrant and grave Israeli aggression against Lebanon," the
official news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait condemned the grave escalation of attacks by Israel on
Lebanon that have claimed many innocent lives and caused massive
material damages, Sheikh Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Friday morning resumed air raids on civilian targets in
Lebanon following a series of attacks on power plants and bridges
outside Beirut and in south Lebanon Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people have reportedly been killed and 60 others
injured in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti top diplomat said the air raids which directed at
destroying vital civil installations in Beirut and other Lebanese
areas posed a dire threat to Lebanon's sovereignty, security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The fresh Israeli aggression against Lebanon showed "Israel's
resolve to undermine Arab and international efforts to put the
Middle East peace on the right track so as to secure the return of
all Arab territories occupied by Israel," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The official urged the international community to take urgent
measures to put an end to the attacks and "activate the peace
process to bring about just, comprehensive and lasting peace in
the region.

CHENGDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Six drug traffickers were
sentenced to death and executed today in the Liangshan Yi
Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The local court also passed sentences on some other traffickers
at the public trial.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zongfu, one of those executed, was caught with 760 g of
heroin at Xichang railway station. His wife, Zhong Wanfu, who was
also caught at the station, was sentenced to death, with a two-
year suspension.

<P>
Drug addiction has long been a problem in the prefecture. In
recent years, some local youngsters who went to work in areas on
the Sino-Myanmar border became drug addicts and brought back drugs
to sell.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts by the local government to crack down on drug
abuse, the number of registered drug addicts in the prefecture
dropped from 8,247 in 1996 to 7,862 last year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Concerned Over Stronger Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi Friday expressed his
concern over the appreciation of the baht, the country's currency,
saying it will affect Thailand's exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the parliament during a debate on the budget bill
for fiscal year 2000, Supachai said if the baht rises to 35 baht
to the U.S. dollar, it will become too strong.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign currency rates released by Bangkok
Bank Friday afternoon, the buying and selling price for the baht
was at 36.30 and 37.00 respectively for 50 and 100 dollar notes.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that exporters have started to complain that the
recent appreciation of the baht could hurt the export sector and
impair the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
A strong currency and low interest rates could trigger a
capital outflow, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports had been in decline for 13 consecutive
months before experiencing increases in April and May. The Central
Bank of Thailand had lowered its projection of a 4-percent growth
for exports to 2.1 percent earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Supachai attributed the appreciation of the baht to an
improvement in assessment of the Thai economy by international
rating agencies and in capital flow.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the London-based international rating agency FITCH
IBCA raised the sovereign rating of Thailand to investment grade,
citing a marked improvement in the country's external debt and
liquidity conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media reported Friday that the government is
considering intervening in the currency market to prevent baht
value from further appreciation.
</P>
<P>
However, Supachai ruled out any intervention. He pledged to
consult with the Finance Ministry and the central bank in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Literacy Rate Rises to 56 Percent in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's literacy rate has risen
to 56 percent from 42.6 percent in 1997 due to a series of
measures undertaken by the government in the education sector for
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
This change has infused dynamism into the educational
administration and system and its infrastructural development
across the country, the national news agency BSS Friday quoted
officials of the Ministry of Education as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the major successes of the persistent endeavors, the
government is freeing five out of 64 districts from the curse of
illiteracy, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Primary and Mass Education Department received "UNESCO
International Literacy Prize" in 1998, and 75 government secondary
schools and 2,292 primary schools have been set up across the
country, they added.
</P>
<P>
Under the "satellite school program", the government has so far
set up 2,726 schools to provide education to children.
</P>
<P>
The government's measures for expansion of higher education
included initiatives to set up at least 12 science and technology
universities in the greater district headquarters, and 13
polytechnic institutes and 13 vocational training institutes, they
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has also decided to recast the
curricula of primary and secondary education in line with the true
history of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 8.17 billion taka (168.5 million
U.S. dollars) this year to strengthen education administration and
management system, develop infrastructure for providing training
to teachers and scholarships to students and update textbooks and
curricula, said an official of the Planning Commission.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Launches Appeal to Aid Landmine Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) launched an appeal here Friday for 105 million
Swiss francs (69 million U.S. dollars) to cover its activities for
landmine victims over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, a Geneva-based humanitarian organization,
the funds would provide landmine victims with treatment and
physical rehabilitation in 23 limb-fitting centers run by the ICRC
in 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
The funds would also help continue supporting similar centers
run by ministries of health, national Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, and non-governmental organizations in many other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC will also use some of the money to collect and analyze,
where possible, data for use in the development of appropriate
landmine-action programs.
</P>
<P>
"Although two important legal instruments concerning anti-
personnel mines have recently become part of binding international
humanitarian law, these weapons continue to maim and kill
countless people every day," the ICRC said. "Recent developments
in the Balkans have highlighted this tragic fact."
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that in many parts of the world the presence of
anti-personnel mines still prevents farmers from tilling their
fields, children from attending school, and refugees or internally
displaced people from returning to their homes.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Bank Notes Devastating Somali Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- More illegal Somali bank notes
are flowing into the country further devastating the fragile
economy of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
More than 19 billion Somali shilling (about 1.9 million
U.S.dollars) has arrived for Somali businessmen in the
northeastern town of Bossaso Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here in Mogadishu, the new
consignment which consists of both 1000 and 500 bank notes, the
first of their kind, has already reached the central town of
Galkaio where the inflation had already soured following the
former arrival of billions of Somali bank notes in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The reports received through the VHF radios Friday said unlike
former consignments which were printed in Canada, this new one in
Bossaso had allegedly been printed in India.
</P>
<P>
The radios said the businessmen in collaboration with high
members from the local authority of Puntland have managed to
print the money in making balance to the continuous arrival of
the Somali bank notes in Mogadishu which is causing devaluation of
the Somali Shillings in every corner of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The import of the illegal bank notes and the mass infusion of
weapons and ammunition in Somalia are threatening both the
fragile economy and the stability on this war torn nation in
particular and Horn of Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The illegal import of weapons and printed bank notes are
complicating the reconciliation process of Somalia.

<HEADLINE> International Consulting Company Helps Chinese Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes international
consulting companies to help upgrade its state-owned enterprises (
SOE), an official from the State Economic and Trade Commission (
SETC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongming, director of the Training Department of the SETC,
made the remark at the launching ceremony of the new Chinese name
of Andersen Consulting of the United States here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government is training middle- and
high-ranking managers of 512 major state-owned enterprises in
business administration. Every manager of the SOEs has to receive
at least three months' training.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chinese SOEs are attaching ever-greater importance
to training, he said that the market for the training of SOE
managers is so large that the government alone cannot meet the
demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped that Andersen Consulting and other
leading international consulting companies would further promote
the training of SOE managers in China.
</P>
<P>
Since entering China in 1993, Andersen Consulting has conducted
successful cooperation with the SETC and Chinese companies such as
Dawncom Group Co. Ltd.

sentences ranging from fixed-term imprisonment to the death
penalty, awaiting confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Shanghai police also destroyed in public more than
300 kg of narcotics confiscated since last year, a stern warning
to drug traffickers just one day ahead of the International Day
Against Drug Abuse and Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Police departments in Shanghai have enhanced their crackdown on

The police dealt with more than 1,462 drug cases, involving
some 1,100 people, and seized 37.8 kg of heroin in the January-May
period this year.

<HEADLINE> Private Entrepreneurs Satisfied with Social Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that private
entrepreneurs in this north China's municipality feel an obvious
improvement in their social status since the nation first
introduced the opening-up policy 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of the respondents felt satisfied with their
economic status, with another 45 percent content with their
political status, and about 52 percent pleased with their social
status, according to the survey conducted by the municipal
association of private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that most private managers now feel proud of
themselves after the 15th Communist Party of China Congress
confirmed the status of the private sector in the socialist
economy, compared to their reluctance and diffidence in the past
to say they were running private businesses.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the private sector is another reason
behind the feeling of boosted status by these private bosses, said
the experts.
</P>
<P>
China's private enterprises had exceeded 1.2 million by the end
of 1998, with their registered capital totaling 1.1 trillion yuan
and gross assets exceeding 1.18 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that private entrepreneurs are becoming
more aspiring and have gone beyond the single goal of making a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
More of them are choosing corporate interests above their own
interests, and about 48 percent of the respondents said their
first goal is to make their enterprises, with about 34 percent
saying that they make the welfare of their employees top priority.

<HEADLINE> Rival East Timor Factions Kick Off New Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Rival factions of East Timor
kicked off their second round dialogue and reconciliation
conference at Sheraton Bandara Hotel here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a continuation of the successful
church-sponsored conference held in Dare village, west of Dili,
capital of East Timor, on September 10-11 last year.
</P>
<P>
Like the first Dare talks, the second conference is jointly
sponsored by Dili Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Baucau
Bishop Basilio do Nascimento. A total of 60 participants from East
Timor and abroad are attending the talks dubbed Dare II which is
scheduled to end on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20 political leaders participating in the conference
are F.X. Lopez da Crux, Domingos Soares and Jose Antonio Tavares
from the presidium of the United Front for Autonomy, and Xanana
Gusmao, David Ximenes and Leandro Isac from the East Timor
Resistance Council.
</P>
<P>
Domingos Sequeira, spokesman of the Dare II Steering Committee,
said the meeting would be closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the sensitive nature of the issues under discussion,
and to ensure that the dialogue proceeds in a quiet and
constructive atmosphere, the Dare conference is not open to the
press or public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss the resolution of East Timor's
political and security problems, Sequeira said, adding that the
Dare conference was the only major dialogue process initiated and
managed wholly by East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
In the talks last year, the rival factions agreed to recognize
their differing views and refrain from violence.
</P>
<P>
The second reconciliatory meeting is expected to produce an
agreement on deepening and improving the substance of the
U.N.-supported autonomy package that Jakarta has offered to the
East Timorese as a final solution to the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold a direct ballot in August this year to allow the
territory's people to choose whether their homeland should become
an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Russian Upper House Approves Peacekeepers to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Upper House of
parliament on Friday approved the dispatch of up to 3,600
peacekeeping troops to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Both Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov welcomed the approval, which came after heated debate in an
extraordinary session of the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told reporters before the session that the political
significance of sending troops to Kosovo outweighs economic
considerations, saying Russia's military presence in the Balkans
would be conducive to solving the region's ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the approval "in a significant measure facilitates
the work of the foreign and defense ministries" in pursuing two
goals in the Balkans -- establishing peace and stability in the
region, and Russia's interests which "were, are and will be in the
Balkans."
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said Russia will
spend over 70 million U.S. dollars on the peacekeeping operation,
including 60 million rubles (2.7 million U.S. dollars) from the
defense budget, quite a strain on an already money-strapped
country.
</P>
<P>
While the large contingent of Russian troops will start for
Yugoslavia next Monday, an advance unit will depart for Kosovo
Saturday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, quoting a source at
the headquarters of the Russian airborne troops.
</P>
<P>
The advance unit will "decide on the spot how many Russian
paratroopers will be deployed, in which areas of Kosovo, and under
what conditions," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal hammered out in Helsinki, Finland, Russian troops
will operate in American, German and French sectors in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Has Not Yet Recovered: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Recent improvements in
macroeconomic indicators, such as the strengthening of the rupiah
and the decline in bank interest rates and inflation rates, do not
mean that Indonesia's economy has already recovered, a senior
minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the road to economic recovery, but the economy has
not yet recovered," Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He said many things still have to be done -- the banking system
has to be restructured, corporate credits have to be settled, the
production sector has to be revived, and exports have to be given
a boost.
</P>
<P>
"Many problems still need to be solved and this does not mean
that our work has been completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
On comments that the country's economic recovery has been
proceeding slowly, Ginandjar said efforts have just begun.
</P>
<P>
However, if these efforts run well, economic problems will be
solved promptly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about an ideal rupiah-U.S. dollar exchange rate, the
minister said, "Let it go depending on the situation and other
fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was trading at 6,840/6,860 against the U.S. dollar
Friday, compared with 6,750/6,780 against the greenback Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which was around 8,500 against the dollar before
the June 7 polls, has risen above the 7,000 mark this week.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

a Russian zone in the northwest sector of the province, Western
intelligence analysts have concluded.
</P>
<P>
-- About 1,700 convicted U.S. felons and others barred from

law enforcement records.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Stresses Promotion of Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China needs to improve the people'
s awareness of environmental protection and make afforestation
everyone's obligation from generation to generation, leaving our
descendants a better space for survival and development, a senior
Chinese leader stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said this
while addressing the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of
the Ninth CPPCC National Committee, which ended this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has long given priority to the cause of
afforestation and made great achievements, but the reality is
still a harsh one, and time is pressing as we face this severe
challenge, otherwise the Chinese nation's survival will be
threatened, let alone the issue of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
China has a huge population, which can offer enough manpower
for afforestation, and a successful combination of personal
benefits and national welfare should be the key to the success of
this cause, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li stated that planting more economic trees is important for
the national afforestation drive, which is a new concept for
making profits and making full use of land resources at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation is a long-term and systematic project calling for
scientific research, more investment and better services, Li added.

</P>
<P>
But then her game fell apart and world number 16 Testud took
advantage, winning the final four games of that set to make it 1-
all. But she made a series of errors around the court allowing 22-
year-old Tanasugarn to take control.
</P>
<P>
The world number 63 broke Testud three times in the decider,

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has been the second
biggest African importer of goods produced by its northern
neighbor of Kenya in the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Gold Twins Merging into Fifth Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Toronto-based gold twins,
Franco-Nevada Mining Corp. and Euro-Nevada Mining Corp., will
merge and become the fifth largest gold company in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is hopefully the last year we'll have to hold two annual
meetings," Seymour Schulich, chairman of both companies, told the
general meeting of the royalty twins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The merger will be based on a market capitalization of 2.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the proposed merger, Euro-Nevada investors
will receive 0.77 of one Franco-Nevada share for each Euro-Nevada
share. Shareholders will vote on September 8 on the newly merged
companies, which will be called Franco-Nevada Mining Corp. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Building a stronger institutional following is the key driver
of the deal. With the price of gold approaching its 20-year low of
260 dollars an ounce, the value of North American Gold Funds has
fallen from about 5.4 billion dollars five years ago to about 2.7
billion dollars, according to Mr. Schulich.
</P>
<P>
"The level of apathy and disinterest has never been greater,"
he said, citing the fact that the financially troubled gold mining
industry has written off 3.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.38
billion dollars) in assets.
</P>
<P>
Despite the "generally positive" reaction to the news of the
merger, as described by local media, Franco-Nevada shares fell 40
cents to 22.85 Canadian dollars (about 15.54 U.S. dollars)
Thursday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Euro-Nevada dropped 25 cents to 17.70 Canadian dollars (about
12.04 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two companies, both founded in the 1980s, have investments
in 60 royalties covering five million acres of land. About 96
percent of the profit and cash flow is derived from assets in the
United States, Canada and Australia.

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Arab investors are considering the establishment
of an Arab investment company for mineral sector in Arab states
with a capital of 500 million U.S. dollars, Arab daily Al Hayat
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The investors hope that the company will be officially
announced on the sideline of the 7th Arab conference on mineral
resources due to open in Cairo from October 25 to 28 under the
theme of "Arab mineral resources in the service of economic
development."

AMMAN -- Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Wealth
Suleiman Abu Ileim began his talks with Iraqi officials in Baghdad
Thursday for expanding Jordanian-Iraqi cooperation in the field
of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quote Abu Ileim as having said at a news
conference in Baghdad that Jordan wishes to win a quota in the
development of Iraqi oilfields, adding that the Jordanian National
Petroleum company has examined a number of Iraqi oilfields and has
made certain conclusions.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- President of the Iraqi federation of industries Adnan
Al Hamidani suggested in Beirut the establishment of a joint
transport company by the Lebanese and Iraqi private sectors to
facilitate business activity.
</P>
<P>
Hamidani was quoted by Al Hayat Friday as saying that the
Iraqi federation is prepared to extend all facilities in
coordination with the competent quarters to facilitate all actions
that may activate Iraqi-Lebanese economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi Al Bambi told
Arab daily Al Hayat that fiscal year 1999/2000, due to begin July
1, would witness the tabling of two fields as crude oil producing
fields in the western desert with a capacity of 12,000 barrels per
day, as well as 9 new fields of natural gas in the same area, the
Mediterranean and the Delta to produce 303 billion cubic feet a
year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the projected development of natural gas fields
in the Mediterranean, including those of Habi, Sieth, Rasheed,
Balteem, north Port Said area and Timsah, with a total capacity of
1.5 billion cubic feet, would be completed by the end of 1999.

RABAT -- The World Bank anticipates that economic growth in the
Middle East and North Africa will drop to some 0.7 percent in
1999 as compared to 1.5 percent in 1998 and about 3.1 percent
in 1997, Al Hayat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report "Financing World Development," the Bank
said the fall in growth in the Arab region this year is due to
price fluctuation on the international oil market and weak
economic performance within the European Union which consumes most
of the non-oil exports of Middle East countries such as Egypt,
Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An External Affairs Ministry
spokesman said here Friday that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Gibson Lanpher would visit New Delhi Saturday but added that he
was not aware of details of the official's program.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman maintained that the forthcoming visit of Lanpher
could not be construed as seeking third party mediation on the
Kashmir issue but only part of diplomatic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Lanpher is now in Islamabad meeting with Pakistani leaders over
the crisis of Kargil in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation headed by
Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Central Command General Anthony
Zinni Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said a
"balanced and constructive approach" was needed to bring peace in
South Asia. He reiterated the demand that the overall Kashmir
problem be solved first to avoid any Kargil-like situation.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is also reported to have urged the United States to play
a mediatory role between India and Pakistan to defuse the crisis.
India, however, is strongly against any third party involvement in
the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
India's former home minister Indrajit Gupta said here Friday
that the United States has made no U-turn in its policy towards
India and might instead use the Kargil crisis to get some kind of
foothold or a base in Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Yes to Tighter Controls, No to Moratorium :UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Friday
welcomed an EU agreement on tighter controls on genetically
modified crops, but criticized a French proposal for a moratorium
on new GMO (genetically modified organisms) approvals.
</P>
<P>
British officials said the agreement amounted to a political
declaration instead of a legal ban on new GMO products.
</P>
<P>
British Environment Minister Michael Meacher, issuing a
statement after a meeting in Luxembourg of EU environment
ministers, said: "...I think no one can now, or in the future,
seriously argue that the procedures are not tight, comprehensive
and balanced, and in my opinion, very effective,"
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at the Department of the Environment said, "The
French minister made clear there was no legal basis for a blanket
moratorium. What they were putting forward was a political
declaration."
</P>
<P>
Also, a spokesman at the Ministry of Agriculture criticizing
the French move was quoted by Reuters as saying, "The French
proposal is not the way forward. What we are pressing for is an
agreement on improved legislation,"
</P>
<P>
EU ministers agreed last December to apply new principles of
risk assessment and post market monitoring within the framework of
existing laws that are now being put in place.
</P>
<P>
A group of five countries led by France said in Luxembourg they
would suspend all further GMO license applications until the rules
are revised.
</P>
<P>
German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, who chaired the
meeting, said the EU political agreement confirms a de facto halt
on new GMO approvals until legal changes have been made, probably
in 2002, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
No genetically modified crops have been approved in the EU
since April 1998 because of shortcomings in the existing approval
system.

<HEADLINE> Panchen Lama in Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery (RPT) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama, Erdeni Losang
Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu, attended today a ceremony to mark the
completion of a restoration and refurbishment project of the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery in Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, which was built in 1447, is one of
the six major monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism and has been the
residence of all previous Panchen Lamas.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery has a floor space of 300,000 sq.m. and is a major
center for Tibetan Buddhist believers to perform their religious
activities. It also has many scripture halls and shrines to the
Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Salong Pingla, the deputy director of the lamasery's
management commission, revealed at the ceremony that the Chinese
central government had allocated a total of 80 million yuan over
the past few years to maintain the soul tower of the 4th Panchen
Lama and build soul towers for the 5th to 10th Panchen Lamas in
the lamasery.
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party of China and the State Council, China's
highest governing body, had highly praised the 10th Panchen Lama
for his contribution to the Tibetan Buddhism and the unification
of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government spent over 4.6 million yuan (about 550,
000 U.S. dollars) and bestowed large amounts of silver and gold to
build a tomb for the 10th Panchen Lama and a memorial hall after
he passed away.
</P>
<P>
Salong Pingla said that this fully reflected the central
government's positive religious policy in Tibet and the state's
respect for the freedom of religious beliefs of Tibetan Buddhists
and other people.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was selected as the reincarnation of the
10th Panchen Lama during a lot-drawing ceremony held in front of a
statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni on November 29, 1995 and the State
Council approved the selection.

profound public concern.
</P>

were concerned with the relationship between the city and the
environment, the city and technology and the city and culture.
</P>
<P>
A UIA official said that the design proposals were wide-ranging
and diverse, reflecting the open minds, the creativity and a sense
of social responsibility of the new generation.
</P>
<P>
According to UIA practice, a student architecture design
competition is held in the run-up to every UIA World Congress of
architects, and Chinese students began to participate in the
competition in 1984 and won the first prize in the 14th
competition in 1990.

HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals in Hong Kong
reached a total of 853,617 in May this year, up 9.6 percent on May
1998, according to figures released by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of visitor arrivals from January to May 1999
was 4.2 million, an increase of 12.1 percent over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy in May reached 76 percent, reflecting the
general pattern of growth seen in visitor arrivals since July 1998.
Hotels in the high tariff B category were the best performers --
achieving a rate of 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most short-haul markets remained strong during May, with
particularly good performances from China's inland areas and
Taiwan region, which experienced a double-digit surge. Indonesia
leads for a second month, with a rise of 67.1 percent, while
Thailand's gradual economic recovery continues to boost outbound
travel, with the number of visitors growing by 53.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, weak currencies in New Zealand and keen regional
competition in both Europe and North America created a seasonal
downturn in some long-haul markets. Despite a moderate growth in
April, arrivals from the United Kingdom fell 15.1 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Panchen Lama in Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama, Erdeni Losang
Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu, attended today a ceremony to mark the
completion of a restoration and refurbishment project of the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, which was built in 1447, is one of
the six major monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism and has been the
residence of all previous Panchen Lamas.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery has a floor space of 300,000 sq.m. and is a major
center for Tibetan Buddhist believers to perform their religious
activities. It also has many scripture halls and shrines to the
Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Salong Pingla, the deputy director of the lamasery's
management commission, revealed at the ceremony that the Chinese
central government had allocated a total of 80 million yuan over
the past few years to maintain the soul tower of the 4th Panchen
Lama and build soul towers for the 5th to 10th Panchen Lamas in
the lamasery.
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party of China and the State Council, China's
highest governing body, had highly praised the 10th Panchen Lama
for his contribution to the Tibetan Buddhism and the unification
of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government spent over 4.6 million yuan (about 550,
000 U.S. dollars) and bestowed large amounts of silver and gold to
build a tomb for the 10th Panchen Lama and a memorial hall after
he passed away.
</P>
<P>
Salong Pingla said that this fully reflected the central
government's positive religious policy in Tibet and the state's
respect for the freedom of religious beliefs of Tibetan Buddhists
and other people.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was selected as the reincarnation of the
10th Panchen Lama during a lot-drawing ceremony held in front of a
statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni on November 29, 1995 and the State
Council approved the selection.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Indian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, met with
Harkishan Singh Surjeet, general secretary of the Communist Party
of India (Marxist), here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, said China and India are close neighbors, boast long
histories and ancient civilizations, and are developing countries
with the largest populations in the world.
</P>
<P>
The development of the close-neighborliness between the two
countries not only accords with the fundamental interests of both
countries and the common aspirations of the two peoples, but also
is a consistent position of the CPC and the Chinese government, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, leaders of China and India jointly advocated the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and have since made
these universally recognized principles the political foundation
for the relations between the two countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has always treasured its friendship with the Communist
Party of India, Li said, voicing the hope that the two parties
would further reinforce cooperation in a bid to push forward the
healthy development of bilateral ties and contribute to both
regional and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet said the Communist Party of India appreciates the
reform and opening up policy of the CPC and the Chinese government,
as well as China's achievements in economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China would play a bigger role in
safeguarding world peace and development, and in pushing forward
the formation of a rational and just new political and economic
world order.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet is visiting China at the invitation of the CPC.

societies of the two countries' parliaments represents an
effective channel through which the two sides can exchange views
frankly, in order to increase mutual understanding and expand
common ground.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is looking forward to the visit by President
of the French Senate Christian Poncelet in fall this year, Li
noted.

Besson said that the exchanges at different levels between the
parliaments of France and China are of major significance for the
growth of the France-China partnership of comprehensive
cooperation.

plan with the NPC during Poncelet's visit, with which Li Peng
expressed his agreement.

BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators deliberated a
draft amendment to the Law on the Protection of the Ocean
Environment here today, calling for equal importance to be
attached to ocean environmental protection as to that of the land.
</P>
<P>
Members attending the ongoing 10th meeting of the Ninth

the ocean is being polluted and new pollution sources are
appearing.

LUANDA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola is still searching for a
helicopter of the national police force, which went missing
Tuesday in southern Angola's Namibe Province governmental sources
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers, including navy divers, are searching in the sea and

including Jeronimo Marcolino "Ngongo", Deputy Internal Minister,
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Seminar to Brief Officials, Entrepreneurs on WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Local government officials and
entrepreneurs across China will be briefed on the latest
developments in the country's bid to enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the effect WTO entry will have on China in
a week-long seminar scheduled for July 18.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the seminar, the China WTO Research Society,
said that senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), including Long Yongtu, MOFTEC chief
negotiator, and several other senior economists, will lecture at
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Topics of briefings will cover a general introduction to the
WTO, China's foreign trade system reform, China's opening policy,
the process of China's bid to enter the multilateral trade body
over the past 13 years, and what China's accession to the WTO will
mean to the country's various economic sectors as well as the
relevant policies China should adopt.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second such seminar this year. In January, prior
to Premier Zhu Rongji's official visit to the United States, a
week-long WTO seminar was also held here on a similar topic.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration promised its firm support for China's
entry into the WTO in 1999, during Chinese Premier Zhu's visit to
the United States. Important progress has been made on the issue,
MOFTEC minister Shi Guangsheng said soon after the Premier's visit.
</P>
<P>
The talks on China's entry into the WTO between China and the
United States came to a standstill following the U.S.-led NATO
attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade May 8.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting British Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry Stephen Byers last week, Shi said that China
has never changed its stance, viewpoint and attitude toward its
accession to the WTO. But, he said, now is not the proper time to
resume the WTO talks with either the United States or the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led missile attack against the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade damaged the good atmosphere of negotiations," he said. "
Only after the U.S.-led NATO has made a response satisfactory to
China and a good atmosphere is reinstated can the talks be resumed.

<HEADLINE> More Opium Production Likely in Afghanistan: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the United
Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) said Friday that opium
production in Afghanistan is likely to rise again this year.
</P>
<P>
UNDCP representative in Pakistan and Afghanistan Bernard Frahi
told a news briefing here that bad weather depressed opium
production to 2,100 tons in Afghanistan last year, but weather has
been good for the crop this year.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is now believed to be the world's largest producer
and trafficker of narcotics with opium grown on 63,000 hectares,
producing an average 3,000 tons of opium every year.
</P>
<P>
Frahi said the Afghan Taliban are cooperating with the UNDCP in
fighting the drug problem but collect tax on poppy crop also. "We
can not accept that," he said, adding that pressure should be put
on the Taliban to stop it.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban signed an agreement with the UNDCP in 1997 to fight
the drug problem. The Taliban had destroyed 32 opium-processing
factories in Nangarhar province and some poppy plants in Kandahar
province, he said.
</P>
<P>
The poppy crop over 30,000 hectares in Helmand province would
be targeted next, Frahi added.
</P>
<P>
Frahi dispelled the impression that Taliban leaders are
involved in drug business, saying that the Taliban could not be
ignored and "we will have to involve them to combat drug
trafficking."
</P>
<P>
"We do not have the resources to address the whole problem,"
Frahi said, referring to the complex problem of weaning poor
Afghan farmers away from growing the lucrative poppy crop.
</P>
<P>
He said Afghanistan is the major supply route of drug smuggling
to European countries through Central Asian states.

<HEADLINE> Food-Short Tanzania Plans to Boost Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Facing a 589,000 tons of
grain shortage in the coming season, Tanzania has been making a
strategic plan for agriculture development, local newspapers
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his budget report to the parliament in central town of
Dodoma, the Minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives William
Kusila said that the grain production for 1998/1999 financial year
will satisfy by only 86 percent of its demand in the new fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the looming 589,000-ton grain deficit,
particularly maize, rice and wheat, to unfavorable weather
conditions like delay and uneven distribution of rains and other
calamities including outbreaks of destructive pests.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that there were indications that only Rukwa,
Ruvuma, Mbeya, Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions would be
self-sufficient in maize production.
</P>
<P>
He said the preliminary forecast indicated that about 7.485
million tons of food crops were produced in 1998/99, almost half
is grains and half is potatoes, beans and bananas.
</P>
<P>
"Production of grains will decrease by 11 per cent compared
with the production in 1997/98, while the production of other food
crops will decrease by one per cent," Kusila said.
</P>
<P>
Kusila said that the government was forced to take emergent
measures to import food, including 175,000 tons of maize which is
expected to arrive in the country before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"The government will ensure that its strategic grain reserve
has at least not less than 150,000 ton of food," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for cash crop production for the 1998/99 season, the
minister said reports showed that there was an increase in
production of coffee, cashew nuts and sugar.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the prices in the world market for cash crops
such as coffee, cotton, cashew nuts and sisal dropped compared
with rates in 1996/ 97 and 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said that the Strategic Agricultural
Development Plan was almost ready for implementation aiming at
maximizing the use of agricultural resources.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the 43 million hectares of arable land available,
Tanzanians have only managed to till 6.3 million hectares so far,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan will help promote extension services to some
3.6 million small farmers and livestock keepers to improve the
crops production and animal husbandry by controlling diseases and
pests and developing irrigation schemes.

<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday urged Israel and
the guerrillas in Lebanon to end the cross-border attacks that
have killed at least 10 people.
</P>
<P>
"The UK is deeply concerned about the serious escalation of
violence in Lebanon and Israel culminating in the Israeli bombing
attacks in Beirut and the Beqa'a. We urge an end to this latest
cycle of retaliatory attacks," the Foreign Office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes on Thursday killed at least eight people and
hit power stations, roads and bridges after Hezbollah (Party of
God) guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets from Lebanon, killing two
civilians in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The deaths and injuries to civilians in South Lebanon, northern
Israel and Beirut represent serious breaches of the April 1996
Understanding," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's civilian death toll was the highest in a single day
since an unwritten accord was drafted in April 1996 with the aim
of keeping non-combatants out of the line of fire, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The foreign office said it would be "making immediate
representations in Israel, Lebanon and Syria" to urge restraint on
all sides and strict respect for the April 1996 Understanding.

FUZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
executed 14 drug traffickers in Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou cities
today as part of a national crackdown upon narcotics one day ahead
of the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province has been confronted by increasing drug
cases in recent years since locals colluded with drug traffickers
in Taiwan to make and smuggle narcotics, an official with the
Fujian Provincial Higher Court acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Courts in Fujian handled fewer than 100 drug cases each year
before 1995, compared with 219 cases in the January-Friday period
of this year, the official said, adding that anti-drug work has
been challenged by well-organized and armed transnational drug
trafficking rings.
</P>
<P>
The courts have made joint efforts together with local police
and other authorities to reinforce crackdowns on drug trafficking,
having handled 1,526 cases involving 2,461 people since 1996, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Inaugurates Civil Service Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Thursday swore in the newly appointed Secretary to the Government
of the Federation (SGF), Head of Service and the 36 permanent
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian official newspaper the New Nigerian quoted the
president's speech at the inauguration as saying that the public
service team should meet the challenges of the next millennium by
becoming "people-oriented rather than self-serving; innovative
other than rule bound".
</P>
<P>
The civil servant, Obasanjo said, is the expert adviser to the
political leadership of his ministry, saying he must be loyal to
the political leader in carrying out the decisions and policy laid
down by the political leadership.
</P>
<P>
"We will restore the core values of honesty, impartiality,
professionalism, transparency for which the Nigerian civil service
was known as well as ensuring that civil servants regain
confidence in themselves,* he said.
</P>
<P>
The present administration, he said, was determined to provide
an enabling environment and protection for the civil servants to
perform their duties without fear of favor.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo reiterated that the reward of post was based on merit
and not ethnic, religious or "old boy considerations."
</P>
<P>
He warned the audience against using traditional rulers,
clergymen and other powerful persons to carry favor or covering up
misdeeds as was found in the past.
</P>
<P>
He told civil servants to resist illegitimate political demands
or pressures and political encroachments on the internal
self-regulation of the civil service system.
</P>
<P>
"These must be respect for the rule of law and adherence to the
rules and regulations as enshrined in the civil service rules,
financial regulations and the administrative guidelines," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the president also noted that the immediate
priorities of his administration include the resuscitation of
decaying infrastructure, raising capacity utilization of the
nation's industries and eradicating corruption from national life
as well as restoring confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo Monday retired 11 permanent secretaries, appointed or
swapped 35 others in a shake-up of the ill-named old civil
servant team.
</P>
<P>
Permanent secretary is the top rank civil servant under the
cabinet member in a ministry or government agency.

to the Chinese capital. Some people have been renting stools to
onlookers, which "mars the solemnity of the ceremony and creates
disorder," said Xia Shangwu, director of the Tian'anmen Area
Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, anyone wishing to fly a kite
on the square must register with the administration with a
document from his or her work unit to obtain permission.
</P>
<P>
Kite flying has been a popular activity in the square for
decades, with its large area and continuous wind.
</P>
<P>
Other articles of the new regulations have been in effect for
some time, including a ban on vehicles entering the square,
playing football and roller skating, as well as unlicensed
business activities, spitting and littering.
</P>
<P>
To mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's

<HEADLINE> Rally to Support Kashmir "Freedom Fighters" Held in Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A protest rally was held here
Friday to express solidarity with Muslim militants, fighting at
the heights of Kargal along the Line of Control in Kashmir against
the Indian military forces.
</P>
<P>
The rally was led by, among others, Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry,
prime minister of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
It started from the Foreign Office, and marched to the office
of the United Nations. Representatives of the rally handed over a
memorandum to a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum reminded the United Nations of the Indian air
raids and use of chemical weapons against Kashmiri Mujahideen and
innocent civilians "who are striving for their promised right of
self-determination".
</P>
<P>
The urgency of resolving the Kashmir problem is further
heightened by the danger of a nuclear confrontation with
calamitous consequences for India and Pakistan in particular and
South Asian and the world in general, said the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
It expressed hope with the United Nations for a durable
settlement of the Kashmir in the interest of human rights and
international peace.
</P>
<P>
The protesters urged the western countries to give up their dual
standard on the issues of Kashmir and human rights and take
immediate action to end Indian atrocities in Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Stresses Balanced Approach to Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday asked the United States to take a "balanced and
constructive" approach to the prevailing crisis in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Commander-in-Chief of the U.S.
Central Command General Anthony Zinni, Sharif appraised the guest
of Pakistan's viewpoint on the current crisis in Kashmir, a press
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed again the necessity of a "just and
final" settlement of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the
United Nations resolutions to let the Kashmiris exercise
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the confrontation in Kargil of Kashmir was
symptomatic of the problems that have bedeviled the Pakistan-India
relations over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Unless a peaceful solution to the Jummu and Kashmir dispute
was reached in the shortest possible time, situations like Kargil
would continue to erupt, threatening peace and endangering the
stability of the region," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Sharif assured that Pakistan will keep on respecting the Line
of Control pending the final settlement of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
General Zinni, who arrived here late Wednesday night for
defusing the tension in Kashmir, will convey Pakistan's point of
view to President Bill Clinton, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Zinni Thursday held talks with the Committee of Joint Staffs'
Chairman Pervez Musharaff, after which Pakistan labeled the
viewpoint that Zinni brought in as a "narrow" one.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government was
determined at a meeting Thursday to curb the surge of crimes by
foreign bandits in the country's Northern states.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo, at the meeting with governors of
the affected states stressed the need for them to be security
conscious by guaranteeing the safety of lives and property of
their people, reported This Day, a leading Nigerian newspaper
Friday.
</P>
<P>
While assuring that the government would take necessary
measures required to restore peace and order in the affected
states, he asked the state governments to also show greater
concern for rural areas where the bandits appeared to operate at
will.

The government, according to him, would not fold its arms and
allow the bandits to terrorize and maim innocent Nigerians, adding
that the issue was of serious concern to his administration.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, coming on the heels of a debate on the issue at
the House of Representatives, which had also expressed concern
over the increasing influx of the bandits into the country, was
expected to work out modalities on how to curb the threat to lives
and property.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives had set up a special committee
which is expected to liaise with all the security agencies and the
immigration department toward solving the problem.
</P>

recently in the Karim Lamido Local Council Area of Taraba State by
the bandits.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 persons, including three policemen, were killed one
week ago in Taraba, an eastern state of Nigeria by armed bandits
suspected to be from neighboring Chad and Niger Republic.

<HEADLINE> Strengthened Exchange Rate Boosts Indonesia's Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's import activities in
the last two months have been increasing at an average of 10-20
percent following the recent strengthening of the rupiah exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"The recent strengthening of the rupiah currency against the
U.S. dollar has revived the country's import of various industrial
raw materials for export-oriented industries," local press reports
Friday  quoted Saud, chairman of the Indonesian Association of
Importers, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar has
strengthened to 6,700 from 9,000 in April.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that this year's import value may reach some 30
billion U.S. dollars, despite the fact that the importers have to
finance their import activities themselves, as letters of credit
issued by national banks are still unacceptable abroad.
</P>
<P>
Saud said that 74 percent of the 30 billion dollars would be
for the import of raw materials, 20 percent for capital goods, and
the rest for consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The ideal rupiah exchange rate is 5,000 per dollar, but a range
between 6,000 to 7,000 is still acceptable for imported
activities, Saud said.
</P>
<P>
Before the monetary crisis which started in mid-1997, the
rupiah exchange rate was 2,400 per dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Manufacturing output
increased by 9.1 percent year-on-year in May 1999 and recorded a
cumulative 8.2 percent growth in the first five months compared to
the same period last year, according to data released Friday by
the Economic Development Board of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has maintained a momentum to grow for
the sixth consecutive month since gyrating from negative to
positive territory in December 1998 and the growth was largely
contributed by that in the electronics and chemicals clusters.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster grew 31.6 percent over last May with
increase coming from semiconductors, cellular telecommunication
products and more orders from Europe and the United States for
computers, disk drives and PCBAs. The sector registered a
16.9-percent growth in cumulative output for the first five months
of 1999 compared to the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew by 19.6 percent year-on-year
bringing the cumulative output up by 11.4 percent for the first
five months compared to the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In May, the output of petrochemicals grew by 22.6 percent, the
pharmaceuticals industry grew by a hefty 71.4-percent compared to
the relative low base a year earlier and output of petroleum
products contracted by 8.5 percent as regional oil demand remained
lackluster.
</P>
<P>
The output of the engineering cluster declined in May by 0.5
percent year-on-year with cumulative output for the first five
months of this year 2.9 percent lower than that produced in the
same period of 1998.

The precision engineering segment expanded by 7.5 percent while
the process and transport segments shrank by 13.4 and 5.5 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo to hold talks with Taylor on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Nigeria's President
Olusegun Obasanjo and his Liberian counterpart Charles Taylor are
to meet in Liberia Friday, discussing ways of resolving security
issues in the West African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The trip of President Obasanjo is widely believed to be
primarily aimed at pushing for a final settlement of the decade
long conflict in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Sierra Leone government and its rebel
United Revolutionary Front (RUF) is at a critical moment now when
Freetown has accepted the power-sharing formula with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
How to patch up the relations between the two west Africa
countries are also high on the agenda of the two leaders' talks.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian daily Friday quoted the charge
d' affaires of the Liberian embassy in Lagos, Mr. Roland Bedell as
saying that Liberia will on July 26, the 152nd independence
anniversary of the west African country, destroys all arms and
ammunition seized from rebels during the seven-year fratricidal
war.
</P>
<P>
How to improve the bilateral relationship, which turned sour at
the time of late Gen. Sani Abacha, is also high on the agenda of
the two leader's talks.
</P>
<P>
Liberia hopes to use the visit to familiarize President
Obasanjo with the Liberian people, adding that Nigeria is a
leaders of the sub-region, said the Liberian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the wide speculations that Taylor is a major
architect in the Sierra Leonean crisis, and among other things,
the close relationship between him and Foday Sankoh, leader of the
rebels, Bedell confirmed that though the two are friends, there
was no evidence to establish that Taylor funds the rebel
insurgency in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, Taylor has always advocated diplomatic
settlement to the problems in Sierra Leone, arguing that it cannot
be true that he supports rebellion in that country.
</P>
<P>
Former Nigerian administration had publicly charged a couple of
months ago that Taylor was the chief financier and brain behind
the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Past Nigerian commanders in the West Africa Peace Keeping
Forces or ECOMOG stationed in Sierra Leone had also accused
Taylor and other African leaders such as Blaise Compaore of
Burkina Faso, and Moamar Gaddafi of Libya, of backing the rebels
secretly.
</P>
<P>
But Bedell said: "We believe in dialog. Liberian war for
instance was solved after all the killings, with dialog. We then
went into election and now have a democracy. That is the formula
we want in Sierra Leone."

<HEADLINE> New Methods Needed to Help HK Industries: Federation Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Henry Tang, chairman of the
Federation of Hong Kong Industries, here Friday called on local
firms to change and adapt their methods of operation to survive in
a more sophisticated and competitive world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 39th Annual General Meeting of the federation,
Tang said that one of the most vital areas to be addressed is the
uptake of new technology -- not just information technology (IT),
but technology applied across the whole production process to make
better products in a more competitive and efficient way.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong government is doing some very good work in
helping our industries upgrade their production methods, and we
welcome the fact that many of the recommendations made by the
Chief Executive's Commission on Innovation and Technology are
already being acted on," he said.
</P>
<P>
As suggested by the commission, the government is now in the
process of setting up an Innovation and Technology Fund, to the
tune of 5 billion HK dollars (641 million U.S. dollars), to help
nurture new technology and upgrade existing technology in Hong
Kong's industries. A detailed framework has recently been
announced.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that the fund will not purely be focused
on IT-related projects, but will look at the wider issue of the
take-up of innovation and new technology in our traditional
sectors," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The fund will also promote industry-university collaboration,
which is considered by the federation as crucial to upgrade Hong
Kong's industrial technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of an Applied Science and Technology Research
Institute will help address the shortfall in research and
development that's long been a problem in local industry, Tang
continued.
</P>
<P>
The institute will provide a useful bridge between the work
being done in the universities and the take up of new technology
in local industry.
</P>
<P>
Providing recommendations to the government on unemployment,
the federation has argued that maintaining a robust industrial
base in Hong Kong world provide local workers with stable
employment.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the future, Tang said the federation, which
comprises some 3,000 member companies, will watch with interest
developments in the IT industry, in particular the Cyberport and
the Science Park, which will both have a big impact on Hong Kong's
hi-tech future.
</P>
<P>
The federation is setting up a new IT group, Group 25, to
acknowledge the rapid growth in this field, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Close cooperation with China's mainland in all areas will
continue to be a priority for the federation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government is working to ease restrictions that stop highly
skilled scientists and technologists coming to Hong Kong to work.
"We believe this is the right move to make, and one that will
ultimately help all sectors of local industry," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The federation also supported the idea of establishing a second
market in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong to enable smaller
companies with innovative ideas to raise capital for expansion and
development, he added.

<HEADLINE> Fear of Ethiopian Incursion into Somalia Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Fear is increasing over a
possible incursion of Ethiopian troops in the central regions of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Abudwaq and the border town of Balanballeh of
Galgudud region said that an Ethiopian military delegation have
toured these towns consulting with local elders and traditional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to elders contacted in Abudwaq town through the VHF
field radio, the Ethiopian officers have asked them to sign a
pact, allowing the Ethiopian troops to pass through those towns.
</P>
<P>
The traditional leaders said the Ethiopians did not say where
they are heading to, but merely asked them to sign a document
they presented which would give them the authority to deploy their
troops and vehicles in Galgudud region for what is called a mere
security improvement attempt.
</P>
<P>
However, the traditional leaders have refused to sign any
document for the Ethiopian officers. Instead, they offered them
collaboration in the security improvement efforts in the region.
The local elders said the Ethiopians did not like the response
they were given and left them in disapproval.
</P>
<P>
The reason why the Ethiopians are eager to deploy their forces
in the central region of Galgudud is not known. However it is
known that a mysterious ship loaded with various kinds of weapons
and ammunitions had recently arrived at the natural port of Fah
village, some 45 km southeast of central Hobyo town.
</P>
<P>
The weapons and ammunitions are known to have arrived for
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid from the government of
Eritrea which is engaged in a serious border conflict with
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians, after confronting disagreement with traditional
leaders of Galgudud region, have started building up large force
in Lasa Anoh village, some 80 km north of Balanballeh town close
to the border.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians are reportedly making serious military maneuver
that has been explained as an attempt of invading Galgudud region.
 Local people are concerned over the possible human catastrophe in
case the Ethiopians try to invade their towns without their
consent.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has gone without a central government since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Solar Eclipse Records Help Pinpoint Confucius' Birthday (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ancient Chinese people believed that what happened in the
heaven was closely connected with what happened on the earth. And
when important things happened, they always observed the sky and
made astronomical records," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"In Chinese historical documents there are plentiful
astronomical records. The records, especially solar and lunar
eclipses and planets phenomena, can help us identify many
important historical incidents," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Modern astronomic calculation offers us a new scientific
method in archaeological study, which can not be matched by
traditional methods," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Jiang and his fellow researchers consulted
the most advanced long-term ephemeris database and traced the
chronology of more than 3,000 years ago, pinpointing the exact
dates of a well-known ancient war between King Wu of the Zhou
Dynasty (11th century BC- 221 BC) and King Zhou of the Shang
Dynasty (16th century BC- 11th century BC).
</P>
<P>
Li Xueqin, China's leading historian and director of the
Institute of History under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
said using modern astronomy is a good method for solving
historical puzzles. "But it must be based on authentic historical
documents." he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the astronomical method has attracted wide
attention in the historic field recently. In a grand project to
put precise dates on the three dynasties of Xia, Shang and Zhou,
with 170 historians working on 40 specific topics, a quarter of
the topics belong to astronomical study. And experts believe that
modern astronomy will facilitate historic research.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Solar Eclipse Records Help Pinpoint Confucius' Birthday (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The birthday of Confucius, the
founder of Confucianism and great thinker and educationalist in
ancient China, was recently pinpointed by scientists as October 9,
552 BC, one year earlier than thought.
</P>
<P>
"We confirmed that this year's October 9 is the 2,550th
anniversary of the great thinker, according to solar eclipse
records in the Spring and Autumn Annals and by means of modern
astronomic calculation," said Jiang Xiaoyuan, dean of the Science
History Department of Shanghai Jiaotong University today.
</P>
<P>
Confucianism held sway as the orthodox philosophy of feudal
society in China for some 2,000 years since the Han Dynasty (206
BC-220 AD). It was believed that Confucius and the Buddha
Sakyamuni were contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, China's first doctor in astronomic history, who is
attending an academic meeting here, said he recently found in
historical documents that there were records of a solar eclipse in
the year when Confucius was born.
</P>
<P>
"A solar eclipse is a rare astronomical phenomenon, and its
date can be accurately calculated," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Calculations indicate that a partial solar eclipse could be
seen in Qufu in east China's Shandong Province, Confucius'
hometown, on August 20, 552 BC. Jiang and his team input the data
into computers which then calculated the birthdate using
historical records of the death of the great philosopher,
pinpointing it at October 9 that year.
</P>
<P>
The exact birthday of Confucius has been debated for a long
time in the historical fields. And the popular view is drawn from
the Records of the Historian written by Sima Qian of the Han
Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) that he was born in 551 BC.
</P>
<P>
However, it doesn't accord with Confucius' death date written
in the same book, said Jiang, adding that his new calculation
tallies with the death date and Confucius' age very well.

awakened" here on Friday at a special eye-dotting ceremony in
preparation for the upcoming Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival-

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese market observers are
getting more concerned about the doggedly lethargic market, and
hold a prudent attitude toward the government's latest stimulative
measures.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter, normally a dull season for consumption
anyway, saw a further drop in the retail sales volume. Figures
from the information center under the State Administration of
Internal Trade show a 1.7 percentage point drop in May from the
seven percent growth of the first four months.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a spate of positive news from securities
departments aroused a rally on China's two bourses, whose
composite indices have hit consecutive new highs in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the vibrant stock market may attract
consumers to invest more in stocks and thus affect immediate
consumption for some time; but with more cash gained through high
yield investments, they are likely to spend more afterwards.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the hefty cut in the interest rate
announced on June 10 has not only helped encourage consumers to
turn to the securities market, but will also have a positive
effect as to kick off a recovery of the domestic consumer market.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that these measures would not have an
immediate influence on consumption. The retail sales volume in
June will remain similar to that of May, they predicted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country's total retail sales
volume in the first five months stood at more than 1.23 trillion
yuan, up 6.6 percent from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Warri Peace Meeting Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The peace meeting on Warri crisis
rounded off Thursday in Asaba, capital of Delta State with a
communique calling for the end of Hostility and addressing the
issue of council headquarters relocation.
</P>
<P>
A communique by the leaders of the three ethnic groups Urhobo,
Ijaw and Itsekiris said the meeting paved the way for further
negotiations under a peaceful atmosphere, reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian daily Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was concluded as members of the House of
Representatives' Ad Hoc Committee for the Warri crisis visited
the state as part of efforts to bring lasting peace to the area.
</P>
<P>
The six-point communique said the parties agreed that the
channel of communication between the various ethnic groups which
the peace meeting offered should be sustained so that permanent
peace can be pursued through dialog.
</P>
<P>
It was also resolved that the state government should assist
victims of the Warri crisis across the board within its financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the warring youths, at a press briefing, yesterday
declared their total support for the Warri national peace
conference holding in Benin, Edo State, Friday to find a lasting
solution to the recurring crisis in the area.
</P>
<P>
The peace conference is being arranged by 3000 family settlers
in Warri area who planned to use the forum to tell the world the
real problem confronting the war-ravaged town and proffer possible
solutions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo two weeks ago paid an
urgent visit to Warri region and pleaded for time to enable his
government to resolve the underlying problems behind the Warri
crisis when ethnic clashes had claimed about 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
Disputes between the Ijaws and Itsekiris on the relocation of a
local government triggered off the killing which lasted for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
But poverty and a feeling of being neglected by the federal
government are at the roots of the conflict. The Niger delta
region generates nearly all of the country's oil and above 90% of
the nation's foreign currency reserve, yet find itself struggling
in deep poverty.

<HEADLINE> UK Envoy Urges Uganda to Pull Out of Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to
Uganda Michael Cook has criticized Uganda for its intervention in
the armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and
urged it to pull out as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with members of the Young
Parliamentarians Association here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The British diplomat said that Uganda's intervention in the
conflict is not necessary and that the British government is not
happy with Uganda's intervention although London recognizes
Kampala's need for security at the borders, the Monitor daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some parts of the border were more insecure than before Uganda
sent troops into the DRC, the envoy noted, and this showed the
current policy was a failure.
</P>
<P>
He urged Ugandan authorities to call a cease-fire and negotiate
a withdrawal from the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption of rebellion in the DRC in early August of
1998, Uganda has maintained a large military presence in the
eastern part of Congo (K) to allegedly protect its borders.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has accused Kampala of
backing the rebels fighting to topple his administration, a charge
which has been denied by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama
Mbabazi said that Uganda, as a key player in the armed conflict in
the DRC, would not sign the cease-fire pact in Lusaka, Zambia this
weekend if its security concerns were not properly addressed.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Contest Ends with No Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 25 (Xinhua)--Hackers lost their battle against
two heavily-armored web servers as organizers declared on Friday
no winners for the Hackers Zone international competition held in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing had happened," declared Myril Shaw, vice president of
a U.S.-based company which provided one of the target servers.
</P>
<P>
He said this was so despite more than 40,000 hacking attempts
between May 14 till June 25.
</P>
<P>
Had they succeeded, the first-break-in penetraters would have
swept away prizes of 10,000 Singapore dollars (about 5882 U.S.
dollars) and 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myril emphasized that the contest was not meant to foster or
glorify the illegal act of hacking and the sponsors considered
hackers criminals.
</P>
<P>
He said the contest had proved the web a dangerous world but
people can still have the confidence to do e-commerce over the
internet.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time that hackers had failed in such an
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Infinitum Company, who sponsored the other server,
organized a similar contest last year in the United States and
offered the same amount of prize. But the money stayed intact.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Lau, president of Reed Exhibition Companies, Singapore,
said, " The Hackers Zone competition has provided a pivotal focus
for us to communicate the importance of IT security. "
</P>
<P>
He said his company will consider having this competition
again.

JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Friday vowed to build a people-centered and caring society.
</P>
<P>
In his first state-of-the-nation address to parliament, Mbeki
said: " What will guide us in everything we do will be the
challenge to build a caring society."
</P>
<P>
"This society must guarantee the dignity of every citizen on
the basis of a good quality of life for every woman, man and
child, without regard to race, color or disability."
</P>
<P>
Such a society must be sustained by a growing economy capable
of extending sustainable and equitable benefits to all people,
said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's speech was televised on state television.
</P>
<P>
He said the task to build a caring society is not one that can
be carried out by the government alone.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of the reconstruction and development of our
society into one which guarantees human dignity, faces the
entirety of our people.
</P>
<P>
"It is a national task that calls for the mobilization of the
whole nation into united people's action, into a partnership with
government for progressive change and a better life for all, for a
common effort to build a winning nation."
</P>
<P>
He committed his government to working in close partnership
with all, to ensure that it drew on the energy and genius of the
nation as a whole, to give birth to "something new, good and
beautiful."
</P>
<P>
"We invite all those in our country who occupy positions of
authority and responsibility to join in this new way of doing
things, by engaging the people whom they serve and lead in the
common effort to transform all of us into a people at work for a
better South Africa," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's joint sitting of parliament, a solemn ceremony
was held at the National Assembly building in Cape Town.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Pledges to Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Friday announced a variety of new initiatives to tighten the
screw on criminals.
</P>
<P>
In his first state-of-the-nation address to Parliament, Mbeki
said new measures include the improvement of the competence of the
police force, the establishment of a special investigation unit to
deal with "all national priority crimes", coordination of security
organs and new crime-fighting legislation.
</P>
<P>
He said new police recruits with requisite education levels
would be brought into the police service to help transform it into
the "pride of the nation".
</P>
<P>
New recruits will be given proper training and relevant
regulations will be reviewed to ensure the proper promotion and
deployment of serving members, taking into account their
competence, honesty and dedication.
</P>
<P>
Steps would also be taken to review and improve the police's
conditions of service, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the "special and adequately staffed and
equipped" investigation unit will be launched within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I have directed that the ministers of safety and security,
defense, intelligence, justice, home affairs and finance must
finalize all outstanding matters which relate to the activation of
this unit within a fortnight."
</P>
<P>
He promised to introduce amendments to the Prevention of
Organized Crime Act and legislation against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation will also be introduced to ensure that we can deal
 mercilessly with all crimes involving guns, including the illegal
 possession of firearms, the killing of police officers,
corruption within the criminal justice system and the intimidation
of witnesses."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said a study by the coordination and implementation unit
in the office of the deputy president had confirmed "what surely
all of us have known", the correlation between poverty, crime and
race. The areas with high crime rates were the black and poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
The government intended to make "multi-disciplinary
interventions" in these areas, starting with a few pilot areas,
drawing in all spheres of government and ordinary citizens in an
offensive to reduce crime levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the central features of the brutish society we seek to
bring to an end is the impermissible level of crime and violence.
Acting together with the people, we will heighten our efforts
radically to improve the safety and security of all our citizens,"
Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Export Up 7.7 pct in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam in the first six months of
1999 half completed its import-export targets for the year, said a
report of Vietnam's Ministry of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been in the face of difficulties of falling export
prices and weakening domestic purchasing power this year.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report of the Ministry of Trade,
Vietnam's exports in the period reached 4.9 billion U.S. dollars,
up 7.7 percent from the year-earlier period and making up 50
percent of the year's plan.
</P>
<P>
Of this, exports by foreign-invested enterprises were worth
over 1 billion U.S. dollars, up 8.9 percent; while exports by
domestic firms reached 3.9 billion U.S. dollars, up 7.4 percent
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports in the first six months reached 5.22 billion
U.S. dollars, down 12 percent over a year ago, and making up 45.5
percent of the year's plan. Imports by foreign-invested
enterprises reached 1.25 billion U.S. dollars, down 11 percent;
and imports by domestic firms were worth 3.97 billion U.S.
dollars, down 12.3 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The import fall resulted from weakening domestic purchasing
power and measures taken by Vietnamese Government.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam reported a trade deficit of 320 million U.S. dollars
over the period, the lowest in recent years.

MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has approved a one million U.S. dollar technical assistance grant
to help establish an Asia Recovery Information Center web site,
ADB said Friday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
This Internet-based facility will support the collaborative
exchange and analysis of information on the social and economic
impacts of the Asian financial crisis, and the pace and
sustainability of the economic recovery process, ADB said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will publish an Asia Economic Recovery Report

According to ADB, the types of information to be provided by
the web site will include key social, economic and financial
indicators as well as the development assistance initiatives and
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
By improving access to reliable and up-to-date information on
the crisis, users of the web site will be better able to respond

said.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented over a one-year period
commencing in July 1999. It will be reviewed at the end of one

<HEADLINE> Barak Signs First Two Coalition Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Following tense negotiations,
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak signed the first
coalition agreements with two political parties on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed with Yisrael Baaliya Party,
which got six Knesset (parliament) seats in the May elections,
the party's leader Natan Sharansky will take up the post as
interior minister in the incoming coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Another senior member of the Russian immigrants' party,
Edelstein, will be named as deputy minister of the immigration and
absorption ministry.
</P>
<P>
Before the elections, Sharansky had accused the religious Shas
Party of blocking the immigration from Russia and vowed to hold
the interior ministry portfolio by himself.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the coalition talks, Sharansky also
threatened to walk out of the coalition talks if Shas is offered
the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
Barak also signed an agreement with National Religious Party
(NRP), which won five seats in Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, NRP leader Yitzhak Levy will be named as
construction minister while the party's No.2, Shaul Yahalom, as
deputy education minister.
</P>
<P>
Barak intensified coalition talks with concerned political
parties early this week as he had less than two weeks to go before
the deadline for submitting his government list to the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, which began on Thursday night and lasted until
Friday morning, Barak also met representatives from the religious
Shas Party and the right-wing Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the One Israel coalition told Israel Radio that it
is closer to reach an agreement with Shas than with Likud.
</P>
<P>
However, Shas representatives also expressed their angry at
the news that Sharansky was offered the interior ministry, saying
that Barak had made the deal with Yisrael Baaliya even before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has asked the leaders of the concerned political
parties not to leave the country over the weekend, is expected to
form the new government in days.

<HEADLINE> Agency Set up to Aid Kenyans Seeking Jobs Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An organization to help Kenyans
seek employment abroad has been launched in Kenyan capital
Nairobi, media reports said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Association of Foreign Employment Agents will liaise
with the Ministry of Labor's National Employment Bureau and
Kenyan embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch Thursday, Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu
underscored the importance of publicity among Kenyans about the
job opportunities abroad.
</P>
<P>
Plans should be made to ensure that Kenyans were not cheated,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Abud Sheobo, chairman of the association, said the
organization is aimed at eliminating bogus agents who had duped
Kenyans into accepting non- existent jobs abroad.
</P>
<P>
The scams can be avoided through proper and cautious evaluation
of potential employers by Kenya's embassies and demanding
realistic salaries and "humane working conditions".
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi appealed in April to Kenya's
college graduates to look for overseas jobs, saying Kenya was not
able to provide enough jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan economy has been in a recession in recent years with
the growth rate in 1997 at 2.3 percent and 1.6 percent in 1998.
Last year the unemployment rate of this east African country stood
at 25 percent.

PANAMA CITY -- The United States is never interested in
cooperating with Panama to solve the security problem along Panama
's border with Colombia, National Police Director Jose Luis Sosa
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a statement by U.S. Southern Command chief
Charles Wilhelm, who, in a report to the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Tuesday, said the United States can
intervene unilaterally in Panama if the presence of the Colombian
guerrilla in the border province of El Darien endangers the
security of the big ditch. Sosa said he is surprised by Wilhelm's
statement, noting that more than three years ago when he talked on
the matter with U.S. diplomats and high-ranking military
commanders, he never received any concrete support. (Panama-US-

<P>
In a news communique issued at the end of the fourth conference

to return to the track of establishing mutual trust on solving the
Kashmir dispute. Tension emerged between India and Pakistan last
year when the two South Asian countries conducted nuclear tests
one after another, and both have traded harsh words since
conflict flared up in the Kargil sector of Kashmir at the end of
last month. (India-Pakistan-Meeting)

<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed by
rampaging lions and hippos in Zambia's Central Province last
weekend, Zambia Information Service has said.
</P>
<P>
The service quoted an official named Ricky Milandu as saying
Thursday in Choma in Southern Province that five of the seven were
fishermen while the other two were farmers.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were attacked when they were trying to protect
their cattle from lions while the fishermen were attacked while
they were fishing.
</P>
<P>
He said the population of the wild beasts has tremendously
increased in the area of Itezhi-tezhi, posing a threat to human
life.
</P>
<P>
The situation was serious as people have started moving in
groups with spears and axes for fear of being attacked by the wild
beasts.
</P>
<P>
Milandu lamented that appeals to the Department of National
Parks and Wild Life to crop the beasts have gone unheeded.
</P>
<P>
He said villagers have now threatened to take the law into
their hands if they are not protected.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns of Further Strike On Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
warned that it would take further action against Lebanon if Beirut
fails to curb Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks on Israeli
northern areas.
</P>
<P>
"If there is not quiet in the north, there won't be quiet in
Lebanon," the office of outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said in a statement after an emergency cabinet meeting late
Thursday night, in which the ministers approved the most heavy air
strike on Lebanon in three years.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a large-scale air strike from Thursday evening
through early Friday morning, avenging waves of Katyusha rocket
attacks on its northern areas by Hezbollah guerrillas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the most deadly cross-border attack in near six years, two
Israeli civilians were killed and several others injured.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said two civilians were killed and a third was
critically injured in the border town of Kiryat Shmona late
Thursday night when a rocket slammed into the town hall in the
third barrage of Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Five people were hurt in the first two barrages that hit towns
and villages in Galilee region Thursday afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, or Party of God, began the rocket attack after
one Lebanese woman in south Lebanon was wounded by Israeli
shelling fired from the Israeli-occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a swath of land in south Lebanon in 1985 and
declared it security zone with a claimed aim of protecting its
north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust the Israeli occupation troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the second Katyusha rocket barrage, the Israeli
government ordered a large-scale air strike on Lebanon, plunging
Beirut into darkness by hitting a power station near the Lebanese
capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that eight Lebanese civilians were killed
and several dozens injured in the Israeli air strikes. In
retaliation, Hezbollah fired the third and the deadly barrage of
rockets on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the deaths of the two civilians in Kiryat
Shimona, Israeli fighter planes launched a fourth round of air
raid, shattering power stations, bridges and communication centers
as well as Hezbollah bases in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst military escalation between the two
countries since 1996 when Israel launched a major military
offensive on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ordering the large-scale military reprisal against Lebanon,
Netanyahu said in a statement that Hezbollah was "mistaken" if it
thought it could attack Israel while the government was in
transition.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's office said Barak was
informed of Netanyahu's decision to bomb Lebanese civilian
infrastructure targets. Netanyahu retains full power until Barak
put together a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his One Israel members, Barak has reiterated
that his government will pull Israeli troops out of Lebanon
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Barak should form a new government by July 9, but the
escalation of conflict in Lebanon will undoubtly quicken the pace
of coalition negotiations since dissatisfaction has grown among
Israelis over the stalemate in government's operations.

<HEADLINE> Recent Notice Covers Transportation Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Communications
and Ministry of Finance have jointly issued a notice calling for
intensified controls over transportation fees.
</P>
<P>
China is currently considering a plan to convert transportation
fees into taxes. However, due to lack of understanding of the
reform, some areas have failed to remit fees on schedule and in
some cases have evaded payments in the interim period prior to
passage of a related law.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show a 20-percent drop in highway maintenance
fees collected in the first quarter compared to the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministries have instructed transportation departments at
all levels to adopt effective measures covering the collection of
fees.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt to Improve Farm Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is putting
in place tax incentives, specifically the reduction of duty on
tractors and other agricultural machinery to increase production
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Suresh Desai, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, said
the agricultural sector is the backbone of Zambian economy. The
government must continue its efforts to promote the realization of
the vast potential in the sector, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
When officiating at the 35th Annual Congress of the Tobacco
Association of Zambia (TAZ) here Thursday, the minister called on
the tobacco sub- sector to improve tobacco production as it is a
high value crop which is earning the country significant foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's volumes were still low compared to Malawi and Zimbabwe
which had smaller land sizes, he noted, adding there is more room
for further increase in production.
</P>
<P>
Desai said it was necessary to add value to the locally
produced tobacco in order to earn more foreign exchange from the
export market. He encouraged the farmers to invest in the
processing plant and ensure that it was able to handle all the
tobacco grown in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He also urged TAZ to encourage more small scale farmers to join
it in order to get the benefit associated with belonging to the
group.
</P>
<P>
The government realizes it had not been easy for farmers to
adjust to the liberalized environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, low producer prices, including
inadequate input, crop marketing system and limited credit
facilities were the major problems slowing down agricultural
development in the country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Revive Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development (MARD) would take measures to help local
sugar refiners tackle difficulties in sales, as well as propose
for Vietnam's Cabinet approval the implementation of some
incentives for the industry, Vietnam's business newspaper The
Saigon Times Daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Minister of MARD Nguyen Thien Luan
at a meeting with a number of Vietnamese sugar refineries in Hanoi
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statistics of MARD show that in the 1998-1999 crop, 41 local
refineries have produced 552,000 tons of sugar, and smaller
enterprises 200,000 tons. However, domestic sales have been so
poor, resulting in 353,000 tons of sugar being piled up.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Vietnamese sugar refineries at the meeting
agreed upon the need of dealing with the current high production
cost of sugar. They also agree to seek export markets as sugar
stockpiles might be worse with the commissioning of some more
sugar mills.
</P>
<P>
MARD will propose Vietnamese Government extend bank loans taken
out for investment to reduce production costs and maintain the
floor prices of different categories of sugar at less than 5,000
Vietnamese dong (VND) (0.36 U.S. dollars) to 6,800 VND (0.49 U.S.
dollars) per kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling and floor prices of sugarcane will be kept within
the range of 200,000 VND (14.38 U.S. dollars) and 240,000 VND
(17.25 U.S. dollars) per ton to guarantee profits for sugarcane
growers.
</P>
<P>
Sugar imports will be banned and sugar smuggling will be
combated, with three teams to be set up in the three regions to
monitor these operations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged Not to Drink Imported Coke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian food health
authorities have appealed to the public not to buy and drink
imported Coco-Cola, especially from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has not registered any firm to import
Coco-Cola from Belgium and other European countries, the drinks
have found their way through the notorious Zanzibar route, The
African newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fabian Magoma, registrar of the National Food Control
Commission, told the paper Thursday that the Tanzanian government
had long ago banned imported Coco-Cola and other food products
from Belgium as the Chief Chemist found the goods unfit for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, Magoma said, most of the supermarkets in Tanzania are
full of imported Coca Cola products not certified by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Importers of the products are unknown, he said, adding that his
 commission had tried to trap them in Zanzibar but failed.
</P>
<P>
According to the registrar, in the next fiscal year starting
July 1, the commission will institute strict control at 15 entry
points with medical officers properly equipped.
</P>
<P>
A lot of countries have banned imports of Coco-Cola, chicken,
eggs, meat and other food following reports that goods produced in
several European countries were contaminated with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
A Dar es Salaam Coco-Cola firm said Wednesday that its products
are safe and free from the cancer-causing substance.

<HEADLINE> Time Not Right For Vigorous Consumer Goods Market: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese market observers are
getting more concerned about the doggedly lethargic market, and
hold a prudent attitude toward the government's latest stimulative
measures.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter, normally a dull season for consumption
anyway, saw a further drop in the retail sales volume. Figures
from the information center under the State Administration of
Internal Trade show a 1.7 percentage point drop in May from the
seven percent growth of the first four months.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a spate of positive news from securities
departments aroused a rally on China's two bourses, whose
composite indices have hit consecutive new highs in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the vibrant stock market may attract
consumers to invest more in stocks and thus affect immediate
consumption for some time; but with more cash gained through high
yield investments, they are likely to spend more afterwards.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the hefty cut in the interest rate
announced on June 10 has not only helped encourage consumers to
turn to the securities market, but will also have a positive
effect as to kick off a recovery of the domestic consumer market.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that these measures would not have an
immediate influence on consumption. The retail sales volume in
June will remain similar to that of May, they predicted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country's total retail sales
volume in the first five months stood at more than 1.23 trillion
yuan, up 6.6 percent from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines-U.S. Balikatan War Games Slated Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States agreed Friday to resume a large scale military war exercise
in January or February next year.
</P>
<P>
The holding of "Balikatan" exercise which was suspended in
1994, was agreed upon at the opening of the 41st Philippines-U.S.
Mutual Defense Board (MDB) meeting here.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement, Philippine Army's Chief of Staff
General Joselin B. Nazareno and Admiral Dennis C. Blair, commander
in chief of U.S. Pacific Command announced that preparation for
the Balikatan is now in the final draft stage.
</P>
<P>
Topics discussed during the meeting between military officers
from both the U.S. and the Philippines were regional security
assessment, update on the review of the MDB concept plan and
Visiting Forces Agreement ratification implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the United States have an existing Mutual
Defense Treaty (MDT) signed in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of the resumption of the Balikatan
exercise, Nazareno said "this will strengthen the interoperability
of both the Philippine and U.S. forces."
</P>
<P>
Balikatan is the largest of all Philippines-U.S. joint combined
exercises in scope and magnitude. It is a tri-service exercise
conducted to validate the two country's concept plan under the
MDT.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Blair said, the resumption of exercise Balikatan
will involve the participation of some 600 to 1,000 soldiers from
both the United States and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But the exact details will be announced between now and January
when the exercises start, Blair said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Fishermen Lost at Sea in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A fishing boat carrying six
fishermen from West Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia, was
engulfed by huge waves at the Indian Ocean, Antara News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The six were all from the fishing village of Melayu Bangsal,
Ampenan district.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted an eyewitness to the mishap Hambali as saying
that the boat was first struck by an eight-meter wave on Friday
morning when it was going ashore after spending several days at
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
"Deadly waves emerged suddenly from the opposite direction of
the boat and struck it three times until it vanished from our
sight," Hambali said.
</P>
<P>
He said his boat was about 40 meters away from the ill-fated
boat when the accident took place but his attempt to rescue the
fishermen was hampered by the big waves.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> United States Advance into Women's World Cup Quarter finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CHICAGO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hosts the United States survived an
early scare, beating Nigeria 7-1 to advance into the quarterfinals
of the 3rd Women's World Cup here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States were 0-1 down only three minutes into the
match when Nigerian striker Nkiru Okosieme caught the American
defenders off guard and beat the goal-keeper with a fierce shot.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had the chance of being 2-0 ahead but Okosieme's shot at
the 5th minute just went wide.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian team played aggressively after taking the lead.
They pressed ahead, making most of the shots but failed to enlarge
their lead.
</P>
<P>
The turning point of the match came at the 19th minute when
veteran Michelle Akers headed home a well-placed free-kick to level the
scoring at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
The goal greatly inspired the host team and they opened their
scoring gate and added five more goals in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Mia Hamm added one just one minute after Akers' goal. Milbrett
Tiffeny made it 3-1 for the host team at the 23rd minute. Assisted
by Hamm, Lilly Kristine further enlarged their advantage to 4-1 at
the 32nd minute while Akers and Cindy Parlow each scored a goal at
the 39th and 42nd minutes respectively to put the host team 6-1
ahead by halftime.
</P>
<P>
The American team made several substitutions in the second half,
replacing Hamm and Akers with younger players. They had only one
goal in the second half through Tiffeny at the 82nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The victory put the United States on top of Group A with 6 points
and virtually earn a berth in the quarterfinals. They will play their
last group opponents DPR Korea at Boston on June 27.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A Technology Innovation Fund for
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was launched today with
a primary allocation of one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars)
, after approval by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng Nan, vice minister of Science and Technology,
the special fund has been introduced to support the development of
technology-based SMEs.
</P>
<P>
She announced the move at a joint press conference between her

establishment of the fund is expected to play a positive role in
optimizing the structure of industries, expanding domestic demand,
creating more job and promoting sound and steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Deng said the fund will give priority to programs with
independent intellectual property rights, high technology, high-
value added products and those which are export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
She said the fund will be available to all technology-based
SMEs within every framework of ownership and explained it will
also be used as launch capital for scientists and researchers with
R&AMP;D achievements to run technology-based SMES.
</P>
<P>
The fund is also expected to offer loan interest subsidies for
SMEs with innovation projects to obtain loans from commercial
banks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Swimmers Aim 4 Golds at SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian swimming team may
be content with a haul of four gold medals at the Brunei Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games next August due to the absence of Catherine
Surya and Rita Mariani, the Indonesian Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kristiono Sumono, an official of the Indonesian Swimming
Federation (PRSI), said that Indonesia's best hopes will hinge on
the men's events through Richard Sambera, Wisnu Wasdana (freestyle)
, Felix Sutanto and Albert Sutanto (individual medley and
backstroke).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia grabbed 10 gold medals at the 19th SEA Games in
Jakarta two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The absence of Rita and Catherine will make our job of
maintaining the last two years' feat more difficult, especially in
the women's events," Kristiono said.
</P>
<P>
The swimming federation could not greedily push Rita to
maintain her form during her training on the grounds that her
American outing was at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
"She studies in the U.S. on her own money, not financially
allowed by PRSI. Therefore we can by no means force her to carry
on with her training," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rita withdrew from the team because, as she said, she would not
be able to meet expectations to win a medal, while Catherine is
still nursing a nagging back injury.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is preparing seven male and six female swimmers for
the games which will run from August 7-15.

<HEADLINE> Water Park in Southwest China Awarded International Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A theme park fed with water from
the Funan River in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
province, has recently been awarded the International Environment
Design Prize.
</P>
<P>
The park, which features a river water environment,
purification facilities and educational exhibits, is reportedly
the first of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The complex, which is in the shape of a fish and covers 24,000
sq.m., was jointly designed by specialists from China, the United
States and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Since its opening in 1998, the park has received many donations
from international organizations and companies. It has also become
a base to promote awareness of environmental protection for
primary and secondary schools in Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Kunming, the capital of southwest China
's Yunnan province, is expected to be built into one of China's
most beautiful cities in the next century in line with a recent
blueprint of the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The successful hosting of the '99 Kunming World Horticulture
Exposition, which runs from May 1 to October 31, has greatly
promoted construction of urban infrastructure in Kunming, well-
known as the "city of spring", said Yang Jianqiang, municipal
party secretary.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city's urban area has increased from 116 square
kilometers to 132 square kilometers, fulfilling the urban
communications development plan 10 years ahead of schedule. And
the city's green coverage rate has reached 28.5 percent, with per
capita green coverage standing at seven square meters.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the development scheme, the green coverage
rate of the city's new area will be at above 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council to Issue Doping Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Sports Council (
KONI) plans to immediately issue a guidance book on drug use in a
bid to familiarize athletes with various kinds of drug substances,
the Indonesian Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Imron ZS, mission chief of the Indonesian sporting delegation
to the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, said the book is felt to
be important to give guidance to the athletes over drug use
because not all of them know much about drugs which may contain
banned substances.
</P>
<P>
An ignorant athlete, who means to use drugs for treatment, may
probably end up with a banned drug and find himself or herself
being faced with a doping charge.
</P>
<P>
According to Imron, prior to the departure date to Brunei next
August, the athletes will have to undergo regular physical tests,
which may be an effective effort to prevent the athletes from
consuming performance enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We'd better find out a drug-using athlete and cancel his
departure rather than risk being involved in a potentially big
problem there," Imron said.
</P>
<P>
Imron reiterated KONI's commitment that only athletes with good
prospects of winning medals will go to Brunei.
</P>
<P>
"If a sport federation, which has been preparing for the games,
can't yet guarantee a medal it'd better withdraw its outfit. That
would be better than being sidelined in a tough selection," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The biennial SEA Games will run from August 7-15, contesting 21
events. Indonesia will compete in 20 events.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Calls for Enhanced Sino-U.S. Business Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BALTIMORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Entrepreneurs from both China
and the United States should make consistent efforts to promote
economic cooperation and help bring back on track the soured
relationship between the two countries, said a Chinese diplomat
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Longhai, Economic Counselor at the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, made the remarks at a business conference co-sponsored
by Triway Enterprise, Inc. and Maryland-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 Chinese businessmen and government officials as well as
American entrepreneurs attended the meeting held here at the World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the past 20 years have witnessed profound
progress in China's economic reconstruction. During the 1978-1997
period, China's GDP has risen at an average annual rate of 9.8
percent, 3.3 percentage points higher than that of the world.
</P>
<P>
"China has also achieved 8.3 percent growth in GDP at the first
quarter of this year. I believe the targeted seven percent GDP
increase in 1999 will be achieved," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shen also applauded the rapid progress in the Sino-U.S. trade
and investment relations in recent years. In 1998, he said, trade
between the two countries reached 54.94 billion U.S. dollars, a
hike of 12.1 percent over 1997. By April this year, Sino-U.S.
trade amounted to 16.8 billion dollars, an 8.4 percent increase as
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Shen recognized that China is facing a number of
challenges, such as the slowdown in exports due to the Asian
financial crisis, the sluggish domestic market demand, and the
setbacks in Sino-U.S. relations as a result of NATO's airstrike at
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the on-going anti-China
campaign fanned up by the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
He urged the business community in both countries to continue
working hard to revitalize the relationship between China and the
United States so as to create a favorable atmosphere for
furthering business ties in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that China has adopted more positive policies to beef
up exports and investment opportunities, especially in the fields
of farming, forestry, water conservancy, railways, highways,
telecommunications, environmental protection and urban
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good and new business opportunities in
China. I wish we could have better cooperation with our foreign
partners. We'll do business together, and we'll make money
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
John T. Wu, President of Triway Enterprises, Inc., told the
conference that the souring of U.S.-China relations makes it more
urgent for businessmen from both countries, along with their
respective governments, to joint hands closely for amending the
damaged ties.
</P>
<P>
"The more serious the difficulties, the harder we should work
together," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he is hopeful that the peoples and governments of the
United States and China "have enough wisdom to solve their
differences and overcome the current obstacles."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, led by the general manager of the
administrative department of China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, is composed of business representatives of
various industries from provinces of Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian,
Zhejiang, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
The delegation is to continue business talks with American
businessmen in the next few days before leaving for home on July 3.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Create More Orphans in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has warned
of an increase of HIV/AIDS orphans to over one million by 2005 if
the current trend of the disease infection continues.
</P>
<P>
Kasaya Kisaka, a senior official of the Population Department
at the Ministry of Planning and National Development, said infant
and child mortality rate would worsen should efforts in place to
control the killing disease fail, he was quoted by Friday's East
African Standard newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Kisaka made the remarks at a recent symposium on reproductive
health care in Kisumu, Nyanza Province in southwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that his government was very concerned
with the way HIV/AIDS has seriously reversed the gains made in
areas of child survival in the country.
</P>
<P>
Data reveals that 30 to 40 percent of babies born of infected
mothers were also inflected with HIV, he said, adding that the
majority of them develop AIDS and die two years after their
births, and few survive past the age of five.
</P>
<P>
Kisaka also noted that HIV/AIDS would have a larger impact on
the country's population size.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kenyan Permanent Secretary of Health
Philemon Mwaisaka said more than 200,000 Kenyans would die of AIDS
before the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Traders Under-Declare Turnovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Revenue Authority's (ZRA's)
recent campaign to increase tax compliance discovered that traders
have been under-declaring their turnovers to as low as 10 percent
of the actual volumes of business.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted ZRA spokesperson Chipo Mwiindilia
as saying here Thursday that in the campaign large amounts of
goods believed to have been smuggled into the country have been
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
He said the ZRA has visited over 100 traders in capital Lusaka
alone and the findings are that some traders have been maintaining
two sets of records, one for themselves and a doctored one for
production to ZRA.
</P>
<P>
"In some instances the declarations are as low as 10 percent of
the total turnover and this is the amount the 17.5 percent value
added tax is being based on," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZRA confiscated large amounts of goods which appear to have
been smuggled and have no proof of payment of duty.
</P>
<P>
However, he was unable to state the actual amount that the
government lost in revenue through this vice.
</P>
<P>
He said the ZRA will continue with the exercise to ensure that
all traders complied with the law.

increased from 15 to 128 during the last 25 years, and foreign
exchange earnings from this sector has increased from a trickle of
3.17 million U.S. dollars in the 1972-73 fiscal year to 321
million dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
And it now ranks the third among the export items, next to the
ready-made garments and knitwear sectors in terms of foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh produces 30,000 tons of frozen foods
annually, and about 1.2 million people directly and 10 million
people indirectly are associated with the sector for their
livelihood. The sector contributes about 4.7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
As a riverain deltaic country, crisscrossed by mighty rivers
and numerous canals, Bangladesh, with its warm tropical climate,
is ideally-located and offers a vast reserve of fresh water fish
from its inland water and shrimp and marine products from the Bay
of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The output of seafood can be raised to 150,000 tons, boosting
export earnings to one billion dollars, if the departments
concerned take some pragmatic measures, according to Abdul Awar
Mintoo, president of the Bangladesh Federation of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Exports More Coffee with Less Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya exported 493,100 bags (50 kg
per bag) of coffee in the first eight months (October 1998 - May
1999) of the 1998/ 99 crop year, up from 481,128 bags in the same
period last season.
</P>
<P>
But the export revenues were just 5.46 billion shillings (74.8
million U. S. dollars) at the current exchange rate, down 31.5
percent from the 7.89 billion shillings in the same period last
year, according to the Coffee Board of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The board said the decline in revenues was due to sharply lower
world prices which caused Kenyan coffee auction prices to drop to
an average of 106 dollars per bag in May from 259 dollars in May
1998, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's coffee production is expected to hit 90,000 tons
in 1999/ 2000, up from 70,000 tons in 1998/1999 thanks to improved
weather, said the coffee board.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Coffee Exchange auctioned a total of 799,261 bags
between October and May, compared with 659,345 bags the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the leading importer of Kenyan coffee in the eight
months to May, increasing its purchases by 27.6 percent to 176,
496 bags.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- More and more foreign firms have
expressed interest in investing in Zambia's power projects
following the government's decision for private sector
participation in the country's power generation and transmission.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Friday quoted Permanent Secretary of

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Stop Industrial Pollution in Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- All major industrial enterprises
in east China's Jiangsu Province, one of the country's economic
powerhouses, will cease discharging pollutants into the Yangtze
River, the country's longest, by the end of this month, 18 months
ahead of the national schedule.
</P>
<P>
"So far, more than 360 of the province's 408 major industrial
enterprises along the river have already accomplished their
pollution control schemes," said Shi Zhenhua, director of the
Jiangsu Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, the 400-km-long section of the Yangtze in the
province has been badly polluted over the past five years as
enterprises increased wastewater discharges into it.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the province set a deadline requiring all local
enterprises to meet provincial wastewater discharge standards by
the end of this June in order to avoid closure, as part of the
nation's effort to control pollution along the Yangtze and other
major rivers.
</P>
<P>
Mayors from Nanjing, Yangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Taizhou,
Nantong and Wuxi cities have signed responsibility contracts
promising to meet the deadline.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With the number of automobiles on
the roads of southeast China's Fujian Province exceeding 1.35
million, the emission problem has been targeted as the major blame
for the deteriorated urban pollution there.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly released timetable for treating
automobile emission, the production, sales and use of leaded
petroleum in the province were banned on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
By October 1, all automobiles produced and sold in Fujian must
meet the national standard of emission discharge. By the end of
this year, 50 percent of operating automobiles that fail to meet
the standard in the province will be obliged to install emission-
refining devices. The work is expected to be completed by the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
By the time the cross-century schedule is fulfilled, Fujian's
air quality will meet the country's second-degree standard.
</P>
<P>
The emission control program has been highlighted as one of the
provincial government's priorities. All emission examination
personnel have to pass a unified qualification test before they
are allowed to take up their posts.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Faces Shortfall in Gas Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is now facing a shortfall
of 190 million cubic feet in gas supply each day as production in
two gas fields have remained suspended due to mismanagement, The
Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Petrobangla, which is in charge of oil and gas exploration and
production in the country, said the daily supply of gas has fallen
to 740 million cubic feet from the normal supply of 925 million to
930 million cubic feet following a sudden halt in the production
in the offshore Sangu gas field, in Southeast Bangladesh, Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
And earlier on Saturday, production in the Jalalabad gas field
was suspended, reducing gas supply to the national grid by 60
million cubic feet every day.
</P>
<P>
The Zia Urea Fertilizer Factory, one of the country's several
major fertilizer factories, has been forced to suspend its
production since last Sunday and production in other fertilizer
factories and gas-based industrial units across the country are
also being hampered as they are not getting the required volume of
gas supply, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Daily domestic gas supply in the southeastern Chittagong City,
the country's major seaport, has fallen by 100 million cubic feet,
and as a result, about 50 percent of the people in the city are
not getting gas. To keep the gas supply normal in Dhaka, the
country's capital, Petrobangla has suspended gas supply to a good
number of industrial units, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Sangu Gas Filed, operated by the British company Cairn Energy,
went out of production on Thursday afternoon due to technical
faults in its offshore plant. Production in the gas field has been
suspended many times due to such technical faults, causing a
shortfall of 100 million cubic fee gas per day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been taken for emergency repair in the gas field,
and the authorities concerned have been asked to get the help of
the navy, in case of need, in order to resume production as early
as possible.
</P>
<P>
A high-level inter-company committee has been formed for the
overall coordination and supervision of the repair activities.
</P>
<P>
The daily production capacity of 44 running gas wells in 12 gas
fields in the country is about 1.025 billion cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> 8 Killed, 60 Wounded in Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight Lebanese were killed and at
least 60 others wounded overnight in the largest Israeli air
raids on Lebanon since 1996.
</P>
<P>
About six Lebanese, most of them civil defense workers, were
killed and 16 others were wounded when they struggled to evacuate
workers from the fire set by Israeli raid on the power station in
Gumhur, 10 kilometers east of Beirut and near the official
residence of President Emile Lahoud and Lebanon's Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The attack plunged most of Beirut into darkness and smoke
columns could be seen several kilometers away at the moment.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, another two Lebanese were
killed and at least 15 others, including three women, wounded
when two bridges on the coastal highway linking the country's
southern city of Sidon and Beirut were destroyed by Israeli
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also raided Lebanon's eastern ancient city
of Baalbek, hitting a residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
At least 33 Lebanese, three of them in serious condition, were
injured in the attack and a four-floor building and a nearby
Mosque were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also flew low over the capital and broke the
sound barrier, shattering Lebanese anti-aircraft. "The raids
confirm the anti-peace attitude of Israeli leaders regardless of
their local affiliations," said Lahoud in a statement read by
Lebanese television stations.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman admitted the raids,
saying Israeli jets struck Lebanon's Gumhur Electricity Plant. He
said the blast served as a response to the cross-border rocket
attacks earlier by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Two Israelis were killed and five others wounded in the
Hezbollah attacks, Israeli army said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Hezbollah slammed at least 24 Katyusha
rockets and mortar bombs into northern Israel to avenge an
Israeli shelling which wounded a Lebanese woman in the day.
</P>
<P>
She is the sixth civilian wounded by Israeli shelling in five
days.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Israel reached an understanding in April 1996
after an Israeli 16-day onslaught on Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered agreement bars any attacks on civilians or
from civilian area on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Most shops in and around the city
center of capital Harare had either run out of staple maize meal
or were on the verge of doing so, the daily Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all shops in Harare including the country's biggest
retailers - - OK and TM -- had run out of maize meal.
</P>
<P>
Major millers in Zimbabwe stopped milling maize-meal Tuesday,
citing a deadlock with the government over pricing.
</P>
<P>
Maize millers were awarded a 20 percent increase in the price
of mealie- meal, yet they wanted a 61.2 percent hike.
</P>
<P>
The millers said they would not be able to operate at a profit
following an 88 percent increase in the floor price of maize.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the government appealed to both small and large
milling companies to resume production immediately while a lasting
solution is being sought to resolve their concerns.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira said the
government was considering a two-pronged approach that is likely
to avert a looming maize meal crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are examining all possible options available to meet the
concerns raised by the millers," he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the two-way strategy being adopted by the government
to resolve the current stand-off, said the minister, the Ministry
of Lands and Agriculture was looking at cutting down the handling
costs of maize at the Grain Marketing Board to reduce input costs
incurred by the millers.
</P>
<P>
The government was also looking at the possibility of passing
part of the costs incurred in the milling of maize meal to other
by-products such as stock-feeds.
</P>
<P>
He said the two strategies, if successfully implemented, would
improve viability of the milling industry.
</P>
<P>
The government has the responsibility of keeping prices of
basic commodities such as bread and maize-meal within the reach of
the average consumer, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sissi Double Strike Earns Brazil Olympic Berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CHICAGO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sissi scored twice in the match
against Italy to earn Brazil a berth at the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In a Group B match played at Soldier Stadium of Chicago on
Thursday, Sissi opened the scoring at the 3rd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team fought better after the a difficult first 20
minutes. They began to dominate the match. Captain Antonella Carta
had the big chance to equalise after 32 minutes but saw her penalty
kick stopped by Maravilha.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team continued to create scoring chances but it was
Sissi once again scored after 63 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The two goals put Sissi on top of the scorers' list with a total
of 5. She scored a hat-trick in a 7-1 victory over Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The victory made Brazil on top of the group with 6 points. They
qualified for the quarterfinals and the 2000 Syndey Olympic Games as
well.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great feeling to qualify for the Olympic Games," said
Brazilian coach Wilson Oliveira Rica, "but we are not quite there
yet. We still have another phase to complete."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would rest his star players in the third match as
they have already qualified for the quarterfinals, Rica said:"No I
don't believe in changing strategy much. We want to keep our
rhythm. The only reason we change is if there is a contusion or
injury, or we want to let a player rest a bit."
</P>
<P>
Sissi said:"I am very happy that we have qualified for the
Olympic Games, but I keep in mind that last year I could not be in
th US Cup because of a contusion in my knee. I am happy for me and
my teammates."
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Sissi said she was right at her peak form:"In
Brazil, we have a saying that one gets better as one gets older."
</P>
<P>
Sissi vowed to stick to their game plan:"We are going to
accomplish our goal and keep that in stride. We are not going to
worry about Germany. We are just going to go for first place."
</P>
<P>
Brazil are the third team qualifying for the quarterfinals. On
Wednesday, China and Norway advanced into the last eight after
winning their second straight game respectively.

LOS ANGELES, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Internet usage by commercial
farmers in the United States has more than doubled over the past
two years, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The computer and the Internet have become just as important to
farmers as the tractor and good weather," said the report from
Rockwood, a subsidiary of Farm Journal Corp. and an information
service company for the U.S. agricultural community. The market
research firm conducted a survey in April.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that two-thirds of all commercial farmers own
at least one computer. In addition, these farmers spend, on
average, at least two hours per week using the Internet for
agriculture purposes.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier study conducted by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture in 1997, 13 percent of U.S. farms had Internet
access, 31 percent of farms owned or leased computers, and 20
percent used a computer for their farm business.
</P>
<P>
There were approximately 2.06 million crop and stock farms in
the United States in 1997. The percentage of crop farms' computer
ownership and Internet access was somewhat higher than that of
stock farms.
</P>
<P>
The latest study found that farmers use computers mostly for
financial reporting and analysis and for business record keeping.
More and more, however, commercial farmers are becoming heavier
users of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing evidence that farmers will migrate quickly
toward Web-based transactions, such as purchasing seed, crop
chemicals and farm equipment on the Internet," Rockwood said. The
firm expects Internet usage by farmers to be tripled compared with
1997 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, farmers use the Internet to gather information, such
as commodity prices, and information about weather, farm machinery
and chemicals. About a third of current Internet farm users said
during the survey that they are interested in shopping for
agriculture products on-line in the future.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Step Up Malaria Control in Border Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to step up
control of malaria in its border areas, especially along the
Myanmar-Thai border areas, with the emphasis on the Roll Back
Malaria concept.
</P>
<P>
Plans have already been made to initiate the activities in
accordance with the concept along the border areas for the
reduction of the malaria problem in the areas, said Myanmar
Deputy Health Minister Mya Oo at a three-day Third Task Force
Malaria Border Meeting which began here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Myanmar Ministry of
Health and the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Mya Oo called for collaborative efforts between Myanmar and
Thailand to strive for the reduction of the malaria problem in
both countries, saying malaria is one of the priority diseases in
Myanmar as well as a re-emerging disease in the Southeast Asia
region.
</P>
<P>
Because of the common border between Myanmar and Thailand, this
disease, along with HIV/AIDS, constitutes a common problem to both
countries especially along the border areas, he noted, stressing
the need to control the disease in partnership.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need to closely watch the situation in
the border areas in the wake of population migration problems,
socio-economic development activities and new settlements among
the border townships.
</P>
<P>
He warned that during this year, due to climate changes, the
malaria problem may become more aggravated, disclosing that some
epidemics were recorded in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, during 1997, the malaria
morbidity rate was 15 per 1,000 people and the mortality rate was
7.5 per 100,000 people in Myanmar with the rates doubling in
border areas.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are Myanmar and Thai health officials as
well as WHO representatives.
</P>
<P>
Both the First and Second Task Force Malaria Border Meetings
were held in Thailand during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand has provided 100 tons of anti-malaria drugs
and insecticides to Myanmar, for use along the Myanmar-Thai
border.

BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese can now get a look at
a "money house", an early form of banking in China, at an exhibit
at Beijing's Deshengmen, one of the capital's old gate towers.
</P>
<P>
The old currency is an example of the original banking system

Ming (1368 - 1644) and Qing (1644 - 1911) dynasties, and business
then gradually developed into credit from simple currency
exchanges.

over all individual financial operations.

<HEADLINE> Kiptanui, Komen Lose Heats in Kenya Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Top steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui
and middle distance specialist Daniel Komen lost their 1,500
meters heats as former Olympic champion William Tanui coasted to
his victory with ease at the Kenya's World Championships trials
which started here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, both Kiptanui and Komen did not push themselves to
the limits as the high altitude prevents the runners from
attaining good times, preferring to reserve energy for the last
two-day competitions as Kenya will decide its squad for the World
Championships to be held in Seville in August.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Tanui "strentched his muscle" to win the
third 1,500 meters heat in three minutes 44.1 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kiptanui, Olympic 3,000 meters steeplechase silver medalist,
said he was merely improving his speed ahead of his speciality.
</P>
<P>
Komen appeared deliberately to slow down on the home stretch to
finish third in 3:48.6 as Stephen Kipkorir won in 3:47.4.
</P>
<P>
"I am only perfecting my speed. I will run the 5,000 metres at
the World Championships," Komen said.
</P>
<P>
Vivian Cheruiyot, world cross country junior women's silver
medallist, won heat two of 5,000 meters in 16:33.1.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Resorts Motivational Trainer for Badminton Juniors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) has invited a motivational trainer in to
encourage younger shuttlers ahead of international tournaments,
the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said PBSI invited Andrie Wongso to provide input
to the association on how to increase the juniors' motivation.
</P>
<P>
"It's not wrong to listen to another person's opinion on what
they think of PBSI," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said some senior shuttlers had also visited Andrie for
inspiration ahead of important events, including the Thomas Cup.
</P>
<P>
Andrie, owner of the Action and Wisdom motivation training
center, said his encounter with the young athletes was only the
start of improving the PBSI training method.
</P>
<P>
"This is a brainwashing process. Not all of the shuttlers can
understand what their motivation is to become a shuttler. We know
that non-technical factors really influences a shuttler's
performance on court," said Andrie, who also owns the Harvest card
factory.
</P>
<P>
Andrie told the junior players they needed 100 percent self-
confidence to attain their goals.
</P>
<P>
"Without 100 percent self-confidence, you won't be a champion.
You must all focus your attention on one purpose: to be a winner,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 juniors were admitted to the National Training
Center in East Jakarta after several selections late last year and
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Andrie expressed hope that PBSI could create conditions where
shuttlers could feel they were highly motivated for training
sessions and competitions.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said he hoped the juniors would become more successful
in reaching their targets after 2001, and would arrange a similar
session for all coaches and senior shuttlers in the near future.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Urged to Solve Conflict Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from a working group
on South Asian issues Thursday appealed to India and Pakistan to
strictly observe the United Nations' Resolution 1172 on stopping
nuclear tests and calling for a peaceful settlement of the border
conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a news communique issued at the end of the fourth conference
of senior officials, the group urged the two adversary neighbors
to return to the track of establishing mutual trust on solving the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Tension emerged between India and Pakistan last year when the
two South Asian countries conducted nuclear tests one after
another, and both have traded harsh words since conflict flared
up in the Kargil sector of Kashmir at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from 14 countries and the European Union
reviewed at the conference the situation in South Asia since the
group's last meeting in February in Tokyo, and exchanged views on
regional security, especially the missile tests India and Pakistan
conducted recently and armed conflicts in the Kargil area of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
They expressed regret and concern over the mentioned problems
involving India and Pakistan, and called on both parties for an
early withdrawal of their troops from Kargil and a negotiated
solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Chinese representative Sha Zukang, head of arms control
department in the Foreign Ministry, stressed at the meeting that U.
N. Resolution 1172, which was passed unanimously through
discussion, embodies the shared wish of the international
community, and China hoped India and Pakistan strictly implement
each requirement of the document.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, the presidency of the conference, proposed to call a
foreign ministerial meeting of the working group on South Asia
issues during the U.N.'s assembly this year to discuss the India-
Pakistan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The working group was composed of high-ranking officials and
experts from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, the
United States, as well as the EU.
</P>
<P>
The group, set up in June 1998, one month after India and
Pakistan conducted nuclear tests, was designed to study problems
triggered by such tests, expand consensus of the international
community through bilateral and multilateral channels and help to
promote mutual trust and ease tensions in the South Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Heroin Seized at Sri Lanka's International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Police Narcotics
Bureau (PNB) Thursday seized two kilograms of heroin with a street
value of over 3 million rupees (43,000 U.S. dollars) at the
Colombo International Airport, police sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was smuggled by a 50-year-old Indian who arrived on
an Air Lanka flight from Chenani, India, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Police found that the drugs were concealed in 12 polyethylene
packs in the sides of two boxes containing electric grinders.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that the smuggler was to be met by a
local contact.
</P>
<P>
The detection came after several recent successful drug busts
by the PNB and the Customs Department, which have intensified
their efforts to crack down on the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
In the last major detection made a few weeks ago, a key member
of an international ring was arrested and over 1.125 million
rupees (16,000 dollars) worth of heroin recovered.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of heroin into Sri Lanka has been rising
continuously due to its strategic location between two main drug
producing areas, the Golden Triangle of Thailand, Cambodia and
Vietnam and the Golden Crescent comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is also used by major drug traffickers as a transit
point. Many international drug dealers use shipping routes through
Sri Lanka to transport large quantities of heroin to Europe and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Cicadas Popular in Ancient China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Ancient Chinese ate cicadas, wore
jade cicadas as ornaments, and even had jade cicadas placed in
their mouths when they died, said an archaeologist here today.
</P>
<P>
The history of eating cicadas in China can be traced back to
the Stone Age, and the habit continued into the Zhou Dynasty (1100-
221 B.C.) said Li Ye, an archaeologist at the Hanzhong Cultural
Relics Administration Committee in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, who has studied a large number of historical documents
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
In the inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells of the Shang
Dynasty (16th-11th century B.C.), China's earliest characters,
there is a special one meaning "roast cicada", said the
archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
Li said that cicada was a delicacy at Zhou Dynasty imperial
banquets. "It is possible that cicadas were tribute gifts from the
people of Baiyue, which is the area of today's Guangdong, Guangxi
and Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have found seven jade cicadas at a site
in Shijiahe, in central China's Hubei Province. The objects, more
than 4,400 years old, are the earliest cicada ornaments ever found
in China.
</P>
<P>
The jade cicadas, 2.5 to 2.7 cm long and 0.95 to 1.8 cm wide,
have small holes in them so that they can be fastened to clothing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that cicada ornaments continued to be popular in the
Shang and Zhou dynasties, when they were also used to decorate
precious jade and bronze articles.
</P>
<P>
Many cicada ornaments have been discovered in tombs of the
Shang and Zhou dynasties. They were put on or beside the body.
</P>
<P>
Jade cicadas have also been found in the mouths of the
occupants of tombs from the Shang Dynasty to the Western Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Li said that some jade cicadas in the tombs of the Western Han
Dynasty have no holes in them, so presumably they were specially
made for the funerals.
</P>
<P>
"After the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) cicadas were no longer
eaten. But their image was kept on jade and bronze articles as a
symbol of beauty," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denounces Indian Ministers' Remarks on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday brushed aside
the various remarks on the Kashmir situation and on the country
itself made by two Indian caretaker cabinet members as "highly
irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Office Rafiq Altaf
denounced Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh's statement that
Kargil represents a "fundamentalist threat" not only to India but
to the whole world, urging the world not to be taken in by the
propounder of this philosophy.
</P>
<P>
"By promoting this theory, he is trying to tell the world that
it is India versus Islam -- this is highly irresponsible
doctrine," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also took strong exception to the remarks of
Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani who called Pakistan a "rogue
state."
</P>
<P>
"It fits ill in the mouth of the minister of that country to
call us names," he commented.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Pupils Haunted by Fear of Violence at School: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Every other pupil at age 11, one in
three 14-year olds and one in five 16-year olds fear violence at
school, said a survey among 2,058 school children across the
country carried out by the Trade Union of Bulgarian Teachers last
December.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released by the union's President Yanka Takeva at
a national conference on "Violence in Bulgarian Schools and Ways
to Overcome it", showed that one in three pupils of the fourth
and seventh grades has had money, objects and snacks robbed.
</P>
<P>
Some kind of violence was used against 520 pupils of those
interviewed, while 625 complained of petty thefts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 828 children say they resort to physical force to
resolve disputes; of them, 658 use physical force in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Violence at school is on the rise, according to 49.9 percent
of the interviewees in Sofia. 38.5 percent of them complain that
violence has been used against them while another 28.8 percent
carry things for self-defense at school.
</P>
<P>
Asked how their parents punish them, 884 pupils say they are
reprimanded, 251 are kept from doing what they like best, 242 are
stopped from playing, and 103 are beaten.
</P>
<P>
The National Police Directorate said that one in nine thefts
in May was committed by children. The police recorded 1,419 crimes
committed by underage children in the first quarter of the year.
Three children were killed, 56 were raped and 18 kidnapped during
that period.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of underage drug addicts in the country disrupt
public order. Moreover, children become addicted to drugs at an
increasingly younger age. Pupils start taking drugs at the age of
only 12 or 13, said Dr. Kitan Kitanov of the Institute on
Criminalistics.
</P>
<P>
Drug addicts, mostly heroin users, numbered 20,000 in mid-1998,
according to the Center on Drug Dependency.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fast-Food Restaurants in China Pay for Broadcast Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tricon Restaurant
International Co. headquartered in the United States has made a
decision to pay for the music broadcast in their restaurants in
China.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an agreement signed between the company and
the China Association of Music Creation Rights, the company's
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants in China will pay
the musicians for airing their music.
</P>
<P>
The Berne Convention on the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works, signed in September 1886, stipulated that businessmen
should pay for broadcast music. The United States became a member
in 1989, China in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sam Su, chairman in charge of the Kentucky and Pizza Hut
business in China, said that the two world-renowned restaurants
need legal protection for their intellectual properties, and at
the same time they should also protect others'. The annual payment
for the music broadcasting is expected to be as high as 200,000
yuan (about 24,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over 300 Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants have been set up in
nearly 80 Chinese cities and areas since the first one appeared in
Beijing in November 1987. And the total number of Pizza Huts in
China now exceed 30. The first Pizza Hut branch in China was set
up in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia said Thursday that it is positive to
establish a free trade area between the Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said Mercosur can obtain larger trade diversity
through the free trade area with the EU, because "it will protect
us from changing situation, economic variations, protectionist and
political barriers."
</P>
<P>
He noted that 30 percent of Brazil's trade is with the EU, and
less than 50 percent with the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lampreia said, Mercosur needs to discuss
divergence on the agriculture issue with the EU during the Latin
America, the Caribbean and the EU Summit to be held on June 28 and
29 in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, a major trading bloc in the western hemisphere,
comprises Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, with Chile and
Bolivia as its associate members.

<HEADLINE> New Cities Prosper on Ancient Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve cities have emerged on the
northern route of ancient Silk Road in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Silk Road, the ancient trade link between East Asia and
Europe, followed three routes -- southern, central and northern --
which snaked through nine key countries, including China, the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq
and Syria. The Xinjiang section of the road stretches 1,000
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the 12 cities stands
at 50 billion yuan, or approximately 50 percent of the region's
total GDP. They have also enjoyed annual economic growth rats of
close to 10 percent and have emerged as the developed areas in the
region, according to Gao Hongxing, an official with the Xinjiang
Construction Department.
</P>
<P>
The central government has designated the triangular linking
Urumqi, Kuitun and Karamay as one of the 19 key areas.
</P>
<P>
"Completion of the Eurasian Continental Bridge have eventually
linked the three cities and transformed the area into a focal
point of investment in western China," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
Kuitun, one of the 10 most rapidly developing cities in remote
China, has recorded an annual economic growth rate of over 20
percent in recent years.

Japan, China routed the United States 25-20, 25-20 and 25-17 for
three straight wins in Group B, and will face the winner between

their defeat but failed to set the match to their tune for want of
excellent spikers.

23-25, 19-25, 25-20 and 15-10, also booking the semifinal ticket

<HEADLINE> Peru Enjoys Robust Tourism Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has become a major pillar of
Peru's economy, generating high foreign currency earnings and many
job opportunities, President Alberto Fujimori said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the country's tourism income at more
than 1 billion U.S. dollars this year with 900,000 arrivals and
more than 1.3 billion dollars in 2000 with 1 million arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said the tourism sector directly employs more than 120,
000 people, "but we can talk of up to 500,000 indirect jobs."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's peace agreement with neighboring
Ecuador has helped boost the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador reached a peace agreement in October last year
that fixed their common border. Final documents were signed last
month, putting an official end to the two countries' border
dispute lasting more than 160 years.
</P>
<P>
"This has permitted us to take daring measures, such as
simplifying the entry procedures concerning Ecuadoran, Bolivian,
Chilean, Colombian and Brazilian citizens," said Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
He said that tourists from these neighboring countries are no
longer subject to extra safeconduct, because their national
identity document is enough.
</P>
<P>
Peru's tourism sector earned 950 million dollars in 1998 with
some 832,000 tourist arrivals. A foreign visitor spends an
average of 1,600 dollars and stays 14 days in Peru, longer than in
any other Latin American country, which, according to Fujimori, is
an index of Peru's tourist potential.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Never Cares to Assist Panama: Panama Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States is never
interested in cooperating with Panama to solve the security
problem along Panama's border with Colombia, National Police
Director Jose Luis Sosa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a statement by U.S. Southern Command chief
Charles Wilhelm, who, in a report to the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Tuesday, said the United States can
intervene unilaterally in Panama if the presence of the Colombian
guerrilla in the border province of El Darien endangers the
security of the big ditch.
</P>
<P>
Sosa said he is surprised by Wilhelm's statement, noting that
more than three years ago when he talked on the matter with U.S.
diplomats and high-ranking military commanders, he never received
any concrete support.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. army had leased to the Panama police six
obsolete helicopters, one of which crashed, killing seven
policemen.
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is that they charged us two million U.S.
dollars a year for the use of those helicopters," said the police
chief.
</P>
<P>
Sosa said that when he asked the United States to provide M-16
rifles to equip the border police, the U.S. charged Panama 1,600
dollars for each one.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the actions of President Ernesto Perez Balladares,
we were able to acquire AK 47 rifles for 70 dollars each. These
weapons have the same fire capacity as the M-16," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said that U.S. authorities were asked to give
technological support to reinforce Panama's police communications
system, but they did not answer that either.
</P>
<P>
After U.S. invaded Panama in 1989 to oust then President Manuel
Noriega, Panama's armed forces were dissolved, and were replaced
by the Panamanian Public Forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in Panama dated back to 1903. At its
peak, the Pentagon had about 65,000 troops in 12 major military
bases in the Canal Zone, a 16-kilometer swath of land on either
side of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1977 treaties, the United States must withdrawal all
its military personnel from Panama before the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Danube Section Under Metal Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A study conducted by Bulgarian
environment researchers has showed that the Bulgarian section of
the Danube is under the pollution of the excess of some metals.
</P>
<P>
The content of lead in the river exceeds the normal level three
times, of copper 1,400 times, and of cadmium 30 times, according
to a report prepared by the National Center for Environment and
Sustainable Development.
</P>
<P>
Samples were taken randomly from water, sediment, plants, fish
and soil in the 167 kilometers of the Danube from the Timok river
to the town of Oryahovo, Georgi Tsenov, head of the Vratsa-based
Regional Inspectorate for Environment and Waters, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As Bulgaria has no standards establishing the permissible limit
of toxic metal and metalloid contents in bottom sediments, the
conclusion was drawn after a comparison with the results of
previous measurements, Tsenov said.
</P>
<P>
The border river of Timok is contaminated as a result of long-
year pollution with toxic slime and waste residues from the Bor
copper mine in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, plant and fish samples show that the Danube water
contains excessive content of nickel.
</P>
<P>
The radiological analysis of four water samples, four sediment
ones, one soil sample and seven plant ones did not establish any
increase in the content of radioactive substance.
</P>
<P>
No dead fish and birds were observed during the period of the
survey. There were no other visible damages to the water or
riverside flora and fauna either.

<P>
CARACAS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela suffered its second loss
in eight friendlys after being outscored by Peru 3-0 in Lima on
Wednesday, as it rounded up its tune-up for the upcoming American
Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Venezuela was still hailed by its home fans
as it recorded three wins, three draws and two losses in the
latest soccer friendlys of the year under Argentine Jose Omar
Pastorizaone.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the away loss on Wednesday, Venezuela was only
beaten once at home by Argentina 2-0 on February 3, it even tied
Denmark 1-1 on January 31, and levelled twice against Colombia 0-0
and 1-1 on March 31 and April 14.
</P>
<P>
On May 9, Venezuela recorded its away victory of 2-0 against
Ecuador and beat it again 3-2 on home turf one week later. On
June 20, Venezuela defeated Peru 3-0 at home, only to be revenged
by Peru with the same score three days later.
</P>
<P>
Pastorizaone urged the Venezuela players not to underestimate
themselves as they are on the same level with many a South
American squads.
</P>
<P>
With his contract to expire in November, the Argentina coach
who took the helm seven months ago, called for national support
for their outing in the American Cup as it will serve to prepare
Venezuela for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The American Cup will kick off on June 29 in Paraguay, with
Venezuela pitting against Brazil on June 30, facing Chile on July
3 and playing Mexico on July 6.

<HEADLINE> In form Agassi Gains Momentum at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- American tennis player Andre Agassi
roared into the third round at Wimbledon on Thursday with a 6-3,6-
4, 6-3 victory over Argentine Guillermo Canas.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old American, fresh from his triumph at the French
Open, cruised through his first round at the All England Club for
the loss of just six games.
</P>
<P>
Canas is not renowned as a grass-court player but he did reach
the quarter-finals of junior Wimbledon in 1995 and after an
uncertain start he put up more of a fight in the second set.
</P>
<P>
An early break gave him a 3-0 lead but Agassi battled back to
level the scores with some thunderous groundstrokes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the points developed into long rallies from the
baseline which ideally suited Agassi's game and a brilliant
running forehand gave him the vital break of serve and he duly
took the second set 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Canas' serve simply lacked the power to trouble Agassi and the
Argentinian found return after return flying past him.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, Wimbledon champion in 1992, broke serve to earn a 3-2
lead and although Canas then saved three break points to keep the
match alive, it merely delayed the inevitable with Agassi breaking
serve again in the final game to complete a straightforward win.
</P>
<P>
Former champion Richard Krajicek continued his quiet progress
with a convincing 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 win against doubles specialist
Todd Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
A solitary break of serve in the 11th game was all that
separated them in the opening set, a pattern that was repeated in
the next.
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge found it difficult to cope with the power of the
Dutchman's serve, although he broke once in the third.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek displayed the greater consistency and had few
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Former French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten demonstrated his
increased confidence on grass with a straight sets win over German
David Prinosil.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian saved two break points at 3-3 in the first set
but after that Prinosil never had a look-in.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten hit an impressive 17 aces and only two double faults in
the course of the one hour, 12 minute win.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Kuerten was happy to pick Prinosil off from the
baseline and cruised to a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 win.
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker won a grudge match against Nicolas Kiefer to keep
his dreams of a glorious farewell very much alive.
</P>
<P>
He stepped onto Centre Court for the first time in two years
knowing it could be his last ever match but his victory ensured at
least one more.
</P>
<P>
He and fellow German Kiefer are not on speaking terms after a
series of rows but Becker let his tennis do the talking in a
straight sets victory.
</P>
<P>
Fellow German Kiefer was vey much a bit part player as Becker
won 6-4, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Big serving Goran Ivanisevic was not pleased to be questioned
about possible changes to the game after his 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
win against Sandon Stolle.
</P>
<P>
"Big servers will always have big serves," he said, asked if
different balls would produce longer rallies.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest tournament, look at the people queueing
outside the gates, they are not bored with it."
</P>
<P>
His famous serve was instrumental in the match, as 32 aces were
dispatched, Australian Stolle sending down 18.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Pat Rafter put friendship to one side to beat his
doubles partner Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 in the second
round at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman, a member of last year's victorious Swedish Davis Cup
team, produced some superb returns but was not consistent enough
to beat the in-form Australian.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, who beat Bjorkman on his way to his second U.S. Open
title last year and won the Australian Open doubles with him in
January, took the second set tiebreak 7-3 with an ace.
</P>
<P>
In an exciting third set Bjorkman saved two matchpoints to
force a tiebreak which he won 9-7 on his fourth set point.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman needed treatment for cramp in the fourth set and soon
went down a break. Rafter broke him again for 5-2 and served out
for the match, finishing off with a service winner.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Foreign Reserves Hit All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has an
all-time high foreign reserve of 13.95 billion U.S. dollars as of
the end of May, Philippine Daily Inquirer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as
saying the latest gross international reserves figure was made
possible by the purchase of 2.6 billion dollars at the Philippine
Dealing System since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the figure, the highest in history, is already
beyond the original target of 13.2 billion dollars for the whole
year, enough to cover the country's imports of goods for more than
five months.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the central bank's purchases were made possible
by the robust influx of foreign funds into the country since
January.
</P>
<P>
Foreign portfolio investments, for instance, increased by 43
percent in the first five months of 1999 compared over the same
period of last year, translating into more than 500 million
dollars in net inflow of foreign funds, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also attributed the improvement in the reserves to a
trade-in-goods surplus and the strong loan inflows particularly
for budgetary support.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Miyazawa fund had already released 405
million dollars through Japan's Export-Import Bank for the
country's power and banking sectors, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Cooperation with Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China's top aircraft manufacturer,
the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), has decided to expand
cooperation with its European counterpart Airbus.
</P>
<P>
The two companies has recently signed a series of agreements on
furthering cooperation in design and manufacturing of civilian
aircraft, a spokesman of AVIC confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, AVIC will participate in the development
program of the newly launched A318 as well as in the manufacturing
of A320 wings and parts for the Airbus aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation in northeast China and the Xi
'an Aircraft Industry Group in the northwest, two major Chinese
producers affiliated to AVIC, will directly participate in the
program.
</P>
<P>
AVIC engineers will also play a role in the design and the
certification process of the A318.
</P>
<P>
The agreements will build on the existing industrial
partnership and embark on a long-term and mutually profitable
cooperation between the two sides, according to officials with the
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the move represents a possible advantage
for Airbus to introduce its new series into the booming civil
aviation market of China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian PDI-P Leads in Vote Counting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Vote-counting by Indonesia's
General Elections Commission (KPU) slowed further on Thursday,
with fewer than 1 million votes added during the day to bring the
total votes counted to just more than 62 million, or 52 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) still leads
with 36 percent of the vote, followed by Golkar Party with 18.6
percent and the National Awakening Party (PKB) with 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party (PPP) and the National Mandate
Party (PAN) collected 9.8 and 6.8 percent of the votes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday night, 151 of the 462 contested seats of the House
of Representatives (DPR) in the 27 provinces had been distributed,
on the basis of having met the minimum number of votes necessary
to obtain a seat in each province.
</P>
<P>
PDI-P is ahead nationwide with 65 DPR seats in its hands,
Golkar and PKB are neck and neck with 31 a piece, PPP is third
with 14 seats, followed by PAN with nine and the Crescent Star
Party (PBB) one seat.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the June 7 election
to compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the DPR. The remaining 38
seats are reserved for the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Data collected by official Antara News Agency from all
provincial and overseas chapters of the election committee showed
that by Friday morning, more than 92.988 million or 78.93 percent
of the votes had been counted with the PDI-P winning 104 seats and
Golkar 74.
</P>
<P>
Other parties which had won seats are PKB with 34 seats, PPP
(27), PAN (15), PBB (2) and the Justice Party (1).
</P>
<P>
KPU will announce the final results of the June 7 election on
July 8. KPU members said they were sure the July 8 deadline for
completing the final tallies for the DPR and lower legislative
bodies could be met.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto warned political
parties against mobilizing the masses or conducting shows of force
as the campaign period is long over.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities will take stiff measures in line with the
existing laws and regulations against groups of people from any
political parties who defy law," he was quoted by national
newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
His statement appeared to be aimed at members of the Democratic
People's Party, who have staged many rallies after the election,
protesting against alleged election fraud on the part of the
ruling Golkar Party.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Needs Structural Reshuffle: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Both the structure of China's
stock market and the equity structure of listed companies should
be reshuffled to further the ongoing reform of the state-owned
enterprises, a leading Chinese economist has said.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fureng, honorary director of the Institute of Economics
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, made the remarks in
an article published in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's stock market has assumed the unique duty of supporting
the reform of state firms, apart from the typical functions of
raising capital and optimizing resource allocation, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
But the market is actually being prevented from accomplishing
this mission to some extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
When regulations stipulate that state-owned equity and the
institutionally-owned equity must constitute the majority share of
listed companies, the normal function of the stock market is
distorted, the economist explained.
</P>
<P>
Dong pointed out that in current practice, some investors are
given preferential price for the shares they acquire, which is
patently unfair, while the rigid control of the equity structure
of listed companies has actually stultified the original design of
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The majority shareholders in most listed companies are
governmental representatives, therefore the decision-making
procedure of those companies remain basically unchanged and so-
called shareholders' meetings, boards of directors and the
supervisory committees remain figureheads, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, money-losing listed companies feel no pressure to
better their management, he said, noting the fact that some listed
companies are heading to the bottom only half a year after
entering the stock market.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the declining financial condition of listed
companies, the number of those with the state and state firms
holding majority shares should be reduced, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
All businesses, regardless of their ownership structure, should
be entitled to equal treatment when being considered for listing,
the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not a firm should be floated on the stock market
should also be decided by securities changes according to their
performance, rather than being subject to a substantive approval
process handled by securities regulators, he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Advances into Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- American Andre Agassi roared into
the third round at Wimbledon tennis championships on Thursday when
he defeated Argentine Guillermo Canas 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old American, fresh from his triumph at the French
Open, cruised through his first round at the All England Club for
the loss of just six games.
</P>
<P>
Canas is not renowned as a grass-court player but he did reach
the quarter-finals of junior Wimbledon in 1995 and after an
uncertain start he put up more of a fight in the second set.
</P>
<P>
An early break gave him a 3-0 lead but Agassi, seeded fourth,
battled back to level the scores with some thunderous
groundstrokes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the points developed into long rallies from the
baseline which ideally suited Agassi's game and a brilliant
running forehand gave him the vital break before he duly took the
second set 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Canas' serve simply lacked the power to trouble Agassi and the
Argentinian found return after return flying past him.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, Wimbledon champion in 1992, broke serve to earn a 3-2
lead and although Canas then saved three break points to keep the
match alive, it merely delayed the inevitable with Agassi breaking
serve again in the final game to complete a straightforward win.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three-times champion Boris Becker thrilled a
Wimbledon center court crowd and taught 15th seed Nicolas Kiefer a
lesson by beating his fellow German 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to move into the
third round.
</P>
<P>
Bad blood between the two -- dating back to when Kiefer left a
squad run by Becker -- turned the contest into a needle match and
the 31-year-old, with his serve in tremendous form, crushed the
upstart 10 years his junior.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great feeling to be back on centre court -- it
brought out the best in me," Becker said.
</P>
<P>
"I played perfect grasscourt tennis. It almost felt like I had
won the tournament but unfortunately it was only the second round.
"
</P>
<P>
Becker next meets Lleyton Hewitt after the Australian teenager
beat Morocco's Karim Alami 6-1, 6-4, 4-6 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The men's favourites continued untroubled with former Wimbledon
champion Richard Krajicek enjoying straight-sets wins.
</P>
<P>
He was joined in the third round by U.S. Open champion and
second seed Pat Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, seeded fifth, was equally unforgiving against
Australian doubles specialist Todd Woodbridge, winning 7-5, 6-4,6-
4.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Pat Rafter eased through with a 6-2, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2
win over his friend and doubles partner Jonas Bjorkman on Court
One.
</P>
<P>
Home favourite Tim Henman was first out on center court to
finish off his match against American Chris Woodruff which was
halted by fading light on Wednesday with the Briton one set up and
trailing 3-2 in the second.
</P>
<P>
Henman, the sixth seed, won the first six games when the pair
resumed on Thursday to sew up the second set and lead 2-0 in the
third before he faltered to lose service.
</P>
<P>
The set then went to a tiebreak which Henman won 7-4.
</P>
<P>
Henman goes forward to a third-round clash on Friday with
Sebastien Grosjean, runner-up at the Lipton Championships in
Florida this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's finalist Goran Ivanisevic saved six set points in a
first-set tiebreak before beating Australian qualifier Sandon
Stolle 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. The Croat now meets Dutchman Paul
Haarhuis.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Todd Martin of the United States beat Czech Jiri
Novak 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 while Brazilian former French Open champion
Gustavo Kuerten, who had never won a grasscourt match before this
week, continued his good run with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over
German David Prinosil.

Krajicek, seeded fifth, was equally unforgiving against
Australian doubles specialist Todd Woodbridge, winning 7-5, 6-4,6-
4.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Pat Rafter eased through with a 6-2, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2
win over his friend and doubles partner Jonas Bjorkman on Court
One.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Sanchez Vicario, winner of four Grand Slam titles,and
Hingis had been seeded to meet in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Hingis's conqueror, 16-year-old Australian qualifier Jelena
Dokic, survived another round with a hard-fought 6-0, 4-6, 8-6 win
over Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The top quarter of the women's draw now looks strangely
depleted, with Mary Pierce and French compatriot Julie Halard-
Decugis the only remaining seeds.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, never at her happiest on grass despite two
appearances in the final here, accepted defeat with good grace.
</P>
<P>
"I think that she played better than me," she said of the 37th-
ranked Raymond. "I made a lot of errors and that cost me the match.
"
</P>
<P>
Raymond plays Conchita Martinez who must fancy her chances of
repeating her 1994 triumph here after collecting her second
straight-sets win, 6-4, 6-1 over American Tara Snyder.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Pierce had an equally comfortable win,dispatching
Italy's Rita Grande 6-1, 6-3 but Halard-Decugis, the 11th seed,
had to work a bit harder to defeat another Italian,Silvia Farina,
6-2, 3-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Jana Novotna had to save six breakpoints at
3-1 up in the second set against Austrian Sylvia Plischke before
getting through to the third round with a 6-3, 6-1 win.The Czech
fifth seed meets Spaniard Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open and Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport, the third
seed,will face Laura Golarsa of Italy after beating another Slovak,
Karina Habsudova, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, home favourite Tim Henman was first out on
centre court to finish off his match against American Chris
Woodruff which was halted by fading light on Wednesday with the
Briton one set up and trailing 3-2 in the second.
</P>
<P>
Henman, the sixth seed, won the first six games when the pair
resumed on Thursday to sew up the second set and lead 2-0 in the
third before he faltered to lose service.
</P>
<P>
The set then went to a tiebreak which Henman won 7-4.
</P>
<P>
Henman goes forward to a third-round clash on Friday with
Sebastien Grosjean, runner-up at the Lipton Championships in
Florida this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's finalist Goran Ivanisevic saved six set points in a
first-set tiebreak before beating Australian qualifier Sandon
Stolle 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. The Croat now meets Dutchman Paul
Haarhuis.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Todd Martin of the United States beat Czech Jiri
Novak 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 while Brazilian former French Open champion
Gustavo Kuerten, who had never won a grasscourt match before this
week, continued his good run with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over
German David Prinosil.

<HEADLINE> Tongchuan Makes Pot 5.8 M Tall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tongchuan City in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province has made a pot 5.8 m in height and 3.9 m in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
The pot, known as China's No.1 big pot, has become a new
tourist attraction as it stands in front of the Yaozhouyao museum
in the city. It is a replica of a celadon pot dating back to the
Song Dynasty (960 - 1279), but is 30 times larger, according to a
local source.
</P>
<P>
The pot has come to be a symbol of Yaozhou porcelain, a famous
kind of ceramics originally made in Tongchuan. Both the original
pot and the replica are made of this kind of porcelain,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
One amusing characteristic of the original pot is that the pot
lid cannot be separated from the body. Water is poured in through
a plum blossom-shaped aperture on the pot's bottom, but, curiously,
water will not flow out when the pot is stood upright.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 3-Year Extended Fund Facility Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Thursday approved a three-year credit totaling 512
million U.S. dollars for Peru under the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) to support the government's economic reform program for
1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
The government of Peru intends to treat the EFF credit as
precautionary, and will only draw it if adverse external
circumstances make it necessary, the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
EFF is an IMF financing facility that supports medium-term
programs that seek to overcome balance of payments difficulties
stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural programs.
The repayment terms are 10 years with a grace period of four and a
half years, and the interest rate, adjusted weekly, is currently
about 3.34 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
"Directors welcomed the authorities' overall strong record of
prudent economic management in the face of a number of external
shocks that adversely affected economic performance in 1998 and
early 1999. Based on continued timely policy adjustment, the
program for 1999 assumes that a recovery will gradually build
momentum in the course of the year," said Stanley Fischer, IMF's
First Deputy Managing Director.
</P>
<P>
The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in Peru slowed
to 0.7 percent in 1998 from 7.2 percent in the previous year. The
IMF estimated the growth of real GDP will increase to 3-4 percent
this year, and further rise to 5.5 percent in 2000 and 6 percent
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> ADR Market Rebounds During First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) market made a recovery in many emerging market economies,
particularly those in Asia, Citibank said in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said there is a significant rise in both trading
volumes and new capital raisings, indicating that U.S. investors
regained their appetite for ADRs during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Overall, ADR projected the total dollar value of ADR trading
during the first xis months of this year will post an 18 percent
increase, from 272.3 billion U.S. dollars to 320.7 billion
dollars, and total number of shares traded will rise 31 percent,
from 6.7 billion dollars to 8.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar value of capital raised via new ADR
offerings soared 66 percent from 4.2 billion dollars during the
first half of 1998 to 7 billion dollars during the first half of
1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Companies from emerging markets continued to be most active,
accounting for 71 percent of capital raised through ADR offering
in the first half, the report said, adding that during the first
half of last year, emerging market issuers accounted for 48
percent of capital raised via ADRs and on a regional basis,
Asia/Pacific-based companies raised 4.7 billion dollars via ADRs,
or 68 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Asia has turned the corner, and Latin American
appears to have stabilized, we're seeing a significant increase in
cross-border trading of ADRs, driven in large part by interest in
the emerging market," said Kurt Schneiber, Citibank's Global
Managing Director for Depositary Receipts. "This supports our
long-term view -- good, high-quality companies, wherever they are
located, will always be attractive to knowledgeable investors."
</P>
<P>
The report said Korea Telecom's 2.5 billion dollars offering
this year set the record for the largest ADR capital raising. This
is significant considering Korea's economy was among those most
severely affected during Asia's dramatic economic downturn of
1997-1998, it added.
</P>
<P>
Three other major ADR capital raisings also came out of Korea
during the first half, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Sanchez-Vicario Falls to Raymond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario became the
second women's seed to be knocked out at Wimbledon when she was
beaten 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 in the second round by American Lisa Raymond
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Spanish seventh seed, who reached successive
finals in 1995 and 1996 only to lose each time to Steffi Graf,
followed top seed Martina Hingis out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of errors and that cost me the match," Sanchez-
Vicario said.
</P>
<P>
"I am a little bit disappointed but I think that she played
better than me."
</P>
<P>
The last time that Sanchez Vicario made such a brief
contribution to a Grand Slam was at Wimbledon in 1992 when she
lost in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Since then she has appeared in 10 finals at the big four
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
On Wimbledon's court two, aptly known as the "graveyard of
champions", the 27-year-old looked a shadow of her former self.
</P>
<P>
Mistake followed mistake as Raymond, ranked 37th in the world,
won the crucial points and took the tiebreak 7-4.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario began the second set in style, holding serve to
love, but it was the only service game she was to win for the rest
of the match.
</P>
<P>
A backhand error cost her the break in the fifth game and two
games later she put a forehand long on match point.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old American now meets another Spanish ex-champion,
Conchita Martinez, winner here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Australian teenage sensition Jelena Dokic was made to work hard
for a third round place, finally overcoming Katarina Studenikova 6-
0, 4-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Following her win over Martina Hingis, Dokic began superbly,
taking the first set in 23 minutes with some accurate
groundstrokes and sublime drop shots.
</P>
<P>
After no initial signs of fatigue from her famous triumph,
Dokic found herself pegged back by the dogged Slovakian.
</P>
<P>
Calling on all her reserves of energy, Dokic came through a
frantic final set that saw five consecutive breaks.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Mary Pierce booked her third round passage with a
straight sets victory over Rita Grande.
</P>
<P>
The French star held the upper hand throughout with aggressive
strokes from the back of the court and Grande's wily finesse had
little effect.
</P>
<P>
Grande took a while to settle down and by the time she was on
top of her game, Pierce had the match in the bag.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who attracted big crowds out on Court Three, eventually
wrapped things up with a 6-1, 6-3 scoreline.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Lindsay Davenport took just 44 minutes to dismiss
Slovakia's world number 68 Karina Habsudova.
</P>
<P>
With both players firmly rooted on the baseline, Davenport
broke serve in the first and third games.
</P>
<P>
Habsudova hit back but Davenport was in no mood to be denied
and broke again and held on for the set.
</P>
<P>
Two early breaks in the second put Davenport firmly in control
and she eased to a 6-2, 6-2 win. She will play Italy's Laura
Golarsa next.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
Thursday as the bond market slid and scattered warnings of
weakness in second-quarter earnings were issued.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 132.03 at
10,534.83, the fourth straight decline for the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 17.28 at 1,315.78 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
index fell 44.13 at 2,553.99.
</P>
<P>
The continuing slide of the bond market pushed the 30-year
Treasury bond yield to 6.16 percent today from 6.11 percent
Wednesday. The rising yield of bonds presented investors with an
attractive alternative to stocks.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also worried about corporate earnings weakness
in the second quarter. Semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices
expected its second-quarter loss to be far worse that analysts had
expected. Goodyear, a component of the Dow index, also said its
second-quarter profits will fall well below analysts's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 6.78 at 623.97 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 2.01 at 769.15. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 3.88 at 443.16.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,988 down, 953 up and 589
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 691.00 million shares from 723.43
