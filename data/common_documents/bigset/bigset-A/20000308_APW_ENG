<HEADLINE> Replacement Oscar Ballots Mailed  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A replacement batch of more than
4,000 Oscar ballots was mailed out Tuesday night after a mix-up at
the post office prevented voters from getting their valuable
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in the mail now, said U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman
Terri Bouffiou.
</P>
<P>
   A week after mailing the ballots, tucked in business envelopes
with 33-cent, first-class postage, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences learned on Tuesday members still hadn't received
them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials then discovered postal workers mistakenly thought the
letters were third-class because they were dropped off in canvas
bags, which typically are for bulk mailings. A new batch was picked
up and mailed on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The March 21 deadline for returning ballots will remain in
effect, leaving plenty of time to count them in advance of the
awards ceremony five days later, said John Pavlik, spokesman for
the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The second batch of 4,200 ballots should be delivered Wednesday
to Academy members in Southern California and by Thursday to
Northern California members, according to the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will still give members a week-and-a-half to fill it out
and mail it back, so that should be plenty of time,'' Pavlik said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,400 ballots mailed Feb. 23 to out-of-state and
out-of-country Academy members were unaffected by the mix-up.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Postmaster Kerry Wolny received the new ballots in
person Tuesday night at the Academy's Wilshire Boulevard office in
Beverly Hills and they were mailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a feeling that they will be treated beautifully,''
Pavlik said.
</P>
<P>
   The original Oscar mailing had been treated with considerable
fanfare by the Oscar people, who invite the news media to witness
the annual ritual at the Academy's offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy will invalidate the original ballots. The new ones
will come with a yellow return envelope, as opposed to the
originals' white envelope.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid similar problems in the future, the Postal Service will
recommend sending a letter carrier to the annual mailing ritual and
taking the ballots directly to the post office, Bouffiou said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots have been lost by the post office before. In 1982,
nominating ballots were mistakenly stuck into a bin marked for
nonpriority bulk mail. They were found in time.

<HEADLINE> Bush Helped by Core GOP Support  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush relied on his core of support
from Republicans and conservatives to overwhelm John McCain's
backing from moderates, independents and crossover Democrats in
many regions, exit polls found.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the voters in the Republican primaries Tuesday saw
Bush as the candidate who could win in November. But the Texas
governor still was unable to expand his base of support outside the
party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's overall message played well in New England, but his
gamble of criticizing conservative Christian leaders may have
backfired in some key states.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and New York, more than a third of voters in the
Republican primaries said McCain's criticism of the religious
leaders affected their votes, and they went for Bush by a margin of
3-to-1, according to the exit polls conducted for The Associated
Press and television networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   And more than a third of voters in the Republican primaries said
they had an unfavorable opinion of McCain -- ranging from almost
half in Georgia to about a fifth in Massachusetts. Just over a
fourth said that about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''McCain's just too nervous and excitable,'' said Joe O'Connor,
a Bush voter from Kansas City, Mo. ''There's no telling what that
man might do if he were to become president.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Al Gore got strong backing from
Democrats, voters who liked his experience, his leadership skills
and his proposed health care plans. Bill Bradley made health care
the centerpiece of his campaign, but voters preferred Gore's more
modest plan by a 3-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain split the vote among those who said
personal qualities were most important, four in 10 said issues were
most important and they went for Bush by almost 2-1. Bush led among
those who thought moral values and taxes were the top issues, while
he and McCain split the voters who thought Social Security was the
most important. Six in 10 of the voters in the GOP primaries said
Bush's views on issues were about right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked George W. because I saw him as more attuned and a
little more measured and temperate in his actions and his views,''
said George Applegate, 71, of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   McCain severely criticized Bush for visiting South Carolina's
Bob Jones University -- which has a history of anti-Catholic views,
and had a stronger showing among Roman Catholic voters in some
states.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush divided the Catholic vote in New York and Maine
while Bush easily won the Protestant vote in those states. McCain
narrowly won the Catholic vote in Connecticut, where he and Bush
split Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator's loud complaints about the conduct of the
Bush campaign caused him problems.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were about evenly split on whether McCain attacked Bush
unfairly nationally, while a majority thought Bush did not attack
McCain unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think Bush is sticking more to the facts,'' said Bill
Fogg, 51, of Waitsfield, N.Y. ''He's not getting into personal
issues. I think he has a calmer demeanor than McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Among McCain's vulnerabilities:
</P>
<P>
   --Four of 10 said McCain says one thing but does another in the
area of campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   --A third of voters in Republican primaries said he was not
conservative enough. Among self-described Republicans, the number
ranged from a third in California to more than half who felt that
way in Georgia and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was unable to paint Bush as too conservative: No more
than a fifth of self-described Republicans saw Bush in that light
in any state, and the rate was usually about one in 10.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's vulnerabilities:
</P>
<P>
   --A fourth of Republican voters said they worried that Bush
doesn't know enough to serve effectively as president.
</P>
<P>
   --A third of McCain voters said they would back Gore if he ran
against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There were regional differences in the GOP vote, with McCain's
message resonating more loudly in New England, where only one in 10
voters described themselves as conservative Christians. Just over
four in 10 voters in that region said they were conservative and
they gave Bush a narrow edge.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Gore led Bradley among liberals, moderates and conservatives.
Four of five voters in the Democratic primaries had a favorable
view of Gore, while about two-thirds felt that way about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 thought Gore was about right on the issues
ideologically while about half felt that way about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Four of five voters in the Democratic primary approved of the
job done by President Clinton and that group went for Gore by
almost 3-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased with the Clinton regime,'' said Gene Broussard, a
49-year-old Democrat from Baltimore who voted for Gore. ''The
economy is really good right now ... I guess it's a matter of
keeping things going in the same direction. You know what they say,
don't fix it if it's not broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 10,486 voters in the Democratic
primaries and 12,009 voters in the Republican primaries at
precincts in states across the country holding primaries Tuesday.
The margins of sampling error was plus or minus 1.5 percentage
points for Democrats and 1 percentage point for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven states were surveyed: California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Rhode
Island and Vermont.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Curtis Joseph made 33 saves as the
Toronto beat the Edmonton Oilers 2-0 on Tuesday night, the Maple
Leafs' seventh victory in their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who signed with Toronto as a free agent before last
season after three years with the Oilers, has four shutouts this
season and 26 in his 11-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Tie Domi and Yanic Perreault scored first-period goals for
Toronto. Defenseman Dmitry Yushkevich assisted on both goals.
</P>
<P>
   Domi opened the scoring 3:44 into the game, banging a rebound
into an open side after goalie Tommy Salo came out to stop
Yushkevich's shot.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault scored with 6:04 left in the period, deflecting
Yushkevich's point shot over Salo's glove hand with six seconds
left on Toronto's first power play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph was at his best in the second period when Edmonton
outshot Toronto 10-3. In the third period, the Maple Leafs goalie
stopped Ethan Moreau's one-timer from close range.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto moved five points ahead of second-place Ottawa in the
Northeast Division, and closed within five points of Eastern
Conference-leading New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton is tied with Colorado for the Northwest Division lead.
The Avalanche beat Calgary 8-3 on Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Subway Derails; 3 Killed  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two subway trains carrying more than 1,500
rush-hour commuters collided when one of the trains derailed
Wednesday, killing three people and injuring more than 30 others.
</P>
<P>
   The impact sheared off the wall of one of the train's rear cars,
ripping out the cushioned seats. Buckled metal and other debris
littered the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a huge lump of metal penetrating my car, and everybody
was panicking,'' a 21-year-old commuter told national broadcaster
NHK. ''Many passengers were collapsing.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, said
spokesman Ryuichi Kinoshita of the Tokyo Rapid Transit Authority.
An initial press report blamed the accident on an explosion, but
officials -- including the prime minister -- quickly denied that.
</P>
<P>
   There were 240 passengers on the train that derailed, and 1,300
on the oncoming train that hit it, the fire department estimated.
One of three passengers in critical condition died in a hospital
hours after the accident. A man and a woman were killed in the
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Sachie Uehara, a subway spokeswoman, said the derailed train was
moving at less than 25 mph. The other train was reducing its speed
before arriving at the station, and was probably traveling at a
similar speed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said two of the dead -- a man in his 50s and a woman in her
20s -- were in the car at the end of the derailed train. Two cars in
the midsection of the sideswiped train were also heavily damaged,
with their sides torn off and interiors exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Most injured passengers were riding in the last car of the
derailed train and the third and fourth cars of the inbound train,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the morning accident, hundreds of curious
people crowded around the site near the opening of a tunnel or
peered at the wreck from rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off the busy thoroughfare near Nakameguro
station in western Tokyo, causing a massive traffic jam. Hundreds
of workers in hardhats and yellow jackets swarmed around the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo News agency reported that the train had been derailed by
an explosion inside one of the cars. But Tadao Ando, an official
with the Cabinet's Crisis Management Office, said there was no
evidence of sabotage or any criminal act in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi also denied an explosion was
involved, Kyodo News agency reported. Obuchi's Cabinet set up a
task force to deal with the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters who stopped to look at the wreckage expressed alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable,'' said Katsuo Yoshida, a 50-year-old
company worker. ''I'm worried that there will be more serious
accidents as computers are relied on more heavily in the train
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Service was soon resumed on some parts of the subway line, but
throughout the morning tens of thousands of passengers were
directed to use other trains or buses to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was believed to be the worst in Tokyo since late
1988, when a train rammed into the rear of another stopped at a
station during rush-hour, killing two and injuring 92. In May 1991,
a crowded tourist train slammed head-on into a local train in
western Japan, killing 42 people and injuring 415.

<HEADLINE> Gore's New York supporters cheer victory  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying a vigorous primary season has only made
their candidate stronger, New York supporters of Vice President Al
Gore cheered his lopsided Super Tuesday victory and looked forward
to the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Raysor, a union organizer for DC 1707 representing 25,000
day care workers, was exhausted from 17 hours of campaign
activities -- starting at 5 a.m. But she conceded her work was
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore's issues are what we do every day with our families.
His issues are our issues -- child care, health care, fighting to
not get Medicaid privatized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president's message has been resonating,'' said
federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who celebrated with Gore
backers at the carpenters union headquarters in Manhattan. ''He's
getting stronger as a candidate. As Gore gets stronger, the
Republicans are getting weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The 200 Gore supporters cheered when CNN announced Gore had
swept Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From New York to Georgia to Ohio, the vice president defeated
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a one-time Knicks superstar.
Leading with 60 percent of the vote or more in some states, Gore
was also bidding for victory in California, the biggest prize on
the busiest night of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Gore beat Bradley by a 2-1 margin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''You beat Bill Bradley in his own back yard,'' Cuomo told the
crowd. ''No one was expecting it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff thanked the crowd on her
father's behalf and said: ''He has one message: This is the best
campaign team ever. Because of your hard work and your efforts, Al
Gore has won the New York primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Union support was key to Gore's victory in New York. Dennis
Hughes, president of the state AFL-CIO, said his federation passed
out 1 million pieces of Gore literature at work sites around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have a movement, thank God, of the size we have in
New York state, we really make a difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a great victory,'' said carpenters union head
Michael Forde. ''This New York City district council is going to
take Al Gore all the way to the presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 8, Flames 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Ray Bourque made an instant impact on
the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman, acquired after 21 seasons with the Boston
Bruins, had an assist in his Colorado debut Tuesday night as the
Avalanche had their largest offensive output of the season in an
8-3 victory over the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic had three goals, Stephane Yelle scored twice and Chris
Drury had four assists for the Avalanche, 5-0 against Calgary this
season. Colorado has outscored the Flames 27-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche moved four points ahead of Calgary in the Western
Conference and into a tie with the Edmonton Oilers for the
Northwest Division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk were acquired Monday as part
of a five-player deal with Boston, where Bourque had spent his
entire NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a long day of travel, Bourque showed no signs of
fatigue. He logged a game-high 20 minutes and finished plus-four.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, paired on defense with Adam Foote, sat out the third
period for precautionary reasons with a slight groin strain. He is
expected to play Friday night at Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Deadmarsh, Dave Reid and Milan Hejduk also scored for the
Avalanche, who have won three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Valeri Bure, Andreas Johansson, and Jason Wiemer had goals for
the Flames, who had their five game unbeaten streak come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Also snapped were the scoring streaks of Jarome Iginla and Marc
Savard, which ended at 16 and 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado broke open a 3-3 tie in the second period scoring four
unanswered goals.
</P>
<P>
   Drury set up Reid at 5:07 and then Yelle's second at 7:53 made
it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, the NHL's career top scoring defenseman, picked up his
first Colorado point -- combining with Alex Tanguay to set up Hejduk
at 10:40.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic completed the second-period scoring by beating Grant Fuhr,
on in relief of Fred Brathwaite, from a bad angle with seven
seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr's first appearance since Dec. 15th lasted less than 10
minutes. After facing just three shots, Brathwaite returned for the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   After Bure's 35th on the power-play gave Calgary a 1-0 lead at
4:15 of the first, the Avalanche stormed back with three goals in
the span of a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Yelle tied it at 9:13, swiping the puck under Brathwaite, as the
center was being knocked to the ice by Flames defenseman Darryl
Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took the lead 31 seconds later when Deadmarsh whacked
in Peter Forsberg's rebound from close-in.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche made it three goals on three shots when Sakic
scored for the first time.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 101, Mavericks 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP)-- Ruben Patterson scored a season-high 32 points
Tuesday night as the Seattle SuperSonics overcame the ejection of
Gary Payton and defeated the Dallas Mavericks 101-86.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was ejected for his second technical foul late in the
third period. But the Sonics never missed their All-Star guard
because Patterson took over down the stretch. Payton had 19 points,
nine assists and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson scored 16 points in the fourth quarter as the Sonics
pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley had 31 points for the Mavs and Dirk Nowitzki
added 22. Mavs lost their fifth straight game and fell to the
Sonics for the eighth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was 6-of-9 in the fourth quarter. He also finished
with five steals and eight rebounds as the Sonics began a favorable
part of their schedule at home. Counting Tuesday's game, the Sonics
play 10 of their next 11 at Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd of 13,261 came to see Dennis Rodman. He had 15
rebounds and two points in 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was called for his fifth foul with 54.7 seconds left in
the third quarter and was nailed for his second technical foul and
ejected with Seattle ahead 72-64.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks missed a chance to cut the deficit. Nowitzki
missed the technical free throw and Rodman was called for an
offensive foul, nullifying Finley's basket.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker countered with two free throws for a 74-64 lead after
three periods.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas made a 19-6 run during the third period, trimming a 61-42
deficit to 67-61 with 3:28 left in the period on Erick Strickland's
3-point shot. Finley and Strickland led the comeback with six
points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was brilliant in the opening half with 17 points, seven
assists and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks give up the most points in the league and the
Sonics had plenty of easy shots in rolling to a 57-38 halftime
lead. Seattle shot 52 percent (24-for-46) while the Mavericks
converted just 15-of-44.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics built their biggest lead during the first half when
Payton was resting. He sat out 5:10 in the second quarter, when the
Sonics stretched their advantage from 16 to 22 points. Emanual
Davis hit three consecutive baskets putting the Sonics up 53-31.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics took command early. The Mavericks led only once by
two points. The most noise came when fans rose to their feet when
Rodman attempted two free throws with 1:42 left in the half. Fans
booed Rodman, who waved his hands, encouraging the fans to yell
louder. He made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Vernon Maxwell was put on the active roster Tuesday
after spending 29 games on the injured list after he had
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Jan. 7. ...The Sonics
beat the Mavericks for the eighth straight time overall. ...The
Mavs are 4-9 since Rodman joined the team on Feb. 9. ...Don Nelson
is sick with the flu and missed his fourth straight game. Donn
Nelson Jr. ran the team in his father's absence. ... Earvin
''Magic'' Johnson attended the game and sat at courtside with
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.

<HEADLINE> Texas Withdraws From Hawaii Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The University of Texas officially backed out of
its scheduled season-opener against Hawaii on Tuesday, explaining
that the move was in the best interest of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will pay Hawaii a $100,000 fee for canceling the Sept. 2
game, which leaves the Rainbow Warriors with two open dates in
September. Hawaii is off Sept. 16, and has another opening Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry this didn't work out and for any inconvenience it
causes Hawaii and our fans who had looked forward to the trip,''
Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii coach June Jones has said the Longhorns are ''afraid'' to
play the Rainbow Warriors. Hawaii finished 9-4 last season,
including an Oahu Bowl victory, after going 0-12 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is I think they just don't want to play us.
They got an opportunity to get beat and nothing to gain,'' Jones
said. ''We'll find somebody that wants to play us that isn't
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown dismissed Jones' statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hawaii should be very proud of their program,'' Brown said.
''None of that is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and athletic director Hugh Yoshida have contacted a dozen
schools, but have not found a replacement yet.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii planned to charge a $5 premium fee on each ticket for the
Texas game. If Aloha Stadium's 50,000 seats sold out, that would
have generated an extra $250,000 in revenue for Hawaii.

Bush Rises To Vanquish McCain
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- George W. Bush accelerated his drive to the Republican
presidential nomination Tuesday, winning California, New York and five other
primaries as he rose to vanquish John McCain. Praising his insurgent challenger,
the Texas governor said, ''Soon our party will unite and turn to the main task
at hand --ending the era of Clinton-Gore.'' McCain won four states Tuesday but
none beyond independent-minded New England. The Arizona senator said he was
going home to consider his fate and an aide said he could quit the race as soon
as Thursday. If so, it would end a campaign that had ignited enormous interest
in the GOP primaries.

Gore Clears Way to Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore cleared his way to the Democratic presidential
nomination with a Super Tuesday primary sweep that pushed Bill Bradley to the
brink of withdrawal. ''We need to build on our record of prosperity,'' the vice
president said, turning his focus toward November. ''He won, I lost,'' said
Bradley, all but conceding his challenge was over after losing contests from
Maine to California. Two Democratic party officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said campaign aides had told them the former New Jersey senator
planned to depart the race on Thursday. Gore won in New England, Georgia, Ohio
and several stops in between, regularly gaining 60 percent of the vote or more.

Calif. Approves Gay Marriage Ban

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Californians rejected gay marriage Tuesday, approving a
ballot measure that prohibits the state from recognizing same-sex marriages
legally performed in any other state. Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service
for The Associated Press and television networks showed Proposition 22 passing
with strong support from both men and women and from voters of all races and
income groups. Democrats opposed it by 2-1 but Republicans backed it by about
6-1. ''It's a victory for California families,'' said Robert Glazier, spokesman
for the Yes-on-22 campaign.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Keyes got a surprising second-place finish in
Minnesota's GOP straw poll, but finished in single digits in most of Tuesday's
Republican presidential contests. In the straw poll, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
got about two-thirds of the vote, and Keyes was second, with McCain a few points
behind Outside of his performance in Minnesota, Keyes' strongest finish was in
his home state of Maryland where he picked up roughly 7 percent of the vote.

Tokyo Subway Derails; 3 Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two subway trains carrying more than 1,500 rush-hour commuters
collided when one of the trains derailed Wednesday, killing three people and
injuring more than 30 others. The impact sheared off the wall of one of the
train's rear cars, ripping out the cushioned seats. Buckled metal and other
debris littered the scene. ''I saw a huge lump of metal penetrating my car, and
everybody was panicking,'' a 21-year-old commuter told national broadcaster NHK.
''Many passengers were collapsing.'' There were 240 passengers on the train that
derailed, and 1,300 on the oncoming train that hit it, the fire department
estimated.

Arafat, Barak Discuss Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat met late Tuesday to consider a U.S. plan to restart the
stalled peace process. The plan involves a new timetable for achieving a
permanent peace by September, said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the senior Palestinian
negotiator. It was not clear after the meeting ended whether Arafat or Barak had
accepted the proposal. Peace negotiations broke down last month after
Palestinians rejected Israel's plans for its latest army pullback in the West
Bank. That caused the two sides to miss a Feb. 13 deadline to draw up the
framework of a final peace agreement.

Patterson took over down the stretch. Payton had 19 points, nine assists and
eight rebounds. Michael Finley had 31 points for the Mavs and Dirk Nowitzki
added 22.

<HEADLINE> N.C. District Unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Race played too great a factor in drawing a
congressional district, a three-judge federal panel ruled Tuesday
in a decision that could delay the May congressional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, the judges determined the 12th District,
covering 90 miles from Charlotte to Greensboro along Interstate 85,
is illegal and must be redrawn. The 1st District, which covers
portions of eastern North Carolina, was upheld by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st and 12th Districts elected North Carolina's first black
congressional representative in a century in 1992, when the
districts were first drawn in efforts to bolster minority
representation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, following a four-day trial in November, makes it
uncertain whether the May 2 congressional primaries will be held as
planned. The current congressional districts -- drawn in 1997 -- will
have to be re-adjusted so that a new 12th District can meet the
panel's approval, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means that the North Carolina Legislature has to go back
into special session within a short period of time and draw a new
plan in order to hold our primary election,'' Attorney General Mike
Easley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1998 congressional primaries also were delayed for four
months after the identical 12th District boundaries at issue in the
trial were rejected by a similar three-judge panel. A new filing
period for candidates had to be held under the new boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson Everett, the Duke University law professor who filed
the lawsuit challenging the 1st and 12th Districts, was pleased
with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial proved that the racial motivation was the
predominant factor,'' Everett said Tuesday night. ''Hopefully, the
Legislature will come up with something in its place ... so they
won't have to try to repeat this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who challenged the districts' makeup over the past
decade, has argued repeatedly that the two districts were drawn
primarily to elect blacks.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys and legislative leaders have said race was only
one of the factors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court, which heard earlier challenges to the
districts in 1993 and 1996, ordered the three-judge panel last year
to hear the case because the justices said the panel lacked enough
information when it declared in 1998 that race played too
predominant a role in the 12th District boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 plan left the 1st District with just over 50 percent
black voters, and the 12th with 47 percent. When a three-judge
panel declared the 12th District unconstitutional in 1997, the
Legislature had to quickly adopt new boundaries used only for the
1998 election. The 1997 boundaries remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic State Sen. Roy Cooper, who was the chief architect of
the 1997 congressional redistricting effort, said Tuesday night
that the decision likely will mean the state will have to readopt
the 1998 boundaries, which the panel has upheld in the past. If the
General Assembly does not create new boundaries, the panel will.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th District drawn in 1997 is represented by Rep. Melvin
Watt, D-N.C. The First is represented by Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C.

<HEADLINE> Former Attorney General Levi Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Edward Levi, the U.S. attorney general who helped
rebuild a Justice Department crippled by the Watergate scandal,
died Tuesday after a seven-year battle with Alzheimer's disease. He
was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Levi had risen through the ranks to become president of the
University of Chicago when he was tapped as attorney general. He
served in the post from 1975-77.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I assumed the presidency in August 1974, it was essential
that a new attorney general be appointed who would restore
integrity and competence to the Department of Justice,'' former
President Ford told University of Chicago officials Monday. ''Ed
Levi, with his outstanding academic and administrative record at
the University of Chicago, was a perfect choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi had taught at the University of Chicago Law School,
becoming dean in 1950. He was named the university's provost in
1962 and served as president from 1968 to 1975. He was the first
Jewish leader of a major U.S. university, the school said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During his time as president, student protests reached a high,
culminating in a 1975 takeover of the school's administration
building. Levi was praised for his evenhanded response to the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wisdom, wit, a quiet grace and a tireless willingness to
strive for excellence have seldom been combined in such measure in
one individual,'' U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens
recently said of Levi.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago on June 16, 1911, Edward Levi was the son and
grandson of rabbis. He graduated from the University of Chicago in
1932 and received his law degree from the school in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he worked as a special assistant in the
U.S. attorney general's office. In 1945, he returned to Chicago as
a law professor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Levi wrote ''An Introduction to Legal Reasoning,''
which argued that legal institutions develop an internal logic that
is consistent but also adaptable to change.
</P>
<P>
   Levi held numerous leadership positions in national civic
groups. He argued for civilian control of nuclear energy and in
1945 advised the group that founded the Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He served on President Johnson's task force on education from
1966 to 1967 and on President Nixon's task force on higher
education from 1969 to 1970. He was elected president of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He was a trustee of at least nine national foundations and held
honorary degrees from 26 colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be private, and arrangements were pending
on a memorial service at the university.

<HEADLINE> Bradley fans unfazed by defeat  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Bradley's resounding loss to Vice President
Al Gore in Super Tuesday's races did little to quiet a celebration
by about 1,000 Bradley supporters, who partied in a midtown
Manhattan ballroom and said their candidate gave them hope for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley renewed my faith in politics, and his ideas have rung
a bell for millions of Americans,'' said Joe Orsini, 42, a
Manhattan writer. ''Bill Bradley lives on in the hearts and minds
of many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Many deemed Gore a foe who was simply too rich, too strong and
too aggressive for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate, but this is what happens when you don't have
money or the support of the establishment,'' said Ezra Friedlander,
an investment banker from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Gore swept past Bradley in New York and other states, pushing
his rival to the brink of withdrawal in the Democratic presidential
campaign. The Bradley camp had considered New York a must-win state
for the former Knicks basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harlem's Real Deal Soul Band played loudly and supporters
swayed to the beat as they cheered ''Bradley, Bradley'' and ''Keep
running, man'' while Bradley worked his way through the crowd at
the Sheraton New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe history will write that we tried to change politics,
tried to restore trust,'' Bradley said Tuesday night. ''The fact
that we did not win this primary ... makes the goal no less
reachable. When nobody was talking about the 44 million Americans
without health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley thanked his team for its hard work and said he would
meet with campaign officials in the next few days to evaluate his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters, admitting they knew all along Bradley had
little chance to win, compared notes on what could have been done
differently.
</P>
<P>
   They said Bradley should have waged a more offensive campaign
instead of just parrying blows from his higher-profile opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wish he had answered Gore back initially when he
(Gore) became so negative,'' said Claire Houlihan, a homemaker and
mother of four from Allendale, N.J. ''But Bradley can certainly be
congratulated on a clean campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl David, a Manhattan lawyer, said Bradley was simply too
nice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley is a good person, and maybe he is too good,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Super Tuesday, polls showed Gore leading Bradley by
margins of up to 2-1 in New York just two months after the former
New Jersey senator looked as though he would give Gore a real run
in the state. But by the eve of the primary, even Bradley's biggest
New York supporters were all but conceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fought handsomely, gallantly and right to the end,'' Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said that after Gore went on the attack, ''frankly,
Bill was just too philosophical about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffi Karakashian, a law student from Middletown, N.J., said
media focus on the season's more sensational political candidates
squeezed Bradley out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really the fault of the press,'' said Karakashian, 23.
''There was way too much focus on (Arizona Sen. John) McCain,
especially after New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Rosenberg, a bakery owner from Manhattan, placed the
blame squarely on Bradley's campaign, saying, ''Lousy campaign
management, terrific candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Unions take credit for Al Gore victory in Bill Bradley's backyard  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Forests fell for handbills. Phone lines sizzled. Vice
President Al Gore's 2-1 victory over Bill Bradley came at the
calloused hands of unions representing 2.5 million New Yorkers and
they're reveling in it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're proud of the work we did,'' said state AFL-CIO President
Dennis Hughes at the carpenters' union hall in Manhattan on Tuesday
night, the scene of the Gore victory party.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have the movement -- thank God -- of the size we have
in New York state, we really make a difference. One of seven
AFL-CIO members nationally reside in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes estimated the state union spent $200,000 in its drive to
win Gore the state's Democratic presidential nomination. DC-37, the
New York City's largest municipal union, mailed more than 1 million
pieces of campaign literature in conjunction with the state
AFL-CIO, and made more than 250,000 phone calls to its 125,000
active members and 40,000 retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Eve, Gore's state campaign manager, credited union support
with making ''all of the difference in the world -- reaching out to
hundreds of thousands. Today they really turned it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Raysor, a union organizer for DC 1707 representing 25,000
day care workers, was limping from 17 hours of campaign activities
-- starting at 5 a.m. But she conceded her labor work was
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore's issues are what we do every day with our families.
His issues are our issues -- child care, health care, fighting to
not get Medicaid privatized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DC 1707 President Glenn Huff Sr. added, ''Al Gore is working
hard for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, said her 2,000 volunteers made more than 80,000 telephone
calls and got out 250,000 pieces of mail. Her union, representing
city school teachers and workers, was one of the first to endorse
Gore last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a great victory,'' said Michael Forde, president of
the New York District Council of Carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Yagid, who runs a business in the Garment District, said
too many clothing makers are sending work overseas, and she
expected Gore could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy's doing very well. I feel he (Gore) did an
excellent job as vice president on international issues, on
domestic issues,'' said Yagid.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Passes Ban on Gay Marriages  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Californians overwhelmingly banned gay
marriage, cracked down on juvenile crime and rejected an overhaul
of campaign financing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures were just some of the 20 social, political and
pocketbook proposals on the California ballot Tuesday. Voters also
reaffirmed their support for casino gambling on Indian land and
rejected an attempt to repeal the tobacco taxes championed by
director Rob Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 percent of precincts reporting, 1,009,656 voters, or 66
percent, supported the gay marriage ban, known as Proposition 22,
while 521,460 voters, or 34 percent, opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   California, like every other state, does not license gay
marriages. Proposition 22 bans recognition of gay marriages
performed in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ballot measures passed in Alaska and Hawaii in 1998, and
signatures are being gathered in Colorado and Nevada. But the
stakes, as always, seemed higher in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   The issue galvanized politicians and church leaders on both
sides, with each side claiming they were fighting for families.
Supporters raised about $8 million and opponents about $5.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22 was sponsored by Republican state Sen. Pete
Knight; the opponents included Knight's gay son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably it's my small town upbringing and the fact that I've
been going to church all my life,'' said Lewis Cain of Sacramento,
who voted for Proposition 22. ''It just seemed like the right thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner returned to the political theater to oppose the measure
that would have repealed the 50-cent-a-pack cigarette tax he
campaigned for in 1998. With 14 percent of precincts reporting, the
measure had 966,711 no votes, or 71 percent, and just 402,039 yes
votes, or 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The original tax -- designed to fund early childhood development
programs -- squeaked through, prompting cigarette retailer Ned
Roscoe to launch the repeal effort. However, the tobacco companies
failed to jump in and the campaign never grew.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the ballot was a second try at legalizing casinos on
Indian land. With 19 percent of precincts reporting, there were
1,071,630 yes votes, or 64 percent, to 609,740 no votes, or 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure passed in 1998 but was struck down as
unconstitutional. This time, the measure sought to amend the state
constitution in a version supporters hoped would stand up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Indian gambling was a hotly contested issue, with both
sides spending $88 million, the nation's costliest campaign ever.
This time around, the issue was quieter, with the two sides
spending around $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In another repeat performance, software millionaire Ron Unz, who
successfully campaigned against bilingual education in 1998, was
back on the ballot seeking to restrict campaign fund raising. His
measure, which sought to ban corporate campaign contributions,
limit other donations and provide partial public financing of
campaigns, won only 36 percent approval.
</P>
<P>
   Three measures dealt with punishment. One that passed was
sponsored by former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who proposed
letting prosecutors decide if teens ages 14 to 17 should be treated
as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a devastating blow to juveniles in California,'' said Kim
Mayoshi, who led the opposition. ''This initiative is going to push
thousands of nonviolent offenders into the criminal justice system
at the age of 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters also passed a measure extending the circumstances that
warrant the death penalty as well as one increasing the penalty for
second-degree murder to life in prison if the victim was a Bay Area
Rapid Transit or California State University peace officer.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed a measure making it easier to pass school
bonds was falling behind. But voters passed a measure providing $50
million in bonds to build homes for veterans, along with a pair of
environmental measures that spent $4 billion on expanding state
parks and preserving water quality.
</P>
<P>
   One proposition would have allowed votes for ''None of the
Above'' in federal and state elections. The measure lost by a
substantial margin.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court says Crime Victims Board can't take Gravano's money  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The state Crime Victims Board cannot prevent a
former mob hitman from making money on a book about his crimes, an
appellate court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the New York Appellate Division ruled 5-0 that the
state's ''Son of Sam Law'' does not give the victims board the
authority to seize book proceeds owed to Salvatore ''Sammy the
Bull'' Gravano because the law does not apply to the federal crimes
to which he pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The law was meant to prevent criminals from profiting from their
illegal acts. But the court said Tuesday that the statute applies
only to criminals convicted of state felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, whose testimony helped nail organized crime boss John
Gotti, pleaded guilty to a federal racketeering charge in 1994 and
was sentenced to five years in prison. He admitted taking part in
19 killings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Gravano signed a deal with author Peter Maas to write a
book about his criminal career. Maas and his agent struck a
subsequent deal with HarperCollins to publish the book and with
20th Century Fox to do a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The 308-page book, ''Underboss,'' became a bestseller after its
1997 publication. The title refers to Gravano's rank as the No. 2
man -- after Gotti -- in the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   The victims board tried to force Gravano; Maas; Maas' company,
T.J.M. Productions Inc.; HarperCollins; and Maas' agent,
International Creative Management, to turn over all money owed to
Gravano for the book.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court said the victims board ''has not shown
that the statutory language encompasses any offense other than a
state felony.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's lawyer, Larry H. Krantz, called the ruling ''correct''
and declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Dowd, who argued the appeal for Maas and
T.J.M., said, ''It's a wonderful decision for anyone who'll ever
put pen to paper.''
</P>
<P>
   He had argued that allowing the board to sue would have a
chilling effect on writing about crime.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Smirlock, the assistant attorney general who argued the
case for the victims board, said he did not immediately know if the
board would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division ruling noted that the current ''Son of
Sam Law,'' enacted in 1992, is the revised version of a similar
statute struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The first law was struck down for violating the First
Amendment's guarantee of free expression. It would have encompassed
Henry David Thoreau's ''Civil Disobedience'' and ''The
Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the court observed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the families of several of Gravano's victims have
filed civil wrongful death suits against the ex-mobster, who was
arrested again recently for his role in an Arizona drug trafficking
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kuby, a lawyer who represents a daughter of one of
Gravano's murder victims, said that unless the Appellate Division
decision is overturned, the ''victims' families will be utterly
without recourse.''

<HEADLINE> Floods Crush Mozambican Life  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOKWE, Mozambique (AP) -- Life, as Weselina Mavelope knew it, is
no more. The devastating floods that swept through her village
killed her eldest son, the family breadwinner. It swallowed her
home and all she owned.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mavelope, a widow approaching 60, her daughter-in-law and
her three grandchildren must cope without a male head of the
household -- a potentially crippling economic blow in this African
country's patriarchal farming communities. She has no other family
to support her.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just don't know what to do,'' she said weakly as she looked
for a food handout at a Mozambican Red Cross center in Chokwe, 125
miles north of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have lost everything -- my son, our home, our things. We
only have the clothes we are wearing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters that swept across this southeast African nation
one month ago and surged again two weeks later have ebbed, leaving
hundreds confirmed dead and 1 million people either homeless or in
desperate need of help.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of international relief organizations and at least 16
African and Western governments, including the United States, have
provided an estimated $103 million in aid. Still, Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano said $250 million will be needed to
rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
   For Mavelope, the thought of rebuilding is a daunting -- if not
altogether impossible -- task.
</P>
<P>
   She, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren sleep in the open
air, amid the mosquitoes and what remains of their garden. Their
mud-brick house, like those of her neighbors, was swept away,
leaving only a dark outline in the pale soil.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the family members go out scavenging for food in the
desolate, debris-strewn town. They gather in the evening to cook
the foraged scraps over a wood fire. Like most people here, they
have been drinking filthy floodwater, tainted by human remains and
animal carcasses, in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at our wits' end,'' Mavelope cried.
</P>
<P>
   Before the floods, Mavelope's eldest son worked their fields in
the rich alluvial soil of the Limpopo River valley, growing corn,
beans and vegetables they could barter for other goods at street
markets. But the family's crops and all their seeds were swept away
in the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Mavelope said she had seen many floods in her riverside village,
but the devastating torrent of water that slammed into Chokwe 10
days ago was unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   When the Limpopo waters began rapidly rising during the night,
Mavelope and her daughter-in-law heaved her sick, 40-year-old son,
onto the tin roof of their hut to keep him from the water.
</P>
<P>
   As the torrent engulfed the town, he was too heavy to carry away
-- and they were forced to flee without him, in what Mavelope says
was a chilling choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just had to run, there was nothing else we could do,'' she
said tearfully. ''We ran and ran as fast as we could but the water
came after us and caught us up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The family clambered up a tree on the edge of town as the water
rose. They spent two days on their perch.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, their home -- and Mavelope's son -- were gone.
His body has not been found, but Mavelope says she has no hope of
finding him alive.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers estimate that several hundred people, perhaps 500,
died in Chokwe, a town of 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-and-white tractor chugs through the silted-choked
streets, pulling a trailer with body bags and leaving a sickening
stench.
</P>
<P>
   Muddy brown water marks on the walls of houses show the flood
crest reached more than 6{ feet high. A dead goat lies in the
scorching sun on Chokwe's main street, one of its hind legs still
tethered.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Madalena, an Italian charity worker who has lived in
Chokwe for five years and is helping out at a makeshift medical
center in the local Catholic church, says the floods have reduced
the lives of the people in this town to ''virtually zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a sudden, violent thing. There's a massive job
ahead to put these lives back together,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airplanes Helping in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAQUALANE, Mozambique (AP) -- Toiling under the tropical sun,
aid workers erected tents, toilets and a water purification plant
as a massive aid camp took shape around an estimated 40,000
residents in waiting -- victims of Mozambique's floods.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of food were doled out, and although its distribution
appeared chaotic, vast numbers of people were being fed.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish soldiers, part of a 150-member force, swiftly erected a
field hospital, complete with operating area. Two Spanish and four
British helicopters flew in supplies and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The camp, about 90 miles northeast of the capital, Maputo, is
one of the largest of 72 camps set up to accommodate an estimated
250,000 people displaced by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs Tuesday that a multinational relief
effort for this impoverished southeast African country was finally
starting to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   The main road linking Maputo to the flood-stricken town of
Chokwe, 125 miles to the north, was reopened to light vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In Maputo, the entry of the U.S. military mission was marked by
the arrival of the mission commander, Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph
Werhle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. planes flew over flood-stricken areas on Tuesday, beaming
back live video images of marooned people and demolished terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered by a specially equipped Hercules C-130
was to be passed on to aid agencies to help them plan relief
efforts, Air Force Col. Gary Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Five other cargo planes ferried supplies from South Africa's
Hoedspruit air base to Maputo and the central Mozambican city of
Beira.
</P>
<P>
   The aid will be stockpiled there until helicopters can transport
it to isolated regions. The first two U.S. helicopters arrived at
Hoedspruit on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters that swept across Mozambique a month ago and
surged again two weeks ago have ebbed, leaving hundreds confirmed
dead and almost 1 million people homeless or in desperate need of
help.
</P>
<P>
   Werhle brushed aside suggestions that the United States had been
tardy in launching its aid effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration authorized military involvement in
the relief operation last week, after consulting with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We moved out as quick as we got the word,'' Werhle said.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 U.S. troops were deployed in the region by Tuesday
afternoon. Up to 600 were expected to participate in the mission.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 Western and African governments and scores of
international relief organizations have provided an estimated $103
million in aid.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers welcomed the U.S. forces, saying they were needed
to help transport tons of food aid arriving daily at the Maputo
airport.
</P>
<P>
   With no radar, one runway and phones that work only on occasion,
the dilapidated airport is barely handling the planes and
helicopters carrying out the massive airlift.
</P>
<P>
   Landings and takeoffs have multiplied fivefold since the aid
effort began in earnest. The airstrip is inundated with 260
takeoffs and landings each day.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they all come back it can get scary sometimes,'' said
Njama Bakara, the chief air traffic controller.
</P>
<P>
   Six helicopters and sixteen planes, ranging from a huge Libyan
cargo jet to a single-engine Cessna owned by Nazarene Mission
Aviation, jammed the broiling, narrow tarmac on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're stretched, but we are coping,'' Bakara said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the shipments of maize, beans and other food had
reached 350,000 Mozambicans, said Namanga Ngongi, a World Food
Program official. But 300,000 flood victims in more isolated areas
had not yet been fed, Ngongi said.
</P>
<P>
   While a feared cholera epidemic has not come to pass, tens of
thousands of Mozambicans have contracted malaria from the swarms of
mosquitos breeding in the floodwaters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said it planned to start an immunization
campaign to battle waterborne diseases.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Voter Thinking  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A look at voter thinking Tuesday, according to interviews at
polling places conducted by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   --THE BIG PICTURE: Texas Gov. George W. Bush rode strong support
from women, the religious right, voters without college degrees and
Republicans. Arizona Sen. John McCain won the votes of
independents, crossover Democrats, liberals and people who think
abortion should be legal.
</P>
<P>
   --CRUCIAL QUALITIES: Bush won huge majorities of voters looking
for a candidate who can win in November or who best represents
conservative values. McCain won among voters who were looking for
someone who is not a typical politician or someone who stands up
for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   --RELIGIOUS RIGHT: In California, New York and Ohio, McCain's
attacks on some Christian conservatives appeared to hurt him. Those
who said his comments affected their vote somewhat or a great deal
overwhelmingly favored Bush. Those who said McCain's comments
didn't matter preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
   --ROMAN CATHOLICS: McCain, who severely criticized Bush for
visiting anti-Catholic Bob Jones University, had a stronger showing
among Roman Catholic voters. In New England, he won both Catholics
and Protestants, but took Catholics by a wider margin. In New York,
he won Catholics, but Bush took Protestants. In California and
Missouri, Bush won the Catholic vote, but not as overwhelmingly as
he took the Protestant vote.
</P>
<P>
   --IN NOVEMBER: Democrat Al Gore would fare better if Bush, rather
than McCain, were the Republican nominee, voters said. About 16
percent of Republican voters said they would support Gore vs. Bush.
But just 10 percent said they would vote for Gore if he were
running against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   --SMARTS: About one in four voters said Bush did not have the
knowledge needed to serve effectively as president, and in some
states it was much higher -- more than 40 percent in Massachusetts
and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   --TAXES VS. SOCIAL SECURITY: Bush was the winner among those who
thought cutting taxes was more important than strengthening Social
Security. McCain won those who preferred Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   IN NEW ENGLAND:
</P>
<P>
   --Demographics: McCain won among men and women and in every age
and education group. He took all but the poorest voters.
</P>
<P>
   --Party breakout: Nearly half the voters were independents, and
McCain took 70 percent of those votes. Bush won Republicans, but it
was closer. McCain won liberals and moderates; Bush took
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   --Religious right: Bush took most of their votes, but just 10
percent of New England voters consider themselves Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   IN CALIFORNIA:
</P>
<P>
   --Veterans: Although considered a strength for McCain, veterans
preferred Bush by nearly 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   --Religious right: Nearly 20 percent of voters said they were
Christian conservatives, and nearly three-quarters of them went for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --Social Security vs. tax cuts: McCain generally wins votes among
voters who say it's more important to preserve Social Security than
to cut taxes, but not in California, where they divided them. Bush
took the tax-cutters by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   --Conservative enough?: One-third of Republican voters said
McCain is not conservative enough. Just 10 percent said the same
about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --Gay marriage: Voters who favored a proposition banning same-sex
marriages were most likely to support Bush, followed by McCain.
Those against the proposition went for Gore, followed by McCain and
then Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   IN NEW YORK:
</P>
<P>
   --Demographics: McCain did best among the best educated and
wealthiest voters.
</P>
<P>
   --Veterans: Bush and McCain split the veteran vote.
</P>
<P>
   --Philosophy: McCain won the moderates and liberals; Bush took
the conservatives, who made up half of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   --Religion: Bush took a solid majority of Protestants and a
majority of Catholics but he lost the small Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   --Abortion: McCain won those who say abortion should be legal all
or most of the time. Bush took the anti-abortion vote.
</P>
<P>
   --Decision time: McCain did well among voters who made up their
minds in the last week, except for those who waited until Election
Day; they went for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ELSEWHERE:
</P>
<P>
   --In Ohio, independents strongly favored McCain, but they
accounted for only about one in five voters. And some seven in 10
Republicans preferred Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --In Georgia, more than a fourth of voters said they were
Christian conservatives, and they went for Bush by an 8-to-1
margin. Others also supported Bush, though by a closer margin.
</P>
<P>
   --In Maryland, 90 percent of voters were Republicans, and they
overwhelmingly preferred Bush. McCain took the independent vote,
but it was too small to help him.
</P>
<P>
   --In Missouri, McCain had the edge among the one-fourth of voters
who had never voted in a GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   --DEMOGRAPHICS: Al Gore won every income, education and age
group, but Bradley did best with the most educated voters and the
richest -- those earning more than $100,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   --CORE DEMOCRATS: Blacks and Hispanics preferred Gore over
Bradley by 8-to-1 margins, and Gore was winning 3-1 among union
households. He also won a solid majority of the most liberal and
the most conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   --IN NOVEMBER: Just under 10 percent of Democratic voters would
cross over and vote for Bush if he is Gore's opponent in the fall.
But twice as many would vote for McCain over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --GOP VIEWS: About half of Democratic voters had a favorable view
of McCain, but only about one in six did of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --HEALTH CARE: Bradley made health care the centerpiece of his
campaign, but more than four in 10 voters said Gore's more modest
plan was better and about three in 10 said they were about the
same.
</P>
<P>
   --CLINTON BACKLASH: Voters who disapproved of Clinton, both in
his job and as a person, were more likely to vote for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   --ISSUES: Bradley won among those who cared most about campaign
finance reform. But Gore was the solid winner in every other
category, including issues that Bradley campaigned on: health care,
race relations and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   --QUALITIES: Bradley did well among those looking for someone
with new ideas and who is not a typical politician -- but not many
people said that was the most important quality. Most Democrats
were interested in someone who is a strong leader and has the right
experience -- and they overwhelmingly favored Gore. Those who wanted
someone who stands up for what he believes favored Gore, but more
narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The exit polling was conducted by Voter News Service, a
consortium of the AP and television networks. Eleven states were
surveyed: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The results are based on interviews with 13,156 Republican
voters and 11,422 Democratic voters leaving precincts. The margin
of sampling error was plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, larger
for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Study Launched On UN Peace Efforts  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked
international experts to look at U.N. peacekeeping failures and
determine what went wrong so the world body can improve prospects
for peace in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member panel will cast a critical eye on past and
present U.N. peace efforts and make recommendations by July, Annan
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the report in the hands of world leaders this summer so
they can read it before arriving here for the Millennium Summit in
September, which is expected to help shape the role of the United
Nations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a clear set of recommendations on how to do better in
future in the whole range of U.N. activities in the area of peace
and security,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the panel looks at ''the quality of the
mandates we get -- which have to be clear and achievable -- the sort
of resources the member states put up to back these operations, and
the will of the member states'' to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general said the study was ''propelled forward
much faster'' by recent highly critical reports he commissioned of
the U.N. role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the 1995 fall of
Srebrenica -- when Annan headed the U.N. peacekeeping department.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was accused of ignoring evidence that a
genocide was planned in Rwanda and of abandoning the Rwandan people
when it was under way. It was accused of failing to help save
thousands of Bosnian Muslims from a Serb massacre in Srebrenica
because of errors and misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   The reports also faulted the Security Council for not giving
these missions appropriate mandates and the resources to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Former Algerian Foreign Minister Lakhdar Brahimi, who was named
to head the panel, said the United Nations faces the perennial
problems of a shortage of money and opposition from governments to
risking the lives of their soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it bears repeating that if you want the United Nations
to do a job, this is what is required. And I think this is what the
panel is going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A related serious problem is that the Security Council
authorizes peacekeeping missions without the money or manpower to
carry them out, he said. And another major issue is ''the staying
power of the international community,'' which starts peacekeeping
missions enthusiastically but gets diverted to other crises, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important question really is that the United Nations,
with all its component parts, needs to approach the question of
peace and security with the willpower and the determination to
start well and to stay on with the job until it is done,'' Brahimi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the panel will look at peace efforts ranging from
conflict prevention to military intervention and will study ''the
nuts and bolts'' of getting the planning, organization and command
of U.N. peace operations right.
</P>
<P>
   It also will focus on the difficult issue of what to do when
circumstances change during a mission -- ''for instance if the peace
you are trying to keep breaks down and large numbers of civilians
are in danger of being massacred,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is great opposition among the United Nations' 188 member
states to a standing U.N. army, but Annan said the panel may look
at an agreement among Scandinavian countries, Canada and the
Netherlands to each identify ''a high-readiness brigade'' that
would be on standby for peacekeeping operations if the countries
decide to participate.
</P>
<P>
   With these brigades, he said, headquarters elements could be on
the ground in 48 hours and peacekeeping troops within a month --
which would be ''a major, major improvement'' on the four or five
months it now takes the United Nations to put troops on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is currently involved in 16 peacekeeping
operations from East Timor to Sierra Leone, each with a different
mandate from the U.N. Security Council. It also is taking part in
numerous diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing or resolving
conflicts, for example in Afghanistan and between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore win Connecticut primary  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore collected an easy
victory and insurgent Republican Sen. John McCain narrowly defeated
George W. Bush in Connecticut's presidential primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The elections drew a higher-than-usual turnout.
</P>
<P>
   With about 96 percent of precincts reporting, Gore led Bradley
55 percent to 42 percent. McCain led Bush 49 percent to 46 percent.
Alan Keyes ran a distant third with 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling conducted for The Associated Press and television
networks by Voter News Service found Gore leading in almost every
part of the state except along the coast, where Bradley may have
benefited from his former career as a New York Knicks basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew support from moderates and previously unaffiliated
voters who registered Republican before the primary. But even in
GOP strongholds such as Fairfield County, McCain led Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never played on his Connecticut roots: His father, former
President Bush, was a student at Yale University in New Haven when
the future Texas governor was born July 6, 1946. His grandfather,
Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut from 1952 to
1963.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush largely ignored the state -- with its relatively paltry
25 GOP convention delegates, all of whom will go to McCain -- in
favor of larger prey in California, New York and Ohio. His only
recent visit to Connecticut was a brief airport rally Saturday in
Windsor Locks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke Friday at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, in
what initially appeared would be competing appearances at Roman
Catholic universities in that city. But Bush canceled a speech at
Fairfield University, citing a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCain held a fund-raiser in Greenwich and spoke at
the Metro Hartford Chamber of Commerce. He appeared at Yale in
December.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also drew support from Connecticut's wealthy Indian
tribes. A group of executives of the Mashantucket Pequots and
Foxwoods Resort Casino donated at least $20,900 to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is in his third term as senator from Arizona, is a
past chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. He remains a
member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had the backing of the state's Democratic leaders and spoke
at the state party's annual fund-raising dinner on Feb. 19.
Bradley's backers were irked that he was not invited.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Hartford early on the morning after the New
Hampshire primary, and visited the state in mid-February and again
on Thursday. His wife, Ernestine, visited Wesleyan University on
Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairman Ed Marcus lauded the efforts of town
chairmen and labor unions who supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a victory that was achieved with almost no money being
spent,'' he said Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's voting mirrored that of Massachusetts and Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   With just 67 delegates to the Democratic Party convention,
Connecticut did not draw the attention either party gave to larger
states.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said turnout appeared
to be running higher than the 20 percent seen previously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there's been a very lively debate both on the
Republican side and the Democratic side, I think that generated a
lot of interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican turnout was somewhat higher, she said, probably
because that race was considered more closely contested.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout appeared highest in Fairfield County, which Bysiewicz
attributed to the campaigns' high visibility in nearby New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was also heavier in the 16 cities and towns that had
town committee primaries, including West Haven, Windsor and
Newington.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters affiliated with one of the major parties could vote
Tuesday. Voters seemed more influenced by emotion than by issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor, 51, of Hartford cast his ballot at the West End
Fire Station. He said he was voting for Gore mainly because he
likes him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has more experience than Bradley and he's helped President
Clinton get the country in great shape,'' said the 51-year-old
sanitation worker.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Parker, 71, of Hartford, a retired church secretary who
also voted at the fire station, said she chose for Gore ''because
he's straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley's OK, but I like the way Gore backed up the president
during all that trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Joe Pizzella, 36, a marketing manager who cast his
ballot at the school in the affluent neighborhood, said he simply
liked Bush better than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush just seems presidential in appearance and the way he
speaks,'' Pizzella said. ''I think he would be a refreshing
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Norton, 69, a Republican who worked as an insurance manager
before retiring, said she thinks Bush will make a dependable
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for him even though even though I disagree with him on
abortion,'' she said. ''I'm not sure McCain is stable; I always get
the feeling he's about to blow, even when he's smiling.''

<HEADLINE> Web Site for Farmers in Development  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Berks County dairy farmer David Bitler makes
most of his money selling milk and cows domestically. Occasionally,
he supplements his income by selling the purebred Holsteins to
buyers in Argentina, Brazil, Israel, Egypt, China and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So Bitler is enthusiastic about a Web site under development at
St. Joseph's University that could help him and other Pennsylvania
farmers export more of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always looking for something else, because milk prices
are really bad right now,'' said Bitler, of Fleetwood. ''That would
be of great interest to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will identify global export opportunities for
Pennsylvania's farmers, especially small to midsize operations.
Organizers promise it will be comprehensive, quick-loading and easy
to use.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's received a $325,000 grant from the state Department
of Agriculture for the project, dubbed ''Pennsylvania Feeds the
World.'' The site is supposed to be in operation by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're enabling small Pennsylvania farmers to connect to the
global economy, and that's an exciting idea,'' said Nancy M.
Childs, associate professor of food marketing and head of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Childs and her team are poring over government data to identify
expanding markets for products such as apples, poultry, dairy, even
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania farmers exported $930 million worth of food and
timber in 1998, according to the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers are outside the
borders of the United States, and our producers have clearly looked
at that as a market opportunity,'' said Russell Redding, deputy
agriculture secretary for marketing, promotion and program
services.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're trying to do is provide an opportunity for small to
midsize companies to take advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site will not only help farmers sell their products, it will
also identify the risks in each of the foreign markets. In Russia,
for example, there is a big demand for food. But a farmer exporting
crops there might not get paid, Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   John Schwartz, director of the Lancaster County extension, said
the new Web site should have no problem finding an audience because
many Pennsylvania farmers have embraced the Internet in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys have their own chat rooms. They're chatting all
across the country,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has a name, but state officials aren't releasing it
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the state's perspective, this is a fairly inexpensive
mechanism to empower farmers and it should have an attractive
payoff in terms of exports created,'' Childs said.

<HEADLINE> Troops Not Warned on Faulty Suits  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army and Air Force leaders concede they didn't
warn their troops not to use potentially flawed chemical-protective
suits until weeks after the Pentagon had urged them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the services confirm that soldiers and airmen did not
get the full story until after a news report brought the problem to
public light. Still, it is unclear even now how widely the warning
has spread among U.S. forces deployed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, the Defense Logistics Agency told all the military
services' logistics offices not to use suits from two suspect lots
in any real emergency. But it was not until Feb. 28, the day after
The Associated Press reported that many of the suits contained
holes and tears and the contractor had been charged with fraud,
that the message went beyond the logistics offices.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of the problem's scope were troops at Army and Air Force
bases who, the Pentagon inspector general says, could have been
killed wearing faulty suits during a gas or germ attack.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Friday did the DLA send a memo to four-star generals
and admirals on every continent, the Army and Air Force chiefs and
others -- as opposed to logistics offices. The latest memo provides
more detailed information on what items to set aside and whom to
call with questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 warning said 1989 and 1992 lots of ''battle dress
overgarments'' made by Isratex Inc. of New York City should be
removed from the active inventory. An alert last December to the
same logistics offices had mentioned only the 1992 lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force didn't tell air bases around the world that either
lot was defective until the day after the story broke, said Maj.
Donna Nicholas, an Air Force spokeswoman. The Army had told its
soldiers about the 1992 lot but not about the 1989 lot, because
Army headquarters didn't get the Feb. 3 memo and they first learned
about it in news reports, said Army spokeswoman Nancy Ray.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Matt O'Neal, said sailors and Marines have
their own protective suits and none are made by Isratex.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 lot has not been proven defective, it was
pulled along with the 1992 lot and is considered suspect because of
the company that made it, DLA and inspector general officials have
said. All told, the company provided 780,000 suits to the military
at a cost of $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas said officials at Air Force headquarters never got the
December message. And she said the Feb. 3 warning was sent to the
wrong Air Force location and wasn't received by headquarters until
Feb. 15. Nearly two more weeks then passed before the Air Force
issued a warning memo Feb. 28, the day after the AP story.
</P>
<P>
   The belated Feb. 28 memo was sent not to field units such as air
bases in Korea or the Middle East but to the supply offices of
major commands and to Air Force centers that store such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The service telephoned ''high-threat'' places such as Korea to
notify them of the problem suits, Nicholas said, though she could
not document such contacts nor say precisely when they occurred.
She called it ''coincidence'' that the service's warning came soon
after the press report.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army warned the field about 1992 lots, headquarters
never got the Feb. 3 memo on the 1989 lot, Ray said. She and others
said the news stories alerted officials to the 1989 lot and that on
Feb. 28, numerous phone calls were made to warn units from Georgia
to Germany about both lots.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Larry Barker, responsible for chemical gear for the 85,000
troops in the 18th Airborne Corps, said the first time he heard
about the 1989 lot being a potential problem was Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1994, Pentagon officials have conceded they knew
that Isratex was being investigated for allegedly selling inferior
products with the intent to defraud the military. Eventually, five
different Isratex contracts were included in an indictment against
the company. Last September, company officials pleaded guilty to
various charges in federal court in New York. Sentencing is set for
April.
</P>
<P>
   After tests in September showed flaws on suits from the 1992 lot
were more serious than previously believed, the Defense Logistics
Agency issued the Dec. 2 warning to 18 logistics offices. The
December warning cited only the 1992 deal but said all suits ''that
are connected with/manufactured by subject contractor be used for
TRAINING ONLY!''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 memo went out to the same recipients. This time it
said both the 1989 and 1992 lots ''have been tested and identified
as being unsuitable as chemical protective suits.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no deadline for action in either memo, but both
requested ''widest possible dissemination of this document.''

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs More Airport Funds  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates of greater federal investment in the
nation's airports won a belated but big victory with congressional
approval of a bill authorizing $40 billion in spending over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration bill also allows airports to
increase passenger fees, increases flights out of New York, Chicago
and Washington airports and acts to make smaller market airports
more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is important ''because it affects every airport
in this country. It affects air passenger service. It affects
safety,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who
helped House and Senate negotiators overcome their final
differences on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences have lingered since last fall, leaving the FAA
without an authorization bill since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1
and forcing a delay in federal funding for new airport projects.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the Clinton
administration was pleased with the compromise. ''We are going to
get about 95 percent of what we proposed, which is very, very
good,'' he said. He mentioned money for safety and security,
modernization of air traffic control, expanded capacity and the
viability of smaller airports.
</P>
<P>
   David Plavin, president of the Airports Council International,
noted that the number of air passengers in the United States is
expected to jump from about 650 million this year to more than a
billion in 2011. The bill ''lets airports make the investment they
are going to need to make to keep up with this. ... It's a really
major achievement,'' Plavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation authorizes $12.7 billion for aviation programs
in fiscal 2001, an increase of $2.7 billion over this year. It
would also allow airports to raise passenger taxes from the current
ceiling of $3 per person to $4.50, a boost that could give airports
another $700 million annually for improvements if all enacted the
raise.
</P>
<P>
   While the compromise is expected to win wide support when it
comes before the Senate today and the House in the coming days,
some Appropriations Committee lawmakers, who decide how the budget
is going to be spent, raised objections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said he would vote against it because the increased
spending ''will either come at the expense of other important
domestic programs or diminish our ability to use the surplus to
reduce the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   His chairman on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, also refused to sign off on the compromise until
language was removed that he said gave the House a veto over any
Senate effort to reduce spending below certain levels.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the compromise, Rep Bud Shuster, R-Pa., the House
Transportation Committee chairman, won a guarantee that spending on
airport projects every year would at least equal money coming into
the Aviation Trust Fund plus interest. The trust fund takes in
about $10 billion every year in user fees, and Shuster has
complained about money from the fund being diverted into the
general budget for nonaviation uses.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would eliminate the ''high-density rule'' established
in 1969 to limit flights out of New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia
and Chicago's O'Hare airports. The limits would end at the New York
airports in 2007 and at Chicago in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Slots -- one slot is a landing or takeoff -- at Washington's
Ronald Reagan National Airport would be increased by 24, with 12
reserved for flights beyond the 1,250-mile ''perimeter rule'' in
place since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Study: State Teacher Tests Vary  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   State tests for would-be teachers can effectively measure basic
knowledge, but tell little about whether a person will be any good
at teaching, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council, a nonprofit, independent council
that advises the government, was asked by the Education Department
to investigate how the various states evaluate would-be teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The council found the tests varied so greatly that any
state-to-state comparison would be meaningless. It also recommended
further study of why minorities get lower test results.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen educators and testing experts conducted the two-year,
$1.08 million study, released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study reinforces what we have found,'' said Terry Knecht
Dozier, senior advisor on teaching to Education Secretary Richard
Riley. ''You cannot make interstate comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dozier noted that requiring states to report on how
prospective teachers fare on licensing exams ''is very critical
public information.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 federal law requires teacher colleges that receive
federal financial aid to report how their graduates perform on
state licensing exams. Those that perform poorly could lose that
aid. The schools were to begin issuing their report cards in April,
but last month the Education Department postponed the program by a
year, saying it needed more time to create a uniform reporting
system.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one states require would-be teachers to pass at least one
licensing test, the study found. But the states vary widely in what
and how they tested, and what they considered good enough to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some states focused more on basic skills, others on knowledge of
a subject area, and others on knowledge of teaching practices.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust, a Washington-based group
that advocates improved student achievement and closing achievement
gaps, said the results raised questions about the value of the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed the disparity in minority test results on the
teaching schools turning them out. ''The question is whether the
education that the prospective minority teacher is getting is good
enough,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report was an interim finding. A report near the end
of the year will suggest how states might judge teachers'
performance in the classroom, Dozier said.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Bombing Convict Seeks Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh has asked a
federal judge for a new trial, saying his defense attorney during
his first hearing was more concerned with media attention and a
book he was writing about the case.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh contends Stephen Jones leaked inflammatory stories about
McVeigh to the media, including a purported confession from him.
McVeigh's new defense team filed a motion for appeal Tuesday in
U.S. District Court in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''Repeatedly, throughout the time that Stephen Jones represented
Mr. McVeigh, the mass media reported inflammatory stories based on
information supplied by the defense,'' attorney Dennis Hartley said
in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh's request portrays Jones, who is in private practice in
Enid, Okla., as media-obsessed and eager to promote a
foreign-terrorist theory because it was good fodder for his book.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ''Others Unknown: The Oklahoma City Bombing Case and
Conspiracy,'' was published in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jones denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attacks on former counsel are the price any lawyer pays when
he agrees to represent a defendant in a death case,'' he said.
''Personal and professional attacks -- no matter how false, untrue
and misleading -- are par for the course.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time McVeigh has appealed his conviction and
death sentence on murder and conspiracy charges in the April 19,
1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that killed
168 people. A year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear
arguments that his trial was tainted by jury misconduct and news
reports that he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, McVeigh accused Jones of promoting a
questionable theory about foreign terrorists to stoke interest in
his book about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal also contends Jones failed to disclose to McVeigh
that he was close friends with a family whose daughter was killed
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh also asked U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch, who
presided over his trial, to remove himself from consideration of
the request for a new trial because the judge has said Jones did a
good job.
</P>
<P>
   Co-defendant Terry Nichols received a life sentence after being
convicted of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy for his role
in the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Study Boosts Drug for Heart Patients  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A drug shown to have saved the lives of heart
failure patients can also ease their symptoms and reduce
hospitalizations, researchers reported today in an international
study of 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved an extended-release form of metoprolol, a
type of medicine known as a beta blocker. Beta blockers help reduce
the heart's workload.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers reported in June that metoprolol reduced deaths by
34 percent in heart failure patients. Their analysis of additional
benefits appears in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Heart failure involves a damaged or overworked heart that cannot
pump efficiently. It afflicts an estimated 4.8 million Americans
and is a leading cause of hospitalization. Heart failure caused
45,419 deaths in 1997, the latest available figures, according to
the heart association. The symptoms often include breathlessness
and swelling in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional treatment includes diuretics to reduce fluid
buildup and drugs called ACE inhibitors to dilate blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in today's study could quell long-standing concerns
that beta blockers worsen heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this and other recent studies, the American Heart
Association is updating its heart failure treatment guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It had previously urged ''considerable caution'' in the use of
beta blockers but will now recommend them for most heart failure
patients, said Dr. Sharon Hunt, a Stanford University cardiologist
and chairwoman of the updating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Metoprolol, sold in the United States under the brand name
Toprol XL, is made by AstraZeneca, which funded the study. It is
awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval for use in heart
failure. Only one beta blocker has such approval: carvedilol, which
is marketed as Coreg and made by SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
   Beta blockers have been used since the 1960s to treat high blood
pressure and some heart conditions. More recently they have been
recommended for heart attack survivors, but because they slow the
heart rate, concern arose that they could make heart failure worse.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Dr. Ake Hjalmarson of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in
Gothenburg, Sweden, researchers followed 3,991 heart failure
patients in the United States and 13 European countries for an
average of one year. All were taking conventional medication. About
half were also given metoprolol; the rest were given a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, there were significantly fewer deaths in
the metoprolol group.
</P>
<P>
   But there also were about a third fewer hospitalizations, and
symptoms improved in 28.6 percent of the beta-blocker group,
compared with 25.8 percent of the placebo group. More beta-blocker
patients also reported feeling better, 50 percent vs. 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney Goldstein, a co-author and a cardiologist at Henry
Ford Hospital in Detroit, said the results do not necessarily apply
to other beta blockers, though others also have been shown to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   A JAMA editorial said less than 30 percent of eligible patients
are being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come ... to initiate beta-blocker treatment in
the large number of patients with heart failure in need of this
therapy, which should both improve their quality of life and
increase its length,'' wrote Drs. Robert Califf and Christopher
O'Connor of Duke University.

<HEADLINE> ABC Wins 10th Week in a Row  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's getting wonderfully monotonous for ABC. The
network won the prime-time ratings race for the 10th week in a row
thanks to ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The five episodes that ABC aired easily were last week's five
most-watched programs. None drew less than 28 million viewers, and
Wednesday's edition had almost 32 million. No other program last
week was seen by more than 19 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nightly prayers of rival TV executives,
''Millionaire'' shows no signs of weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anything, it's getting stronger now that it's airing
against repeats,'' said Larry Hyams, chief of research at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that NBC's competing miniseries, ''The 10th
Kingdom,'' was a flop. None of the three episodes that aired last
week drew more than 11 million viewers. The continued ratings
weakness of NBA basketball is also siphoning off viewers for NBC on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's airing of the ''TV Guide Awards'' on Sunday proved the
public doesn't have an unlimited appetite for awards shows. It
ranked No. 72 for the week, weakening Fox on a night the network is
usually strong.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's ''Grapevine'' had a middling premiere Monday, drawing more
than 6 million fewer viewers than its lead-in, ''Everybody Loves
Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had a prime-time average of 16.6 million
viewers (10.9 rating, 18 share), CBS had 12.1 million viewers (8.5,
14), NBC had 10.8 million (7.5, 12) and Fox had 8.9 million (5.9,
9). UPN had 3.8 million viewers (2.6, 4), the WB was at 3.4 million
(2.5, 4) and Pax TV had 980,000 viewers (0.7, 1).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' averaged 11.2 million viewers last week
(8.3 rating, 17 share), edging ABC's ''World News Tonight,'' which
had 11 million viewers (8.1, 16). The ''CBS Evening News'' pulled
up the rear in the evening news competition with 8.7 million
viewers (6.7, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Feb. 28-March 5, the top 10 shows, their
networks and ratings were ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Wednesday), ABC, 20.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Tuesday), ABC, 20.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Monday),
ABC, 18.8; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 18.4;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Sunday), ABC, 17.5; ''60
Minutes,'' CBS, 13.9; ''Friends,'' NBC, 12.6; ''Law and Order,''
NBC, 12.5; ''The Drew Carey Show,'' ABC, 12.0; ''Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' CBS, 11.6.

<HEADLINE> Gore and Bush win big in New York  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
Bush, relying on the traditional power levers of New York politics,
have scored major victories in the state in their drives for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore -- turning to labor unions, minorities and his party's
elected officials -- all but buried Bill Bradley in Tuesday's New
York primary, an impressive victory on what had once been home
court for the former Knicks basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush relied on Gov. George Pataki and
New York's other Republican leaders to trump Sen. John McCain,
taking at least 65 of the 93 delegates at stake in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush scored victories all across the country in
the Super Tuesday primaries, leaving Bradley and McCain to ponder
whether there was any point to staying in the race.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's New York campaign was run by Pataki, McCain's
troops were a generally ragtag bunch led by Staten Island Borough
President Guy Molinari and U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long Island.
King delivered in a big way for McCain. Of the 15 delegates at
stake on Long Island, McCain won at least 12.
</P>
<P>
   Those Long Island losses cast further doubt on the political
future of the man who has long been the strongest local Republican
leader in the state, Nassau County GOP Chairman Joseph Mondello.
Last year, Democrats ended the decades-long Republican domination
of the Nassau County Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the victories from Maine to California were
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing,'' Gore said from
Tennessee where he watched favorable results stream in from all
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting in New York, Gore had
704,070 votes or 65 percent to 363,487 votes or 33 percent for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''He won, I lost,'' Bradley told supporters at a New York City
hotel. He promised to ''make my plans known shortly'' about whether
he would continue in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp had considered New York a must-win state.
</P>
<P>
   The New York victory was especially sweet for Gore, who finished
a disappointing third in New York's 1988 primary and then quickly
quit that year's presidential race. This time around, he had the
backing of almost all of the state's top elected Democrats and of
its politically powerful labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrats were electing 158 pledged delegates to
the Democratic National Convention with another 85 pledged
delegates to be selected later by party leaders based on the
primary's popular vote outcome.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans didn't vote directly for the candidates,
only for the prospective delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-primary polls had shown Bush and McCain running almost even
in New York even though most of the state's Republican luminaries,
including Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had
lined up behind the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the party organization delivered for Bush in most
areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But as is often the case in New York, local politics threatened
to overshadow the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before the primary, with Pataki launching harsh
attacks against McCain, Giuliani publicly refused to join in and
repeatedly said nice things about the senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday before the primary, Giuliani marched at Molinari's
side during a Staten Island parade as the former congressman handed
out McCain campaign promotions. The mayor, who is running for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, later joined Pataki at
an event promoting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki loyalists suggested Giuliani was more interested in
boosting his own electoral chances than in helping Bush, the mayor
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, Giuliani was openly suggesting that given
Bush's New York victory, Pataki would be a good choice for the
GOP's vice presidential slot.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Faces 72 Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Legal problems for Gen. Augusto Pinochet
have begun to mount at home amid a flurry of new lawsuits stemming
from alleged human rights abuses during his dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   With six new lawsuits filed Tuesday, Pinochet faces a total of
72 cases in Chile. He returned to Chile on Friday from his 16-month
detention in Britain, escaping attempts by a Spanish judge who
wanted to bring him to trial on charges of torture and torture
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent suit Tuesday was filed by Miria Contreras, a
former secretary to Marxist President Salvador Allende, who was
killed when Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras lost her 20-year-old son, Enrique Ropert, soon after
the Sept. 11, 1973, bombardment of the government palace where
Allende and others were posted.
</P>
<P>
   An official report by the civilian government that followed
Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship in 1990 reported Ropert was
arrested outside the palace on the day of the bombardment. The
report also found that 3,197 people were killed or disappeared
during Pinochet's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Ropert was described in the report as a militant socialist who
''was executed by agents of the state'' and his body found the same
month on a Santiago riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Caucoto, a lawyer in the case, said Ropert's ''wants a
complete clarification of what happened to her son, in what
circumstances he died and where they held him before assassinating
him,'' Caucoto told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Contreras was unable to claim her son's body
because she had gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Caucoto said he believed the lawsuit would help push for a
clarification of the violent period in which the military broke
with a century of democratic rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Caucoto is handling other cases against Pinochet, include one
relating to the killing or disappearance of former presidential
bodyguards and others seized at the palace during the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has hired a lawyer and retired army colonel, Gustavo
Collao, to represent him. He had no comment on the new lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, a government-sponsored dialogue involving
the military and human rights laws stalled amid rising tempers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for human rights groups expressed displeasure with the
military's public welcome for Pinochet as he arrived home from
London.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of all the armed branches personally welcomed Pinochet
at the airport when he descended from an air force plane and was
cheered by thousands of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue began six months ago amid efforts to locate the
remains of more than 1,000 dissidents unaccounted for after being
arrested under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman on Monday asked the Santiago Court of Appeals
to strip Pinochet, now 84, of immunity from prosecution, which he
enjoys as a senator-for-life. The post was created for him by his
regime. A decision and possible appeals could take weeks, even
months.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman is investigating another high-profile case known as ''the
caravan of death'' -- the killing and disappearance of 72 dissidents
in the days after the coup.

<HEADLINE> Super Tuesday Deflates TV Networks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the networks, it was more like Flat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Super Tuesday came to an end, networks rapidly shifted focus
to the fall campaign, with perhaps a little wistfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game is really over,'' Fox News Channel's Brit Hume
declared after his network proclaimed George W. Bush the winner
over John McCain in the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that March 7 is living up to its billing as the
decisive night in the race for president,'' CNN's John King agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The networks all but declared McCain and Democratic challenger
Bill Bradley dead before polls closed in most of the 16 primary
states. Actual results only confirmed that, leaving pundits
deflated after the past month's unpredictable roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   Television's political competition again was left largely to the
cable networks. Broadcasters essentially covered the 16-state
primary election in brief updates.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore's victory over Bradley was so decisive that
it cost him airtime. Cable networks overwhelmingly concentrated on
the Bush-McCain fight. CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel all cut away
from Gore's victory speech faster than they did for Bush's two
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Networks adhered to a commitment not to divulge what they knew
from exit polls before voting stopped in individual states -- at
least technically. It wasn't hard to read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have always known that it was an uphill battle,'' Anne
Thompson said from McCain headquarters at 6:10 p.m. EST on MSNBC.
''That uphill battle has never looked steeper than tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson used the same line reporting on NBC's ''Nightly News''
20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far there is nothing to contradict last week's polls
indicating this would be a very good day for George Bush and Al
Gore,'' ABC's Peter Jennings said at the opening of ''World News
Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters struggled to avoid referring to the McCain campaign in
the past tense, though King noted McCain had slipped and done this
himself.
</P>
<P>
   During prime-time, ABC, CBS and NBC stuck to brief, hurried
reports that lasted barely a minute or two. ABC even preceded one
Jennings report by informing viewers that ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' would soon be seen in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   That follows the pattern of the campaign, where broadcasters
have essentially ceded live political coverage to the cable news
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the lack of time had anything to do with it, Jennings
was briefly embarrassed when ABC flashed a graphic showing the New
York GOP primary race too close to call between Bush and Steve
Forbes. Forbes has been out of the campaign for a month.
</P>
<P>
   One of the night's busiest TV victory tours was held by
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson. He turned up,
triumphantly, on all the cable news networks when it became clear
McCain's attacks on him had backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it was going to destroy his campaign and I couldn't
understand why he did it,'' Robertson said on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   For now, television's political junkies seemed disappointed that
a few quiet months stretch out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's slim pickings for those of us who like our politics
exciting,'' said MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Enforce Gene Therapy Safety  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is preparing
to force better patient safety monitoring in the nation's 350 gene
therapy experiments -- conducting surprise inspections to make sure
scientists follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's move comes after an Arizona teen-ager died as a result
of a University of Pennsylvania gene therapy experiment, prompting
growing criticism that this promising but still-unproven field
receives little federal oversight to ensure the research is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations already require that researchers establish a
patient safety monitoring system before testing experimental
treatments. But the FDA acknowledged Tuesday it has not enforced
those rules for gene therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the Pennsylvania experiment, researchers didn't even
have a patient safety monitoring system, something the FDA
uncovered only when it inspected the research after Jesse
Gelsinger, 18, died, FDA gene therapy chief Dr. Kathryn Zoon said.
</P>
<P>
   Under FDA's new initiative, all gene therapy researchers must
appoint someone not directly involved with their experiments to
monitor patient safety. The monitors could consist of contract
research organizations or other scientists at a hospital or
university.
</P>
<P>
   These monitors are not truly independent since the gene
therapist hires them.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA pledged to ensure gene therapy monitors are working
and know that the law requires them to report patient safety
problems to the government -- and to conduct random, surprise
inspections to make sure.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments that don't comply can be halted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe these are important steps ... to ensure patient
safety,'' Zoon said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative sparked mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were supposed to be doing that already,'' said well-known
bioethicist George Annas, a Boston University professor of health
law. ''FDA has let this get out of hand. ... They don't inspire a
lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But another critic welcomed the change.
</P>
<P>
   ''The patient safety monitoring is the most important element
that's been missing in all of this,'' said Abbey Meyers, president
of the National Organization for Rare Disorders and a former
National Institutes of Health gene therapy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Today, gene therapists can conduct experiments for years without
anyone checking how their patients fared, she explained. So FDA
inspections are vital, but the agency lacks the money and people,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has got to give them the money to do this job
right,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA employs between 150 and 200 clinical trial inspectors,
but they never have been asked to judge patient-safety monitoring
in early-stage experiments, or to focus on gene therapy instead of
the many other types of human experiments now under way.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death is the only one so far blamed directly on gene
therapy, after experiments on some 5,000 patients in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this new field has not cured anyone yet. And the NIH has
discovered hundreds of adverse reactions patients suffered that
researchers delayed reporting to government experts who oversee the
experiments' safety.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some critics say gene experiments should temporarily be
halted until oversight is better established.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing a lot of premature human experimentation here
that's more trial-and-error than hypothesis testing,'' Annas said.
''This is very important research. I don't want to see it tarnished
in the public's view'' because it was done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the government announced it will bring together
the nation's most experienced gene therapists to debate how best to
ensure patient safety. And the FDA said it is preparing a new
regulation to force disclosure of serious side effects so the
public understands the risks.

<HEADLINE> Battier To Stay at Duke  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke junior forward Shane Battier, saying he
wants to keep speculation about his NBA future from distracting the
team during the NCAA tournament, said Tuesday night he would return
for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm staying,'' Battier said. ''I'm excited about the team next
year. I'm excited about getting my degree next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 Battier became a central figure for Duke this
season following the loss of underclassmen Elton Brand, Corey
Maggette and Will Avery to the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Battier, fourth in the ACC with a 17.1 scoring average, said
talk about last season's potential early departures was a
disruption during the Blue Devils' run to the NCAA title game.
</P>
<P>
   The focus ''wasn't on our team. It was on future prospects and
the summer,'' Battier said. ''So I don't want to take away from
this team, and I'm staying.''

<HEADLINE> CBS' McGuire To Stop Broadcasting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS basketball analyst Al McGuire is retiring
after 23 years of broadcasting, saying he no longer has the energy
or desire to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The former coach, who led Marquette to the 1977 NCAA title
before beginning a broadcasting career, told CBS he would miss the
NCAA men's basketball tournament because he is suffering from a
form of anemia.
</P>
<P>
   But McGuire, 71, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he
will be retiring from broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over. It's curtains. It's all she wrote,'' McGuire told
the newspaper in an interview published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former North Carolina and Los Angeles Lakers star James Worthy
will replace McGuire and team with play-by-play announcer Dick
Enberg on CBS's third team for the NCAA tourney, which opens March
16. McGuire also was scheduled to work the Southeastern Conference
tournament, but will be replaced by Bill Raftery.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said his condition isn't life-threatening, but saps his
energy, particularly at night. The arduous schedule of the NCAA
tournament -- which would require him to call four games on the
first day -- was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't feel on top of my game,'' McGuire said. ''I don't
remember getting old. How'd that happen?
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I just wasn't touching bases. And rather than milk it
and leave them short, I decided to wave the white flag.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire's last appearance on CBS was Sunday's Big Ten game
between Indiana and Wisconsin, alongside Enberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saturday night, he said he couldn't do it and he started to
cry,'' Enberg said Tuesday in New York. ''To say he's going to be
missed by those who know him and love him is an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire has been a CBS analyst for eight NCAA tournaments. He
was with NBC from 1977-92.
</P>
<P>
   ''In all of our lives, you meet certain people who are special
and he's one of those,'' said CBS lead analyst Billy Packer, who
also worked with McGuire at NBC. ''He will be missed not only in
this tournament but by anybody who got to know him.''

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Derrick Coleman scored 16 of Charlotte's
final 22 points as the Hornets beat the Golden State Warriors
102-99 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman finished with 34 points and 17 rebounds. He was 13-of-20
from the field and 8-of-8 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   The power forward was coming off a 26-point performance Sunday
in the Hornets' home victory over Chicago after missing three games
because of a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones added 19 points for the Hornets, and Elden Campbell
had 18.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes led the Warriors with 21 points, Donyell Marshall
added 19 and Vonteego Cummings had 18. Golden State has lost two
straight at home following a season-high three-game home winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman made two free throws with 3:05 remaining to tie it at
88, and added a jumper with 2:24 left to give the Hornets a 90-88
lead. After Mookie Blaylock tied it with a jumper, Coleman hit
consecutive baskets to give Charlotte a 94-90 lead with 1:21
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Caffey drew the Warriors within three with a free throw,
but Coleman countered with two free throws to push the Hornets'
lead to five at 96-91 with 57 seconds left. Blaylock made it 96-94
with a three-point play with 54 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's free throw made it 97-94 with 21.5 seconds left.
After Golden State's Billy Owens hit a free throw with 20.5 seconds
to go, Coleman made two more free throws with 18.9 seconds left to
make it 99-95.
</P>
<P>
   Caffey pulled the Warriors within two again with a dunk with
11.9 seconds remaining, but Coleman hit two free throws with 11.1
seconds to go to make it 101-97.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings hit a jumper with 3.9 seconds to make it 101-99, and
Charlotte's Baron Davis completed the scoring with a free throw
with 3.6 seconds left. Hughes missed a 3-point attempt as time ran

Bush Accelerates Past McCain
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- George W. Bush accelerated his drive to the Republican
presidential nomination Tuesday, winning California, New York and five other
primaries as he rose to vanquish John McCain. Praising his insurgent challenger,
the Texas governor said, ''Soon our party will unite and turn to the main task
at hand --ending the era of Clinton-Gore.'' McCain won four states Tuesday but
none beyond independent-minded New England. The Arizona senator said he was
going home to consider his fate and an aide said he could quit the race as soon
as Thursday. If so, it would end a campaign that had ignited enormous interest,
pitting a self-styled political reformer against the scion of the GOP
establishment.

Gore Sweeps Past Bradley
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore cleared his way to the Democratic presidential
nomination with a Super Tuesday primary sweep that pushed Bill Bradley to the
brink of withdrawal. ''We need to build on our record of prosperity,'' the vice
president said, turning his focus toward November. ''He won, I lost,'' said
Bradley, all but conceding his challenge was over after losing contests from
Maine to California. Two Democratic party officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said campaign aides had told them the former New Jersey senator
planned to depart the race on Thursday. Gore won in New England, Georgia, Ohio
and several stops in between, regularly gaining 60 percent of the vote or more.

Calif. Approves Gay Marriage Ban

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Californians rejected gay marriage Tuesday, approving a
ballot measure that prohibits the state from recognizing same-sex marriages
legally performed in any other state. Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service
for The Associated Press and television networks showed Proposition 22 passing
with strong support from both men and women and from voters of all races and
income groups. Democrats opposed it by 2-1 but Republicans backed it by about
6-1. ''It's a victory for California families,'' said Robert Glazier, spokesman
for the Yes-on-22 campaign.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Keyes got a surprising second-place finish in
Minnesota's GOP straw poll, but finished in single digits in most of Tuesday's
Republican presidential contests. In the straw poll, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
got about two-thirds of the vote, and Keyes was second, with McCain a few points
behind Outside of his performance in Minnesota, Keyes' strongest finish was in
his home state of Maryland where he picked up roughly 7 percent of the vote.

Tokyo Subway Derails; 3 Killed

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two subway trains carrying more than 1,500 rush-hour commuters
collided when one of the trains derailed Wednesday, killing three people and
injuring more than 30 others. The impact sheared off the wall of one of the
train's rear cars, ripping out the cushioned seats. Buckled metal and other
debris littered the scene. ''I saw a huge lump of metal penetrating my car, and
everybody was panicking,'' a 21-year-old commuter told national broadcaster NHK.
''Many passengers were collapsing.'' There were 240 passengers on the train that
derailed, and 1,300 on the oncoming train that hit it, the fire department
estimated.

<HEADLINE> Former Reform Activists Back McCain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINA, Minn. (AP) -- Making up for a third-place showing in
Minnesota's GOP caucuses Tuesday, Arizona Sen. John McCain won big
among Independence Party activists.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonbinding preference poll among breakaway Reform Party
members, McCain handily defeated Reform Party contender Pat
Buchanan and others candidates. Minnesota's Reform Party left the
national party last week and reclaimed the name Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   With unofficial results from seven of eight congressional
districts, McCain had 144 votes, Natural Law Party candidate John
Hagelin had 44 votes, Buchanan had 26 votes and 73 were
uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jesse Ventura, who stopped by a caucus in Edina, didn't
cast a ballot. He bolted the Reform Party last month and urged the
state party to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I'm prepared to vote for president yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Bumgarner, 52, backed McCain. He hopes McCain reconsiders
his reluctance to leave the Republican Party and run as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's not listed on the (November) ballot, I'm going to
write him in anyway,'' Bumgarner said.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Would Target Fire Safety  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major House spending bill includes $15.1
million to work on fire hazards in the U.S. Capitol complex that
were highlighted by Congress' health and safety agency in January.
</P>
<P>
   More than $7 million in the bill revealed Tuesday would be spent
in the Capitol building to survey asbestos, install smoke
detectors, upgrade alarm systems, test electrical equipment and
study smoke-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The funding in this bill will provide the resources
necessary'' to handle hazards cited by the congressional Office of
Compliance, the report accompanying the bill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Architect of the Capitol, responsible for congressional
grounds and buildings, told Congress that 66 of the 173 fire-safety
findings have already been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Only House-controlled areas are covered by the legislation.
Senate appropriators would have to decide whether money should be
added for Senate-administered spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The money is part of a House Republican bill that would spend $9
billion to finance diverse domestic and foreign government
programs. However, major Democrats also support money to upgrade
the Capitol's fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the $15.1 million would replace defective sprinkler
heads, install sprinklers in areas that don't have them, design new
fire suppression systems, provide proper storage for hazardous
materials and improve emergency lighting systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Compliance said in its late January report that
the lives of 535 members of Congress, their staffs and thousands of
daily visitors have been jeopardized by the poor state of fire
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Safety inspectors found ''the overall level of fire safety to be
far below that of most other American office buildings of similar
size and age.''

<HEADLINE> Battle Over Book in Greece  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- It began with a small fire. About 200
religious zealots and ultra-conservatives fed the flames in January
with copies of a book they call blasphemous because of passages
about the possible sexual longings of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The book burning, however, was just kindling for a bigger
confrontation. Political leaders, clergymen and scholars have been
drawn onto the unstable ground between the nation's commitment to
free expression and the Orthodox Christian heritage that figures
strongly in Greece's ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled today in the northern city of
Thessaloniki on a suit to halt the sale of the best-selling book
''M to the Power of N'' by former Communist parliament deputy Mimis
Androulakis.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a series of fictional dialogues between women whose
names all begin with the letter M. The central theme is misogyny in
various aspects of life, including religion. One chapter mentions
an often explored hypothesis: a possible sexual element in the
relationship between Christ and Mary Magdalene, a prostitute who
became a follower.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not a theocratic regime ... we are a European
country,'' Androulakis said. ''This is not Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Greece, Androulakis and his many supporters are up
against a clique that draws its strength from a potent source: the
place where undercurrents of nationalism and religion flow
together.
</P>
<P>
   The legal challenge to the book is led by a Byzantine history
professor, Marios Pylavakis, who argues that Christ's life cannot
be open to fictional reinterpretation. He has been joined by a mix
of ultra-nationalists and religious firebrands -- the same group
that opposes efforts to normalize relations with longtime rival
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings are particularly strong in northern Greece, where
the Ottomans still held lands less than 100 years ago and the
affinity is deep for the Greek-dominated Byzantine Empire that
ended with the fall of nearby Constantinople, now Istanbul, in the
15th century. If the book's opponents keep up their crusade, the
case could emerge as a delicate issue in advance of national
elections on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesus Christ is not a novel,'' said Pylavakis. ''He is what's
most holy to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement Tuesday from the governing body of the Greek
Orthodox Church called the book ''blasphemous obscenity'' and said
its opponents are justified to try to block the work of ''this
disrespectful writer.''
</P>
<P>
   But a wide spectrum of supporters have put aside differences to
unite behind Androulakis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greece does not carry out witch hunts or have holy
inquisitions,'' said Foreign Minister George Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
   A top official for the opposition New Democracy party, Prokopis
Pavlopoulos, said the case smacks of ''other times'' -- an apparent
reference to the political and artistic repression under the
1967-74 military junta and earlier leaders. Androulakis claims he
became a target of right-wingers for his fight against the military
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greece is entering the 21st century with a medieval
mentality,'' said an editorial in the daily Ta Nea newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's highly conservative Orthodox church feels pressure from
both sides. It risks alienating some of its flock for being too
tempered. At the same time, political leaders are increasingly
annoyed at the public and outspoken style of the church's leader,
Archbishop Christodoulos.
</P>
<P>
   It also could re-energize those seeking a constitutional
separation of church and state in Greece -- something Christodoulos
strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Many church critics point out another case of politics and
religion colliding in Greece -- the excommunication of world famous
Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis following the 1955 publication of
''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a study of Christ questioning
his divinity.
</P>
<P>
   A 1988 movie adaptation of the book prompted demonstrations
around the world, including in Greece and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''My book is a pretext,'' said Androulakis. ''It is an excuse
for some fanatics who think they can turn back to Byzantium.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Prepares $9B Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost doubling a request from President
Clinton, House Republicans have prepared a $9 billion measure
financing everything from eradicating cocaine production in
Colombia to repairing fire traps in the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to push the legislation through the House
Appropriations Committee on Thursday. But its fate after that is
unclear as lawmakers will face their first battle of this election
year over what to do with the federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the bill, obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press,
shows that lawmakers would make only minor changes in the $1.6
billion Clinton requested for battling drug traffickers in Colombia
and nearby countries. They would also provide the $2 billion wants
for U.S. troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the package contains money Clinton did not seek for the
military's troubled health insurance system, rising Pentagon fuel
costs, and road repair and housing loan costs attributed to damage
from last fall's Hurricane Floyd and other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see some emergency items that were not included'' in
Clinton's request, said House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for the current fiscal year, has drawn the ire of
conservatives unhappy over its price tag, which is only likely to
grow with additional money for the Pentagon and farmers. They are
also upset that nearly all of the bill would be paid for from this
year's projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Democrats are unhappy with the anti-drug
money. They say the proposal risks U.S. involvement in what has
been a bloody Colombian civil war, and that more attention should
be paid to preventing drug use at home.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said he planned to push his version of the bill through his panel
in two weeks. He said Clinton's request for military construction
in Colombia ''bothers us'' and that much of that spending would
probably be left for later this year, when Congress considers
spending bills for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill changes Clinton's drug-fighting request slightly
by adding money for Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   It provides just $12 million of the $93 million he sought for
aid to Kosovo, and limited that to U.S. participation in
international police activities in the violence-racked Balkan
enclave.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also ignores Clinton's request for $210 million for
debt relief for poor countries, an effort the administration and
Congress joined in last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Included is $15 million to correct fire safety hazards
identified in the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also repeal gimmicks enacted last fall that
had pushed roughly $10 billion in spending into fiscal 2001, in
effect rolling them back into this year. This will help lawmakers
working on next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmicks included military and civilian pay days,
contractual payments, and grants for medical research and some
social services that last fall were delayed until next Oct. 1 -- the
start of fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also:
</P>
<P>
   --Provides $1.5 billion for the military's growing fuel bill,
caused by soaring oil prices, and $855 million for Defense
Department medical insurance program -- neither of which Clinton
requested.
</P>
<P>
   --Has $600 million Clinton sought to help poor families pay
utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   --Adds more than $1 billion to Clinton's $1.1 billion request for
natural disasters and other emergencies, including funds for the
National Aeronautics &AMP; Space Administration, highway repairs, rural
housing loans, and combatting crop diseases.

<HEADLINE> China Pins Hopes on Its West  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China sees the key to its future success in its
west: an inland expanse of deserts, Himalayan highlands and rugged,
overfarmed mountains that is home to most of its poor.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by fears that the widening gap between its relatively
affluent east and the backward, poverty stricken west could inflame
social unrest and slow overall national development, the communist
leadership has dusted off its perennial campaign to channel more
investment into the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   That, the leadership contends, is the only way China can shake
off endemic poverty and foster national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The population is large, the land is cheap, and the natural
resources are plentiful,'' Zeng Peiyan, China's economic planning
minister, said Monday. ''With our diligence, and that of the whole
country, we can build a western region with a flourishing economy
and beautiful mountains and rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint calls for vast increases in government spending on
basic infrastructure and on luring foreign and domestic investment
westward. Yet it raises questions about how China can lure
investors to a landlocked region lacking good roads and railways,
and bereft of modern technology and skilled, educated workers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes as many foreign companies, frustrated by
bureaucratic interference and uncooperative local partners and wary
of shifts in government policy, are reassessing their China
strategies, skeptical about the illusory promise of a potential
market of 1.3 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult from a commercial perspective. The conditions
have to be there. I'm not convinced they are,'' said Jeanne-Marie
Gescher, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign executives question whether the government ought
to influence business decisions by fiat. The government, however,
says the west's abundant natural resources -- such as gas, oil and
minerals -- can make it a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   The western development strategy is a top agenda item at the
11-day annual meeting of the National People's Congress that began
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress delegates have demanded new policies to encourage
investment, including preferential tax laws, low-interest,
long-term loans, special economic zones and more support for
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the major problems that hampers Yunnan's development is
the low quality of its laborers. Education is vital to local
development,'' said Linghu An, a deputy from southwestern Yunnan
province.
</P>
<P>
   The west accounts for about two-thirds of China's land and
almost one-fourth of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's policy of situating
important industries inland for defensive purposes, the region grew
relatively quickly for the first three decades of communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   But since China began dismantling its planned economy 20 years
ago, rural incomes have lagged. The average rural resident earned
$267 last year, and even less in the west. City residents had $707
in disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 of China's poorest 80 million people live in the
west, many members of restive minorities, such as Tibetans and
Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. Illiteracy is common, excessive logging
and intensive farming have wreaked environmental havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of the domestic and foreign investment that has
transformed much of eastern China, antiquated factories in the west
are closing because they churn out unmarketable products. The
streets of many western cities are filled with laborers hunting
jobs or eking out meager livings hawking factory surplus or driving
pedicabs.
</P>
<P>
   The government's outline for western development calls for
establishing more high value-added industries there. Provinces that
depended mainly on farming, mining, tobacco and metallurgy would
develop food processing industries, tourism, electronics, and
natural gas production.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing for a higher minimum wage, President
Clinton is rallying Democrats against a Republican plan that would
tie an increase to $122.7 billion in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are using this minimum wage increase to pass
irresponsible tax cuts that would threaten our fiscal discipline
and jeopardize our ability to extend the life of Medicare and
Social Security and pay down the debt,'' Clinton said in a letter
to the leaders of both parties in the House and Senate. ''Let me be
clear: This is the wrong approach. I will veto any legislation that
holds this minimum wage increase hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned a rally today with Democrats at the White House.
''Working families across this country deserve an increase,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's opposition, House Republicans are forging
ahead with legislation to slash inheritance taxes and cut other
taxes for businesses to offset the cost of raising the minimum wage
by $1 over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders generally oppose raising the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage but are willing to put the question to a floor vote
Thursday to appease GOP moderates who have strong labor
constituencies and to give conservatives another election-year
opportunity to vote for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Using a chunk of the projected budget surplus estimated at
$122.7 billion over 10 years, the tax package would sharply reduce
the estate tax, boost contribution limits for 401(k) plans, make
health insurance fully tax deductible for the self-employed and
enact several tax changes favorable to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
said raising the minimum wage alone would ''saw off the bottom rung
of the economic ladder'' by reducing the number of jobs smaller
employers could afford to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This modest tax relief for those who create jobs will provide
an effective antidote to the job-threatening potential of a higher
minimum wage,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $5.48 this
year, $5.81 in April 2001 and $6.15 in April 2002. Backed by
organized labor, Clinton and congressional Democrats favor a $1
increase over two years and oppose the tax cuts as unnecessary and
tilted toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,
have a bill that would increase the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour
by a dollar over just two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If wages had kept up with worker productivity gains over the
past 25 years, a minimum wage worker would be earning $8.79 an hour
today,'' Kennedy said through a spokesman. ''This disgraceful
disparity shows how far we have fallen short in guaranteeing that
low-income workers receive their fair share of the nation's
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fear the GOP won't permit a vote on their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their bills are too little, and too loaded,'' complained Fred
Clarke, spokesman for Bonior, who has produced an $8 billion tax
plan Clarke said was targeted directly at businesses and others who
would be affected by the minimum wage hike.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke recalled that Clinton vetoed a $792 billion GOP tax cut
last year. ''What they're doing is using the minimum wage to pass a
failed tax plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing or eliminating the estate tax is a cornerstone of the
GOP political agenda and is part of this year's congressional
strategy of passing smaller, bite-sized tax cuts instead of one
massive bill like last year's vetoed package.
</P>
<P>
   The House business tax package would:
</P>
<P>
   --Reduce the top estate tax rate from 55 percent to 50 percent by
2002, reduce all estate tax rates by 1 percentage point in 2003 and
2004 and repeal a surcharge that applies only to estates worth over
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually raise the annual contribution limits for 401(k) plans
from $10,000 to $14,000 by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   --Make health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed fully
tax deductible in 2001, sooner than under current law.
</P>
<P>
   --Give small business a tax write-off on $30,000 of equipment, up
from $19,000; raise the business meal deduction from 50 percent to
60 percent; and restore a law allowing the seller of a business to
pay taxes as installment payments are received, instead of in an
immediate lump sum.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Entrants Turn Selves In  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Pummeled by snow, strong winds and
plummeting temperatures, hundreds of illegal immigrants trying to
cross the Arizona desert surrendered in exchange for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the undocumented Mexicans were inadequately dressed,
with plastic bags as rain gear, when they turned themselves in
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a flow of people giving themselves up, waving people
down'' to escape the frigid conditions on the Tohono O'Odham Indian
reservation west of Tucson, Tribal Police Chief Larry Seligman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, federal, state, local and tribal police helped in
what Border Patrol officials characterized as the rescue of 355
people.
</P>
<P>
   Two men have been found dead since Monday night, at least one
apparently of exposure. Seligman said he expects more bodies to
turn up.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce winter storm that coated the mountains of Southern
California and Arizona with snow Monday also is blamed for the
deaths of three illegal immigrants in the high country east of San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants in Arizona were held in shelters or Border Patrol
facilities overnight before being returned Tuesday to Nogales,
Mexico, where authorities worked to ensure that shelters could
accommodate them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman said the numbers who turned themselves in, many
hypothermic, overwhelmed the tribal clinic. Pima County Emergency
Services and the Red Cross provided blankets and hot soup.

<HEADLINE> Many Hispanics Below Poverty Line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People of Mexican descent, who comprise more
than 65 percent of the country's Hispanic population, are the least
likely among Hispanics to be college-educated, Census data released
today show.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7 percent of the nation's 20 million Mexicans held
bachelor's degrees. Cubans were the Hispanic group most likely to
be college-educated, with 25 percent of that population holding
bachelor's degrees or better. Nearly 28 percent of non-Hispanic
whites finished college.
</P>
<P>
   With one quarter of the nation's 31 million Hispanics living
below the poverty line in 1998, the possibility of Hispanics -- and
especially recently arrived immigrants -- to get better wages could
get smaller because of increasing demand for college-educated
workers, said Gumecindo Salas, vice president for governmental
relations of the Hispanic Association for Colleges and
Universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tradition among all immigrants in the U.S. is that after
two or three generations, you tend to see a movement up in
educational level,'' Salas said. But with Hispanics, ''because you
have so many coming in over time, it tends to undermine that level
of improvement. It may not appear to be improvement, but it
actually is.''
</P>
<P>
   The data are part of the Census Bureau's Current Population
Survey on Hispanics, the last population estimates before the 2000
Census.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic population is expected to triple to 98 million in
2050. Hispanics could become in the half-century the nation's
largest minority group with their percentage rising from about 12
percent now to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty level for a family of four in 1998 was considered to be
$16,600. About 8 percent of non-Hispanic whites lived in poverty in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 27 percent of Puerto Rican families lived in poverty,
compared with 24 percent of Mexican families and 11 percent of
Cuban households.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country's Latino population is not as homogeneous as some
might think,'' said census analyst Roberto Ramirez.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Approves Gay Marriage Ban  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Californians rejected gay marriage Tuesday,
approving a ballot measure that prohibits the state from
recognizing same-sex marriages legally performed in any other
state.
</P>
<P>
   With 41 percent of precincts reporting, 1,814,640 voters, or 63
percent, had supported Proposition 22, while 1,059,312 voters, or
37 percent, were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service for The Associated
Press and TV networks showed Proposition 22 got strong support from
men and women and from voters of all races and income groups.
Democrats opposed it by 2-1 but Republicans backed it by about 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a victory for California families,'' said Robert Glazier,
spokesman for the Yes-on-22 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's heavily gay Castro district, the mood was
gloomy at Harvey's, a restaurant and bar named for Harvey Milk, the
city's first openly gay supervisor, who was assassinated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll accept my taxes to raise somebody else's kids, but
they won't let me protect my partner,'' said Nelson Smith, 74, a
retired lab technician who's been in a gay relationship for 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Proposition 22 is brief: ''Only marriage between a
man and a woman is valid and recognized in California'' -- but
complex legal and moral issues lay beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   California, like all other states, recognizes only marriage
between a man and a woman. But state law also grants legal status
to marriages legally performed in other states. Common-law
marriages and couples too young or too closely related to marry in
California have gained legal recognition under that law.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hawaii Supreme Court raised the possibility of
same-sex marriages in 1993 -- a prospect the state's voters later
rejected -- 30 states and the federal government passed laws denying
recognition to same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In California, supporters of Proposition 22 said their purpose
was not to demean homosexuals but to protect the state's right to
define marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents sought to connect the initiative to discrimination and
anti-gay violence. They also said similar laws in other states have
been used to challenge adoptions, child custody and other benefits
for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the issue was on the table on town meetings around
the state Tuesday. The decisions weren't binding, but were meant to
guide state lawmakers trying to craft legislation following a state
Supreme Court ruling that gays are unconstitutionally being denied
the benefits of marriage. One pending bill would grant all such
benefits the state can offer without actually allowing gay
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In most, if not all, communities around the state, residents
voted against allowing gay marriages, although it was close in a
few. Several communities supported domestic partnerships, however.

<HEADLINE> Bodies of Mother, Son Go Unnoticed  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVON, Ohio (AP) -- The bodies of a bedridden double amputee and
his mother were discovered in their home about a month after the
woman, who was her son's caregiver, died from a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Donaldson, 37, may have been able to see the body of his
dead mother down the hall before he died several days later of
dehydration, Lorain County Coroner Paul Matus said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Donaldson, 71, and her son had been dead nearly a month
before their bodies were discovered Monday after a postal carrier
noticed mail overflowing their curbside box.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donaldson likely died of a heart condition around Feb. 9,
Matus said. The son was schizophrenic and diabetic. His legs had
been amputated and he was unable to care for himself, Matus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a loving relationship,'' the coroner said. ''She
doted on him. She was a full-time caregiver.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last summer, the son still had both legs and had
been cutting the grass on the family's 5-acre plot with a rider
mower, according to neighbor Nancy Rothacher, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson apparently had his legs amputated at that time and
then became bedridden, Rothacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donaldson's body was found in a hallway. A terrier-mix dog
that apparently starved to death was next to her, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Donaldson was found in bed, Matus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do (to see her body) was to sit up in bed and
lean forward,'' Matus said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found forms from social service agencies and a
visiting nurses association inside the house. A nurse had gone to
the house Feb. 9, but Ms. Donaldson said help wasn't needed, Matus
said.

<HEADLINE> Moderates come out for McCain, conservatives go for Bush  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut showed its political maverick
streak, choosing Arizona Sen. John McCain over Texas Gov. George W.
Bush in the Republican primary in part because people think he's
not a typical politician, exit polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's outside the mold, said Bloomfield resident Mark Hunt.
''He's something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the Nutmeg State said the same thing about New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, who lost to Al Gore in Connecticut, but made a
stronger showing here than in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The vote continues Connecticut's primary election tradition of
choosing underdogs. In 1984, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart won
over nominee Walter Mondale; and in 1992, former California Gov.
Jerry Brown beat President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and McCain drew voters who had been independent, but who
registered with a political party so they could vote in Tuesday's
closed primary election, exit polls show.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were conducted for The Associated Press and television
networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Many McCain voters said they supported the Arizona senator
because he is not a typical politician and because they thought he
was a ''real reformer,'' poll results showed.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those polled said McCain ''says what he
believes,'' while about 4-in-10 voters said the same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked the fact that McCain tried to avoid getting into
negative politics. It always seemed that when Bush made a comment,
it was always a snide remark. He didn't seem genuine,'' said Edward
Del Santo, a McCain voter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters said they supported the son of former President
George Bush because of his values and because they think he can win
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's really got what it takes,'' said Tim Dock, an
insurance company worker who said he predicted in a college
politics class in 1997 that Bush would be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters liked his stance on taxes, education and
abortion. McCain voters supported his stance on campaign finance
reform, world affairs and moral values.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also won in Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island. He
first got serious notice in New England when he won the New
Hampshire primary. Bush won in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed McCain leading Bush among women and
more-educated voters. More Bush supporters considered themselves
part of the religious right, a movement whose leaders McCain had
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters registered with one or the other of the parties
could vote Tuesday. Independents had until noon Monday to choose a
party, and exit polling indicated many more of them voted for
McCain and Bradley than for Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of President Clinton's job performance was a key factor
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that I like the way I see Clinton doing things for us.
I think Gore might probably replace him and do the same things, to
ensure a good environment for everybody,'' said Raphael Lopez, 37,
a Hartford machinist.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of Democrats said they approved of the
way President Clinton has done his job, and about two-thirds of
those voters went for Gore, the exit poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voters said they chose their candidate for the issues he's
presented, including Social Security, Medicare, the economy and
education. His support crossed racial, income, educational and
gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   More Bradley supporters than Gore supporters said their
candidate ''says what he believes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen Gore really stand up for anything where he
doesn't later back down. He's swayed too much by public opinion and
not what he thinks is right,'' said Norman Blais, 28, a Hartford
resident who voted for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 1,344 voters in the Connecticut
Republican presidential primary and 1,180 voters in the Democratic
primary. The exit poll was conducted in 40 randomly selected
precincts statewide. The margin of sampling error for each result
is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Officer accused of murder takes stand  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) --For the first time since he shot an
unarmed suspect in the back at point-blank range, New Milford
Police Officer Scott Smith has told his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   During more than three hours of testimony at his murder trial
Tuesday, Smith recounted the foot chase and struggle on Dec. 29,
1998, that ended when he fired one fatal shot. Smith is the first
police officer in Connecticut to be charged with murder for an act
in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 28, told the jury he thought his life was about to end
seconds before he fatally shot Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he yelled ''Show me your hands'' over and over again
as he pursued Reid along busy Route 202, but Reid failed to
respond. Smith said he tried to force Reid down on an embankment,
but Reid pushed his way back up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I am, a police officer, holding a firearm at this guy and
he's not showing me his hands,'' said Smith, 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting more and more scared. I don't know what he's
thinking. ... I just couldn't make any sense out of it, and he was
scaring the crap out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that on a second attempt to force him down, Reid, on
his knees and with his back to Smith, moved very suddenly and
seemed to be groping in his mid-section. Smith said he believed
Reid was reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he fired after Reid, with his back still to him,
twisted his left arm toward him. Reid was unarmed, but a folding
knife with a 2-inch serrated blade was found in a jacket near his
body.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he made that classic move, I thought 'Oh (expletive), I'm
dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought of my mother, my father ... I thought of my sister,
and how much I was going to miss them and just how much I loved
them,'' Smith said, his voice quivering.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fired my gun one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith remained composed throughout most of his testimony,
speaking in a clear voice and looking at the jury. The only time he
showed emotion was when he told the jury that he thought of his
family when he believed he was about to be killed by Reid.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Waterbury State's Attorney John
Connelly pounced on Smith's detached testimony, suggesting that
Smith did not care what happened to Reid because when asked about
shooting Reid, he repeatedly said, ''I couldn't believe what had
just happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you ever say once, 'I couldn't believe what just happened
to Franklyn Reid?'' Connelly asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I did not,'' Smith answered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because you didn't care what happened to Franklyn Reid,''
Connelly said, raising his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Smith answered: ''Of course I cared what happened to Franklyn
Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly -- the case's special prosecutor -- suggested that it
would be good for Smith's career as a police officer to apprehend
Reid, who had been well-known to the town's police department.
Reid, 27, had been wanted on several warrants including
threatening, breach of peace and failure to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who had been on the force two years at the time of the
shooting and had been given a temporary assignment in the detective
bureau, denied he thought about his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was never a consideration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly pressed him, asking, ''Wouldn't it be nice and look
good on Officer Smith's record if he could say that he was the one
police officer who single-handedly captured Franklyn Reid?''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Smith acknowledged the arrest would likely look
good.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly was so vociferous in his cross-examination that Judge
Charles Gill admonished him to lower his voice.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Connelly suddenly sat down on the courtroom floor,
making a loud thumping sound, to illustrate how he claimed Reid
complied with Smith's commands to get on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Connelly, you weren't there -- I was. That's not the way it
happened,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly also pressed Smith on why he made the decision to get
out of his unmarked car and chase Smith alone, instead of waiting
for his partner or for backup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things happened so fast,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''...And the decisions you make in life you have to live with,
don't you, Officer Smith?''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's correct,'' Smith replied.

	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Judy Jarvis, who battled lung cancer for
18 months while continuing to host her nationally syndicated radio
talk show, has died. She was 54.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis died Tuesday, said her son Jason, who served as executive
producer and co-host of ''The Judy Jarvis Show'' which airs three
hours a day on more than 50 stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Jarvis had been a nationally syndicated radio host since
1993. She formerly was a reporter for Time Magazine and The Boston
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   She also was a frequent contributor to the Op-Ed pages of
newspapers throughout the nation and appeared as a pundit on CNN,
NBC and C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, the self-described ''feisty, independent-minded broad,''
had been ill since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She found herself with a sharp cough and shortness of breath
while in Seattle to host her show from the National Association of
Broadcasters annual meeting. Upon returning home, Jarvis, a
nonsmoker, was diagnosed with a particularly virulent strain of
lung cancer that quickly spread through her body, forcing the
amputation of her left leg last March.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis took a medical break from her Farmington-based show.
Jason filled in for his mother on the air, and when she returned
co-hosted the show with her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone that she came into contact with remembered her, and
was touched by her. Everyone,'' Jason Jarvis said. ''She was a
larger-than-life figure. She lived out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Long Island, N.Y., Jarvis was a political science
graduate from Boston University, a former teacher, and the
President of Jarvis Productions, Inc. which syndicates The Judy
Jarvis Show.
</P>
<P>
   The radio show made Jarvis a broadcaster of national renown.
Talkers, the industry trade magazine, named Jarvis one of the most
influential people in talk for five straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kurtz, the media writer for The Washington Post,
described her as a ''radio rebel'' in his talk-radio book ''Hot
Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete early this morning.

<HEADLINE> Study: Parents Juggling Day-Care  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Debra Sisson rejoiced when she got her
daughter into a Tacoma, Wash., day care center that stays open
until midnight. A single mom and casino dealer who works nights,
Sisson had been scrambling, using friends or relatives to watch
2-year-old Roselynn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day I just hoped that someone could watch her,'' said
Sisson.
</P>
<P>
   With more people working jobs that require night and weekend
hours and few day care centers taking kids after hours, many
mothers are juggling multiple day-care arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A new study released today shows that more than a third of
working mothers have two child-care arrangements for children and
another 8 percent are using at least three.
</P>
<P>
   Most mothers are shuttling their children between formal day
care centers and the homes of neighbors or relatives, according to
a survey of more than 44,000 household by The Urban Institute, a
Washington-based social policy research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found out that older children are more likely to be in
multiple arrangements than younger children. Essentially it's
driven by the fact that 3- and 4-year-olds are in 3 or more
arrangements,'' said Gina Adams, senior research associate at
group's population studies center who co-authored the study.
</P>
<P>
   Grandview Early Learning Center, the center that cares for
Sisson's daughter, is run by the Puyallup Indian tribe, which
operates the casino where Sisson works. The center expanded its
hours to midnight, seven days a week, after receiving a $70,000
state grant in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Maki, center director, says more extended hour care
facilities are needed for people working in area casinos, hospitals
and service companies. But many fear the higher costs and added
responsibilities of caring for children late at night or on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would I do it again? No,'' said Maki. ''It's a huge
responsibility. But the parents are benefiting from it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 million people worked nontraditional hours in 1997,
the latest year for which statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   That number is expected to increase. Occupations with a high
number of employees working nights and weekends are expected to
account for 27 percent of all job growth over an 11-year period
that ends 2005, according to report by the Washington State Child
Care Resource and Referral Network.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national statistics on the number of day-care
centers that operate in the evenings and on weekends, but
child-care experts say supply doesn't meet demand, which has
increased in recent years as people coming off welfare found jobs
in restaurants, cleaning services and other places that require
them to work at night and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute survey, part of a multiyear project looking
at federal and state social programs, showed that children from
well-off families were slightly more likely to be in multiple care
arrangements than low-income children, with 49 percent of affluent
kids care for by two or more providers, compared to 44 percent of
poorer children.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- Infants and toddlers are less likely to be in multiple care
arrangements. Forty-four percent of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds are
in two or more, compared to 34 percent of younger children.
</P>
<P>
   -- The use of multiple child care arrangements varied widely
across 12 states studied more closely. In Michigan, 41 percent of
children under three were in more than one child care arrangement,
while in Mississippi, the figure was 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nationally, 65 percent of mothers juggling more than one
arrangement used a combination of day care centers and relatives,
nannies or baby-sitters. Twenty percent used two day care centers
and 13 percent used combinations of relatives and baby-sitters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chided on China Effort  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton ''got exercised'' after
Republicans accused him of not working hard enough to win
congressional support of a plan to help U.S. exporters reap
benefits from a major market-opening trade agreement with China,
Democrats say.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with several senators Tuesday, including
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Clinton offered specific
numbers of meetings and other actions he has taken to build support
for the trade deal, they said. He promised to send legislation for
a permanent normal trade station for China to Capitol Hill today.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave a spirited response, and he said anybody who would say
that is just looking for excuses,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Lott conceded, ''I found out tonight he's
been doing a lot more than I had realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress must vote to end the annual reviews of China's trade
status with the United States in order for U.S. exporters to gain
the trade concessions China is offering to make in exchange for
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to deliver another speech on the issue
today, laying out the benefits he feels the United States will
receive not only economically but also in terms of strengthening
national security and boosting reform efforts in China through
closer trade ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lott warned U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene that the Senate would not even take the matter up this
year unless he saw greater efforts on the administration's part.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not interested in a feckless exercise that produces no
result,'' Lott said during a hearing before the Senate Finance
Committee's trade subcommittee. ''I am not going to stick my neck
out and take the time up of the Senate if you are not going to get
into a war room status and go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the trade deal has been jeopardized by the strong
opposition of organized labor, leaving Republicans to wonder just
how hard Clinton would push Democrats in an election year to buck a
key party constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the administration's failure to launch a new round of
global trade negotiations last December in Seattle raised questions
about Clinton's commitment to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seattle was an unmitigated, inexplicable disaster,'' Lott
said. ''You may say you are really going (to push the China
legislation). Well, if you are, I don't see it and if I don't see
it, I don't believe it is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said the administration has set up its war room,
headed by Commerce Secretary William Daley, and Clinton has already
met with 50 to 70 House and Senate members to seek support.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the deal are concerned that the longer Congress
waits to vote on China, the more erosion of support there will be
in an election year. In addition to labor unions, environmental
groups and human rights organizations are lobbying heavily against
granting China normal trade status, believing it takes away U.S.
leverage to push China to make greater reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore raised doubts about the administration's
commitment to the China deal at AFL-CIO meetings in New Orleans
last month. Labor leaders said Gore promised them that if elected
president, he would renegotiate the China agreement to include
protections for worker rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The comment sparked anger among major business groups and forced
Gore to issue a letter clarifying that he supported the
administration-negotiated trade deal. House Minority Whip David
Bonior, D-Mich., predicted last week that as many as two-thirds of
House Democrats would oppose the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Peacekeepers, Civilians Hurt  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers imposed
an early curfew in this ethnically divided city, hoping to ease
tensions inflamed after a street brawl led to gunshots and grenade
blasts that injured 16 French peacekeepers and 24 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Attackers shot into a crowd during a fight between an ethnic
Albanian and a Serb on Tuesday, touching off a clash that further
underlined NATO's failure to ease ethnic passions in the divided
city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials halted attempts to register Serbs wanting to
return to their homes on the southern, ethnic Albanian side of
town, but managed to slip 13 ethnic Albanians back into the
predominantly Serb part of the city, sending them home to a
high-rise apartment complex that was the site of repatriations last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, the complex was hit by a rocket. No
injuries were reported, French peacekeepers said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovska Mitrovica, located 20 miles northwest
of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, underlines the
difficulties NATO faces in attempting to return the town to its
prewar, multiethnic status.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's fight broke out on the Serb-controlled side of the
city when an ethnic Albanian identified as Luan Miftari attacked an
unidentified Serb man with a crowbar, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Serbs rushed to help the injured man, while others went
after Miftari. In the crush, an ethnic Albanian opened fire from
the backyard of a nearby house, seriously wounding one Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ''That created panic,'' said Lt. Matthieu Mabin, a spokesman for
the French peacekeepers, who arrived on the scene on foot, backed
by armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The French headed down a narrow side street, as grenade blasts
rang out, injuring several peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Medics scrambled to stabilize one soldier's leg wound, as
another lay on the ground moaning. Those who were not hurt in the
blast dragged injured comrades toward waiting ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hand grenades were thrown, we don't know from whom or from
where ... but it created very many injured, especially French
soldiers,'' Mabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Serbs, 16 French peacekeepers and four ethnic Albanians
were hurt in the fighting, said Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, another
spokesman for the French peacekeepers. A seventeenth peacekeeper
was injured in a separate incident.
</P>
<P>
   Four ethnic Albanians have been arrested, Chanliau said.
</P>
<P>
   After the grenade blasts, French peacekeepers began door-to-door
searches in the Bosnjacka Mahala neighborhood where the fighting
occurred. They later moved up the city's curfew by two hours to 8
p.m., and promised to take any measures necessary to make the
region secure.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, visited
NATO peacekeepers on the southern side of Kosovska Mitrovica on
Tuesday, NATO said. The independent Beta news agency said Clark met
with local Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic.
</P>
<P>
   Bonfires blazed throughout Kosovo on Tuesday, the final day of
memorial events marking the death of Adem Jashari, a hero to
Albanian Kosovars noted for holding off Serb police in a three-day
siege two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
NATO-led peacekeepers moved into Kosovo last June, after a 78-day
bombing campaign that ended a yearlong Serb crackdown on ethnic
Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern Tuesday that
the U.N. administration in Kosovo is operating in ''limbo'' because
the province's political future has not been clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
   The ''very ambiguous situation'' created by the U.N. Security
Council resolution that ended the bombing campaign has left ethnic
Albanians and Serbs with different understandings about the future,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions call for ''substantial autonomy'' for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Substantial autonomy has not been defined in any way,'' Annan
said.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Jury Gets Date-Rape Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The death of a 15-year-old girl who drank a soda
spiked with the so-called ''date rape'' drug was a tragic accident,
not involuntary manslaughter, a defense lawyer said in closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Cole, 19, is accused of slipping gamma-hydroxybutyrate --
GHB -- into Samantha Reid's glass during a party. She died on Jan.
17, 1999, after being taken off of life support.
</P>
<P>
   Two other girls also ingested the drug; one recovered and
another was not sickened. Besides involuntary manslaughter, Cole is
also charged with three counts of felony poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The jury heard nearly five weeks of testimony before Tuesday's
closing arguments. Deliberations were to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Courtright said the youths at the party
were deliberately ''using drugs, all of them, every one,
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole had no way of knowing how much of the colorless, odorless
and often tasteless GHB might be harmful to Samantha or anyone else
at the party -- ''a bunch of dumb teen-agers experimenting with
it,'' Courtright said.
</P>
<P>
   He called Samantha's death a ''tragic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Doug Baker said Cole did not use GHB that night
because he knew it was harmful, even telling investigators that it
made him sick when he took it once earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slipping something into someone's drink, I think that crosses
the line ... and I think this goes beyond some stupid mistake,''
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other men also are charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary manslaughter is punishable by up to 15 years behind
bars. The poisoning counts carry a possible life sentence.

<HEADLINE> USDA Plans Organic Food Standards  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal rules for organic food will assure
consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same
standards nationwide. That doesn't mean, however, that organic is
better than conventional food, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because something is labeled organic does not mean that
it is any more superior, any safer or more healthy than
conventional food. All food in this country must meet the same high
standards of safety, regardless of their classification,'' Glickman
said in releasing the proposed rules Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, almost a decade in the making, would bar the use of
genetically engineered crops, disease-killing irradiation
treatments or industrial sludge as a fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Products grown and processed according to the standards and
contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients will be allowed to
carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic.''
Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled ''made
with'' organic ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards, intended to replace a hodgepodge of state and
private rules, also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in
livestock production and require the use of organic feed. The rules
also restrict the kind of fertilizers, pesticides and food
additives that can be used. With a few exceptions, synthetic
chemicals would not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national
organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and
others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected
to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules ''will preserve the well-defined production
practices that characterize organic agriculture,'' said Hiu
Newcomb, who runs organic vegetable farms in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Food Processors Association said USDA ignored
scientific evidence in deciding to block the use of genetically
engineered crops or irradiation. Conventional meat and produce can
be irradiated to kill harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the public's views are important, rules governing food
labeling and food safety must be based on sound science, and sound
science cannot be determined by public opinion polling,'' said
Kelly Johnston, a spokeswoman for the group, which represents major
food processors and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, who wrote a 1990 law that required USDA to
develop the rules, said they should provide a boost to the organic
industry, which has already been growing by 20 percent a year.
Without such standards, ''there are limits to consumer acceptance
and export potential,'' the Vermont Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of the rules will be left to states and private
certifying agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic,
only 6,600 are certified by a state or private agency.
</P>
<P>
   USDA will take public comment on the rules from March 13 through
June 14 before putting them into effect. Farmers and processors
will then be given 18 months to get into compliance.

<HEADLINE> Officer Testifies In Shootout Case  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A retired police detective said he never
ordered an ambulance crew to leave the scene of a police shootout
without a dying bank robber, who bled to death while awaiting help.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Matasareanu was shot 29 times during the 1997 shootout.
Witnesses said he bled to death in the street after one ambulance
left him behind and others failed to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   James Vojtecky, one of the officers being sued in federal court
for failing to get quick help for Matasareanu, said he argued with
emergency medical technicians and wanted them to take the wounded
man to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted all the wounded out of the area ... I assumed they
were going to take him (Matasareanu),'' Vojtecky said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous witnesses have said Vojtecky told EMTs to ''get the
(expletive) out of here'' while Matasareanu lay nearby bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by attorney Victor Sherman, representing
family survivors of Matasareanu, Vojtecky conceded: ''I may have
said something like that, but I didn't tell them to get out of the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is in its third week. U.S. District Judge Christina
Snyder said she expects the jury to receive the case by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky said he thought he did everything he could to save
Matasareanu, short of transporting him to the hospital in his own
police car. He said police rules forbid such transportation if it
is likely to hasten the death of a victim.
</P>
<P>
   With Matasareanu bleeding profusely, Vojtecky said he was afraid
to move him.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven police officers and six civilians were wounded on Feb.
18, 1997, as Matasareanu, 30, and his partner Larry Phillips Jr.,
26, tried to get away from a bank with their loot while they fired
automatic weapons at lightly armed police. Both gunmen died.
</P>
<P>
   One witness quoted a wounded Matasareanu as saying: ''Help me.
Help me.'' Vojtecky said he must have been out of the area because
he did not remember that plea.
</P>
<P>
   He did remember, as others have testified, that Matasareanu
looked at him and asked: ''Shoot me in the head.''

<HEADLINE> China Executes Senior Official  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Underscoring the government's determination to
punish corruption, China today executed a deputy provincial
governor, one of the highest-level officials caught in a long
campaign to root out graft.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Changqing, former deputy governor of eastern China's Jiangxi
province, was executed this morning in the provincial capital of
Nanchang after the Supreme People's Court upheld his death
sentence, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy director of the governing State Council's Religious
Affairs Commission before he moved to Jiangxi, Hu was sentenced to
death last month for taking bribes worth $658,000 and possession of
nearly $195,000 worth of property from unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   Hu appealed his sentence, but the Jiangxi Higher Court rejected
the appeal on March 1 after investigating to confirm that the
evidence used against him was authentic and sufficient and he had
been judged properly in accordance with the law, Xinhua reported.
</P>
<P>
   It cited the Supreme Court's decision as saying that ''as a
senior government official, Hu should have acted as a model and
strictly abided by state laws, instead of abusing his power to make
illegal profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hu was made an example to warn other corrupt officials, the
Communist Party's newspaper, People's Daily, said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
   His execution showed that ''no one can escape the punishment of
the law if he has broken the law, no matter how high his position
or how powerful he is,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Hu's was one of 17 high-level corruption cases the government
says investigators broke last year in their seven-year campaign to
wipe out the graft that pervades nearly every aspect of Chinese
life, undermining support for the ruling Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The execution coincided with the annual session of the National
People's Congress, which convened Sunday. Corruption has
overshadowed the gathering: on the eve of the opening session, the
government confirmed that a vice chairman of the congress, Cheng
Kejie, was under investigation for economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   China's practice of executing people convicted of economic
crimes has been condemned by international rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tactic of high-profile executions clearly timed to warn
and frighten top officials is patently not working. The death
penalty is never an effective deterrent against crime and has had
no noticeable impact on levels of corruption, which are still
mind-boggling,'' said Catherine Baber of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into other smuggling and corruption cases have
shaken two wealthy coastal provinces and reached the upper echelons
of power, causing friction among the powerful and raising worries
about party unity at a time of growing social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   While the leadership publicized Hu's death sentence and
execution, they have been less open about communist China's largest
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the smuggling of $9.5 billion worth of
oil and other goods through the port city of Xiamen has divided the
senior leadership, with President Jiang Zemin moving to protect a
Politburo protege, according to party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among those implicated in the scandal was the wife of Beijing
party secretary Jia Qinglin, a Jiang ally.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Mingyi, Fujian's party boss, said there had been a ''a big
breakthrough'' in the Xiamen case but more investigation was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our attitude is that smuggling destroys the economic order,
causing great harm to state property and corrupts some officials,''
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When this case has been wrapped up we will responsibly tell
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of thousands of officials have been punished
and many jailed, China has rarely executed top level officials for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Former Beijing Communist Party chief and mayor Chen Xitong, the
highest-level official publicly punished so far, was sentenced in
1998 to 16 years in prison for his role in a massive graft scandal
that may have cost the city more than $2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Militias Threaten E. Timor Refugees  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Exhausted, Remund Da Silva waited
patiently on a ramshackle dock with his wife, seven children and
hundreds of others for a U.N.-chartered ship back to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Da Silvas are among tens of thousands who fled or were
forced from their homeland during bloody fighting last year. They
sought shelter in squalid camps in Indonesian-controlled West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most refugees going back, Remund admits he took part
in some of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a member of Aitarak, one of several
anti-independence militia gangs that went on a rampage of killings
and destruction after East Timor's people voted overwhelmingly in a
U.N.-supervised ballot to break away from Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''I committed crimes,'' he said, refusing to elaborate. ''But I
just want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after international peacekeepers forced the militia
bands out of East Timor, some gang members want to go home and
start anew.
</P>
<P>
   But worried about revenge attacks or even prosecution, most
remain in squalid and unhealthy refugee camps in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.N. Commission for Refugees say 144,000 people
from 200 camps have returned to the East. But almost as many are
too afraid to return because of ''continuous attacks and
intimidation'' by the militias.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to hold on to the refugees as they feel they have
more power that way,'' UNHCR spokesman William Splinder said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Robert Gelbard, said the remaining
militia groups must be disarmed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that the Indonesian government take measures to
remove militia leaders and help create a better environment within
which people can make choices about whether to go back to East
Timor or whether to become Indonesian citizens,'' he told reporters
in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Disease is also a major problem for the refugees. In Tuapukan
camp, near West Timor's capital, Kupang, many children have scabies
and all are malnourished. Camp doctors say malaria and respiratory
illnesses are rife.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbard said up to 900 camp inmates have died from disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We warned the Indonesian authorities that leaving the people
in the camps during the rainy season would -- not could -- would lead
to an accelerated number of deaths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Indonesia's reformist president, Abdurrahman Wahid,
went to West Timor after a historic first visit to East Timor.
''The era has ended for those who want to resort to violence,'' he
told militia supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But his words have had little impact. A day later, suspected
militia members opened fire at U.N. troops on the border between
West and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Security is also a continuous threat in some of the camps. UNHCR
officials only visit them with armed escorts from the Indonesian
military. A month ago, two foreign visitors were ''beaten and
nearly killed'' by militiamen, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An East Timorese anti-independence leader told The Associated
Press the militias won't give up their struggle until the United
Nations investigates claims that last year's independence vote was
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this can be overcome, then I think we will be happy to
start talking about going back,'' Francisco da Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. has made clear that it has no intention of doing
this, having already rejected all claims of bias and
irregularities. Indonesia's government has accepted the results of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing troubles, some of the demoralized militia
members now want to go home, said Red Cross officer Yayoi Hayashi,
who coordinates a message service between the camps and family and
friends in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the messages Hayashi received recently from a militiaman
read: ''My friend, you may hate me, but I want to return. Everyone
knows I'm a militia, my hands are dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his family's name was called to board the ship home, Da
Silva said he would do anything not to have to go back to the
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports from East Timor that returning militia members
have been attacked and imprisoned, Da Silva said he trusted East
Timorese independence leader Jose ''Xanana'' Gusmao when he said
that past sins should be forgiven and East Timor must look to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''East Timor is my home,'' Da Silva said. ''It is time to go
back.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Outpaces McCain in Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush's Super Tuesday blowout sent
Sen. John McCain to his Arizona retreat to contemplate the future
of his presidential campaign, and launched the Texas governor into
a general election attack on Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A senior McCain aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he expects McCain to depart the GOP contest but cautioned that no
firm decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   In front of his supporters, McCain asserted: ''We will never
give up this mission, my friends'' -- but by ''mission'' he seemed
to mean his effort to reform politics and his party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may meet again in primaries a few days from now,'' McCain
told supporters in Los Angeles and no one missed the implication of
the word ''may.''
</P>
<P>
   Previewing his likely campaign message, Bush told cheering
supporters in his hometown Tuesday night: ''Someone will make
history this November. Either we will ratify the status quo, or we
will have a new beginning in American politics. I say: America must
not give Clinton-Gore four more years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor beat McCain in California and New York -- the
two biggest delegate prizes at stake Tuesday -- and he won five
other primaries as well: Ohio, Georgia, Maine, Missouri and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won only in independent-minded New England -- in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont -- as voters in
13 states participated in the year's largest night of Republican
presidential contests. In all, 613 delegates were at stake. A total
of 1,034 are needed for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 341 Republican delegates will be elected in next
Tuesday's primaries in six Southern states -- territory considered
friendly to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush forged his usual coalitions, relying on party faithful
while McCain drew from independents and moderate Republicans.
McCain's gamble of criticizing conservative Christian leaders may
have backfired in key states, while Bush's visit to a South
Carolina university with a history of anti-Catholic views seemed to
have been a beneficial campaign issue for McCain in some states.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primaries, Gore won all 15 contests against
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, setting the stage for
Bradley's departure and giving Americans seven months to
contemplate their choice between Bush and Gore as the next occupant
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Looking past McCain, Bush congratulated the vice president for
his Super Tuesday sweep, but said, ''He is the candidate of the
status quo in Washington, D.C. ... He's got a tough case to make in
the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   The widespread beating prompted several McCain advisers,
speaking on condition of anonymity, to say the Arizona senator
would take stock of his campaign today when he travels to his
retreat in Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victories earned him all 162 delegates at stake in
California, at least 66 of 101 at stake in New York, 35 from
Missouri and 14 from Maine. He won at least 103 of the 154
delegates at stake in Georgia, Maryland and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won all 25 delegates in Connecticut, all 37 in
Massachusetts, all 12 in Vermont, all 14 from Rhode Island and at
least 26 in New York, giving him an overall total of 225. Bush had
accumulated 571 delegates to date.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes was still in the GOP race, but not a factor in any of
Tuesday's states.
</P>
<P>
   From Maine to California, Super Tuesday voters brought to a
climax six weeks of seesawing contests: McCain up in New Hampshire,
down in South Carolina, up in Michigan and down again last week,
when Bush swept Virginia, North Dakota and Washington state to
solidify his claim as the GOP's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose staff is already raising money and drawing up battle
plans for November, said he was prepared for a tough campaign
against Gore and his Clinton administration allies.
</P>
<P>
   California was Super Tuesday's super state, offering its 162
delegates to the winner and Bush won them all. McCain himself has
said for months that the winner of California's delegate chase
would claim the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The exit surveys across the states showed women preferring Bush
by a 2-to-1 margin over McCain. Among age groups, McCain carried
only younger voters; those over 30 voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Bush said he plans to challenge Gore on
tax cuts, education reform and Social Security reform. He also
plans to revisit the White House affair that led to President
Clinton's impeachment and Gore's own fund-raising problems in the
1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will stand on principle and I will bring honor to this
process and to the office I seek. I will remind Al Gore that
Americans do not want a White House where there is 'no controlling
legal authority.' I will repair the broken bonds of trust between
Americans and their government,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Californians Reject Gay Marriages  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   California voters firmly rejected gay marriages on Tuesday and
set up a high-stakes Senate battle between Democratic incumbent
Dianne Feinstein and moderate Republican Rep. Tom Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of voting dominated by presidential contests in 16
states, two other senators won renomination -- Republican Mike
DeWine of Ohio and Democrat Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The lone incumbent in Congress to be ousted Tuesday was
nine-term California Rep. Matthew ''Marty'' Martinez, who has
bucked Democratic party leadership on gun control and abortion. He
was defeated by state Sen. Hilda Solis, a fellow Hispanic, in his
working-class district near Los Angeles. With no Republicans
running, nomination is tantamount to election.
</P>
<P>
   Solis, a state senator, had won the party's endorsement and held
a 5-to-1 fund-raising advantage. She was polling 62 percent to
Martinez's 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who in 1994 held onto her seat by just a few
percentage points in the nation's costliest Senate race ever,
easily won her nomination. As the year began, she had $2.6 million
on hand, twice as much as Campbell, who gave up his Silicon Valley
seat to challenge her.
</P>
<P>
   On the state's open ballot, where all candidates appear together
regardless of party, Feinstein was piling up 51 percent of the vote
with nearly half the precincts in. Campbell had 24 percent -- three
times as much as his closest GOP challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure, which bars the state from recognizing
same-sex marriages if they are legalized in any other state, drew
heavy spending -- $8 million from supporters and $5.5 million from
opponents. California recognizes only marriages between a man and a
woman, but state law had required it to validate unions legally
performed in other states.
</P>
<P>
   With 47 percent of precincts reporting, the measure was favored
by 65 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, some 40 town meetings in Vermont considered gay
marriage Tuesday and all those that reported results took stands
against it. Lawmakers are considering the issue following a state
Supreme Court ruling that gays are unconstitutionally being denied
benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   California voters also decided 19 other ballot questions,
approving tougher juvenile justice laws and legalizing Indian
gambling while rejecting tighter campaign finance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, DeWine pulled 79 percent of the vote and hopes to
become the state's first Republican senator re-elected since the
1950s. Real estate broker Ted Celeste, the brother of former Gov.
Richard Celeste, won the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Sarbanes, seeking a fifth term, polled 84 percent of the
Democratic vote, and will face former Howard County police chief
Paul Rappaport, winner of an eight-way GOP race.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, both parties are looking to position themselves for
November battles that will determine control of the new Congress.
Currently, Republicans hold a slim majority in the House, 222-212,
and a 55-45 majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two long-time Democratic congressmen faced serious challenges.
Ohio Rep. James Traficant Jr., target of a Justice Department
investigation into organized crime, survived his, fighting off
three challengers to win nomination to a ninth term in his Rust
Belt district that includes Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the seat of Ohio GOP Rep. John Kasich, the
retiring House Budget Chairman, voters nominated his endorsed
successor -- state Rep. Patrick Tiberi -- while Democrats chose
Columbus City Councilwoman Maryellen O'Shaughnessy.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Ohio, Mary Rose Oakar, who spent seven terms in Congress
before the House bank scandal ended her career in 1992, made a
political comeback. She won the Democratic nomination to a state
House seat from a working-class district in Cleveland -- and will
have no Republican opposition in November.
</P>
<P>
   Unsuccessful in a comeback bid was California's Jay Kim, who was
ousted from Congress by voters after he pleaded guilty to accepting
illegal donations to his 1992 campaign. He lost to businessman Elia
Pirozzi in a GOP primary for a chance to challenge Democratic Rep.
Joe Baca.
</P>
<P>
   Also in California, Mark Dornan, the son of former Rep. Robert
Dornan, was lagging in his bid for the GOP nomination in a heavily
Republican district not far from the one that rejected his
firebrand conservative father four years ago. Car alarm millionaire
Darrell Issa, who lost a race for Senate two years ago, led in
early returns.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti was facing a
potential runoff in his effort to win a third term. Garcetti, just
barely re-elected after the O.J. Simpson trial, had been criticized
for his handling of a Police Department corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A November runoff was also likely in the race for San Diego
mayor. None of the candidates hoping to replace Republican Mayor
Susan Golding, who is leaving office after two terms, was coming
close to a majority.

Bush Sends McCain Into Retreat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush's Super Tuesday blowout sent Sen. John
McCain to his Arizona retreat to contemplate the future of his presidential
campaign, and launched the Texas governor into a general election attack on Vice
President Al Gore. A senior McCain aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he expects McCain to depart the GOP contest but cautioned that no firm
decision had been made. In front of his supporters, McCain asserted: ''We will
never give up this mission, my friends'' -- but by ''mission'' he seemed to mean
his effort to reform politics and his party. ''We may meet again in primaries a
few days from now,'' McCain told supporters in Los Angeles and no one missed the
implication of the word ''may.''

Gore Sweeps Past Bradley
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore cleared his way to the Democratic presidential
nomination with a Super Tuesday primary sweep that pushed Bill Bradley to the
brink of withdrawal. ''We need to build on our record of prosperity,'' the vice
president said, turning his focus toward November. ''He won, I lost,'' said
Bradley, all but conceding his challenge was over after losing contests from
Maine to California. Two Democratic party officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said campaign aides had told them the former New Jersey senator
planned to depart the race on Thursday. Gore won in New England, Georgia, Ohio
and several stops in between, regularly gaining 60 percent of the vote or more.

USDA Plans Organic Food Standards
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal rules for organic food will assure consumers
that the products are grown and processed to the same standards nationwide. That
doesn't mean, however, that organic is better than conventional food,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ''Just because something is labeled
organic does not mean that it is any more superior, any safer or more healthy
than conventional food. All food in this country must meet the same high
standards of safety, regardless of their classification,'' Glickman said in
releasing the proposed rules Tuesday.

Keyes Finishes Second in Minnesota
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Keyes got a surprising second-place finish in
Minnesota's GOP straw poll, but finished in single digits in most of Tuesday's
Republican presidential contests. In the straw poll, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
got about two-thirds of the vote, and Keyes was second, with McCain a few points
behind Outside of his performance in Minnesota, Keyes' strongest finish was in
his home state of Maryland where he picked up roughly 7 percent of the vote.

China Executes Senior Official
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Underscoring the government's determination to punish
corruption, China Wednesday executed a deputy provincial governor, one of the
highest-level officials caught in a long campaign to root out graft. Hu
Changqing, former deputy governor of eastern China's Jiangxi province, was
executed this morning in the provincial capital of Nanchang after the Supreme
People's Court upheld his death sentence, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.

Tokyo Subway Derails; 3 Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two subway trains carrying more than 1,500 rush-hour commuters
collided when one of the trains derailed Wednesday, killing three people and
injuring more than 30 others. The impact sheared off the wall of one of the
train's rear cars, ripping out the cushioned seats. Buckled metal and other
debris littered the scene. ''I saw a huge lump of metal penetrating my car, and
everybody was panicking,'' a 21-year-old commuter told national broadcaster NHK.
''Many passengers were collapsing.'' There were 240 passengers on the train that
derailed, and 1,300 on the oncoming train that hit it, the fire department
estimated.

close since March 31, 1999. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which
soared more than 100 points to 5,006.78 in early trading, finished down 57.01 at
4,847.84.

Hornets Defeat Warriors 102-99
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Derrick Coleman scored 14 of Charlotte's final 18
points as the Hornets beat the Golden State Warriors 102-99 on Tuesday night.
Coleman finished with 34 points and 17 rebounds. He was 13-of-20 from the field
and 8-of-8 from the line. The power forward was coming off a 26-point
performance Sunday in the Hornets' home victory over Chicago after missing three
games because of a sprained right ankle. Larry Hughes led the Warriors with 21
points, Donyell Marshall added 19 and Vonteego Cummings had 18.

<HEADLINE> Tough night for McCain's NY supporters  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. John McCain won the right to compete in New
York's presidential primary, but in the end he couldn't triumph
over the state Republican party leaders who threw their support to
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari and U.S. Rep. Peter
King, of Long Island, were the only GOP elected officials at the
Manhattan hotel ballroom where McCain's supporters gathered to
watch Tuesday night's election returns.
</P>
<P>
   Both criticized Gov. George Pataki and the state GOP leadership
for trying to lock McCain out of the New York race. They also said
that given the obstacles arrayed against him, the Arizona senator
could be proud even in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think about where we are and where we were,'' Molinari said
after Bush won more than two-thirds of the delegates at stake in
New York's primary. ''This has been a people's campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment mixed with pride among the several hundred McCain
supporters who gathered in midtown Manhattan, hopeful until the
very end that their candidate would eke out a victory. They chanted
''We want McCain!'' and roared when the candidate, speaking from
Los Angeles, appeared on television.
</P>
<P>
   Most said they hoped McCain would stay in the race despite Super
Tuesday losses in New York, California, Georgia, Maine, Missouri
and Maryland. Many blamed the New York defeat on McCain's small
organization, party leaders' efforts against him and a ballot
system that made delegates' names larger than those of the
candidates they supported, forcing many to vote against their
elected officials if they wanted to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave it a really good shot, and given the odds against him
from the beginning, he did an incredible job,'' said Soheil
Nasseri, 21, a music student from Manhattan. ''I can't wait for him
to run again in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the months leading up to the primary, Pataki and the
state party were solidly behind Bush, fighting a long and
politically damaging battle to keep McCain's name off primary
ballots in more than half the state's congressional districts. Days
after McCain won New Hampshire's primary by a surprisingly large
margin, Pataki dropped the effort to lock him out of the New York
race and a federal judge ordered the Arizonan's delegate slates
onto ballots here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made the most of the issue, using party leaders'
opposition to his candidacy to bolster his image as a reformer and
saying the state's arcane ballot rules were reminiscent of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Like several of McCain's supporters, Kevin Philbin, a lawyer
from Point Lookout, N.Y., said the New York outcome might have been
different had McCain started campaigning earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had the organization and the money early on, it could
have been a whole different race, because George W. Bush may be a
nice guy, but he seems like a lightweight,'' said Philbin, 38.
</P>
<P>
   The delegate results appeared to bolster the credibility of
King, a Nassau County Republican who became a McCain supporter last
month. McCain won 12 of the 15 delegates available on King's home
turf of Long Island, nearly half of his total statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may have been Long Island's many Catholic voters --
who may have responded to criticism of Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University, which has espoused anti-Catholic views -- and anger
about an ad in which the Bush campaign accused McCain of opposing
funding for breast cancer programs.
</P>
<P>
   King said his office received about 100 telephone calls Tuesday
from New Yorkers puzzled by ballots that listed delegates' names in
larger print than candidates'. He said the ballot set-up was just
another way in which party leaders tried to influence the outcome
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Callers ''were afraid they voted the wrong way or they said it
really shook them up when they got in there,'' King said. ''The
Republican Party looks absolutely stupid, and that reflects on the
leaders of our party if they continue this kind of behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Go to Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ending a divisive debate, President Clinton
has decided to make a brief visit to military-led Pakistan later
this month as part of a South Asia tour that also will include an
extended stay in India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was reluctant to visit Pakistan because he believed it
could send the wrong signal to fledgling democracies elsewhere that
are wary about military intervention, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going because Pakistan is a friend,'' said a White House
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He is not going
because he approves of or acquiesces in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be intent on easing tensions between India and
Pakistan, which already have fought three wars. The current ill
feelings have taken on a new dimension because the two countries
happen to be the world's newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave Washington on March 18 and return
the following weekend. He will stop for several hours in Islamabad
at the end of the trip, White House officials said. His stay in
India will be much longer. A stop in Bangladesh also is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of a visit to Pakistan argued that skipping the visit
would be an unnecessary slap to a strategically important country.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and eight
other Democratic senators asked Clinton to consider visiting
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said the trip, the first by a president to the
region since 1978, offers a chance to make progress on controlling
dangerous weapons and the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said that if Clinton had bypassed
Pakistan, it would have precluded the possibility of a future
American role in defusing tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has offered to mediate the Kashmir dispute but only if
both sides agree. India rejects any such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., ranking Democrat on the House
International Relations Committee, said he expects Clinton to
demand ''concrete actions towards restoring democracy, curbing
terrorism and agreements on nonproliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is troubled by Pakistan's relationship with
organizations that have been linked to the hijacking of an Indian
airlines jet in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani military ousted the elected government in October
but the takeover was generally applauded by Pakistanis because the
deposed regime enjoyed scant backing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision came as a relief to Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi said Clinton's ''visit to our
region could be truly historic if it leads to promotion of peace
and security in South Asia and facilitates a just and durable
settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the wishes of the
Kashmiri people.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Pakistan is eager for the return of civilian rule but
not the ''sham democracy'' that prevailed before October's military
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be the first Democratic president to visit
Pakistan. President Nixon paid a visit in 1969 and President
Eisenhower was there a decade or so earlier.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter visited India in 1978 but bypassed Pakistan.
But for much of the Cold War, Pakistan was clearly the preferred
country in Washington, partly because of the close ties India
maintained with the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Affirmative Action Plan Chided  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MARK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- As Gov. Jeb Bush defended his decision
to end affirmative action for university admissions and state
contracts, thousands of people gathered nearby to rally against the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Singing ''We Shall Overcome,'' and waving signs reading ''Jeb
Crow,'' and ''Bush Whack,'' approximately 10,000 people
demonstrated Tuesday against the governor's One Florida plan. It
bans consideration of race and gender in admissions to the state's
10 public universities and in the awarding of state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The protests coincided with the beginning of the Florida
Legislature's regular session and Bush's State of the State address
inside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of Floridians favor the elimination of
affirmative action programs,'' Bush said during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters called the policy a setback for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first step towards resegregation,'' said the Rev.
Timothy McDonald of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated the crowd at 9,000 to 11,000 people.
Participants included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume, the Rev. Martin Luther King III, members of Congress
and state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Zac, the 8-year-old son of Florida State University student
Vicki Whitaker, carried a sign that read ''My Mom Needs Affirmative
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is oppression, pure and simple,'' she said. ''It's not
about color, it's about oppression. They are telling us we have to
trust people will do the right thing, and we know from our history
that will just not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan guarantees college admission to the top 20
percent of each high school graduating class, provided students
have taken college preparatory classes. Texas, Washington state and
California also have ended affirmative action in university
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has put portions of his One Florida plan into effect
through executive order, but other segments still need approval by
the Florida Legislature, both chambers of which are controlled by
Republicans likely to back the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Bush's plan say the state actually will boost
minority enrollment in college and participation in contracting by
reaching out to blacks and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a new energy for minority outreach that is
unprecedented in state government,'' the governor said. ''Our plan
is working.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said Bush doesn't understand the importance of
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you inherit the name, when you inherit legal protection,
when you inherit the wealth, when you inherit skin color, when you
inherit your parents' friends for advantage, you just don't
understand,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, nearly 600 school bus drivers took the day off to
attend the rally, briefly stranding thousands of students.

<HEADLINE> Judge Confirmation Slowing Sought  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Squelching dissent in his own ranks, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott is moving ahead with confirmation votes
on two nominees to the federal bench that conservatives have
successfully blocked for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., who says he will vote against both of President
Clinton's nominations to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, has
scheduled a vote late today to end a filibuster led by conservative
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. That action could set up final confirmation
votes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Paez, currently a U.S. District Court judge in Los
Angeles, has been waiting four years for that vote, longer than any
judge-nominee in modern history. Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco
lawyer, was nominated more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Smith's attempt to prolong the vote, Sen. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., urged Lott to delay action on Paez on the grounds
that the judge may have failed to follow proper federal sentencing
guidelines in the case of John Huang, the former Democratic
fund-raiser accused of raising more than $1 million in illegal
contributions that the Democratic National Committee returned
following the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said that in accepting a plea bargain between Huang and
the Justice Department, Paez should have accepted guidelines ''that
would have required Huang be incarcerated rather than receiving
probation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott last August promised the president that he would give Paez
and Berzon a vote by March 15, and said Tuesday he intended to
proceed with the vote ''unless some unexpected, serious question is
raised about ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would vote against the two because ''I think both
of the nominees for the 9th Circuit are bad nominees ... and they
have a record of activism and rulings that I think are very
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have complained that Paez and Berzon would only add
to the overly liberal record of the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
says he will support the two, and with all 45 Democrats and at
least six other Republicans behind the nominees, they are expected
to win confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations have been complicated by Democratic accusations
-- and vehement Republican denials -- that the GOP minority moves
slower in approving minority and female nominees. Paez is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such aspersions are utterly devoid of truth and are grounded
in nothing more than sinister, crass politics,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans deflected some of the criticism by bringing up and
confirming, 93-0, New Jersey State Superior Court Judge Julio
Fuentes to a seat on the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Fuentes
is the first Hispanic ever to serve on the 3rd Circuit, which
includes New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the Virgin Islands.
He was nominated a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, said that in general Republicans have been reluctant to
move on the president's nominations to the federal bench and there
are now 76 vacancies, nearly 10 percent of all federal judges,
putting a severe burden on those courts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement, welcomed the Fuentes vote while urging
confirmation of Paez and Berzon. ''Both are highly qualified
individuals who will serve the courts and our country with
distinction.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Sweeps Democratic Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Pocketing wins from New York to
California and points in between, Al Gore charged straight ahead at
Republican George W. Bush and, with talk of a ''healing heart and
soul,'' cleared the way for rival Bill Bradley to bow gracefully
out of the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faced a sobering choice as he closeted himself today at
his Montclair, N.J., home to consult with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll make my plans known shortly,'' he said after minority
voters and union workers sealed Gore's Super Tuesday shutout in 15
states -- including Missouri, where Bradley was born, and New York,
where he was a basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Bradley spoke of his mission in the past tense. ''I
believe history will write that we tried to change politics, to
restore trust, and to defeat the politics of expediency,'' he told
supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduling advisory that Bradley aides promised to distribute
to reporters this morning held the promise of a clearer clue as to
whether the former senator from New Jersey would carry on.
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily took as much as 60 percent of the vote in the 15
contests. In a victory address that aides said would become his
standard stump speech, he painted the GOP as beholden to its right
wing -- himself as ''mainstream'' -- and clearly counted on riding
the strong economy to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had the know-how to continue the economic growth
begun under Bill Clinton -- the only time Gore used the president's
name. In an unnamed reference to Bush's policies, Gore cautioned
against ''wasting the (budget) surplus on a risky tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defeated Bradley in primaries in 11 states, including the
big prizes of California and New York. Bradley came closest in
Vermont, where he pulled 44 percent of the vote. In addition, Gore
won party caucuses in North Dakota, Idaho, Washington state and
American Samoa. The two also sought delegates in caucuses in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The victories pushed Gore's delegate total to 1,152 and
Bradley's to 346, according to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emerged from the Republican voting as the prohibitive
front-runner over Sen. John McCain, who today planned to
contemplate the future of his campaign at his Arizona retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Presaging how bitterly personal a race between Bush and Gore
could prove to be, Gore also alluded to the presidency of Bush's
father, George Bush, whom Clinton defeated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to build on our record of prosperity,'' Gore said.
''We don't need to go back to where we were eight years ago. They
tried their approach before; it produced a triple-dip recession and
quadrupled the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore amplified a challenge he first put to Bradley and later
turned on the Republican presidential candidates:
</P>
<P>
   --To agree to a ban on so-called ''soft money'' campaign
donations and all 30- and 60-second political ads.
</P>
<P>
   --To hold joint open meetings with voters plus twice weekly
debates between the nominating conventions and Election Day in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his goal would be ''to make this a contest of ideas
and not insults, a campaign conducted in full daylight and not
through secretly funded, special-interest attack ads or smear
telephone calls from the extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife Tipper also would conduct ''working family
days,'' which aides described as opportunities for both Gores to
visit workplaces and learn firsthand the everyday concerns of
teachers, nurses, factory workers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   He took the offensive on campaign finance, a vulnerability
because of his questionable 1996 fund-raising tactics and an issue
that Bush promised to hammer. ''I bring a commitment born of
personal experience to the battle for campaign reform,'' Gore told
supporters. ''I've learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore was helicoptering to his mother's home in Carthage,
Tenn., for a brief respite before an evening forum with voters in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He extended a conciliatory hand to Bradley, with whom Gore had
traded accusations and insults for months.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley had ''moved and touched'' Americans with his
campaign for better race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes in this healing heart and soul. I share his
commitment to it. I have learned from his passion for it. And
tonight I salute Senator Bradley and his wife, Ernestine,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who made a congratulatory election-night call to Gore
for the first time, claimed credit for having launched ''the
beginning of a new politics'' and for elevating the issues of gun
violence, poverty and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Polling place interviews with voters in every region of the
country underscored the vice president's strength among core
Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks preferred Gore over Bradley by a margin of 6-to-1; and
Hispanics by 8-to-1. The margin among union members was smaller,
but still a healthy 3-to-1.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Claims of an international lottery win were a hoax  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman who sued a bank for not allowing her
access to $700,000 that had accidentally been deposited in her
account has been charged with bank fraud and other crimes that can
carry stiff penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the charges resulted from Susan Rouse Madakor's
reaction to a mistake Chase Manhattan Bank made when it began
depositing large amounts of money into the 40-year-old Brooklyn
woman's account.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bank fraud, Madakor was charged with making false
statements to a bank and bank larceny after she submitted a false
affidavit, the office of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Madakor, who quickly spent a substantial part of the windfall,
had fought to keep the money, saying she thought she had won a
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed in state court, she said she quit her job
last April at a textile company in Manhattan, where she was paid
$23,500 annually and restructured her life ''based upon my new
found wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Willstatter, her lawyer, declined to comment Tuesday
but said a statement would be made another day.
</P>
<P>
   The money, prosecutors alleged, had been accidentally deposited
in Madakor's account because her account number was a single digit
off from one belonging to the United Nations Environmental Program.
Both accounts were with Chase.
</P>
<P>
   The deposits were made between February 1998 and last October by
the governments of France, Italy, Belgium, Turkey, Namibia,
Uruguay, St. Kitts and Dominica, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Chase discovered the error last fall, it froze
about $450,000 remaining in Madakor's accounts. The rest,
prosecutors said, had been either withdrawn by Madakor or moved to
other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Madakor filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan to force the bank to free the money.
</P>
<P>
   In legal papers, she said she had bought $100 worth of
''International Lottery'' tickets in 1997 using her credit card,
believed the U.N. money rightfully belonged to her and that the
bank had waited too long to claim otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had used some of the money to open a Laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   In her affidavit, Madakor said she was ''very excited to receive
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time, I thought I had won the International Lottery,
which I had entered earlier,'' she said. ''No one every questioned
these transfers at all. The transfers came from foreign
governments, and I thought these were structured payments, much
like one would get from the New York state government had I won the
lottery here.''
</P>
<P>
   But a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors said the
statement about the international lottery was false, made only so
that Madakor could keep the money.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said records of several credit card accounts held
by Madakor in 1997 do not reveal any charges for lottery ticket
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   It also accuses Madakor of telling others that she earned the
money modeling, or had come into an inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison
and a fine of $1 million; or twice the gain she derived from the
crime.

<HEADLINE> 50 evacuated after smoky fire in Seton Hall gym  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A small fire in a gymnasium laundry
room at Seton Hall University forced the evacuation of 50 people
and sent nine others to nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall was the site of a Jan. 19 dormitory fire that killed
three students and injured 62 others.
</P>
<P>
   The 7:05 p.m. fire on Tuesday night, which was confined to a
dryer in the basement of the Robert E. Brennan Recreation Center,
was extinguished within minutes by a student, university
spokeswoman Lisa Grider told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Five security guards, a building manager and three student
employees were taken to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston
for treatment of smoke inhalation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all ambulatory and walking around, but officials on
the scene wanted them to be checked out,'' Grider said. ''They were
sent to the hospital strictly as a precautionary measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The names and ages of the victims, who were expected to be
released Tuesday night, were not released.
</P>
<P>
   South Orange Administrator John Gross said those hospitalized
were suffering from apparently minor conditions related to smoke
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people were inside the recreation center when the fire
broke out in the laundry room, which is used mostly to clean towels
and athletic uniforms. A preliminary investigation by fire
officials found that lint buildup in the dryer caused the fire as
the machine was operating, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   The smoky fire had burned only a few minutes when a student who
works at the facility used a fire extinguisher to put it out,
Grider said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of another fire on campus worried some, but Grider
said the situation was quickly under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody seemed pretty calm,'' Grider said. ''I think
everybody was able to pretty quickly put this in perspective.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Defends Missile-Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is defending its missile-defense
program against accusations that contractor TRW faked results of
important tests and overstated the effectiveness of a vital
component.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we have overstated the results of this
program,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Schwartz, a former TRW engineer, has alleged that the
company doctored results from computer and flight tests of its
anti-missile sensor, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The
allegations are contained in a false-claims suit filed by Schwartz
against TRW.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to decide this summer whether to begin
deploying a multibillion-dollar national missile defense system.
Its cost and impact on arms-control agreements have come under
increasing scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   TRW built the sensor for a Boeing kill vehicle, or warhead, to
be sent on a rocket into space. There it is supposed to intercept
enemy missiles, distinguish them from decoys with which an
adversary might surround its intercontinental missile, and then
destroy the missile.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz alleges computer tests showed the sensor doesn't work
nearly as well as advertised. Moreover, she says, a June 1997
flight test of how well the sensor detected a missile in space did
not fare nearly so well as TRW contended.
</P>
<P>
   TRW spokeswoman Marynoele Benson defended the company's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''As was the case with respect to other aspects of TRW's
performance under its contract with Boeing, TRW's results were
reviewed by two independent panels on behalf of the government,
each of which reached conclusions directly contrary to the
allegations Ms. Schwartz made in the litigation she filed,'' Benson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story is largely about a civil suit between a former
employee and her former employer,'' Bacon said. He noted that the
Justice Department saw insufficient merit in Schwartz's claims to
join her suit.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug May Spur Heart Failure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer advocates say the diabetes drug
Rezulin, already notorious for destroying some patients' livers,
also may be linked to 56 cases of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Also, diabetics need warning that two similar medicines touted
as better alternatives to Rezulin are not proven safer, the
consumer group Public Citizen concluded after analyzing hundreds of
pages of government documents about the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen urged that the Food and Drug Administration on
Tuesday to ban Rezulin, and put stronger warning labels on the
competing drugs Avandia and Actos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not use Rezulin at all. It is too dangerous,'' said Dr.
Sidney Wolfe, head of Public Citizen's Health Research Group. ''The
other two we believe should stay on the market, but ... they should
not be first-choice drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   All three drugs are chemically similar. If Rezulin isn't banned,
all three drugs should bear similar warnings that liver toxicity,
heart failure and significant weight gain are among the risks,
Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was widely cheered when it hit the market in 1997 as the
first medicine that promised to resensitize the body to insulin.
But Rezulin's liver toxicity quickly surfaced. Britain banned it in
1998, and several FDA physicians now are pushing to ban Rezulin
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA knows of 85 cases of liver failure linked to Rezulin,
including 58 diabetics who died taking the drug and another seven
who needed liver transplants to survive.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA officials say Rezulin has proven very valuable to some
diabetics whose disease doesn't respond to other treatments, and
thus they haven't decided further action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Public Citizen's petition will ''undergo very careful
consideration,'' said Dr. David Orloff, FDA's deputy metabolic
disease chief.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- After a sentimental visit to
her Czech homeland, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived
in Bosnia today to tackle ethnic conflict in the Balkans and visit
a Bosnian city that Washington hopes can serve as a model of
reconciliation for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During her two-day visit, talks were planned with
representatives of all three ethnic groups -- Muslims, Serbs and
Croats.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Sarajevo from the Czech capital, Prague,
Albright headed to the U.S. Embassy for a meeting with opposition
leaders. She will then travel to the northern city of Brcko, which
had been under sole control of Bosnian Serbs last year but was then
placed under a joint administration of Serbs and the Muslim-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will return to Sarajevo today for meetings with the
national leaders before traveling Thursday to the Bosnian Serb
capital, Banja Luka, for talks with Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Milorad Dodik and other moderate leaders who are at odds with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others accuse Milosevic of fomenting
ethnic conflict, not only in Kosovo but in Bosnia, through efforts
to undermine pro-Western Bosnian Serb politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Brcko is symbolic of the progress that the
international peacekeeping mission has made in preventing a
flare-up of conflict after the bitter 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Brcko was the only territorial issue left
unresolved in the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended the war.
Bosnian Serbs insisted on maintaining control because Brcko is on a
narrow corridor linking Serb-held lands in the east and west of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the Muslim-Croat federation wanted access to the river and
rail facilities. The federation also wanted the thousands of mostly
Muslim refugees to be able to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   International mediators twice postponed a decision on Brcko's
future because of the sensitivity of the issue and the strong
claims by both sides. After the international decision in March
1999 removed it from exclusive Serb control, hundreds of Bosnian
Serbs demonstrated in the Serb half of the country, refusing to
accept its neutrality. The protests eventually died down, however.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday in Prague, Albright noted that critics once
feared the Brcko issue could derail the entire peace process but
''those predictions were wrong.'' Albright said that gives rise to
hope that the same level of cooperation can be reached eventually
in Kosovo, especially in the explosive city of Kosovska Mitrovica,
where dozens were injured in ethnic clashes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During her visit to the Czech Republic, Albright repeatedly said
that ethnic tensions in the Balkans would ease if Serbia,
Yugoslavia's main republic, joined other Balkan countries such as
Slovenia and Croatia in the march toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy is the key to our strategy throughout southeastern
Europe,'' Albright said Tuesday in Prague. ''Democratic governments
are more stable internally, more likely to encourage ethnic
tolerance and more interested in establishing closer economic and
political ties with their neighbors and the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright praised former Yugoslav republics such as Slovenia,
Croatia and Macedonia, which have made progress in building
democratic systems since they broke with Belgrade in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced that the people of Serbia would make a similar
choice if given the chance to do so,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Serbia would be welcomed into the international
community if Milosevic's rule ends because ''certainly there is no
future for Serbia under Milosevic.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Lawyer Pleads 5th in Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Central Intelligence Agency's former
general counsel has invoked his right not to incriminate himself in
refusing to answer questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee
about computer security lapses by former CIA Director John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Neil, who left the agency in 1997, appeared briefly
with his lawyer at a closed hearing of the committee on Yurdfsy.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the lawyer, Roger Spaeder, said he had
advised O'Neil not to testify while Attorney General Janet Reno
reviews an earlier decision not to prosecute Deutch or others.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the conclusion of the attorney general's review, Mr. O'Neil
expects to speak about this matter,'' the statement said. ''We
emphatically deny that Mr. O'Neil, or anyone else, acted to delay
the agency's investigation of the Deutch matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is looking into Deutch's processing of classified
material on unsecured home computers and why it took the CIA so
long to do anything about it. The security lapse was found in
December 1996, as Deutch was leaving the agency, but the CIA
submitted no report to the Justice Department until March 1998 and
did not notify congressional oversight panels until June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Report: NBC Quits Broadcaster Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is reportedly resigning from the National
Association of Broadcasters, saying the group has not fought hard
enough to ease limits on ownership of television stations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to NAB President Edward Fritts, NBC President Robert
Wright said the association has ''chosen to either stand on the
sidelines, drag its feet or flat out oppose the changes that NBC
seeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, which
reported its contents in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also wrote that NBC cannot support policy decisions that
go against ''our best interests, and the interests of sustaining
broadcasting as a growth business and vigorous competitor to pay
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal rules, no company can own stations that
reach more than 35 percent of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   As of September, NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., was
already near that cap, with 13 broadcast outlets reaching about 27
percent of the nation's homes. NBC-affiliated stations reach far
more, but most of those are owned by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Large media companies have been lobbying to get the cap lifted.
In June, the Fox network pulled out of the NAB last year over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller owners of TV stations oppose any increase in the cap.
They fear greater concentration of station ownership, especially by
networks that distribute programming, would put smaller players in
a weak position when negotiating to get shows.
</P>
<P>
   An NAB spokesman told the newspaper that the association
generally supports deregulation but ''our board has spoken on the
35 percent cap and we support retaining it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAB, based in Washington, represents 1,200 TV stations
across the country and more than 5,000 radio stations.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loan Activity Studied  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A congressional commission studying the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund is calling for a major
overhaul in how both lend billions of dollars to the world's
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, a majority of the commission wants the World
Bank to stop lending money in Asia and Latin America to avoid
duplication of regional development banks but continue lending in
Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Meltzer, a Carnegie Mellon University economics professor
and chairman of the International Financial Institution Advisory
Commission, discussed the report Tuesday. It will be the subject of
hearings before the Senate Banking Committee this week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the commission said its 11-member panel had
unanimously supported a proposal that the IMF restrict its efforts
to short-term relief for members having trouble meeting their
balance-of-payment obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, pushing its own package of IMF
changes, also has recommended that the 182-nation institution leave
long-term development loans to its sister lending organization, the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In another unanimous vote, the panel recommended that the IMF,
the World Bank and the various regional development banks forgive
all of the loans they are carrying to around 40 of the world's
poorest nations, many of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and the World Bank were formed at the end of World War
II to intervene in currency crises and finance projects in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Murray, spokesman for the IMF, declined comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   According to Meltzer, the report also said regional development
banks and the World Bank should stop lending most of its money to
mid-income countries, which can get private funds.
</P>
<P>
   That would free money to go to countries truly in need, Meltzer
said. More than 70 percent of World Bank loans -- billions of
dollars -- go to 11 countries that have access to capital markets,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   John Donaldson, who handles legislative issues for the World
Bank, said Tuesday that his organization considered many of the
commission's recommendations impractical and counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we think their recommended actions are derived from
a fundamentally flawed view of the world,'' Donaldson said. ''If we
can bring money to the table, other money will come to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created by Congress in 1998 as a condition
for increasing U.S. financial support to the IMF. Six members were
appointed by House and Senate Republican leaders and five by
Democratic congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The commission approved the report, 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers offered a
package of IMF reforms that anticipated many of the commission's
recommendations, including scaling back loan operations and
refocusing efforts on providing emergency loans to countries in
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Police ponder boycott of St. Patrick's Day parade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Syracuse's men in blue are considering
skipping their traditional appearance in the city's annual showing
of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Police Benevolent Association President Jeff Piedmonte said the
call for a boycott comes as the department suffers low morale.
Members resent the way a fellow police officer was treated in an
assault case against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rumblings are shaking the buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 police officers march in the parade, which is
scheduled for March 18. The 450-member department has always taken
part.
</P>
<P>
   A special union meeting is scheduled for Wednesday and the
parade is the only item on the agenda, Piedmonte said. After
officers have a chance to speak their mind, the PBA's seven-member
executive board will decide what should be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Piedmonte would not say specifically why the union was
considering a boycott, he did say several concerns were involved.
</P>
<P>
   The union's contract expired Dec. 31 and many in the rank and
file remain upset over the handling of a recent case involving
Officer James Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen was charged with assault after he hit a 12-year-old with
a nightstick while trying to break up a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen was suspended for four months without pay and ordered to
undergo sensitivity training. He also had to write a letter of
apology to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Many officers believed Mullen did not act inappropriately under
the circumstances and more than 100 showed up to support him at his
first court appearance. The gauntlet of all white officers
intimidated the victim and her family, who are black, and stirred
racial tensions in the community.
</P>
<P>
   When Police Chief John Falge seemed to side with the victim,
officers said they felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Roy Bernardi said he was dismayed at the prospect of
officers not marching.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an opportunity for the department to showcase itself
... and I think not doing it sends a bad message to the
community,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers said they will march regardless of the vote or the
likelihood of being called traitors, said Officer John Hierholzer.
</P>
<P>
   ''But half of them that are calling us that never march
anyway,'' Hierholzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to do it no matter what,'' he said. ''We enjoy it.
It's once a year to get the chance to walk down the street and have
people cheer for you. It just gives you a good feeling.''

<HEADLINE> Regents: More students taking, passing Regents Exams  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Students taking Regents tests as part of the
state's higher standards are proving the naysayers wrong, top
education officials said Tuesday. More students are passing the
now-required exams than took the tests three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''A powerful message of success brought to you by the young men
and women of the state of New York state,'' Regents Chancellor Carl
Hayden said of the latest school report cards. This is the fourth
year the state has compiled report cards on every public school
throughout New York.
</P>
<P>
   The state is phasing in a plan to require that students pass
Regents tests in five subjects by 2003 in order to get a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Students who entered high school in 1997 must pass the Regents
English and mathematics exams before they graduate beginning in
2001; exams in global studies, U.S. history and government and
science are being phased in at a rate of one each year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report card data show that students and teachers are
rising to the challenge, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of students who took the exam scored at least 55
in June, compared to 63 percent in 1997 and 65 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Results of other tests were not as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of students scoring at least 55 on mathematics
I, global studies, U.S. history and government, and biology is
climbing, generally close to a third of those taking the tests are
failing.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills said he was worried
about the performance of New York City students on the mathematics
I exam. Of the 87 percent of Education Department-tracked students
who took the exam, only 47 percent scored 55 or higher. The failure
rate may point to deficiencies in the curriculum, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of tracked students taking the biology exam has risen
5 percentage points, and the number of these students scoring 55 or
above rose four percentage points, to 55 percent. That means 45
percent of the 123,000 students tested failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said he was not that worried, based on the way schools
rose to meet the English standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we have reason to be cautious with the early returns on
mathematics, the ramp-up in the other subject matter is really very
closely paralleling the way it looked with respect to English,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, success rates on the tests varied by district type.
Among affluent or ''low need'' districts, passing rates on each of
the tests ranged from 85 percent to 90 percent. That's opposed to
52 percent to 68 percent of ''big four'' districts -- Buffalo,
Syracuse, Rochester, and Yonkers -- and 71 percent to 87 percent of
students in ''average need,'' districts passing.
</P>
<P>
   Mills and Hayden said students in poor, or ''high need,'' rural
districts performed much better than their counterparts in urban
and suburban districts. The passing rate among students taking math
in urban and suburban high-need districts was 69 percent compared
to 87 percent in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Senate proposes easing pension rules for older teachers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Pension rules work as a disincentive for
older or retired teachers to share their years of experience with
students and younger teachers, state Senate Republicans said in
urging reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Among a series of bills the lawmakers proposed Tuesday is a
measure to allow teachers who have reached retirement age of 55 to
defer receiving their pensions so they can stay on the job longer
without suffering a pension penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also urged repeal of the current $17,000-a-year
cap on what pensioners can earn before their benefits are reduced
on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are designed to ease what education officials have
recognized in recent years as an impending shortage of teachers. It
is projected that over the next five years, one quarter of New
York's teachers will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators say the problem will be especially acute in New
York City and other urban districts which typically have trouble
attracting teachers, or often lose them to higher-paying suburban
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Other Senate proposals include:
</P>
<P>
   --Paying ''teacher shortage grants'' of $3,400 to those who
commit to working for four years in districts with teacher
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   --Paying $10,000 salary bonuses to experienced teachers who agree
to teach for three years in poorly performing districts.
</P>
<P>
   --Reimbursing teachers up to $2,500 for the cost of qualifying
for national certification through the National Board for
Professional Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno conceded that teacher
shortages are inextricably linked to how much educators are paid.
New York City, with 54,000 teachers retiring over the next five
years and an average teacher salary about 20 percent below that of
nearby suburban districts, is especially vulnerable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said teachers ''have to be compensated competitively'' to
''keep them motivated, to keep them interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the National Education Association of New York,
Gregory Nash, said that nearly half of all teachers leave the
profession within their first five years for higher paying jobs or
other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans estimated that the proposals they advanced
Tuesday would cost about $36 million. They said their plan
parallels, and in some cases improves upon, a $25 million plan
proposed by Republican Gov. George Pataki in his 2000-01 state
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Their ''teacher shortage grant'' is very similar to Pataki's
''Teachers of Tomorrow'' program, for instance. But where Pataki
favored reimbursing eligible teachers for only student loan
repayment, Senate Republicans said the money should be available
for any purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno foresees teachers enticed to come out of retirement as
supplementing existing numbers of teachers, not supplanting them.
State Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, said formerly retired teachers
could be especially valuable at instructing the growing numbers of
students who are being required to attend summer school.
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest teacher union, New York State United
Teachers, praised the Republicans' proposals to give grants to
teachers willing to go into poorly performing schools and the
elimination of pension penalties as ''smart recruiting tools.''
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills likewise applauded
many of the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like what the Senate is doing,'' he said Tuesday. ''At least
I like the proposal. I'll have to see what comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills declined to endorse Bruno's statement that New York City
teachers should be paid more, calling it a collective bargaining
issue between the city and its teacher union. But he said salaries
are a key part of finding and retaining good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to put together a package that will recruit
teachers,'' he said. ''New York City has to recruit a lot of
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martin Connor, Democratic leader in the Senate, called the
Bruno plan ''a big empty box with a little giveaway novelty
rattling around inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor said the Republican plan would do little to address the
fundamental problem behind teacher shortages -- low pay. Republicans
should attack the problem by providing more money to lower class
size and increase school aid so districts can pay teachers better,
Connor said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Visits Key Bosnia City  </HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRCKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- As hundreds of Serbs chanted
''killers'' and obscenities outside her motorcade, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright today visited a Bosnian city meant to
serve as an example of ethnic harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who earlier today concluded a sentimental visit to her
Czech homeland, arrived here for an announcement formally making
Brcko a multiethnic district -- a move agreed to last year in an
effort to placate Serbs, Muslims and Croats who all claim the
northern city.
</P>
<P>
   Brcko already has a multiethnic government approved by the
international officials running the city. Its residents are exempt
from the draft, a symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the
importance of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But as Albright's motorcade drove up to the municipal building
where the announcement and ceremony making the city a district was
to take place, about 300 Serbs began chanting ''killers,''
''thieves,'' and obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   Someone threw an egg that hit one of the vehicles, and many
protesters waved three fingers in the air in the traditional Serb
salute. Some in the crowd also chanted, ''Dodik, traitor'' -- a
reference to Milorad Dodik, the pro-Western premier of the Serb
half of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Brcko was the only territorial issue left
unresolved in the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, which ended the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Brcko had been under sole control of Bosnian Serbs until last
year, when it was placed under joint administration of the Serb
republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serbs insisted on maintaining control because Brcko is
on a narrow corridor linking Serb-held lands in the east and west
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the Muslim-Croat federation wanted access to the river and
rail facilities. The federation also wanted the thousands of mostly
Muslim refugees to be able to return to their homes in Brcko.
</P>
<P>
   International mediators twice postponed a decision on Brcko's
future because of the sensitivity of the issue and the strong
claims by both sides. After the international decision in March
1999 removed it from exclusive Serb control, hundreds of Bosnian
Serbs demonstrated in the Serb half of the country, refusing to
accept its neutrality. The protests eventually died down.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday in the Czech capital, Prague, Albright noted
that critics once feared the Brcko issue could derail the entire
peace process but said ''those predictions were wrong.'' Albright
said that gives rise to hope that the same level of cooperation can
be reached eventually in Kosovo, especially in the explosive city
of Kosovska Mitrovica, where dozens were injured in ethnic clashes
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During her two-day visit here, Albright is to meet with
representatives of all three ethnicities -- Muslims, Serbs and
Croats.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Sarajevo from Prague, Albright headed to the
U.S. Embassy for a meeting with Bosnian opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was to return to Sarajevo today for meetings with the
national leaders before traveling to the Bosnian Serb capital,
Banja Luka, for talks with Dodik, the Bosnian Serb prime minister,
and other moderate leaders at odds with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others accuse Milosevic of continuing to
foment ethnic conflict, not only in Kosovo but in Bosnia through
efforts to undermine pro-Western Bosnian Serb politicians.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 8; Nasdaq Gains 23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today,
with blue chips struggling to regain their balance after Tuesday's
big selloff and technology stocks pushing the Nasdaq composite back
toward 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 8.37 at 9,787.66.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 23.80 at 4,871.64 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 1.88 at 1,357.50.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were locked in a narrow range as investors debated the
best course of action after Tuesday's stunning selloff . The Dow
fell 374 points, bringing its loss for the week to 570 points,
after Procter &AMP; Gamble told investors it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble blamed its troubles on escalating costs of oil
and pulp, sending a chill through the entire consumer products
sector as analysts anticipated that other companies will also
struggle to maintain profit growth. The selling spread throughout
the market, infecting even high-tech issues that have been
relatively insulated from earnings concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries prevented many investors from doing any
bargain-hunting today. Consumer-oriented stocks were weak again,
with 3M down 1\ to 81{ and Wal-Mart down 1\ to 46{.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq made a tentative move back toward 5,000 today on the
strength of Lycos, up 5~ to 73, and Cisco Systems, up 2 to 134
1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated index briefly crossed 5,000 for the
first time Tuesday morning before being pulled down by
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues and advancers were nearly even today on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 171.88 million shares,
ahead of Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.31 to 596.78.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.9 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 0.04 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bradley dropping out, endorsing Gore for Democratic nomination  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley intends to bow out of the
presidential race Thursday and endorse Vice President Al Gore who
vanquished him in 16 Super Tuesday contests from coast to coast,
The Associated Press learned today.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision marks the end of a candidacy that soared
briefly but floundered when the first votes were cast in the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary. It also eliminates the last
shred of doubt that Gore will be the Democratic presidential
nominee, and allows him to turn his attention to November with a
party united behind his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Both men praised one another in public comments Tuesday night
after Gore's victories sealed Bradley's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior Bradley adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the former senator would leave the race Thursday and endorse
Gore at a news conference near his New Jersey headquarters.
Bradley, 56, plans to stay active in public life and is not
expected to rule out another presidential run, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a contentious campaign that stretched for more than a year,
Bradley questioned Gore's truthfulness and dismissed his policies
as small-bore ''old politics.'' Still, he made it clear in recent
days that he would back the party's nominee -- and the adviser said
he would do so in a speech that aides were working hard today to
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's options were few, and his departure assumed, after
Gore swept Tuesday's voting and pivoted quickly to the general
election campaign against likely GOP nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll make my plans known shortly,'' Bradley said after
minority voters and union workers sealed Gore's shutout Tuesday in
15 states -- including Missouri, where Bradley was born, and New
York, where he was a basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bradley made plans to drop out, Gore was criticizing the
Texas governor today on issues from gun control to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of how he will handle one of his own thorniest
issues -- allegations of improper fund-raising in 1996 -- Gore
answered repeated questions on the subject on morning TV shows with
virtually the same words: ''I've learned from my mistakes,'' and
the nation needs campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily took as much as 60 percent of the vote in the 15
contests. In a victory address that aides said would become his
standard stump speech, he painted the GOP as beholden to its right
wing -- himself as ''mainstream'' -- and clearly counted on riding
the strong economy to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' that the two
sides should make the general election campaign one of ''ideas and
not insults.'' He had no insults for Bush today but said the Texas
governor was badly off track in his support for positions of the
National Rifle Association, in recommendations on Social Security
and refusal to support a ban on unregulated ''soft money''
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday night that he had the know-how to continue the
economic growth begun under Bill Clinton -- the only time Gore used
the president's name. In an unnamed reference to Bush's policies,
Gore cautioned against ''wasting the (budget) surplus on a risky
tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defeated Bradley in primaries in 11 states, including the
big prizes of California and New York. Bradley came closest in
Vermont, where he pulled 44 percent of the vote. In addition, Gore
won party caucuses in North Dakota, Idaho, Washington state,
American Samoa and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gained at least 936 delegates, increasing his overall total
to 1,418. He needs 2,170 to win the nomination. Bradley won at
least 349 delegates, for a total of 406, according to the AP's
count.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emerged from the Republican voting as the prohibitive
front-runner over Sen. John McCain, who today planned to
contemplate the future of his campaign at his Arizona retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Presaging how bitterly personal a race between Bush and Gore
could prove to be, Gore also alluded to the presidency of Bush's
father, George Bush, whom Clinton defeated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to build on our record of prosperity,'' Gore said.
''We don't need to go back to where we were eight years ago. They
tried their approach before; it produced a triple-dip recession and
quadrupled the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore amplified a challenge he first put to Bradley and later
turned on the Republican presidential candidates:
</P>
<P>
   --To agree to a ban on so-called ''soft money'' campaign
donations and all 30- and 60-second political ads.
</P>
<P>
   --To hold joint open meetings with voters plus twice weekly
debates between the nominating conventions and Election Day in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his goal would be ''to make this a contest of ideas
and not insults, a campaign conducted in full daylight and not
through secretly funded, special-interest attack ads or smear
telephone calls from the extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview broadcast today on ''Good Morning
America,'' suggested Gore's campaign-finance stance was
self-serving. ''He's trying to make America forget what went on in
Washington, D.C., for the past eight years. Americans aren't going
to forget,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He extended a conciliatory hand to Bradley, with whom Gore had
traded accusations and insults for months.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley had ''moved and touched'' Americans with his
campaign for better race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Polling place interviews with voters in every region of the
country underscored the vice president's strength among core
Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks preferred Gore over Bradley by a margin of 6-to-1; and
Hispanics by 8-to-1. The margin among union members was smaller,
but still a healthy 3-to-1.

<HEADLINE> Gore and Bush win big in New York  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
Bush, relying on the traditional power levers of New York politics,
have scored major victories in the state in their drives for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore -- turning to labor unions, minorities and his party's
elected officials -- all but buried Bill Bradley in Tuesday's New
York primary, an impressive victory on what had once been home
court for the former Knicks basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush relied on Gov. George Pataki and
New York's other Republican leaders to trump Sen. John McCain,
taking at least 65 of the 93 delegates at stake in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush scored victories all across the country in
the Super Tuesday primaries. Bradley planned to leave the race on
Thursday, The Associated Press learned today. McCain was pondering
his future at his mountain retreat in Arizona today.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's New York campaign was run by Pataki, McCain's
troops were a generally ragtag bunch led by Staten Island Borough
President Guy Molinari and U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long Island.
King delivered in a big way for McCain. Of the 15 delegates at
stake on Long Island, McCain won at least 12.
</P>
<P>
   Those Long Island losses cast further doubt on the political
future of the man who has long been the strongest local Republican
leader in the state, Nassau County GOP Chairman Joseph Mondello.
Last year, Democrats ended the decades-long Republican domination
of the Nassau County Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the victories from Maine to California were
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing,'' Gore said from
Tennessee where he watched favorable results stream in from all
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting in New York, Gore had
704,070 votes or 65 percent to 363,487 votes or 33 percent for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''He won, I lost,'' Bradley told supporters at a New York City
hotel. He promised to ''make my plans known shortly'' about whether
he would continue in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp had considered New York a must-win state.
</P>
<P>
   The New York victory was especially sweet for Gore, who finished
a disappointing third in New York's 1988 primary and then quickly
quit that year's presidential race. This time around, he had the
backing of almost all of the state's top elected Democrats and of
its politically powerful labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrats were electing 158 pledged delegates to
the Democratic National Convention with another 85 pledged
delegates to be selected later by party leaders based on the
primary's popular vote outcome.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans didn't vote directly for the candidates,
only for the prospective delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-primary polls had shown Bush and McCain running almost even
in New York even though most of the state's Republican luminaries,
including Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had
lined up behind the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the party organization delivered for Bush in most
areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But as is often the case in New York, local politics threatened
to overshadow the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before the primary, with Pataki launching harsh
attacks against McCain, Giuliani publicly refused to join in and
repeatedly said nice things about the senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday before the primary, Giuliani marched at Molinari's
side during a Staten Island parade as the former congressman handed
out McCain campaign promotions. The mayor, who is running for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, later joined Pataki at
an event promoting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki loyalists suggested Giuliani was more interested in
boosting his own electoral chances than in helping Bush, the mayor
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, Giuliani was openly suggesting that given
Bush's New York victory, Pataki would be a good choice for the
GOP's vice presidential slot.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore win Connecticut primary  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who could have
run as a Connecticut ''favorite son'' but didn't, narrowly lost the
state's Republican presidential primary to Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore easily
defeated former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who spent more time
in the state but lacked the backing of the party machine.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Gore led Bradley 55
percent to 42 percent. McCain led Bush 49 percent to 46 percent.
Alan Keyes ran a distant third with 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, born in Connecticut, never played on his Nutmeg State
connection. His father, the former president, was a student at Yale
University in New Haven when ''Dubya'' was born July 6, 1946. His
grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut
from 1952 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bush largely ignored the state -- with its relatively paltry 25
GOP convention delegates, all of whom will go to McCain -- in favor
of larger prey in California, New York and Ohio. His only recent
visit to Connecticut was a brief airport rally Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke Friday at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, in
what initially appeared would be competing appearances at Roman
Catholic universities in that city. But Bush canceled a speech at
Fairfield University, citing a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCain held a fund-raiser in Greenwich and spoke at
the Metro Hartford Chamber of Commerce. He appeared at Yale in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hunt, a Bloomfield resident who handles investments for a
Hartford insurance company, said he agreed with McCain's stand on
campaign finance reform and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's outside the mold. He's something different,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bush, who had the support of the state's GOP establishment,
Hunt said: ''All I can figure is he's a good puppet. He sits in.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew support from Connecticut's wealthy Indian tribes. A
group of executives of the Mashantucket Pequots and Foxwoods Resort
Casino donated at least $20,900 to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is in his third term as senator from Arizona, is a
past chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. He remains a
member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke at the state Democratic Party's annual fund-raising
dinner on Feb. 19. Bradley's backers were irked that he was not
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Hartford early on the morning after the New
Hampshire primary, and visited the state in mid-February and again
on Thursday. His wife, Ernestine, visited Wesleyan University on
Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairman Ed Marcus lauded the efforts of town
chairmen and labor unions who supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a victory that was achieved with almost no money being
spent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 67 delegates to the Democratic Party convention will
be apportioned among Gore, Bradley and ''uncommitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut did not draw the attention either party gave to
larger states. But Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said
turnout appeared to be running higher than the 20 percent seen
previously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there's been a very lively debate both on the
Republican side and the Democratic side, I think that generated a
lot of interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout appeared highest in Fairfield County, which Bysiewicz
attributed to the campaigns' high visibility in nearby New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Only voters affiliated with one of the major parties could vote
Tuesday. They seemed more influenced by emotion than by issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor, 51, of Hartford cast his ballot at the West End
fire station. He said he was voting for Gore mainly because he
likes him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has more experience than Bradley and he's helped President
Clinton get the country in great shape,'' said the 51-year-old
sanitation worker.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Parker, 71, of Hartford, a retired church secretary who
also voted at the fire station, said she chose for Gore ''because
he's straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley's OK, but I like the way Gore backed up the president
during all that trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Joe Pizzella, 36, a marketing manager who cast his
ballot at a school in West Hartford, said he simply liked Bush
better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush just seems presidential in appearance and the way he
speaks,'' Pizzella said. ''I think he would be a refreshing
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Norton, 69, a Republican who worked as an insurance manager
before retiring, said she thinks Bush would make a dependable
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for him even though even though I disagree with him on
abortion,'' she said. ''I'm not sure McCain is stable; I always get
the feeling he's about to blow, even when he's smiling.''

<HEADLINE> Runaway teen killed in police shootout after killing deputy isburied  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A week ago Monday, the Vincent Smith
everyone thought they knew made tea for his parents and went to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Vincent Smith that no one knew existed woke up before dawn,
took his father's gun, his mother's car and shot dead a sheriff's
deputy 1,000 miles away before dying himself in a shootout with
police.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, friends and family mourned the 16-year-old that for
reasons unknown seemed to transform overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William Bigelow urged the 500 mourners at the
teen-ager's funeral to stop asking why. The question ''probably
will not be answered on this side of the heavenly Jerusalem,'' the
priest said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Vincent was the good-natured and well-adjusted
child of a decorated police lieutenant who aspired to follow his
father and uncle into law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Truly a non-violent person,'' according to friend Ryan
O'Neill, he was more likely to avoid fights than provoke them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before the end of his improbable journey, he would kill a
rookie sheriff's deputy in Kansas and twice engage police in
shootouts, the second of them fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent's father, Buffalo Police Lt. Thomas C. Smith, remains
stunned, said Mary Smith, his friend since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said 'He made us tea that night,''' she said. ''He went to
bed a good kid and woke up scared and alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Lt. Smith wrote to the family of the slain deputy,
the officer who gained national recognition for taking guns off the
streets said: ''I just want you to know that the same boy who
pulled that trigger is not the same boy who we raised and loved.
Something in him snapped and only God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been talk Vincent, an average student, was worried
over his grades, but schoolmates at the all-boys, Roman Catholic
high school he attended doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   The theories stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The family is ''just having such a hard time because it's
something they don't understand,'' Mary Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid never drove before ... They're all just so surprised,
so baffled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was apparently nothing in Vincent's background that would
point to trouble. He went to Mass every Sunday at Holy Family Roman
Catholic Church, where he had been an altar boy, mowed the lawn and
helped shovel snow.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the greatest kid in the world. I could have him as a
son,'' said a church employee.
</P>
<P>
   His father had been honored in Washington by U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno in October 1998 for helping develop innovative
programs that led to the removal of 262 illegal guns from Buffalo
streets.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering Vincent was missing, his parents, older
brothers and sister searched for him all day and all night. Thomas
Smith, known as ''T.C.,'' then filed a missing-person report with
his department.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths' car was found abandoned Wednesday, March 1, in
northwest Missouri. Two people reported giving the teen a ride to
Hiawatha, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Brown County Sheriff's Deputy Todd Widman stopped Vincent in his
patrol car about 6:50 p.m. Wednesday as he walked along a highway.
Smith allegedly pulled his father's 9 mm handgun from a duffel bag,
shot the deputy twice and fled on foot.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, officers spotted Vincent near a Wal-Mart.
He shot at officers, who returned fire. The teen-ager slipped away
again and officers surrounded the area. About a half hour later,
Vincent emerged from a ditch and fired at three troopers,
authorities said. The officers shot back. Vincent died.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary autopsy results released Tuesday indicated that he
died from a gunshot wound to the chest. Widman was killed by two
gunshot wounds, the Brown County (Kan.) Sheriff's Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police officers attended Vincent's funeral in support
of Lt. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember Vinnie,'' Bigelow said, ''as a wonderful and
wonder-filled teen-ager.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opposes Wage-Tax Cut Link  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today accused Republicans of
playing politics by trying to link $122.7 billion in tax cuts with
a bill to raise the minimum wage. ''It is time to stop nickel and
diming the American working people,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined Cabinet members and Democratic leaders of
Congress in a South Lawn ceremony to press Republicans to enact a
$1 increase over two years in the minimum wage. Republicans want to
phase in the increase over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Republican leaders send me a bill that makes workers wait
for another year for their full pay raise and holds the minimum
wage hostage for risky tax cuts that threaten our prosperity, I'll
veto it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to stop nickel and diming American working people
out of the money that they need and deserve,'' the president said.
''This is just wrong.'' He was joined by Cheryl Costas, a checkout
clerk in Colton Alba, Pa., with four children and a disabled
husband. She spoke of her struggle to raise her family with little
money.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
the three-year increase is ''the least worst way to do the wrong
thing.'' He said he did not know if Republicans have the votes
needed to pass the three-year version.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's opposition, House Republicans are forging
ahead with legislation to slash inheritance taxes and cut other
taxes for businesses to offset the cost of raising the minimum wage
by $1 over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders generally oppose raising the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage but are willing to put the question to a floor vote
Thursday to appease GOP moderates who have strong labor
constituencies and to give conservatives another election-year
opportunity to vote for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Using a chunk of the projected budget surplus estimated at
$122.7 billion over 10 years, the tax package would sharply reduce
the estate tax, boost contribution limits for 401(k) plans, make
health insurance fully tax deductible for the self-employed and
enact several tax changes favorable to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
said raising the minimum wage alone would ''saw off the bottom rung
of the economic ladder'' by reducing the number of jobs smaller
employers could afford to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This modest tax relief for those who create jobs will provide
an effective antidote to the job-threatening potential of a higher
minimum wage,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $5.48 this
year, $5.81 in April 2001 and $6.15 in April 2002. Backed by
organized labor, Clinton and congressional Democrats favor a $1
increase over two years and oppose the tax cuts as unnecessary and
tilted toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,
have a bill that would increase the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour
by a dollar over just two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If wages had kept up with worker productivity gains over the
past 25 years, a minimum wage worker would be earning $8.79 an hour
today,'' Kennedy said through a spokesman. ''This disgraceful
disparity shows how far we have fallen short in guaranteeing that
low-income workers receive their fair share of the nation's
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fear the GOP won't permit a vote on their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their bills are too little, and too loaded,'' complained Fred
Clarke, spokesman for Bonior, who has produced an $8 billion tax
plan Clarke said was targeted directly at businesses and others who
would be affected by the minimum wage hike.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke recalled that Clinton vetoed a $792 billion GOP tax cut
last year. ''What they're doing is using the minimum wage to pass a
failed tax plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing or eliminating the estate tax is a cornerstone of the
GOP political agenda and is part of this year's congressional
strategy of passing smaller, bite-sized tax cuts instead of one
massive bill like last year's vetoed package.
</P>
<P>
   The House business tax package would:
</P>
<P>
   --Reduce the top estate tax rate from 55 percent to 50 percent by
2002, reduce all estate tax rates by 1 percentage point in 2003 and
2004 and repeal a surcharge that applies only to estates worth over
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually raise the annual contribution limits for 401(k) plans
from $10,000 to $14,000 by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   --Make health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed fully
tax deductible in 2001, sooner than under current law.
</P>
<P>
   --Give small business a tax write-off on $30,000 of equipment, up
from $19,000; raise the business meal deduction from 50 percent to
60 percent; and restore a law allowing the seller of a business to
pay taxes as installment payments are received, instead of in an
immediate lump sum.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 60.81; Nasdaq Falls 57.18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology stocks
pulling the Nasdaq composite index lower but the Dow Jones
industrials apparently stabilizing one day after their nearly
375-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was down 57.18 at
4,790.66 as nervous investors collected profits from the high-tech
stocks that have soared this year. The Dow was up 60.81 at
9,856.84.
</P>
<P>
   Both indexes reversed direction several times during the
morning. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.25 at
1,357.87, also recovering from an earlier decline.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were searching for a direction after Tuesday's steep
selloff, when the Dow fell 374 points. Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
sparked the selloff after telling investors it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts'
expectations, was down 2 at 58].
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq sank today as investors sold shares of some of the
companies that have performed best in the Nasdaq's recent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the technology-dominated index briefly crossed 5,000
before falling back as investors took profits. That continued
today, with JDS Uniphase down 18~ to 268{ and Applied Materials
down 10[ to 174.
</P>
<P>
   The market was on edge today, still mindful of Procter &AMP;
Gamble's problems, and worrying that other companies' earnings
would suffer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble blamed its troubles on escalating costs of oil
and pulp, sending a chill through the entire consumer products
sector as analysts anticipated that other companies will also
struggle to maintain profit growth. The selling spread throughout
the market, infecting even high-tech issues that have been
relatively insulated from earnings concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries prevented many investors from doing any
bargain-hunting today. Consumer-oriented stocks were weak again,
with 3M down 1\ to 81{ and Wal-Mart down 1\ to 46{.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to
investors' nervousness as he delivered a speech to the Independent
Community Bankers of America in San Antonio, Texas. While Greenspan
did not discuss interest rates or monetary policy, he warned banks
to maintain their lending standards even in the face of strong
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that while Greenspan's remarks didn't touch on
interest rates or inflation, they echoed his concerns about
Americans' inflated expectations of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 392.20 million
shares, behind Tuesday's torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 13.60 to
581.87.

<HEADLINE> Aimee Mann Blooms With 'Magnolia'  </HEADLINE>
By KIM CURTIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Even if you can't remember the song,
chances are you know the 1985 video for Til Tuesday's ''Voices
Carry,'' in which Aimee Mann, stifled by an overbearing, abusive
boyfriend, declares her independence by ripping off her hat and
exposing spiky, bleached blonde hair with a skinny braided
ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   She begins singing from her seat during a stuffy opera, ignoring
her boyfriend's repeated attempts to shush her: ''He wants me, but
only part of the time. He wants me if he could keep me in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Since childhood, the 39-year-old singer-songwriter has done
things her own way.
</P>
<P>
   A tomboy who taught herself to play her brother's guitar while
she was laid up with mononucleosis at age 12, Mann later dropped
out of the Berklee School of Music after four semesters because its
engineering program wasn't strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   She ventured out with a guitar, a powerful voice and heartfelt
lyrics before Jewel, before Paula Cole, before Lilith Fair. And
while she's had some commercial success over the years -- three solo
albums had critical success and even spawned a single or two -- she
remains mostly unknown to the record-buying public.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's tasting success again, on her own terms, for poignant,
straightforward pop with intelligent, honest lyrics, rather than
the in-your-face attitude of years past.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not tangible or immediate,'' she says. ''I'm just making
a living and being moderately successful. There's not a big ego
payoff. It's the absence of feeling like a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's breakthrough could be the movie ''Magnolia,'' about a
traumatic day in the lives of nine characters in Southern
California's San Fernando Valley. She wrote eight of the
soundtrack's 11 songs, including ''Save Me,'' which is up for an
Academy Award for best original song.
</P>
<P>
   Director Paul Thomas Anderson, who tapped Mann's musician
husband Michael Penn for the ''Hard Eight'' and ''Boogie Nights''
soundtracks, says he was listening to her music when he began
writing the script for ''Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything she seemed to be thinking were things that I was
thinking. This may be due to the fact that she was articulating
feelings and ideas better than I ever could and I wanted to rip her
off,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a two-hour appearance in San Francisco -- crooner
Chris Isaak joined her on stage for a pared-down, acoustic version
of the technopop ''Voices Carry'' -- Mann appeared wired, her
stick-straight, white-blonde hair pushed behind her ears. It was
midnight and her eyes were bloodshot, but she was in a chatty mood.
</P>
<P>
   ''A show like this is great. The audience is fantastic, but it's
very stressful. If you're exhausted, you can't feel good about
walking on stage,'' she said in the spare, harshly lit dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has known exhaustion. Some call her the poster girl for
record deals gone bad, for artists who get chewed up and spit out
by the business. If not for her determination and resilience, she
might have quit altogether.
</P>
<P>
   With that oh-so-'80s hair, Mann burst onto the charts at the
height of New Wave and MTV with Boston-based 'Til Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have this idea that you get signed and your worries are
over,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could have been further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The band was finished after its third release, ''Everything's
Different Now,'' a title that proved prophetic. Mann had come into
her own as a serious songwriter. The dance-pop of the group's debut
had evolved into a more mature sound, which was unappreciated by
her bandmates -- and their label.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mann three years to get out of her contract with Epic.
In 1991, she released the critically acclaimed ''Whatever'' on
Imago. But just as she prepared for her second release, the label
lost its distribution deal and its financing.
</P>
<P>
   Mann -- and her album -- languished for two more years until
Geffen signed her in 1994 and, a year later, released ''I'm With
Stupid,'' a sardonic reference to her label woes.
</P>
<P>
   What would she do differently?
</P>
<P>
   ''Virtually everything,'' she answers, from not being so quick
to form a band in the first place to hiring a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to be ignorant'' to try to be a professional
musician, she said. ''It's nearly impossible to have real human
relationships. It's crazy and exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest effort, ''Bachelor No. 2,'' was supposed to be
released on Geffen, which was founded as an artist-friendly oasis
by David Geffen in 1980. Universal bought the label in 1990, but
merged with Polygram last year. It was then swallowed up by
Interscope Records, which has made most of its money from gangsta
rap.
</P>
<P>
   Seven songs for the album were ready in July 1998. But shortly
after handing them over, Mann was told the label executives
''didn't hear a single.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a formula,'' Mann said. ''They really believe they
know what they're doing. They discount the fact that there are
people who want good, intelligent songwriting. ... They're
listening for something else. They will totally miss your meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say they don't hear a single, but they can't tell you
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two new songs Mann wrote to try to appease the record
company was ''Nothing is Good Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The melodic piano arrangement and Mann's mournful voice disguise
the biting lyrics: ''It doesn't really help that you can never say
what you're looking for. But you'll know it when you hear it, know
it when you see it, know it when you see it walk through the door.
So you say, so you've said before. But nothing is good enough for
people like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mann quit fighting. She and her manager, Michael
Hausman, bought back the master tapes and released ''Bachelor'' on
her own new label, Superego.
</P>
<P>
   She's weary of people telling her what can and cannot be done.
When she was growing up in Virginia, she wanted to learn to box and
surf and build model airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The level of opposition I received from people around me was
phenomenal,'' she said. ''You want to do things that express your
personality. It's hurtful to be told over and over your personality
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything's different now. Mann is back in line. On her own
terms, of course.

<HEADLINE> Dancer Bocca Makes Broadway Debut  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL ZADUNAISKY, Associated Press writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Argentine classical dancer Julio Bocca, a star
of American Ballet Theater productions including ''Sleeping
Beauty'' and ''Don Quixote,'' says he's off on a new career with
his recent debut in the Broadway show ''Fosse.''
</P>
<P>
   Invited by co-choreographer Ann Reinking to replace Desmond
Richardson, the 32-year-old Bocca said he accepted without
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a new beginning for me,'' he said in a recent
interview in his dressing room at the Broadhurst Theatre. ''It's a
new experience that allows me to grow as an artist. I've always
wanted to do musical comedy, but I never thought I would begin on
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bocca rejected an invitation to act in ''Carousel''
because he felt he wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time I accepted because I feel more sure of myself and I
know I'll enjoy myself, no matter what the audience thinks or
critics say.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from the stately, classical choreographic style
of Marius Petipa, with its leaps, entrechats and pirouettes, to the
crisp, jazzy style of Fosse was far from effortless, Bocca
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''My body has absorbed the steps, the movements, the relaxation
techniques for 'Sleeping Beauty,' 'Swan Lake' and 'Don Quixote.'
This is completely different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Fosse,'' which Bocca joined on Feb. 15, his first solo is
''Percussion 4'', an explosive number danced to drums. Reinking
cast him in it because ''it is appropriate that it should go to a
dancer with real ballet training,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Julio is a brilliant dancer with eclectic qualities that make
him great for the role,'' Reinking said. ''And he has been simply
superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocca's classical technique -- the majestic poise, the back
arched slightly backwards -- were especially in evidence in numbers
like ''Take Off With Us'' and the haunting ''Mr. Bojangles.'' He
won ovations for his leaps in the trombone solo he shared with
Byron Easley and Holly Cruikshank during the finale, Benny
Goodman's ''Sing, Sing, Sing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to work with Julio for a long time,'' Reinking
said. ''In Fosse, he showed again that he is a truly gifted
dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocca joined the ABT in 1986 on the invitation of Mikhail
Baryshnikov. A year earlier, he had won the gold medal at Moscow's
prestigious international ballet contest.
</P>
<P>
   After his stint on Broadway ends April 9, Bocca will perform in
Milan with Alessandra Ferri. Then it's back to New York for the
May-June season with the ABT, followed by European and American
tours with the Ballet Argentino, the company he founded and leads
in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballet Argentino is best known for modern choreographies to
music by Argentine tango composer Astor Piazzolla, Cuban mambo
composer Damaso Perez Prado and classic pieces such as Mahler's
Adagietto.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Broadway offers a change of pace -- and what a
pace it is.

   ''Eight shows a week!'' he sighed. ''That's also a novelty for
me.''

<HEADLINE> Farnsworth 'Born' for Latest Role  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, N.M. (AP) -- Richard Farnsworth had just turned 78 and
had to walk with a cane because of a weak left hip. Accepting a
leading role in a movie seemed out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   But director David Lynch, working on the film ''The Straight
Story,'' convinced Farnsworth he was perfect for the part: Alvin
Straight, the main character, also was in his 70s and used not one
but two canes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes people are born to play a role, and it's never more
true than in this case,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth was intrigued, for he saw a lot of himself in
Straight, an Iowa man who made headlines in 1994 for riding his
lawnmower more than 250 miles to see his ailing, estranged brother.
For one thing, Farnsworth -- who lives on a ranch in southern New
Mexico -- favors the country style of life, as did Straight.
</P>
<P>
   Though Farnsworth tossed and turned at night during production,
wondering whether he could endure the aches from sitting on a
lawnmower three or four hours a day for six weeks, he turned in a
performance that has won him an Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first leading actor nomination for the now 79-year-old
veteran character actor, a longtime stuntman whose acting career
didn't begin until he was 57. He's the oldest ever to be nominated
for best actor. (He unseated Henry Fonda, nominated at 76 for ''On
Golden Pond.'')
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at his one-time longhorn cattle ranch,
Farnsworth said he doubted he could have made it through production
of ''The Straight Story'' without the customized silicone seat
cushion he used.
</P>
<P>
   Each day he admired Straight's determination more and more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just doing what I did and being able to get off that thing
every half hour, I realized what he'd gone through,'' Farnsworth
said.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth's age doesn't stop him from keeping up with his
45-year-old fiancee, though. Jewely Van Valin, a flight attendant,
stays with him often at his two-bedroom brick house on a 60-acre
ranch among juniper-dotted hills.
</P>
<P>
   In his high-pitched twang, the actor with the wide white
mustache tells how a doctor once warned him that his relationship
with Van Valin could be fatal. ''And I said, 'Well, if she dies,
she dies!''' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   With Van Valin away at work, a scruffy Farnsworth, wearing
sweats and a baseball cap, sits at a wooden table in his cluttered
den, its walls decorated with 8-by-10 photos of him with costars
and friends -- Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, Wilford Brimley. Eight
cowboy hats dangle from a giant set of antlers on the wall, and in
the next room, a Crockpot sits in the sink.
</P>
<P>
   He doodles on a piece of paper and laughs often as he talks
about his slow rise from stand-in to Oscar-nominated actor, and
about his pride in ''The Straight Story.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, playing the part came naturally to Farnsworth.
Both he and Straight were widowed after long marriages. In the
film, which takes place along fields and in small towns in Iowa and
Wisconsin, Farnsworth wore his own clothes -- jeans, plaid shirts
and suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just tickled to death to get to do it because it was so
easy,'' he says. ''Ya know, I'm rural, I drive a tractor, and what
the heck, I didn't have to do any preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Straight, who at age 73 decided to use a 1966 lawnmower to get
to Wisconsin because he had limited vision and no driver's license,
died in 1996. Screenwriter Mary Sweeney and her co-author learned
from Straight's children about his restrained emotions, dignity,
grace and old-school, man's-man ways.
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes describe Farnsworth as well, Sweeney said. ''It
just felt like putting on an old shoe to him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, Farnsworth was a
poor student who dropped out of school during the Depression at age
15 and went to work as a stable boy at a polo barn. His mother
objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her, 'I know that I'm going to make a living doing
something that I don't need a big education for,''' he said. ''I
knew whatever I did, if I could read and write, I could make a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1937, two men from the Paramount studio came
by looking for ponies and mentioned they needed someone who could
ride horses on film. Farnsworth took the job, which paid $7 a day,
about what he had been making per week.
</P>
<P>
   That started his 40-year career as a stand-in and stuntman. He
worked mostly on Westerns, and he doubled stars such as Roy Rogers
and Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the top horse guys in the business,'' said Fred
Lerner, 65, a stuntman who worked with Farnsworth twice and is
president of the Stuntmen's Association of Motion Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Farnsworth was thrown a line or two of dialogue,
but he didn't like having speaking parts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a real squeaky, high voice. I was embarrassed,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired for 1978's ''Comes a Horseman'' to ride and rope
cows, but director Alan J. Pakula added to the part. Farnsworth
ended up with his first and only other Oscar nomination, for best
supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has acted in nearly three dozen films and TV
movies, including ''The Grey Fox,'' ''The Natural,''
''Resurrection,'' ''Rhinestone Cowboy,'' ''Anne of Green Gables''
and ''Misery.''
</P>
<P>
   His 51-year-old son, Diamond Farnsworth, followed in his
footsteps and has become a top stuntman, doubling for Sylvester
Stallone in the ''Rambo'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Farnsworth moved out of his home of 40 years in the
Hollywood Hills and came to the outskirts of Lincoln, a town of 565
in the foothills of two mountain ranges that is known for Billy the
Kid's famous escape.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth has filled his living room with the heads of a moose,
an elk and a deer that he shot with a bow and arrow. His hunting
days are now over, and he sold his cattle once he started having
trouble getting around.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he spends much of his time sitting on his well-worn
sofa and watching old Westerns on TV. He sees himself in many of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Should he win the Oscar, he'll have to clear a spot atop his
stone fireplace, pushing aside the model stagecoach, or the set of
spurs, or perhaps the award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   His may not be the mantel of a typical movie star, but then
Farnsworth doesn't do anything in typical Hollywood style. Not even
when it comes to the March 26 Academy Awards ceremony, which he'll
attend with Van Valin.
</P>
<P>
   ''My agent called and said there's an outfit that wants to make
me a tux,'' Farnsworth said. ''They make them for the honorees. I
said, 'Aw, heck, mine will do.'''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Target Boy Bands' Promoter  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- In the seven years since Lou Pearlman
launched the Backstreet Boys on the road to pop music stardom, his
recording studio here has become ground zero for the country's
preteen music scene.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been beset by a string of lawsuits involving many of
the singers whose careers he launched.
</P>
<P>
   In separate lawsuits, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync have
accused Pearlman of deception and cheating them out of money. Both
groups have since left Pearlman and settled their lawsuits for
undisclosed amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the legal headaches, Pearlman, 45, still has a
stable of young singing groups -- many of them plucked from the
talent pool of singers and dancers working at Orlando's theme
parks. His groups include C-Note, Take 5, LFO and Innosense, a
girl's group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lou Pearlman has this incredible track record. He's someone
you want to have,'' said Andrea Wong, a vice president at ABC
Entertainment who has overseen production of Pearlman's new
television show, ''Making the Band.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pearlman's Orlando recording studio, his groups go through a
boot camp of dance and voice lessons, media training and workouts
with trainers. His company picks up their expenses and group
members often share a house. Pearlman uses market research to test
the songs, looks and styles of his groups.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Pearlman, a portly man with glasses and receding hair,
grew up in New York City's borough of Queens and graduated from
Queens College. He later got a doctorate in business administration
from Century University in Albuquerque, N.M., which offers degrees
through correspondence classes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he plays guitar and is a first cousin of singer Art
Garfunkel, his interest in the music industry came while running an
air charter service, Trans Continental Airlines and Airship
International.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman received a charter request from New Kids on the Block
in the 1980s and was astounded to learn that the group had amassed
$100 million from record sales, tours and merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody didn't realize that the little girl market is still
there,'' Pearlman said. ''What we did is we filled the void.''
</P>
<P>
   He did that by marketing the Backsteet Boys. His initial
investment in the group was $3 million, but the return has been
substantial. Pearlman has an entertainment empire that has been
reported to be worth $950 million. His company, Trans Continental
Co., encompasses a recording studio, business management,
publishing, Web sites, restaurants, an airline and even security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Pearlman was the force behind ''Making the
Band,'' a documentary-style network TV show that follows the lives
of eight young men competing for a spot in the new boy band O-Town.
The show begins airing March 24 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   His groups refer to him as ''Big Poppa,'' and Pearlman said he
remains friendly with the members of Backstreet Boys and NSYNC,
despite the stinging accusations against him in their court papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the guys saying that, it was the lawyers writing
that,'' Pearlman said. ''How can they be upset if I made them
multimillionaires?''
</P>
<P>
   NSYNC's JC Chasez said in court papers last year that Pearlman
was ''an unscrupulous, greedy and sophisticated businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the story of a man -- Lou Pearlman -- who, while hugging
us and calling us 'family,' was picking our pockets, robbing us of
our future and even endangering our health,'' Chasez wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for NSYNC said group members wouldn't comment on
their relationship with Pearlman. Neither would the Backstreet
Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five members of the Backstreet Boys -- Brian
Littrell, Howard Dorough, A.J. McLean and Kevin Richardson -- sued
Pearlman and his management team in 1997, claiming they had earned
more than $10 million but had received less than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Pearlman launched the group in 1993, he set up a
shareholders agreement that made him the ''sixth'' band member,
deserving of one-sixth of the band's revenue from merchandising and
concerts. He encouraged the band to sign management and recording
agreements with Trans Continental, giving his company 43 percent of
the group's revenue for consulting services. The band also gave
power of attorney to Pearlman and Trans Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman booked the band's flights on the airline owned by his
company and encouraged them to invest their savings in his
company's employee investment savings account, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys, who left Trans Continental in 1997, settled
with Pearlman in 1998, but the legal battle isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Wright, whom Pearlman hired in 1993 to manage the band,
has challenged the settlement, claiming she was improperly cut out
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate lawsuit, Jeanne Tanzy Williams, a former talent
agent who claims she helped assemble the Backstreet Boys, said she
was wrongfully denied a portion of their earnings. She is suing
Pearlman and the band.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pearlman filed a $150 million breach of contract
lawsuit against his other great success, NSYNC, after the group
left Trans Continental and Bertelsman Music Group, which
distributed their records. NSYNC signed on with Jive Records,
current home to the Backstreet Boys and teen pop star Britney
Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman tried to make the group change its name, and to stop
the release of their new album. NSYNC countersued for $25 million,
charging that Pearlman cheated them.
</P>
<P>
   They accused him of double-dipping by taking hefty management
fees while controlling the company that received all income from
the band's live performances.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement reached in December, the band will release
its album ''No Strings Attached'' on March 21 while Pearlman and
Trans Continental will continue to get a percentage of NSYNC's
future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits haven't stopped other young musicians, however,
from trying to sign on with Pearlman. Take 19-year-old Jacob
Underwood, who signed up to seek a part in the latest boy band
creation, O-Town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a really good lawyer representing us,'' Underwood said.
''It's a good contract.''

<HEADLINE> Gijsbrechts Was Master of Illusion  </HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Flemish painter Cornelius Gijsbrechts made mystery
his art. His specialty: getting people to see what isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Gijsbrechts' mastery of illusion made him famous more than 300
years ago and delighted the two kings of Denmark for whom he served
as court painter in Copenhagen. After four years, he left the city,
first for Sweden and then for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''His last dated work is from 1675, then he disappears from the
record,'' says David Bomford, senior restorer at the National
Gallery in London. ''We aren't sure where he was born or when and
we don't know where or when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Bomford has curated a show about Gijsbrechts that includes works
from the Statens Museum for Art in Copenhagen never before sent out
of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 paintings on show were done in the style of trompe
l'oeil, a French term meaning ''deceives the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are fooled, even if only for a few seconds, into
thinking the object depicted on a flat canvas is real, that it is
in three dimensions rather than two, with depth as well as height
and width.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still life depicts inanimate objects in a different space from
that of the spectator,'' Bomford explains. ''In trompe l'oeil,
things have to be life-size in order to deceive and in a very
shallow space so that the eye does not detect the lack of depth.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no real dividing line between the painted space and
our space,'' he says. ''In some trompe l'oeil works, the illusion
is continued by hanging the painting without a frame on a wall
which looks exactly like the wall in the painting. To achieve that,
the artist has to be clever enough to paint without leaving brush
marks.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing picture in the Gijsbrechts show, which runs
through May 1, stands on a shelf and leans against the wall. It
appears to be the back of a painting, showing the canvas with a
small label, the stretcher that holds the canvas firm, nails
holding the stretcher to the frame and the frame itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is so natural that spectators are tempted to turn the
painting around to see the front. But this is a painting with two
backs, one painted and one real. There is nothing to see on the
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Other pictures in the show depict paintings with their canvases
peeling off and a wooden cutout shaped like an artist's easel with
all the painter's paraphernalia on it -- palette, brushes, paints
and even miniature paintings used for copying.
</P>
<P>
   There also are paintings of musical instruments, hunting
trophies that appear to be hanging from boards, and hunting
equipment, which the artist copied and which can still be seen at
Rosenborg Palace in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Gijsbrechts' specialty was paintings of letter racks,
crisscrossed with red tape, into which letters, combs, scissors,
seals and other bits and pieces of everyday life were tucked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trompe l'oeil is most effective when it shows a shallow space
and objects depicted life-size. The shallowness is part of the
deception, so a letter rack is ideal,'' Bomford says.
</P>
<P>
   Gijsbrechts also painted glass-fronted cupboards and their
contents, and one cupboard painting has a real hinged door that can
be opened, with a key to extend the illusion. When the door is
opened, the shelves, the objects inside and the cupboard back are
discovered to all be on a flat canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Painters have always tried to deceive as a way of showing
their skill,'' Bomford says.
</P>
<P>
   A famous example concerns the Italian painter Giotto di Bondone,
who lived from 1267 to 1337 and is credited with transforming
Western art by painting people as they looked and creating the
illusion of space around them.
</P>
<P>
   As an apprentice, Giotto painted a fly on the nose of a figure
that his master Cimabue had painted. The fly was so lifelike that
when Cimabue returned to the painting, he tried several times to
brush the fly away.
</P>
<P>
   Gijsbrechts, who was probably born in Antwerp, was
enthusiastically taken up by King Frederick III and his successor,
King Christian V. Both monarchs employed him to paint these
pictures of illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Other painters skilled in the technique include the Dutchman
Samuel van Hoogstraten, who painted a popular peepshow in London's
National Gallery, and the Frenchman Louis-Leopold Boilly.
</P>
<P>
   An American illusionist school in the 19th century was headed by
Michael Harnett, John Frederick Peto and Charles William Peale.
</P>
<P>
   Peale's best-known work is perhaps ''The Staircase Group,'' a
life-size portrait exhibited in Philadelphia that shows two of his
sons mounting a staircase, with a real step at the bottom and a
real doorjamb as a frame.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington is said to have been deceived into doffing his
hat to the boys' portraits.

<HEADLINE> Show Follows Creation of Boy Band  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A sign hanging above a row of television
monitors in the production room of the new ABC television show
''Making the Band'' tells producers and directors, ''Don't Forget
Your Humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign is a reminder to respect the fishbowl existence of
eight singers who will be living together for the next few months
in a house where cameras record their every move.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal: one of five spots in Lou Pearlman's next boy band
creation, O-Town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Making the Band'' can be neatly summed up as MTV's ''The Real
World'' meets the Backstreet Boys. Many of the show's production
staffers are veterans of the reality-based MTV shows ''The Real
World'' and ''Road Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for this show came to Ken Mok, vice president of MTV
Productions, last year when he was blocked from entering a building
in New York's Times Square by a mob of screaming girls awaiting the
arrival of 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   Mok contacted Lou Pearlman, the Orlando-based pop music
impresario who put together the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, and
the concept behind ''Making the Band'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   The show features the making of a boy band -- from auditions to
rehearsals to their first live performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have asked me, 'What's it like to be a fly on
the wall, getting the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync together? What's
it like behind the scenes?''' Pearlman said.
</P>
<P>
   Open auditions were held for hundreds of men ages 18 to 25 in
Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Nashville, New
York and Orlando. The auditions make up the first episode.
</P>
<P>
   In the second episode, the group is whittled down to eight guys,
who move into a spacious house in Orlando where 10 cameras record
everything they do.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 13-show season, the group will be narrowed
down to the five who will become O-Town. Although the first episode
doesn't air until March 24, ABC has already ordered an additional
nine episodes, said network spokeswoman Mozell Miley.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras roll when the guys wake up and go to Pearlman's
recording studio to practice singing and dancing. Cameras follow
when they go on dates. Whenever they leave the house, they must
call producers in the production room, the house's converted
garage, to let them know where they're going so they can be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras have even followed them into the shower. ''It's all
done in good taste,'' said 18-year-old Ashley Angel, one of the
guys on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Editors: The first hour-long episode of ''Making the Band'' airs
at 9 p.m. EST March 24. The half-hour series then moves to a time
slot of 8:30 p.m. EST on Fridays.

<HEADLINE> Book Renews 'American Negro' Debate  </HEADLINE>
By JOE WHEELAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In 1901, William Hannibal Thomas, one-armed
Civil War veteran, teacher, Reconstruction judge and legislator and
nationally known journalist, committed a shocking act of betrayal
against fellow blacks.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of battling racism and urging freedmen to reform
themselves, Thomas wrote an explosive book titled ''The American
Negro'' in which he declared blacks to be ''the waste product of
American civilization.'' He recommended whippings and castrations
for black criminals and the ''utter extermination, root and
branch'' of cultural beliefs and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' diatribe caused a huge stir. White bigots regarded it
with glee -- a black man criticizing blacks. Stunned black leaders
lashed out at Thomas. Booker T. Washington called him ''a man
without a race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Never before had a person of color so thoroughly slandered his
race,'' historian John David Smith writes in his well-told and
carefully researched ''Black Judas: William Hannibal Thomas and The
American Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   Part history, part psychological study, Smith's book, recently
published by the University of Georgia Press, resurrects the
all-but-forgotten ''American Negro'' and is the first work to
attempt to study Thomas, an ambitious, tormented man who sabotaged
his own success at every turn during a life that spanned 92 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every instance, he overcame racism and rose to the top,
only to self-destruct, blaming racism,'' Smith said in an
interview. ''He had what psychologists call an antisocial
personality disorder. ... The African-American community had enough
to deal with in this horribly hostile world from whites without
having to deal with someone from their own race.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 50, who has taught Southern history at North Carolina
State University for 18 years, spent 15 years hunting down the
elusive Thomas, who Smith said purposely covered his tracks to
escape creditors and sheriffs. Confusing his search was the fact
that at least 19 black men named William H. Thomas appeared in
public records during Thomas' life, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The fulcrum of Smith's book is the question: Why did Thomas
write ''American Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Latent emotional and physical forces, present since his young
adulthood but never fully manifested, exploded in a rage of racial
hatred,'' Smith writes.
</P>
<P>
   He points to three events in Thomas' life: his enrollment as the
only black at Otterbein University in Ohio in 1859 and his
departure after enduring physical abuse; his rejection by the Union
Army, which was not accepting black enlistees in 1861, but did in
1863; and the amputation of his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Thomas, who grew up in a free black family in Ohio and
was light-skinned, never was comfortable with being categorized as
black, Smith wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was wounded with the 5th U.S. Colored Troops in 1865
after exemplary service outside Petersburg and Richmond, Va., and
at Fort Fisher, near Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he attended Western Theological Seminary in
Pennsylvania and was a financial agent at Wilberforce University in
Ohio. But he was expelled from the seminary on moral grounds and
fired from Wilberforce for ''financial irregularities.'' Later, he
was accused of stealing funds while on the faculty at Clark
Theological Seminary in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas moved to South Carolina, where he practiced law, became a
trial judge and served in the state House of Representatives.
Democrats ousted him for fighting for blacks' rights, and he sought
a consular appointment. Named consul to West Africa, one of the
worst postings, Thomas never went.
</P>
<P>
   ''By 1877, Thomas had exhibited clear patterns of aberrant
behavior,'' Smith writes. ''He was corrupt, erratic, secretive and
manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he thrived as a columnist for the National Recorder, a
publication of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and he
founded the monthly journal ''The Negro'' in Boston. He routinely
blamed white racism for blacks' plight.
</P>
<P>
   His 1890 book, ''Land and Education,'' urged programs to help
blacks buy land and obtain manual training. But bigotry and chronic
pain from his battle wound were taking a steady toll, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In an 1894 article, Thomas wrote that blacks needed to be
''thoroughly disciplined under competent white supervision.'' Then
came ''American Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His pent-up anger over his racial identity erupted in 'The
American Negro,''' Smith writes. Thomas catalogued blacks' ethnic
characteristics in the worst light.
</P>
<P>
   ''The severity of his language suggested that he was a man in
emotional pain crouched in a metaphorical corner, a lexicon in his
only hand, crying out to be heard,'' Smith writes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' book, published by Macmillan Co., initially drew
favorable reviews from major Eastern newspapers. Then came the
avalanche of negative criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enemies moved quickly to drive a stake through his troubled
soul,'' Smith writes.
</P>
<P>
   W.E.B. DuBois, Washington and other black leaders weighed in,
aided by black journalists who provided details from Thomas'
checkered past. Columnist John Edward Bruce called Thomas ''the
one-armed saddle-colored Judas.''
</P>
<P>
   After ''American Negro,'' Thomas opened a law office in Everett,
Mass., dabbled in Republican politics and wrote a novel and
autobiography, both of which vanished without a trace. In his old
age, he lived in a hotel in Columbus, Ohio, working occasionally as
a janitor until his death in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks ''succored and protected him as one of their own in his
old age,'' Smith writes, describing it as ''an interesting twist of
fate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a further irony, Thomas' death certificate described him as
''Negro.''

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Shows Jews' Paris Paintings  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They came from Eastern Europe, some from
traditional Jewish villages and Orthodox families, others from
well-to-do circumstances in big cities like Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of their backgrounds, the artists featured in a
new exhibit at The Jewish Museum all ended up in cosmopolitan Paris
between 1907 and 1939, an era when Post-Impressionism, Fauvism and
Cubism served up a heady brew of influences. Drawn like other
bohemians and immigrants to the art capital of the world, they
achieved success and renown for their work without hiding their
Jewishness in the decades before Nazism scattered them again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paris in New York'' features 38 works by 12 artists including
Marc Chagall, Max Weber, Chaim Soutine and Amedeo Modigliani. Yes,
Modigliani was Jewish. But thanks to the magic of assimilation and
an Italian name and upbringing (he's the only one of the 12 who
wasn't born in Eastern Europe), it's not well-known. And unlike
Chagall, who grew up in a Russian shtetl and incorporates Jewish
symbols and images into his work, Modigliani's instantly
recognizable portrait style with its oval faces, swan necks and
irisless eyes offer no clues to his religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the 38 paintings and sculptures featured here are
borrowed from private collectors located in New York City; hence
the exhibit's title ''Paris in New York.'' The goal of the show was
to highlight rarely seen works. While that deprives viewers of the
chance to revisit better-known masterpieces, it also brings to
light unknown treasures. The unique audio-tour even features quotes
from the private collectors, and hearing their honest, intimate
reactions to the art is like comparing notes with a friend on how
you personally relate to a certain piece.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Olden, the collector who loaned Jules Pascin's ''The
Turkish Family,'' says that the painting of nine cheerful
individuals, from a little girl to a jaunty man in a top hat,
gathered beneath a blissful cherub, reminded him of how his own
clan arrived in New York from Hitler's Germany: ''We were like
Pascin's Turkish family, like the refugees who escaped from Turkey
in the late 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Two bronze nudes, each about 2 feet tall, by Elie Nadelman, were
loaned by Bernard Goldberg, who is quoted as seeing the two in a
sexual courtship: ''The woman -- very coy, very, very guarded. And
the male, although he is kind of androgynous, is saying, you know,
'Come on, let's get on with it.' ... When the museum asked if they
could borrow one, I said, 'You can't borrow one without the other
because I think they relate to each other.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are two Chagalls in the exhibit: ''Rabbi,'' a moody
painting in blacks and grays of a man standing with his eyes shut,
lost in thought and stroking a long beard, a crowd of tumble-down
houses in the background; and ''Carpenters and Fishes,'' a brightly
colored picture of two men working a handsaw, with a whimsical blue
fish floating in the corner of a yellow sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Modiglianis include several portraits, among them the 1916
masterpiece ''Portrait of Anna (Hanka) Zborowska,'' an almost
classical depiction of a serene, elegant woman with the artist's
trademark hollowed-out eyes, like a statue's gaze gone
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   Chaim Soutine's work is the most unsettling with its grim
depiction of even the most benign subjects. ''Little Girl With a
Doll'' shows a waif with haunting black pools for eyes, her lips
turned down, clutching a lump of a doll with eyes but no face. Both
girl and doll bring to mind Edvard Munch's famous Expressionist
work ''The Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Soutine's ''The Communicant,'' which interestingly portrays a
Catholic subject, shows a girl dressed in a wedding-like gown, but
her expression conveys sorrow and dread. The bloody ''Hanging
Turkey'' bears a gruesome resemblance to a human corpse. And in
''House at Oiseme,'' even his landscape is infused with foreboding
-- black trees, a ghostly mansion, wispy clouds hanging like
question marks.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also features two enchanting sculptures by Jacques
Lipchitz: ''Acrobat on Horseback,'' a joyful study of motion,
curves and lines; and ''Detachable Figure: Seated Musician,'' a
cello player that is both a realistic wooden statue and a Cubist
construct of geometric shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Moise Kisling's ''Large Reclining Nude, Kiki,'' is a sexy 1925
portrait of a well-known artist-model and cabaret singer whose
curvy white body nearly floats above the floral chaise she reclines
on. Mane-Katz's Post-Impressionist ''Landscape'' uses short,
heavily layered streaks of paint to portray a jumble of simple
peak-roofed homes.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit runs through June 25 at the Jewish Museum, located
on Fifth Avenue at 93rd Street. You may want to go a few blocks
down the avenue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is showing
''Painters in Paris: 1895-1950.'' The Met show includes Chagall and
Modigliani among 100 other artists and makes a good companion to
the more modest show at the Jewish Museum.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 39.72; Nasdaq Down 60.33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology stocks
pulling the Nasdaq composite index lower but the Dow Jones
industrials apparently stabilizing one day after their 374-point
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   In midday on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was down 60.33 at 4,787.51
as nervous investors collected profits from the high-tech stocks
that have soared this year. The Dow was up 39.72 at 9,835.75.
</P>
<P>
   Both indexes reversed direction several times during the
morning. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.52 at
1,356.14, also recovering from an earlier decline.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were searching for a direction after Tuesday's steep
selloff, when the Dow fell 374 points. Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
sparked the selloff after telling investors it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts'
expectations, was down 11/16 at 59 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq sank today as investors sold shares of some of the
companies that have performed best in the Nasdaq's recent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the technology-dominated index briefly crossed 5,000
before falling back as investors took profits. That continued
today, with JDS Uniphase down 12\ to 275[ and Applied Materials
down 6 15/16 to 177 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The market was on edge today, still mindful of Procter &AMP;
Gamble's problems, and worrying that other companies' earnings
would suffer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble blamed its troubles on escalating costs of oil
and pulp, sending a chill through the entire consumer products
sector as analysts anticipated that other companies will also
struggle to maintain profit growth. The selling spread throughout
the market, infecting even high-tech issues that have been
relatively insulated from earnings concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries kept investors off-balance, but couldn't prevent
some bargain-hunting among blue-chip stocks. Johnson &AMP; Johnson led
the Dow higher, rising 3 13/16 to 71 3/16. Merck rose 2| to 56].
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to
investors' nervousness as he delivered a speech to the Independent
Community Bankers of America in San Antonio, Texas. While Greenspan
did not discuss interest rates or monetary policy, he warned banks
to maintain their lending standards even in the face of strong
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that while Greenspan's remarks didn't touch on
interest rates or inflation, they echoed his concerns about
Americans' inflated expectations of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 576.09 million
shares, behind Tuesday's torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 11.52 to
583.95.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Lambchop  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- After long days at his job sanding and
finishing hardwood floors, Kurt Wagner comes home to do telephone
interviews with music critics from England and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been going on so long now it's like normal -- dare I
say,'' the 41-year-old musician and artist said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is the leader of Lambchop, a critically acclaimed band
that records for North Carolina-based Merge Records. The band is
more popular abroad than in the United States, where it is
currently touring with Yo La Tengo.
</P>
<P>
   Lambchop's latest CD is ''Nixon,'' which continues the band's
evolution into a soul music unit, with lush string sections and
steel guitar played against Wagner's lyrics, which range from
sardonic to surprisingly gentle to enigmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these lines from ''The Old Gold Shoe'': ''Like painful
Southern bliss the kids out in the street/poured upon like caramel
take their toys and break them/and garnished with some crushed
pecans look at them, then walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Martina McBride to turn that one into a Top 40 hit.
Wagner's voice is an acquired taste, and on ''Nixon,'' he sings
some songs in a strained falsetto.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Nashville, if you're not just this incredibly gifted
technician -- be it a singer or guitar player or whatever -- they
really have trouble getting past that,'' said Wagner, who grew up
in Nashville. ''It really just bugs them. I think that's one of the
reasons I got into art, instead of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in sculpture
from the Memphis Academy of Arts and Montana State University,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was playing music all through this time period, as most art
school students will, and it was never thought of as much more than
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved back to Nashville after a stint in Chicago and started
inviting friends to get together to play music. The group grew from
making home tapes to singles to CDs, eventually getting a recording
deal with Merge, which issued ''I Hope You're Sitting Down'' in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never pursued it as actively promoting ourselves,'' Wagner
said. ''We hardly do it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambchop strives for excellence. It doesn't let the band disrupt
the personal lives of its 13 members, who all work day jobs. The
band generally plays a month's worth of shows spread out over the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It creates this foundation where people's lives are
important,'' Wagner said. ''They shouldn't sacrifice the quality of
their lives in order to just be a musician or to make music. I just
think that that concept is sort of ludicrous. ... You may not be
'successful,' but you can certainly have a normal life -- a house, a
home, a family, dogs, a job -- and make music.''
</P>
<P>
   The current band includes musicians who play baritone saxophone,
vibraphone and Hammond B3 organ. On ''Nixon,'' C. Scott Chase is
credited with playing open-end wrenches and a lacquer thinner can.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is wary of the tendency of record executives to meddle
with a band's sound to make it more commercial. And major labels
tend to lose interest when told that band members can devote only
so much time to Lambchop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather not have to go out and grind floors every day. But,
is that a good enough reason to sacrifice the quality of what you
think you're doing musically? I don't think so,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Casey Affleck Comes Into His Own  </HEADLINE>
By LISI de BOURBON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After three years of being known as Ben
Affleck's little brother, Casey Affleck is finally making his own
mark as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his superstar sibling was growing weary of
questions about being Casey Affleck's older brother, the younger
Affleck joked, ''I think he'll survive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 24-year-old's impending stardom is no laughing matter.
Affleck has appeared in about a dozen films, including the
just-released ''Drowning Mona'' and the upcoming ''Committed,''
starring Heather Graham, Luke Wilson and Goran Visnjic (Dr. Luka
Kovac on NBC's ''ER'').
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of always took sort of the 'under-the-radar approach,'
and I think Ben was on the radar before he was even there,''
Affleck said. ''It was like an anomaly. It was like they were
looking at the radar and said, 'What's that blip?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Affleck brothers, who were born three years apart, got an
early start in acting. One of their mother's college friends was a
casting director in their hometown of Cambridge, Mass., and she
frequently used Ben and Casey as extras in various productions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really familiar with acting more than most kids, and I
think that's when we both kind of started wanting to do it,'' Casey
said.
</P>
<P>
   They joined the theater program at Cambridge Ringe &AMP; Latin, the
prestigious public high school that Ben's friend Matt Damon
attended.
</P>
<P>
   Casey attended Columbia University, but dropped out after two
years to concentrate on acting. He had a small part in ''Good Will
Hunting,'' which brought Damon and Ben fame, fortune and a
screenplay Oscar, and appeared with Ben in the 1999 film ''200
Cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Drowning Mona,'' Affleck is one of the suspects in the
death of Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), the local stinker in the New
York hamlet of Verplancka. The film also stars Danny DeVito and
Jamie Lee Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I showed up on the first day, and we all sat around and read
the script together, and they had their reading glasses out, and we
were sitting back and they weren't doing any jokes,'' Affleck said.
''I realized they're kind of just like my parents or something, you
know, and I felt much more comfortable to be myself after that
experience. It was comforting to see they weren't always
hysterically funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran film stars even gave him a few pointers while the
film was being shot, Affleck said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be in a scene that was supposed to be funny and it
wouldn't be working, and they knew, they were intuitive about it,
and they would just change the scene in different ways that would
put me in a position where I couldn't help but be funny. They made
everyone else look good by being so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck plays Bobby Calzone, the dimwitted but affable fiance of
Ellen Rash (Neve Campbell), whose father (DeVito) is the town's
police chief. The AP review of the film said, ''Casey Affleck as
the picture of innocence is a real find; he could give Leo
(DiCaprio) a run for his money.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Affleck's biggest challenges was wearing a blond wig for
two months. Although being blond was fun, the wig wasn't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would glue it on to my forehead, then around my ears and
on to my neck, and it had to stay on all day because it would take
an hour to take on and off,'' he said. ''Spending 10 hours a day in
somebody else's scalp would get pretty nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck, who lives in Manhattan, said he has no new films at the
moment, but would like to work with Ben again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going to try to wait around until something comes
along that I really, really love instead of just having to do
something just to take a job,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> TV 'Bible' Chronicles the Video Age  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Who'd have guessed that Roger C. Carmel would
last only one season as Kaye Ballard's husband on NBC's ''The
Mothers-in-Law''? And who'd have imagined that, upon his departure,
the balding and irascible Richard Deacon would sign on to play
Roger Buell for the 1968-69 season?
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the preceding paragraph strikes you as even vaguely
familiar, be afraid -- be very afraid. But for Tim Brooks and Earle
Marsh, such thickly cobwebbed corners of television history are far
more than the trivia of obsessiveness. They're the stuff of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden behind a ponderous title, their book, ''The Complete
Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-present,''
is a 1,363-page trove of facts, plot summaries, supporting
characters and air dates for virtually every show to air in prime
time since the dawn of the video age.
</P>
<P>
   The freshly released edition marks the 20th time the authors
have updated their exercise in television arcana, and it's a sight
to see -- a volume worth a permanent berth on any TV stand, where it
can sit poised to answer any of those niggling questions that crop
up during the couch-potato hours.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know who starred in ''Quark,'' a short-lived 1978 sitcom
about life on space station Perma One? Richard Benjamin and ''Mork
&AMP; Mindy's'' Conrad Janis, among others. Can't remember who replaced
Herve Villechaize for the last season of ''Fantasy Island''?
Christopher Hewett as Lawrence. Need facts on what the DuMont
Network was airing at 8 p.m. Thursday during the 1954 season?
''They Stand Accused.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, writing this book involved watching a lot of
TV. Marsh, who worked at NBC, CBS and Showtime before becoming a
computer and media consultant, has five VCRs at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Earle sees a VCR in a video store, it says, 'No! NO!
Don't take me home,''' jokes Brooks, now senior vice president for
research at the USA Network and the Sci-Fi Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh and Brooks, both avid collectors of reference books, were
working together in NBC's research department in the mid-1970s when
they realized there was no definitive reference work about TV --
something that programmers and creative types could turn to when
they were developing a show or needed information about an old one.
TV and radio schools might use it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the public? There was no market there. Publishers saw little
wisdom in producing an encyclopedia of old programs; in those
pre-cable, pre-VCR, pre-nostalgia-craze days, the shows weren't
airing. Brooks and Marsh got rejected 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Then the times began catching up. In 1976, NBC produced an ode
to its old shows; CBS and ABC followed suit. Low-budget UHF
stations in major cities, needing inexpensive programming, began
airing the likes of ''The Mothers-in-Law,'' ''The Phil Silvers
Show'' and ''The Twilight Zone,'' rearing a second generation on
fare both obscure and classic.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1979, the first edition was published, with facts about
more than 3,000 shows from ''I Love Lucy'' to ''Star Trek.'' It was
designed to be a definitive reference, but not for the industry --
for the public.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, it was comparatively easy. There were just three
networks to deal with -- all within a few Manhattan blocks of each
other -- and each let the authors into its files.
</P>
<P>
   One early problem was chronicling the DuMont Network, which went
out of business in 1956. But with the help of a former DuMont
executive and old TV Guides, they cobbled together the information.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of the Big Three networks' old files have been
destroyed as well, so much of the information Brooks and Marsh
obtained during the 1970s would be impossible to procure today.
''We were there at the right time,'' Brooks says. ''It was a whole
history that would have disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 editions, the book remains an ever-growing, cable
TV-fed wealth of information on more than 5,500 series -- a virtual
bible of TV (a metaphor that makes Marsh groan) that presented
numerous oddball research challenges for the authors.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles are many: differentiating between former Miss America
Vanessa Williams and ''Melrose Place'' actress Vanessa Williams;
learning that the annals of television contained a male Pat Conway
and a female one; getting a handle on variety shows with
quick-change casts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you have any idea how long it took to sort out the regulars
in 'Saturday Night Live' and what years they were on?'' Brooks
grouses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is syndication, added in the second edition after the
two began getting letters that demanded to know, for example, ''why
'Highway Patrol' isn't in your book.''
</P>
<P>
   The two do have best-beloveds among the thousands they've
documented. Brooks cites ''The A-Team'' and, yes, ''Quark.'' Marsh
loves ''Maverick'' and ''The Rockford Files,'' and speaks of ''a
warm spot I've always had for Jim Garner.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the meticulous attention to detail, the directory is
ultimately a labor of love by two people who think that what we
watch is important.
</P>
<P>
   ''For all the complaining that everybody does about television,
other than sleeping and working, people spend more time with it
than with anything else in their lives,'' Marsh says. ''It's become
such an integral part of American life that if you just ignored it,
it would be a crying shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the next edition, then, the quest for perfection goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the girlfriend's last name in Gomer Pyle?'' Brooks asks
Marsh. ''You know -- Bunny?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bunny has had several different last names,'' Marsh says
authoritatively.
</P>
<P>
   Says Brooks: ''That's the kind of stuff you have to watch out
for.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Higher Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rallied Democrats to support
a higher minimum wage on Wednesday and vowed to veto a Republican
plan that would delay the increase and link it to $122.7 billion in
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Republican leaders send me a bill that makes workers wait
for another year for their full pay raise and holds the minimum
wage hostage for risky tax cuts that threaten our prosperity, I'll
veto it,'' said Clinton, who hosted Cabinet members, labor and
community leaders and Democratic lawmakers on the South Lawn of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to stop nickel and diming American working people
out of the money that they need and deserve,'' the president said.
''This is just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders were planning their legislative
strategy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP wants to enact a $1 increase over three years and couple
it with $122.7 billion in tax cuts -- a move that resurrects
portions of the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut package that
Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is backing a Democratic plan to increase the wage by $1
over just two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This modest increase would simply restore the minimum wage to
what it was in real dollar terms in 1982,'' Clinton said. ''For a
full-time worker, however, this would mean another $2,000 a year.
And if you're on the minimum wage, that's real money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Costas, a checkout clerk in Colton Alba, Pa., with four
children and a disabled husband, spoke of her struggle to raise her
family on $5.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am grateful that you are fighting to raise the minimum wage
for families like mine,'' she told Clinton. ''I know how important
a dollar more an hour will be for my husband, my children and me.
And so do you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of the Democrats'
minimum wage bill in the Senate, characterized the conflict as a
''women's issue, because the majority who receive the increase ...
are women,'' and a ''civil rights issue'' because many minorities
also would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
the three-year increase is ''the least worst way to do the wrong
thing.'' He said he did not know if Republicans have the votes
needed to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's opposition, House Republicans are forging
ahead with legislation to slash inheritance taxes and cut other
taxes for businesses to offset the cost of raising the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders generally oppose raising the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage but are willing to put the question to a House vote
Thursday to appease GOP moderates who have strong labor
constituencies and to give conservatives another election-year
opportunity to vote for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Using a chunk of the projected budget surplus estimated at
$122.7 billion over 10 years, the tax package would sharply reduce
the estate tax, boost contribution limits for 401(k) plans, make
health insurance fully tax deductible for the self-employed and
enact several tax changes favorable to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $5.48 this
year, $5.81 in April 2001 and $6.15 in April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., has developed an $8 billion
tax-cutting package targeted at small business owners and others
who would be directly affected by a $1 increase in the minimum wage
over two years.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 23.21; Dow Up 82.22  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology stocks
pulling the Nasdaq composite index lower but the Dow Jones
industrials apparently stabilizing one day after their 374-point
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was down 23.21
at 4,824.63 as nervous investors collected profits from the
high-tech stocks that have soared this year. The Dow was up 82.22
at 9,878.25.
</P>
<P>
   Both indexes reversed direction several times during the
morning. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.65 at
1,364.27, also recovering from an earlier decline.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were searching for a direction after Tuesday's steep
selloff, when the Dow fell 374 points. Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
sparked the selloff after telling investors it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts'
expectations, dropped 2 13/16 to 57 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the market remained on edge as investors mindful of
Procter &AMP; Gamble's problems worried that other companies' earnings
would suffer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble blamed its troubles on escalating costs of oil
and pulp, sending a chill through the entire consumer products
sector as analysts anticipated that other companies will also
struggle to maintain profit growth. The selling spread throughout
the market, infecting even high-tech issues that have been
relatively insulated from earnings concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said investors appeared to believe that the
blue chips had paid too great a price for Procter &AMP; Gamble's
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense to the magnitude of the selloff,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo. ''It was an overreaction that has really
created some good buying opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow higher, rising 3 9/16 to 70 15/16.
Merck rose 3[ to 56~.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped today as investors sold shares of some of the
companies that have performed best in the Nasdaq's recent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the technology-dominated index briefly crossed 5,000
before falling back as investors took profits. That continued
today, with JDS Uniphase down 13~ to 273{ and Applied Materials
down 4 11/16 to 179 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to
investors' nervousness as he delivered a speech to the Independent
Community Bankers of America in San Antonio, Texas. While Greenspan
did not discuss interest rates or monetary policy, he warned banks
to maintain their lending standards even in the face of strong
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that while Greenspan's remarks didn't touch on
interest rates or inflation, they echoed his concerns about
Americans' inflated expectations of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 828.79 million
shares, behind Tuesday's torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.76 to 586.71.

   The millionaire who picked a wife on Fox TV, only to be dumped

<HEADLINE> Woman dies before right-to-die case can be heard by appeals court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Alice Pouliot Blouin had already made the
decision to let her sister go. When the end came, though, it was no
less easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You think you are prepared for this, but you're really not,''
said Blouin. ''It was probably the hardest decision I've ever had
to make in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was made that much more difficult by the state, which fought
the family over what they said was Sheila Pouliot's right to die
with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old woman, at the center of a legal battle for more
than two months, died Monday night at University Hospital less than
24 hours before an appeals court was to consider whether to
continue her hydration treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Pouliot was profoundly mentally and physically disabled since
infancy. Her family cared for her at home until she was 20. She was
then placed in a developmental home. Shortly before Christmas, she
was admitted to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Her family went to court in late December to block the hospital
-- a state health care institution -- from providing nutrition or any
lifesaving medical procedures to Pouliot so she could die with
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just couldn't watch her go through this anymore,'' said
Blouin, who was at her sister's bedside Monday when she died.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice James Tormey signed an order in
early January barring the hospital from initiating lifesaving
treatment, based on doctors' opinions that death was imminent and
any such intervention would serve only to prolong Pouliot's pain.
</P>
<P>
   The state appealed and the dispute resulted in a compromise with
the hospital being allowed to provide sugar water through an
existing intravenous feeding line into Pouliot's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Pouliot surprised her family and her doctors by living longer
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The court battle erupted again last week when the family sought
court permission to terminate the sugar water treatment. Doctors
said the water being given to Pouliot was doing nothing to stop her
body from consuming itself on a slow march toward death.
</P>
<P>
   Tormey sided with the family and ordered the hydration
terminated. But the state attorney general's office again appealed,
obtaining a stay that blocked Tormey's order from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, state Supreme Court Appellate Justice John Lawton
temporarily lifted the stay until the full court in Rochester could
address the issue on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pouliot's death eliminated the need for the appellate court to
address the stay. But it does not necessarily end the case.
</P>
<P>
   The state could continue to pursue its appeal of Tormey's ruling
under a public policy exception.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Winthrop Thurlow said Tuesday it was
too early to say whether the would be done. He offered sympathy to
the family.

<HEADLINE> Singer Backs Domestic Violence Law  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN BIERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Singer Michael Bolton and TV actress Erin Gray
gave lawmakers a 40,000-signature petition Wednesday urging them to
extend the 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year in our nation about 1.5 million women are victims
of domestic violence,'' said Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., sponsor of
the bill to extend the law beyond its scheduled expiration Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''This critical legislation has improved services for victims of
domestic violence, while giving them access to justice and
increased safety,'' Morella said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who starred in the TV series ''Silver Spoons,'' recounted
abuse inflicted on both her mother and herself. ''We must heal the
whole situation or the victim will slip back into the whole cycle
of violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I've seen it's far from an old issue,'' Bolton said,
referring to what he said was an ebb in media attention on the
subject. ''The survivors here tell me otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lives quite literally may be lost'' if Congress does not move
quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions organized by the National Task Force to End Sexual
and Domestic Violence Against Women were distributed and signed at
Lilith Fair and other concerts during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to renew the law comes amid a constitutional
challenge to part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to decide by late June whether
Congress exceeded its authority with one provision in the law
allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The
court case, focusing on a Virginia Tech student's lawsuit against
two football players she says raped her in a dormitory room, does
not involve the 1994 law's criminal provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the law would cost about $1 billion over five years,
according to the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence. The
money would fund shelters and services, hotlines, training for law
enforcement officers, rape prevention education and detection,
grants for community initiatives, and other related services.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns Against Risky Loans  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday sounded his second warning note about the economy this
week, cautioning bankers to avoid making loans on the expectation
that the record-breaking expansion will continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks to a bankers' group appeared to be the latest in a
series of recent efforts by federal regulators to forestall a
repeat of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early
1990s. In that debacle, lax lending, aggressive expansion into new
lines of business and fraud at some S&AMP;Ls eventually forced a
government bailout of hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said there was a ''troubling trend'' of many banks
taking the strong economy for granted and considering it ''ordinary
and expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lending granted on that basis could have grave consequences
for the (banking) industry's ability to weather weaker economic
conditions,'' he said in a text of his speech to the Independent
Community Bankers of America at its meeting in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust (economic) conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came two days after he publicly expressed concern
that the nation's record-breaking economic expansion could be ended
by a resurgence of inflation unless growth slowed to a more
sustainable level.
</P>
<P>
   Private economists viewed Greenspan's comments Monday as a clear
signal that the central bank, which has already boosted interest
rates four times since June, is prepared to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that
banks charge each other, up a full percentage point to 5.75
percent. That in turn has lifted commercial banks' prime lending
rate, the benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans, by
a full percentage point to 8.75 percent, its highest level in
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Greenspan noted that amid the strong economy,
lenient lending standards and fraud at some banks recently have
caused big losses to the federal deposit insurance funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by its largest losses
from bank failures since the early 1990s, last month told its
examiners to keep alert for warning signs of possible fraud at the
banks they inspect. Fraud is said to have been a major factor in
three recent bank collapses, two of which cost the FDIC's insurance
funds an estimated $982 million.
</P>
<P>
   There were eight U.S. bank failures last year.
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC, which has predicted that as many as 20 banks could go
under this year, also has proposed that capital requirements be
doubled for banks that specialize in risky loans to people with
inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, senior Democrat on the House
Banking Committee, on Wednesday proposed merging the federal bank
insurance fund with the insurance fund for savings and loans to
create a single, more diverse fund that would be ''less vulnerable
to regional economic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees
nationally chartered banks, told the Independent Community Bankers
on Tuesday that many banks are letting their internal controls
slip. In response, Hawke said, his agency is ''reconcentrating its
supervisory focus on internal controls and audits.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where effective policies and procedures, and the will to
enforce them, strike us as lacking, we will bring our concerns to
the attention of management ... and make clear their
responsibility,'' Hawke told the bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said bankers and examiners ''need to be continuously
vigilant about traditional causes of bank failure such as fraud ...
and rapid entry into new and unfamiliar activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ''History has shown that entry into new business lines without
the experience, tools and controls to do the job right most often
leads to losses and sometimes, failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Greenspan's speech, James Chessen, chief economist
of the American Bankers Association, said, ''Regulators are paid to
worry and they do a very, very good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one disagrees that it always pays to be prudent and to pay
attention to what's over the next hill,'' Chessen said. ''But
bankers are also very sensitive to the needs of businesses and
customers for credit.''

   Fed Survey Finds Economic Growth
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is still growing strongly with
only limited consumer price increases, the Federal Reserve reported
today. The Fed survey, compiled from reports from its 12 regional
banks, also said labor markets remain tight around the country. But
''despite faster wage growth for some workers, increases in the
prices of final goods and services were limited overall, although
the prices of transportation services and some industrial
commodities rose noticeably,'' the Fed said. The survey, known as
the ''beige book'' for the color of its cover, will be used when
Fed policy-makers meet March 21 to review the central bank's stance
on interest rates. There's considerable expectation that the Fed
may raise interest rates.

   Greenspan Warns Against Complacency
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today
cautioned bankers not to take the current strong economy for
granted when making loans. In a speech to a community bankers'
group, he said a downturn could bring defaults on the loans, and
that complacency could have grave consequences for the banking
industry's ability to cope with weaker economic conditions.

   Qwest Denies Merger Are Dead
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Qwest Communications Inc. gyrated in
trading today as the company denied a report that its negotiations
with another telecommunications company had broken down. The New
York Times reported that negotiations between Qwest and Deutsche
Telekcom AG had ''essentially ended,'' citing executives close to
the talks. Qwest shares fell as much as 10 percent but regained
much of the lost ground after Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach said
The Times' story was ''inaccurate.'' Qwest has confirmed it is
holding talks with another telecom company but has not given its
name. In July, Qwest struck a deal to acquire U S West, a regional
telephone company based in Denver.

gigahertz processor today. The gigahertz chips -- Intel's Pentium
III and AMD's Athlon -- speed up everything from games to graphics
and have the ability to execute three program instructions at a

integration and Internet services. Cisco will hold the remaining
4.9 percent for an investment of $835 million in the joint venture

   Britons May Get Cheaper Net Access
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Online service providers in Britain are deciding,
one by one, that the fastest way to win customers is to slash
prices for Internet access. British Telecommunications PLC became
the fourth company this week to offer low-cost Internet service
similar to what Americans now enjoy. Most Britons have to pay local
phone charges for each minute they use the Internet, although some
subscribe to a service and get free weekend and evening calls.
Industry analysts argue that this per-minute cost is slowing the
expansion of Internet usage and retarding the growth of e-commerce.

later remarks by Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh,

recently as Tuesday, Zanganeh said the latest increase in prices
was only ''transitory'' and no hasty decision should be made.

   World Markets Feel Volatile Trading
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Overseas markets were somewhat shaken by
yesterday's big fall on Wall Street. In Paris today, the benchmark
CAC 95 index was down 1.50 percent, while London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange index was down 0.86 percent and the Frankfurt
Xetra DAX index was down 0.97 percent. In earlier trading in Tokyo
and Singapore, stock indexes were able to hold their losses to
below 1 percent in volatile trading. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock
Average, which fell sharply when trading began, ended the session
at 19,766.80, down 177.44, or 0.89 percent, from the day before. In
Hong Kong, stocks were down sharply in early trading but turned
around late in the session. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose
86.07, or 0.5 percent, to 17,951.43, a new closing highs.

<HEADLINE> British Index Adds High-Tech Firms  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Skyrocketing prices for shares in high-tech
companies led Wednesday to a dramatic reshuffle in the bellwether
stock index for Britain's 100 most valuable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index added an unprecedented
nine companies to its ranks, including high-flying
telecommunications firms and the country's most popular Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for them, it demoted nine other companies operating
in more-traditional industries, such as brewing, utilities and
cigarette production, to its second tier of the top 250 British
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Among those booted from the FTSE-100 index was Allied Domecq,
owner of the Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores, the Dunkin' Donuts
snack chain and some of the world's best-known liquor brands,
including Ballantine's Scotch and Beefeater gin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the biggest change ever,'' said Steven Vale, a spokesman
for FTSE International, which compiles the index.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's reflecting that the market is volatile. The market is
valuing some of these new IT (information technology), high-tech
stocks more highly that some traditional stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until this latest reorganization, the largest number of
companies added to the stock index at any one time was six.
</P>
<P>
   FTSE International, a joint venture between the London Stock
Exchange and the Financial Times newspaper, first created and
monitored its index of the top 100 companies in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Each quarter it reviews the market capitalization of companies
making up the index and adjusts it accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Among those rising to the top 100 this time around are Cable &AMP;
Wireless Communications, a phone company; Freeserve, an Internet
service provider, and Psion, which makes portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   The changes take effect March 18.
</P>
<P>
   Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British
Industry, said investors' fascination with Internet startups has
raised concerns about older industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whilst certain dot-com companies and other companies of
tomorrow will obviously succeed, ... there's a serious worry that
other very good companies miss out on access to capital that was
there before,'' Jones told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a worry for jobs,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Water and PowerGen, two of Britain's largest utility
companies, fell from the FTSE-100 index, as did cigarette maker
Imperial Tobacco and brewing company Scottish &AMP; Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
   The FTSE-100 stood at 1,000 points when it was launched 17 years
ago. It ended trading Wednesday at 6411.2 points, down 55.3 points,
or 0.9 percent, from Tuesday's close.

<HEADLINE> Corporate Tax Shelters Said Problem  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proliferation of corporate tax shelters poses
a serious problem, a top Republican senator said Wednesday, but he
stopped short of supporting the Clinton administration's call for
Congress to pass a broad new law to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said the
focus of any legislation should be greater disclosure of such
transactions to the government and tougher penalties on the
promoters and advisers of tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that corporate tax shelters are a serious problem,''
Roth said at a hearing of his committee. ''The question is: How do
we constructively fix it in a manner that does not unduly affect
legitimate business transactions?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants a new law defining a wrongful corporate
tax shelter as an arrangement that wouldn't make economic sense
without the tax benefits. That definition is now used by courts in
deciding tax shelter cases but has never been part of U.S. tax law.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Roth, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
the growth of corporate tax shelters is ''the most significant
compliance problem'' confronting the U.S. tax system, one that
costs billions of dollars a year in lost revenue and, more
importantly, could undermine respect for voluntary payment of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to address this issue in a meaningful way would put
the fairness and efficacy of our tax system at risk,'' Summers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers is pushing Congress to impose a 25 percent excise tax on
the marketers and buyers of tax shelters and an increase in the
penalty for corporate tax underreporting from 20 percent to 40
percent. The administration also wants greater disclosure, in
addition to the broader anti-shelter law.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy Paull, chief of staff of Congress' Joint Committee on
Taxation, said tougher penalties appear warranted but, like Roth,
did not agree with Summers on the need for a broad law attempting
to define tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you try to legislate, the net will have to be drawn very
broadly. And there will be holes in that net,'' Paull told the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kies, a former Joint Committee on Taxation chief of
staff who is now with the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm,
said he could see ''no credible evidence'' of a downturn in
corporate tax collections that could be attributed to tax shelters.
Kies said the government already has plenty of powers to get at the
problem and called Summers comments about tax shelters
''overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic data indicate no need for these radical
changes,'' Kies said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel plans to hold a second day of hearings on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 88.74  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher in late trading today after
the Federal Reserve's latest report on the economy reassured
nervous investors following Tuesday's huge selloff.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 88.74 at 9,884.77, recovering some
of the 374 points it lost Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which had tumbled as much as 125
points in early trading today, was up 31.54 at 4,879.38.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 16.27 at 1,371.89.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after Fed economists released its ''beige book''
survey of economic conditions, which indicated that while workers'
wages are rising, there is little evidence of inflation in the
overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which central bankers will consider when they meet
March 21 to discuss their interest rate policy, calmed investors'
fears that rates are headed sharply higher. The Fed has raised
rates four times since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's report today stabilized what had been a turbulent
market in the wake of Tuesday's steep selloff, when the Dow fell
374 points.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, the catalyst for Tuesday's selloff, remained
out of favor today, dropping 2 13/16 to 57 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The company's profit warning hung over the market today as
investors worried that other companies' earnings would suffer as
well. But some analysts said investors appeared to believe that the
blue chips had paid too great a price for Procter &AMP; Gamble's
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense to the magnitude of the selloff,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo. ''It was an overreaction that has really
created some good buying opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow higher, rising 3~ to 71\. Merck
rose 3 9/16 to 57 5/16. Drug stocks outside the Dow were higher,
too. Bristol Myers Squibb soared 5 7/16 to 48 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's gains were more modest as investors continued
taking profits from the recent rise in technology stocks. JDS
Uniphase was down 13] to 273 and Applied Materials was down 3 47/64
to 180 25/64.
</P>
<P>
   But buyers stepped in to pick up some high-tech favorites.
Oracle rose 6} to 81 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's beige book wasn't the only news from the central bank
today. This morning, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned banks to
maintain their lending standards even in the face of strong
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's speech to the Independent Community Bankers of
America in San Antonio, Texas, contributed to some nervousness,
traders said. While Greenspan did not discuss interest rates or
monetary policy, he repeated his concerns about Americans' inflated
expectations of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 978.63 million
shares, behind Tuesday's torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.76 to 586.71.

<HEADLINE> A debate uncorked -- more and more wine stopped up by plastic  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A summer night. A romantic dinner at home. A
bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   John Norris thought it would be perfection.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the bottle with a flourish and inspected the
corkscrew. Impaled on the end was a ''cork'' made entirely of
plastic. The mood was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a toy,'' Norris said, recalling his surprise.
''It doesn't belong in a bottle of wine.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more synthetic corks are being yanked from wine bottles
these days. Proponents claim they are superior to natural corks,
while critics mourn a loss of romance and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Squishy squeaks and scrutinizing sniffs have accompanied bottle
openings for centuries, and some wine drinkers find popping plastic
a downer on a good bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ''You almost equate it to twist-off,'' said Eric Pankonin, a
wine drinker who doesn't like his fermented grape juice packaged
like regular grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   Cork is still king, no contest. Oaks growing in Portugal and
elsewhere are still the source for almost 13 billion stoppers a
year, according to the industry-funded Natural Cork Quality
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate corks -- made of plastic or composite materials --
account for a sliver of the market, but have been making headway in
the world of red, white and rose.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every major winery has experimented with synthetic
corks, said Eileen Fredrikson of the San Francisco-based wine
industry consulting firm Gomberg Fredrikson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic models can look like the real thing, with a tough but
squeezable plastic skin. Others appear unapologetically synthetic,
in vibrant shades of red and blue and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our business is definitely increasing,'' said Brooke Hilton of
SupremeCorq, a leading synthetic cork maker in business since 1992.
The Seattle-area company does not release sales figures, but Hilton
said the biggest growth markets are in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that plastic stoppers battle the plague of
''corked'' wine -- vino that goes bad because a damaged cork has
allowed the wine to spoil. ''Corked'' bottles can smell like a damp
cellar or moldy mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, a plastic cork may seem tacky to some people, but you
have virtually no chance of getting skunky, corked wine,'' Jeff
Jetton of Nashville, Tenn., wrote during a recent online
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only advantage a real cork has is that it makes the
purchaser of the wine feel like they've gotten something fancy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrikson's research found less resistance to synthetic corks
among high-end consumers, a group more likely to have suffered
through buying a $100 bottle of musty wine. Grumbling was more
likely among novices buying inexpensive bottles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With that consumer resistance -- and without a significant price
difference for plastic -- wineries have little incentive to make the
switch, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slowly, there has been greater acceptance,'' Fredrikson said.
''But I haven't seen a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic corks seem most popular among wineries that eschew
wine's hidebound image. For instance, Bully Hill Vineyards in New
York's Finger Lakes region uses synthetic stoppers almost
exclusively, national sales manager Andy Toth said. The corks --
printed with slogans like ''Wine With Love'' -- complement brightly
painted bottles that underscore Bully Hill's funky image.
</P>
<P>
   Others wineries, like Ingleside Plantation Winery in Oak Grove,
Va., have been merely experimenting with plastic and composition
corks. Ingleside's Christine Koontz said some customers are
perplexed by them, but the three-year experiment has mostly been a
success.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Koontz also recalled the time her waiter appeared
flummoxed over whether to offer her the plastic cork to be sniffed:
''He just sort of shrugged his shoulders and presented it to me.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Push Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures pushed higher Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, erasing losses from the previous day
as a rollercoaster week continued to be driven largely by weather
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans saw the heaviest trading, rising on rumors that the
Brazilian government may impose an export tax on soybeans in that
country. The market jumped higher even though traders said the
rumor didn't have wide credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures advanced along with soybeans, as rain overnight in
the winter wheat belt turned out to be less extensive than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices found support from a storm system advancing across
the Midwest that should provide much-needed soil moisture.
Expectations that U.S. Department of Agriculture weekly export
sales figures will near 1 million tons for a second straight week
also buoyed the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 2 cents to $2.16} a bushel; May corn
rose 1 cent to $2.26\ a bushel; May oats rose } cent to $1.17} a
bushel; May soybeans rose 4 cents to $5.15{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle fell .13 cent to 72.32 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .22 cent to 84.75 cents a pound; April lean hogs
fell .15 cent to 59.45 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .25
cent to 92.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Gov't Overpayment Measure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government agencies would have to perform
''recovery audits'' each year to try to recoup what is estimated to
be millions of dollars in overpayments to contractors for goods and
services, the House voted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 375-0, would apply to agencies that spend
more than $500 million per fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   It would also give the federal Office of Management and Budget
the authority to exempt an agency where an audit would not be
practical or cost-effective. Agency heads could have the recovery
audits performed in-house or by an outside auditor, which ever is
more cost effective. Part of the money recovered would be used to
establish a management improvement program for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill, if passed,
will result in at least $180 million in collections in the first
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is waste and there are errors and there are
overpayments, billions of dollars in overpayments,'' said Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind. and chairman of the Government Oversight Committee.
''This bill is designed to get at inadvertent overpayments.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, D-N.Y., said , ''Our government
has paid through the nose so much it has developed a bad cold that
has resisted a cure.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 60.50; Nasdaq Up 49.45  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices stabilized today as a Federal
Reserve assessment of the economy reassured nervous investors
following Tuesday's huge selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 60.50 to 9,856.53, according to preliminary
calculations, making up some of the nearly 375 points it lost in
Tuesday's plunge. The Nasdaq composite index rose 49.45 to
4,897.25.
</P>
<P>
   Both indexes changed direction several times in the morning and
early afternoon as traders regrouped after Tuesday's big drop. But
both were solidly higher after the Fed released its ''beige book''
assessment of economic conditions, reporting that while workers'
wages are rising, there is little evidence of inflation in the
overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report gave investors their first real impetus to buy today.
It convinced them that the Fed, which has raised interest rates
four times since June to try to control inflation, might not have
to push rates sharply higher in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's drop, which was sparked by a Procter &AMP;
Gamble warning about disappointing profits, industrial and
financial stocks had been falling because of concerns that higher
rates would erode company earnings.

<HEADLINE> Women's Day Marked Worldwide  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- From masked prostitutes striking in London's red
light district to female activists arguing in a Kuwaiti courtroom
for the right to vote, women marked International Women's Day on
Wednesday mostly by taking stock of the poverty, violence and
inequality that continues to afflict their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Buggies, balloons and symbolic clotheslines filled the square in
front of the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, where about
2,000 women participated in a colorful procession that officially
began the ''World March of Women 2000.'' Some 3,500 local groups in
145 countries are expected to take part in different stages of the
march, which will culminate in New York in October.
</P>
<P>
   A group of male construction workers watched as women passed by
holding a symbolic clothesline with ''Stop housework'' painted on a
pair of trousers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men
will kill them,'' read one banner held by Lisa Dempsey, an Illinois
native living in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   But as songs for peace and justice floated through the spring
sunshine in Switzerland, the day passed more grimly elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Women squatted everywhere, begging in the chilly streets of
Kabul, Afghanistan, where they are banned by the ruling Taliban
militia from working and going to school beyond age 8. Many women
lost their husbands in the long Afghan conflict but are unable to
take jobs to support their families.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the holiday, the Taliban held a ceremony for women
at Kabul's sole women-only hospital as Kalashnikov-wielding
soldiers kept men away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The women were invited to talk and exchange ideas,'' said
Taliban Deputy Information and Culture Minister Abdul Rehman
Hottaq, who dismissed western criticism of the Taliban's treatment
of women as insensitive and ignorant of Islamic traditions and
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, a group of women spent the day in court, challenging
legislation that denies members of their gender the right to vote
or run for office in this Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm optimistic,'' said plaintiff Fatima Abdali, an
environmentalist who works for the Kuwait Oil Company. ''What is
important here is that a door has been opened and any stirring of
still waters is good.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Gaza City, about 300 women joined protests Wednesday led
by the Palestinian Women's Union outside the Palestinian
legislative council building. One of their banners said: ''Women
and men are equal, let's build the coming Palestinian state
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said there had been ''very few positive
developments'' to advance women's rights since a world conference
on the subject in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year a vast number of women and young girls are
mutilated, battered to death, burned alive, raped, trafficked for
domestic or sexual purposes, primarily because they are female,''
Amnesty said.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF said that ''honor crimes'' -- an ancient practice in which
men kill female relatives because of suspected sexual activity
outside marriage -- were on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''For too long men have been getting away with murder,'' said
the executive-director of the U.N. Children's Fund, Carol Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, one in 20 married women said they had suffered
life-threatening abuse from their husbands and almost one in five
said they had been forced into sexual acts against their will,
according to a government survey.
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, Weselina Mavelope, a widow approaching 60, spent
the day weakly looking for a food handout at a Red Cross center in
Chokwe, 125 miles north of the capital of Maputo. Having lost her
eldest son in the recent floods there, she, her daughter-in-law and
her three grandchildren must cope without a male head of the
household -- almost impossible in the southeast African nation's
patriarchal farming communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 prostitutes in masks and elaborate Edwardian costumes
paraded through the streets of London's Soho red light district in
a one-day strike meant to highlight their unsafe working conditions
and attempts by local authorities to evict them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these women work and live in Soho and they would be
forced out onto the streets where it is 10 times more dangerous,''
said Niki Adams, spokeswoman for a support group called the English
Collective of Prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian men thronged to buy daffodils and roses for their wives,
mothers and girlfriends to mark a holiday that began at the start
of the 20th century as a day of struggle for equal rights for
women. And a few hardy Russian women marked the holiday by swimming
in the icy Serebryaniy Bor, a popular beach area on the Moscow
River.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II paid tribute to the ''richness'' of women's
''genius.'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised their
peacemaking qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. scientific and cultural organization UNESCO sponsored a
Women Make the News operation, where media outlets in countries
including Albania, Bolivia, Jordan and Tanzania handed over control
to female journalists for the day. In Britain, the Western Mail
newspaper, published in the Welsh city of Cardiff, changed its
masthead to The Western Femail.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices stabilized today as a Federal

following Tuesday's huge selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 60.50 to 9,856.53, according to preliminary
calculations, making up some of the nearly 375 points it lost in
Tuesday's plunge. The Nasdaq composite index rose 49.45 to
4,897.25.
</P>

   Both indexes changed direction several times in the morning and

both were solidly higher after the Fed released its ''beige book''

It convinced them that the Fed, which has raised interest rates

</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's drop, which was sparked by a Procter &AMP;
Gamble warning about disappointing profits, industrial and
financial stocks had been falling because of concerns that higher
rates would erode company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors remained uncertain about the outlook for
corporate profits after the surprise announcement by Procter &AMP;
Gamble set off massive selling on Wall Street. The consumer
products maker said higher raw materials prices would hurt its
profits for the rest of the company's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The market was completely unnerved by the fact that even Procter
&AMP; Gamble, whose products include consumer staples such as Crest
toothpaste and Tide detergent, could be vulnerable to earnings
problems, and investors began to sell off a broad range of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow lost 374.47 and ended at 9,796.03, its lowest close in
nearly a year. It is now down about 14 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even the technology-dominated Nasdaq, which has been relatively
immune from profit concerns lately, has been hit hard. The index
made a brief foray past 5,000 for the first time Tuesday, but it
eventually fell victim to widespread selling, and analysts said
investors uncertain about the market's direction were collecting
more profits today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Nasdaq, which has outperformed the Dow for months as
investors scooped up high-tech stocks, is up about 20 percent so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The markets watched closely today as Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan spoke at a banking conference. However, analysts
said his comments, which focused on lending practices of small
banks, did not appear to affect stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets were also rattled today by Tuesday's drop.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris today, the benchmark CAC 95 index fell 1.50 percent,
while London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index slipped 0.86
percent and the Frankfurt Xetra DAX index fell 0.97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier trading in Tokyo and Singapore, stock indexes were
able to hold their losses to below 1 percent in volatile trading.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average, which fell sharply when
trading began Wednesday, ended the session at 19,766.80, down
177.44, or 0.89 percent, from the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judging by what happened in New York overnight, the (Nikkei)
market is extremely strong,'' said Hidenori Karaki, a general
manager of stocks at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, were down sharply in early trading but turned
around late in the session. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose
86.07, or 0.5 percent, to 17,951.43, a new closing highs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the U.S. fall was to a large extent due to Procter
and Gamble's profit warning, the fall has had strong repercussions
in the Hong Kong bourse,'' said Alex Wong, a research manager at
OSK Asia Securities Ltd., as trading began there.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Would Curb Sex Slavery  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House bill designed to protect victims of
the growing international sex slavery trade would allow child
victims brought to this country to stay in America.
</P>
<P>
   As originally written, the measure would have allowed any
person, regardless of age, who claimed they were brought to the
United States as a sexual slave would have been eligible to stay in
the country under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee's immigration panel, offered an amendment limiting
eligibility to victims aged 16 and younger. The subcommittee
approved the legislation by unanimous voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Without the change, he said, the law could ''open the door to a
significant number of fraudulent claims and lead to a massive
amnesty for illegal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of sexual slavery and how to curb what officials say
is its rapid growth has been on the minds of Capitol Hill
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, usually women and children are often told they have
jobs waiting for them by a trafficker in their home country. But
once they arrive, they are forced into servitude as prostitutes or
in the pornography industry.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a Mexican woman told a Senate committee how her
quest for a better life turned her into a sexual servant and made
her one of the estimated 50,000 women trafficked to the United
States for illicit purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she was forced to work six days a week and
12-hour days, serving between 32 to 35 clients a day.
</P>
<P>
   Solid numbers on the scope of the problem are hard to come by,
but best government estimates show at least 50,000 women brought
into the United States annually for forced labor, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that with as many as 2 million women
worldwide forced into sexual slavery, the sex trade seems to be
increasingly replacing narcotics as a favored illegal trade
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would authorize $94.5 million over two years to
battle the sex trade. The effort would be monitored by a new
multi-agency task force under the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Funding would be used for counseling and treatment of victims
and to coordinate efforts with foreign governments and independent
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us 4Q Earnings Down 24 Perc.  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc. ended a tumultuous year with
a 24 percent drop in fourth-quarter profits, but the giant toy
retailer said its prospects look good for 2000, with more
customer-friendly stores and exclusive toys.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts lauded the strategies of the company's new president --
former FAO Schwarz head John Eyler -- to revive sagging sales and
profits, but said the company's future is still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't know how successful they will be until after next
Christmas,'' said Sally Wallick, a retail analyst at Legg Mason in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Paramus, N.J.-based chain, once the nation's No. 1 toy
retailer but now trailing Wal-Mart Stores Inc., had a turbulent
year that included the resignation of its CEO and a Christmas
crisis involving its Internet subsidiary, Toysrus.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site was overrun with traffic, making it difficult to
access. Toysrus.com also failed to keep up with orders and ended up
delivering many purchases late -- some arriving after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday sales were also down 2 percent in what was a
better-than-average retail season elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us earned $235 million in the months ended Jan. 29, or 98
cents a diluted share for the quarter ended Jan. 29, compared with
$310 million, or $1.23 a share, during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter figures included a $64 million charge related
to the development of Toysrus.com. Without the charge, the company
said it would have earned $276 million, or $1.15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   That beat estimates of $1.09 a share by analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial. Toys R Us shares rose 81.25 cents to
$11.93} on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For its 1999 fiscal year, the chain earned $279 million, or
$1.14 per share, compared with a net loss of $132 million, or 50
cents a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler, who became president and CEO in January, called 1999 ''a
transitional year'' and blamed some of the holiday sales problems
on shortages of popular toys. He said the company needed to improve
its inventory system to make sure it doesn't run out of toys too
early next season.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has renovated more than 400 U.S. stores with
easier-to-navigate layouts and better product organization. Those
stores are outperforming the older stores, he said, although he
said the concept still needs work.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler said the reorganization cost the company in 1999, but ''we
nonetheless are better positioned for the future and expect to
realize the benefits of these and other initiatives in 2000 and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Toys R Us would introduce an exclusive line of
stuffed animals based on the cable television channel ''Animal
Planet'' this fall. The strategy is one Eyler was familiar with at
FAO Schwarz, where 70 percent of the toys sold at the company were
not found elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter sales rose less than 2 percent to $5.0 billion.
For the year, sales were up 6 percent to $11.9 billion, compared to
$11.2 billion a year before.
</P>
<P>
   Toy sales in the United States increased 3 percent for 1999, but
were down 2 percent for the holiday season, which the company
attributed to the deflated prices of video hardware and a shortage
of hot products. International sales increased 2 percent, including
big gains in France and Spain. Sales in stores in Germany, Canada
and Japan were down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Babies R Us stores reported a 9 percent sales
increase in the year. The Kids R Us chain's sales were down 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com, which began in the middle of last year, earned $49
million in the fourth quarter and $50 million for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us operates 1,549 stores, including 710 in the United
States, 250 Kids R Us stores and 132 Babies R Us stores.

<HEADLINE> 'Baby Slot' for Abandoned Infants  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- This is a story Germans don't want to see
repeated: A 28-year-old mother was convicted of manslaughter
Wednesday for killing three infants shortly after their birth
because she was too overwhelmed to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern city of Hamburg, a group is trying to prevent a
repetition of the tragedy by introducing a ''baby slot'' where
mothers can safely -- and anonymously -- leave unwanted infants
without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Although criticized by some conservatives, the project, to be
launched in three weeks, has been widely praised, prompting cities
throughout Germany to consider implementing similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   It involves a baby slot, to be located near a train station in a
poor section of Hamburg. When a buzzer is rung, a door opens and a
platform is lowered to receive the baby. The door then closes and
the baby is lowered into a warm bed; a sensor alerts health care
workers about two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Baby drop-off programs that provide women this degree of
anonymity are rare. A similar 4-year-old program has reported
successes in Budapest, Hungary, and another exists in Johannesburg,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Alabama, Minnesota, Georgia and Texas have
local programs protecting the identities of women who give up their
babies, but they still must hand them over to health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   Activists believe the anonymity of the Hamburg baby slot will
encourage frightened parents to give up their babies rather than
leave them in unsafe locations. The program was devised after city
officials reported five infants abandoned in 1999. Nationwide,
officials say an average 20 babies are abandoned each year; half
die.
</P>
<P>
   Babies left in the baby slot will be given medical attention and
then go to a foster family. Mothers will have eight weeks to decide
if they want to return and claim their babies, although activists
say experience shows that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mothers are very alone, there's nobody who helps them,
they can't talk with anyone,'' said Juergen Moysich, a manager of
Sternipark, the youth aid group administering the project. ''It's
not an easy decision for a mother to say, 'You know, I can't live
with my baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   The woman convicted Wednesday in the deaths of her three infants
in the eastern city of Chemnitz was sentenced to 13{ years in
prison. Authorities discovered the bodies of the infants, two boys
born in 1993 and 1995 and a girl born last year, in plastic bags in
a freezer after receiving an anonymous tip last June.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show the woman, who was not made public, told
social workers and fellow inmates she loved the newborns but felt
overwhelmed by caring for two older children. They said she
suffered physical and emotional abuse from her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Sternipark hopes its Hamburg project will give women a safe way
to abandon their babies. ''It's the last chance for some babies and
we want to give them this chance,'' said Moysich.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been criticized by conservative politicians who
say any mother who leaves a baby should be prosecuted. But parents
only face criminal action in Germany if they endanger a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are important objections, but we have to deal with the
lives of the babies,'' said Herbert Wiedermann, who heads the
city's child and family welfare department, which has contributed
$25,000 to the $125,000 project. ''We have come to the conclusion
that we want to do everything to save the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby slot will likely be used by underage mothers who have
hidden their pregnancies from their families, drug-addicted parents
or women caught in violent home situations, Wiedermann said.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been praised by Germany's family minister,
Christine Bergmann, who said similar programs should be set up in
all large cities. Speaking Tuesday on ARD television, she said
other options -- such as leaving babies in hospitals -- were not
being used by women who wanted to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ''For such women ... it is not easier to go into a hospital and
give up the baby for adoption,'' said Ingeborg Mueller, the head of
women's projects for an evangelical church welfare organization in
Hamburg.

<HEADLINE> Five charged with perjury in case of banned broker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Five officers of a Long Island stock brokerage
have been indicted on conspiracy, perjury and fraud charges for
hiding the employment of a trader who had been banned for life from
the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, officers of Renaissance Securities Financial
Corp. of Mineola, are accused of concealing the role of Stanley
Cohen in the firm's affairs and thwarting an investigation into his
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, 60, of Jericho, N.Y., was barred from trading stocks and
bonds for life by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission in
1973 because of fraud related to an initial public offering while
he worked at the Wall Street firm of Cohen, Goren Equities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indictment says Cohen, who had been mayor, police
chief and a pizza shop owner in Great Neck Estates during his
exile, secretly began work at Renaissance in February 1996, along
with his son and daughter, without the required okay of the
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD).
</P>
<P>
   The NASD, created by Congress in 1934, licenses and regulates
firms and people in the securities industry. When the association
began investigating Cohen's presence at Renaissance, officers there
lied to protect him, said Barry Goldsmith, executive vice president
of enforcement at NASD Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also agreed to obtain licenses from securities
regulators and money from customers while hiding Cohen's role in
the firm, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith said the current prosecution is the first ever for
lying to NASD investigators. He said the firm, defunct under its
old name, is now called AJC Equities and is at the same address as
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cohen, the defendants are his daughter Jamie Scher, 33,
of Woodbury; his son Adam Cohen, 30, of Great Neck; Todd Spehler,
39, of Bellmore, and Eileen Torrillo, 36, of Dix Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants all face up to seven years in prison if convicted
of perjury, the top count.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the perjury and conspiracy charges, Cohen is
charged with securities fraud under the Martin Act, for preventing
customers from executing certain trades and for manipulating the
prices of certain stocks, including Object Soft and Intellect
Communication.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that besides the five indicted Renaissance
officers, five others have entered pleas in connection with the
case. Those pleas have been sealed.

<HEADLINE> Protests Welcome Albright in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR DRAGICEVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRCKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was welcomed to Bosnia on Wednesday by Serbs in one city
who chucked an egg at her motorcade and Croats in another who
burned a U.S. flag and whistled each time her name was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was in the northern city of Brcko to formally name it a
multiethnic district -- a decision imposed last year in an effort to
placate Serbs, Muslims and Croats all claiming the city. The visit
was meant to hold the city up as an example of ethnic harmony for
residents of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But militant Serbs still want Brcko for their own. As Albright's
motorcade drove up to the municipal building where the ceremony
marking the city's new status was to take place, about 300 Serbs
began chanting ''killers,'' ''thieves,'' and obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, some 10,000 Bosnian Croats rallied to protest the
sentencing of one of their former generals by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia -- a gathering that also turned
into an anti-U.S. demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters in Kiseljak accused the West of being anti-Croat
because of the 45-year prison sentence handed down to Gen. Tihomir
Blaskic in connection with anti-Muslim atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Albright kept to her agenda of publicizing developments meant to
promote stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with all three members of Bosnia's multiethnic
presidency and the Croatian and Bosnian defense ministers, she
announced an agreement terminating covert Croatian military aid to
Bosnian Croats.
</P>
<P>
   Such aid under the previous Croatian government was criticized
by the West and Bosnia as part of attempts to strengthen Bosnian
Croat separatist ambitions. Formally, Bosnian Croat forces are part
of Muslim-Croat Bosnian federation army.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to build confidence throughout Bosnia ... that there
will be no military surprises,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo advised Americans to stay away from
Kiseljak, some 25 miles west of Sarajevo, and the southern city of
Mostar, where smaller demonstration also were held.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serbs gained control over Brcko during the Bosnian
1992-1995 war. The status of the city was the only territorial
issue left unresolved in the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serbs insisted on maintaining control because Brcko is
on a narrow corridor linking Serb-held lands in the east and west
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the Muslim-Croat federation wanted access to the river and
rail facilities. The federation also wanted the thousands of mostly
Muslim refugees to be able to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   International arbitrators twice postponed a decision on Brcko's
future and finally declared it neutral district last year despite
strong Serb resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the city has a multiethnic government approved
by international officials and its residents are exempt from the
draft, in a symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the importance of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Militant Bosnian Serbs still resent U.S. support for their
wartime Muslim enemies in the conflict that ended in 1985 after
NATO bombing helped persuade the Serbs to opt for peace.
</P>
<P>
   One of the vehicles in Albright's convoy was hit by an egg as it
drove by the crowd, many of whom waved three fingers in the air in
the traditional Serb salute. Some in the crowd also chanted,
''Dodik, traitor'' -- a reference to Milorad Dodik, the pro-Western
premier of the Serb half of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Albright shrugged off the incident and concentrated on the
formal change in Brcko's status.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our feeling was if you can solve the Brcko problem you can
solve any problem in Bosnia,'' she said at the ceremony. ''Now,
Brcko has great opportunity -- we are here, we work, Brcko works.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is divided in two autonomous regions, one run by the
Serbs and the other shared by Muslims and Croats. But the goal of
the peace agreement is to re-establish the country's multiethnic
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, who also attended
the ceremony, welcomed the city's new status.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot change the past but we can make the future better,''
he said, urging refugees to return and all people to work on
reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Putin Test: What To Do With Land  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAROSLAVL, Russia (AP) -- What do the potato patches and dairy
farms that ring this eastern Russian city have in common with the
barren wind-swept steppes of Siberia?
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government owns them. Russia has more land than any
country and the government owns nearly all of it.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes perfect sense to most Russians. So farmers were
upset when acting President Vladimir Putin -- the front-runner in
March 26 presidential elections -- suggested selling the fields and
turning Russia into a nation of landowners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should we sell our land? So that foreigners can buy it? So
that (Russian) criminals can buy it and watch it disintegrate?''
asked Alexander Zylev, director of the Molot collective farm, 150
miles northeast of Moscow. A portrait of Soviet founder Vladimir
Lenin hung crookedly above his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The last decade has brought free elections, free media, and
privatized many stores and businesses. But reformers say the
country cannot be considered a real democracy or build a market
economy until it abandons the Soviet system of state ownership of
land.
</P>
<P>
   They also say Russian farms will never be productive until they
move into private hands. But who would want to buy the much-abused
land Russia has to offer?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's 370 million acres of agricultural land are
still farmed collectively. Yet the farms produce a fraction of what
they did in the Soviet era -- and they were grossly inefficient
then.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has some of the most fertile farmland in the world,
Russia relies heavily on food imports. Record-low grain harvests in
the past two years prompted Russia to beg for 8 million tons of
food aid from the United States and European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Zylev's farm is cluttered with broken-down tractors, and half
its cowsheds sit empty, filled with snow seeping through rotten
roofs. Across Russia, farm workers often take home leftover
vegetables as wages -- or steal them. Farmers can't afford
fertilizers, feed or equipment, and are diving deeper into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Putin recently suggested holding a referendum on ''the land
question,'' which he has called a key priority. And the parliament,
which saw many hard-liners ousted in December elections, could
finally give Russia a post-Soviet land code that would encourage
private farming.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether Putin will be strong enough to
overcome the public fear of free land sales, the conservatism among
Russians -- rural and urban,'' said Cameron Sawyer, who runs a
Moscow-based real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as Russian agriculture looks now, many Russians fear
private land ownership would be worse. Farmers worry that serious
reform would shut down unproductive farms and cost them their
livelihoods, and city dwellers worry about food supplies drying up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most Russians are too poor to buy the land, and
farmers fear rich Russians or foreigners will snap it up and take
it out of agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin Milto is a rarity in rural Russia. He wants to buy the
land his Russian-Dutch company, Agronova, uses for growing
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need permission from the local administration to do anything
... To seek a loan, to sell seeds to a neighboring farm,'' Milto
said, while inspecting a well-stocked Agronova warehouse west of
Yaroslavl.
</P>
<P>
   But even his own employees are resisting his efforts to buy
land.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trust my bosses, they're good people. But if one foreigner
buys land, then another will, and soon all of Russia will be
foreign,'' said Tatyana Zhidkova, a seasonal worker stuffing beets
into buckets.
</P>
<P>
   Working land leased from state farms around Yaroslavl, Agronova
produced four times as many potatoes per acre last year as the
national average. It was one of the region's few agricultural
businesses to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Its neighbors, including Zylev's Molot farm, were not pleased.
Some complained to local authorities, and Agronova had to seek new
land plots after one lease deal soured.
</P>
<P>
   Technically it's already legal to buy and sell land, thanks to
decrees signed by Boris Yeltsin. But Russia still lacks a
parliament-approved land code, keeping potential buyers away. Only
about 6 percent of Russia's land is in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the people with money aren't interested in taking over
farms with bloated payrolls and mountains of debt. Demand for land
is so low that the land Agronova wants to buy would cost about $7
an acre, Milto said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rallies Against Wage Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rallied Democrats to support
a higher minimum wage on Wednesday and vowed to veto a Republican
plan that would delay the increase and link it to $122.7 billion in
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Republican leaders send me a bill that makes workers wait
for another year for their full pay raise and holds the minimum
wage hostage for risky tax cuts that threaten our prosperity, I'll
veto it,'' said Clinton, who hosted Cabinet members, labor and
community leaders and Democratic lawmakers on the South Lawn of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to stop nickel and diming American working people
out of the money that they need and deserve,'' the president said.
''This is just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP wants to enact a $1 increase over three years and couple
it with $122.7 billion in tax cuts -- a move that resurrects
portions of the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut package that
Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is backing a Democratic plan to increase the wage by $1
over just two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This modest increase would simply restore the minimum wage to
what it was in real dollar terms in 1982,'' Clinton said. ''For a
full-time worker, however, this would mean another $2,000 a year.
And if you're on the minimum wage, that's real money.''
</P>
<P>
   House leaders were trying to gauge support Wednesday among GOP
rank-and-file for the three-year and two-year versions of the
minimum wage increase, with votes possible Thursday on both along
with the tax package. Some GOP conservatives, led by Rep. Jim
DeMint of South Carolina, were pushing for a measure allowing
states the option of implementing the wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole package shows the difficulty you have when you try
and forge that middle way,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who has
been pushing for the tax-and-wage compromise. ''The challenge is to
find that delicate balance that will bring people on board. Part of
finding that balance is a modest tax relief package.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Costas, a checkout clerk in Colton Alba, Pa., with four
children and a disabled husband, spoke of her struggle to raise her
family on $5.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am grateful that you are fighting to raise the minimum wage
for families like mine,'' she told Clinton. ''I know how important
a dollar more an hour will be for my husband, my children and me.
And so do you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of the Democrats'
minimum wage bill in the Senate, characterized the conflict as a
''women's issue, because the majority who receive the increase ...
are women,'' and a ''civil rights issue'' because many minorities
also would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
the three-year increase is ''the least worst way to do the wrong
thing.'' He said he did not know if Republicans have the votes
needed to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's opposition, House Republicans are forging
ahead with legislation to slash inheritance taxes and cut other
taxes for businesses to offset the cost of raising the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders generally oppose raising the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage but are willing to put the question to a House vote
Thursday to appease GOP moderates who have strong labor
constituencies and to give conservatives another election-year
opportunity to vote for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Using a chunk of the projected budget surplus estimated at
$122.7 billion over 10 years, the tax package would sharply reduce
the estate tax, boost contribution limits for 401(k) plans, make
health insurance fully tax deductible for the self-employed and
enact several tax changes favorable to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $5.48 this
year, $5.81 in April 2001 and $6.15 in April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., has developed an $8 billion
tax-cutting package targeted at small business owners and others
who would be directly affected by a $1 increase in the minimum wage
over two years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mission to Mozambique Stalls  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOEDSPRUIT AIR BASE, South Africa (AP) -- First Mozambique's
battered flood victims waited for help. Now U.S. soldiers wait to
help them. The U.S. military's relief mission slowed as commanders
waited Wednesday for a go-ahead from aid agencies over when and
where to deliver aid.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delay was certain to reinforce critics who say aid to
the stricken southeast African nation has been slow. Mozambique's
rivers burst their banks one month ago and turned large portions of
the country into an inland sea, killing hundreds and leaving almost
1 million people homeless and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen military aircraft from South Africa, Spain, Britain,
France and Belgium delivered 100 tons of aid Wednesday to the
Limpopo River valley, said Capt. Hugo Weich, a South African
military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. troops shaded themselves from the glaring sun under a
canvas lean-to, playing cards and killing time.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were awaiting the go-ahead from international aid
agency officials in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, to start
delivering food and other supplies, said Army Brig. Gen. William
Davies, deputy commander of the U.S. relief mission to the stricken
southeast African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will identify where we need to go and we will then
distribute,'' Davies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Iskander, head of logistics in Mozambique for the U.N.
World Food Program, said the U.S. Embassy was coordinating the
deployment of U.S. troops with Mozambican government authorities.
</P>
<P>
   And Silvano Langa, head of Mozambique's disaster management
agency, said he told the U.S. military attache on Saturday that
U.S. forces were required in the central Mozambican city in Beira
and the Save River valley.
</P>
<P>
   Langa said his foreign minister told him Wednesday there was a
delay in the arrival of the U.S. helicopters. ''The helicopters are
still not in the country,'' Langa said.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. troops participating in the global response
arrived at this air base in South Africa's Northern Province on
Saturday, a day after President Clinton authorized the military's
involvement. The total U.S. relief force in the region is expected
to reach 500 soldiers, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Two C-130 cargo planes delivered personnel and equipment on
Wednesday to Beira, where the United States is staging part of its
operations. Special U.N. envoy Ross Mountain said he had no idea
why U.S. forces had not yet begun delivering food and other aid.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh rains fell over parts of already sodden Mozambique on
Wednesday. Two more days of steady rain were predicted, bringing
fears of renewed flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rainy season is not yet over,'' said Getachev Biriba, a
World Food Program analyst. ''The concern remains that the soil is
so saturated that any rain could pose a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain said a reconnaissance plane had spotted 20,000 people
moving en masse along the upper reaches of the Limpopo River. The
reason for their flight was not immediately known and the World
Food Program said it would dispatch helicopters early Thursday to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. food agency said Wednesday it would airlift
28 tons of emergency food on Friday to more than 500,000 flood
victims in neighboring Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mozambique, the Indian Ocean island nation also has been
pummeled by Cyclone Elina and tropical storm Gloria. Many of the
victims were in remote areas only now being reached by authorities.
Officials said the floods had killed more than 150 people.

<HEADLINE> Labor Shortages Pressure Economy  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The booming U.S. economy is contributing to
widespread labor shortages and putting pressure on some employers
to boost wages, but that hasn't touched off inflation, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday in its latest snapshot of business
conditions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's survey, based on reports from its 12 regional banks,
said labor markets remain tight across the country. That means
employers are having trouble finding workers to fill job openings,
something Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other economists fear
could lead to wage and price inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Given the strong economic growth and the tight labor market
conditions cited in the report, economists believe it lays the
foundation for the Fed to boost interest rates in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market forced some employers to recruit
so-called ''nontraditional'' workers such as senior citizens and
teens, or to boost overtime. Others offered bonuses rather than
raising base wages. Wage gains, for the most part, were moderate,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, product prices were largely stable, suggesting that
inflation was well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite faster wage growth for some workers, increases in the
prices of final goods and services were limited overall, although
the prices of transportation services and some industrial
commodities rose noticeably,'' the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, rising wages and higher fuel costs cut into the
profits of transportation companies, especially trucking firms.
And, prices for energy and petroleum-related products were among
industrial commodities posting sharp price increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed survey, known as the ''beige book'' for the color of its
cover, will be used when Fed policy-makers meet March 21 to review
the central bank's stance on interest rates. The report was based
on information collected before Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe the Fed will boost rates again at the
March meeting in a further effort to slow economic growth to a pace
that will keep inflation in check. Economists said the survey
provides justification to push rates higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are clear signs that wage pressures are accelerating and
it's the first time that the beige book has said that so clearly,''
said Mark Zandi, an economist at RFA Dismal Sciences. ''The Fed is
laying a solid intellectual foundation for more tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union economist Mark Vitner called the survey ''a virtual
blueprint for higher interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Four increases by the central bank since June have raised
interest rates by a full percentage point to 5.75 percent, making
borrowing more expensive for millions of consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists said those actions have done little to cool
the red-hot economy, which grew at a breakneck 6.9 percent annual
rate in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Fed's survey said that expanding manufacturing
activity and mounting retail sales are still producing robust
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of districts reported strong growth during the
survey period, with the remaining reports pointing to moderate
growth or continued high levels of activity,'' the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan in a speech at Boston College on Monday expressed new
worries about an overheated economy and sounded a warning that
interest rates will be raised if growth doesn't slow.
</P>
<P>
   In manufacturing, most districts reported a pickup in activity
in January and February. Sales of semiconductors and other
high-tech equipment were strong in Dallas and San Francisco, and
demand for steel was especially strong, largely for use in the
production of cars and other big-ticket manufactured consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
   On the retail front, the Fed found sales were strong in most
areas and either met or exceeded merchants' expectations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Satellite Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to beam local broadcast signals into
millions of rural households won unanimous approval Wednesday by
the Senate Banking Committee, whose chairman sidetracked the idea
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., said local television provides an
important link for those who live in isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a critical way to receive important local news, storm
information, road reports and school closing information,'' said
Johnson, a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation approved last year, major satellite companies
must beam local stations to about one-quarter of the nation's 211
media markets. But that only covered the largest markets, leaving
about 6 million rural households without local service.
</P>
<P>
   The bill aims to fix the problem by setting up a $1.25 billion
loan guarantee for companies that provide local broadcasts to rural
markets. The guarantee provision in last year's bill was dropped
amid opposition led by the committee chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the original bill did not provide enough assurances
that the loans would be repaid. Under this year's bill, which Gramm
sponsored, the loan guarantees would be capped at 80 percent of the
total instead of 100 percent, and borrowers would have to provide
more collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation cleared the House Agriculture Committee last
month without opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two co-sponsors, Johnson and Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,
said they were worried some lenders would be excluded under the new
program. Because the bill requires FDIC-insured lenders, rural
electric cooperatives and telephone systems would be barred from
participating, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These groups have the most experience doing business in rural
areas, and we ought to make it possible for them to compete in this
program,'' Sarbanes said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2097

<HEADLINE> Austria Seeks EU Reconciliation  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- With European Union countries
continuing to treat Austria like a pariah, President Thomas Klestil
sought the EU executive's help Wednesday in reconciling with its
fellow members.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil met with the EU's Executive Commission in Brussels and
insisted the new Austrian government stand by European values.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Brussels to express and underline that Austria is
utterly bound to the European Union,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 other members of the EU each imposed a ban on bilateral
contacts with Austria to protest the inclusion of Joerg Haider's
far-right Freedom Party in the new government last month.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian ministers continue to attend EU talks. But they have
been shunned at these meetings, with some ministers refusing to
shake their hands and others wearing stickers with anti-far right
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil said he came to the EU headquarters to ask the
commission and its president, Romano Prodi, ''to help us, to
support us in overcoming the difficulties'' that have made Austria
a diplomatic outcast.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has positioned itself as a bridge builder between
the two sides and Prodi said at the news conference that it was
''important that dialogue is not broken off.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hope that the situation would dramatically change when
Haider stepped down as party leader in late February has not
materialized. The Freedom Party has strong anti-immigration
policies, and was for a long time anti-European. Haider has made
comments sympathetic to aspects of the Nazi regime, although he
later apologized for them.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil also said he felt protests by some of the EU members
only made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there are calls not to come skiing, I am quite sure that
this is counterproductive,'' Klestil said, apparently referring to
a call by Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel for tourists to
avoid the Austrian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, which has taken a strong line in the diplomatic
protests, refused to have any official diplomatic contact at all
with Klestil during his two-day stay. No Belgian representative was
at the airport to welcome the president upon his arrival Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil is known to disapprove of the new government and took
pains Wednesday to point out that Haider's party did not represent
the essence of the Austrian people.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was different Wednesday in Switzerland, where
Austria's foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, met with her
Swiss counterpart, Joseph Deiss, and lawmakers from the Swiss
parliament's foreign affairs commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel isolated,'' Ferrero-Waldner said after their
meeting. ''But naturally it's a pleasure to be in a friendly
country which, I believe, knows Austria much better and is much
more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democratic Party, the largest of the four parties in
the Swiss coalition, defied a demonstration ban to protest in front
of the parliament building. The party has opposed the government's
decision to welcome early visits from the Austrian government.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Unveils Knowledge Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's prime minister
announced Wednesday that the national budget for 2001 would
incorporate a far-reaching plan to transform the country from a
production-driven economy into a knowledge-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said policymakers would take the
next year and a half to implement what he called ''The K-Economy
Master Plan'' -- ''a master plan for the entire nation and a
personal master plan for every citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not specify the details, Mahathir said that a
K-Economy, or knowledge-driven economy, is one in which knowledge
is applied to ''every business endeavor in every economic sector.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal was to make Malaysia to ''an information-rich
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Key parts of the plan will be incorporated into the October
budget, Mahathir said in a speech at a conference on world
knowledge attended by delegates from 120 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years as Asia's longest-serving ruler, Mahathir has
helped transform this Southeast Asian country from a land dotted
with rubber plantations into one of the world's most industrialized
economies, with 85 percent of its exports coming from the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Mahathir has pushed for even more high-tech
projects, such as the so-called Multimedia Super Corridor. The $1
billion MSC is intended to serve as a center for computer chip
manufacturing, software development, and other information
technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the 74-year-old leader also has drawn flak from critics who
say that such big-ticket projects come at the expense of country's
poor and homeless.

<HEADLINE> States' Plans for Tobacco Funds  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most states plan to spend their share of the
$206 billion in tobacco settlement money on health care
initiatives, from expanding insurance programs for low-income
families to subsidizing prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the National Conference on State Legislatures shows
that 41 states have 140 bills pending that earmark hundreds of
millions of dollars in tobacco settlement money for health care
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a massive deal forged in 1998, big tobacco companies must
shell out $206 billion to 46 states over 25 years. Four remaining
states settled separately for an additional $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to compensate states for the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses of people on Medicaid. Many states plan
to use part of the money for smoking prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no rules about how the money should be spent, and
many state legislatures propose to put the funds towards general
improvements in health care, including expanding insurance to
people without coverage, an issue of great concern to many state
health officials.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ''has created many opportunities for states that
they otherwise would not have had,'' said William Pound, executive
director of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The survey looked at how much money states would have available
from settlement payments made through April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that California, which is getting $991.8
million, has proposed to expand health programs for poor families,
improve hospitals and trauma centers in low-income areas and
conduct biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which gets $126.5 million, has already passed
legislation to use the funds to subsidize prescription drug costs
and pay for primary care to at-risk newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota wants to use $159 million of its $462 million for
medical student stipends. New Jersey proposed to use $10 million of
its $300 million for mental health services in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four states have pending bills to spend tobacco money on
smoking prevention programs. States have also targeted money at
non-tobacco related programs such as college tuition, K-12
education and child development.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Wrestlers Arrested, Conn Bjt,400  </HEADLINE>
dlstfrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- The 15-year-old boy who was allegedly
hogtied and sodomized with a plastic knife handle by his wrestling
teammates at Trumbull High School was a special needs student who
was encouraged to join the team to help him fit in, his lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of the team have been charged in the hazing
incidents. School officials completed expulsion hearings Tuesday
for seven of the wrestlers, but refused to release the results.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged victim is a special education student with a
learning disability and attention deficit and hyperactivity
disorder, according to his lawyer, Howard Klebanoff.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanoff said the boy was urged by the school to become a
wrestler after some bad experiences with the band and the track
team. But police say his teammates intimidated and assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think calling it hazing is absolutely a misnomer,''
Klebanoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not hazing. To put a child in a locker and poke him
with a pole, to extort money from him to let him out, to take
things from him and make him buy them back -- that's a combination
of physical and emotional abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the alleged abuse took place over a month-long
period, beginning in December. The boy's parents complained to
school officials and police on Feb. 2 after noticing bruises on
their son.
</P>
<P>
   Trumbull Superintendent of Schools Ralph M. Iassonga said the
school district has been working closely with the boy's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the privacy rights of all of the individuals, I
can't comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the students charged in the assault say there has
long been a tacit approval of the hazing ''tradition'' at Trumbull
High -- a charge school officials have denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would think if (school officials) were diligent they
should have known about these things,'' said Frederick Paoletti, a
lawyer for one of the students. ''The kids got a mixed message here
about what you can do and what you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebanoff said the boy's parents are deeply troubled by what
happened to their son and do not wish to speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be certainly safe to say that various types
of civil lawsuits are being contemplated and studied,'' Klebanoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the boy's status as a special needs student could expand
the legal options open to the family.

<HEADLINE> ABC News Announces Restructuring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three senior ABC News executives have been
appointed to new positions in a restructuring announced Wednesday
by the division's president, David Westin.
</P>
<P>
   Westin has been without a deputy since Shelby Coffey left last
November to manage business news at CNN. Instead of naming one
person to the job, Westin appointed three people to supervise parts
of the network news division.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Murphy will become senior vice president of multimedia,
responsible for the transformation of ABC from a broadcast to a
digital newsgathering organization. He's been ABC's vice president
for hard news since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis McGrady, who has overseen ''Good Morning America''
during its turnaround over the past year, will continue supervising
that show and all ABC prime-time news shows, including ''20/20,''
as a senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, the executive producer of ''World News Tonight,''
will become executive vice president and managing editor of news
coverage. He'll be responsible for all hard news programming,
except for ''Nightline,'' and will appoint a successor to run the
evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said he wanted to make the changes to get help in the
day-to-day operation of running the news division.
</P>
<P>
   Each executive has spent many years with ABC News: Murphy
started in 1976, McGrady in 1977 and Friedman in 1982.

	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Enjoy it, because it won't last.
</P>
<P>
   Much of upstate New York basked in record warmth Wednesday, with
temperatures rising into the 80s in the upper Genesee River valley
south of Rochester. The city itself recorded a high of 75 degrees,
breaking a March 7 record of 72 degrees set in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse and Binghamton also were hot spots, but cooling winds
off Lake Erie kept Buffalo in the upper 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse hit 71 degrees, breaking the 66-degree high set in
1973, and Binghamton sizzled at 70 degrees, smashing the previous
record of 64 degrees set in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A storm system that has pelted the Southwest looked likely to
reach upstate New York on Thursday, pulling temperatures back down
into the 40s or lower, the National Weather Service said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From AP Bush Interview  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from an Associated Press interview with
Texas Gov.
George W. Bush:
<TEXT>
<P>
   On his strategy now that he is the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think once the nomination is secure, we will take a deep
breath and prepare for the general. Any successful campaign is one
that assesses our strengths and areas where we can improve. But we
haven't done that yet simply because I'm not the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   More on post-primary strategy:
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we've got an idea of what we need to do and are
going to do between now and the convention and at the convention
and then for the general. I've always discussed the different
phases of the campaign. If the nomination is secure, and I think it
will be, we're heading into that phase, that period of time between
the nominating process and the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of tasks at hand, a lot of decisions that will
be made, and before I make the decisions I want a full analysis
done of what the environment's like today and what the environment
will likely be come the summer and then the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether high turnout in GOP primaries and caucuses reflects
interest in his candidacy:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's a lot of things. I think they're interested in
my message. I think they're excited about my candidacy. I know that
young people who have been voting for me are really pleased to see
a candidate who can renew America, renew our spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain tapped into a vein; people came into our primary
as well for him. Alan Keyes has energized some people. It's a
combination of a lot of things. I also have to believe it is a
reflection on the attitude that people have on Al Gore and the
administration for the last seven years. They want something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   On the important qualities of an effective presidential
candidate and president:
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to become the president, it requires a discipline and
a focus, a determination, an optimism. They're characteristics, at
least, for the kind of president I will be -- an optimistic person,
someone who even when you lose a primary, you're still optimistic.
A president must be someone who's determined and focused. A
president is someone who's got a long-term vision. A president
understands that there'll be good days and not-so-good days ...
What I think the primary process is showing people is how George W.
Bush reacts and thinks and what I'm like as a person.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Quits Broadcasting Lobby  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NBC has withdrawn from the National
Association of Broadcasters, saying the group has not fought hard
enough to ease limits on ownership of television stations and seek
other regulatory relief for the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the network and lobbying group have grown, with
NBC officials repeatedly expressing dissatisfaction with NAB's
unwillingness to push for changes on certain issues. Earlier this
month, the network lost its seat on the NAB's board of directors
for not paying dues.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the broadcasting group, NBC made official its
decision and said the NAB was not serving as a proper forum to
address the changes in the communications marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''An effective and vibrant NAB should be debating what new
regulatory structures are needed to allow free, over-the-air
television to compete with the newly dominant pay services,'' NBC
president Bob Wright wrote Tuesday. ''What's more, the NAB should
be moving heaven and earth to make these changes a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright argued that while the trade association effectively
sought regulatory relief for radio broadcasters, it has not done
the same for the TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   The association instead has chosen to ''drag its feet or
flat-out oppose the changes that NBC seeks,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the network's departure is not a surprise, NAB spokesman
Dennis Wharton said Wednesday, ''It's hard to figure out how NBC
benefits from leaving NAB.''
</P>
<P>
   The most contested issue concerns federal rules that forbid one
company from owning stations that reach more than 35 percent of
U.S. households. A 1996 telecommunications law ordered the Federal
Communications Commission to lift this cap from 25 percent to 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is looking at the restriction right now as part of a
broader review of media ownership rules, but it is unclear whether
regulators will choose to modify it.
</P>
<P>
   As of September, NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., had
13 broadcast outlets reaching about 27 percent of the nation's
homes. NBC-affiliated stations reach far more, but most of those
are owned by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Large media companies have been lobbying to get the cap lifted.
In June, the Fox network pulled out of the NAB last year over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But locally owned stations oppose any increase in the cap. They
fear greater concentration of station ownership, especially by
networks that distribute programming, would put smaller players in
a weak position when negotiating to get shows.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the NAB -- which represents 1,200 TV stations across
the country and more than 5,000 radio stations -- stands by
retaining the cap.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to NBC officials in Washington, NAB president
Edward Fritts wrote, ''It is extremely important that broadcasters
speak, as much as possible, with one voice to support our common
goals and values.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS remain members of the NAB. ABC quit the group in the
early 1990s over another policy disagreement but rejoined a year
and a half later.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Gil Schwartz said the network does not plan to
drop out of the trade group, but is pushing for greater
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's good for the industry and good for over-the-air
TV for it to be able to compete on a level playing field'' with
other programming providers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton gets 10 days for racial profiling sit-in  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton was sentenced to
10 days in jail Wednesday for obstructing traffic during a racial
profiling protest last summer on the Atlantic City Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old civil rights leader, who remained free pending a
to-be-scheduled surrender, vowed to use his incarceration to bring
more attention to the practice of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the attention he expects will come from the jail
term, saying he plans to invite the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Martin
Luther King III and NAACP president Kwesi Mfume to visit him in the
Atlantic County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   But he called his prosecution an extension of racial profiling,
saying he was treated differently because he is black and because
he was protesting the practice. Atlantic City has seen protests by
Miss America Pageant opponents, labor unions and others, but none
have ever been jailed for it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, they want to punish the messenger, now that they've
heard the message,'' Sharpton said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted Nov. 4 of two counts of obstructing traffic
during the July 3 sit-in, which backed up traffic entering this
casino mecca for miles on one of the busiest weekends of the year.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people participated in the protest over the New Jersey
State Police's practice of stopping motorists based on their race.
Sharpton and 75 others were arrested and released that day.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, of Brooklyn, N.Y., was joined in Municipal Court by 45
supporters who arrived on a chartered bus. Many wore buttons
picturing Amadou Diallo, the unarmed New York man who was shot to
death by police in the vestibule of his home as he reached for his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   In court, he painted a portrait of himself as a modern-day civil
rights martyr who was willing to be jailed for his cause. His
lawyer told Municipal Judge Bruce Weekes that Atlantic City would
go down in history beside Selma, Ala., Birmingham, Ala., and the
sites of other 1960s civil rights struggles if it punished Sharpton
for standing up for what is right.
</P>
<P>
   He called Assistant Municipal Prosecutor Michael Mosca ''Bull
Connor,'' a reference to Eugene ''Bull'' Connor, the public safety
commissioner who ordered firefighters to blast demonstrators with
high-pressure fire hoses during a 1963 protest in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Mosca said Sharpton had to be punished for breaking the law. The
sit-in obstructed the main artery in and out of Atlantic City and
could have caused delays for emergency medical vehicles trying to
get to Atlantic City Medical Center, the area's only regional
trauma center, Mosca said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you let him do that, what's the difference for somebody
with another social cause?'' Mosca said.
</P>
<P>
   Weekes agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how noble the cause, you cannot commit an
independently illegal act. There are too many other ways (to
protest),'' Weekes told Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   He sentenced him to two 30-day terms, but suspended all but 10
days of each. The 10-day terms will be served concurrently.
Sharpton also was ordered to pay $310 in court costs.
</P>
<P>
   He has 20 days to appeal, but he was unsure if he would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may not appeal. I want to make this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has been convicted of criminal trespassing four times,
according to Mosca. In 1993, he served 30 days of a 45-day term on
one of the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go from 45 days to 10 days means I'm going too
mainstream,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Former Rep. Perkins Pleas Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Kentucky Rep. Chris Perkins entered
another guilty plea Wednesday in connection with his role in the
House banking scandal for which he already served prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat, who was in the House from 1984 to 1992, pleaded
guilty to criminal contempt. He admitted to lying to a federal
probation officer about his income while a judge was trying to
determine whether he should be fined for his role in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court documents state that during two
conversations with the officer in 1994, Perkins, a lawyer, said his
combined income in 1993 and 1994 was approximately $175,000. In
reality, he earned at least $315,000 in 1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the false information, Judge Royce Lamberth did
not impose a fine, though he did sentence Perkins to 21 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The banking scandal was uncovered in 1991 and 1992, when the
House Ethics Committee discovered thousands of overdrafts written
by lawmakers at a special bank that existed solely for their
benefit. The bank paid the overdrafts, so none of the checks
bounced.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said he wrote bad checks totaling about $300,000 and
made false or misleading statements to obtain loans from commercial
banks. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud, conspiracy to file false
statements with the Federal Elections Commission and filing false
financial-disclosure statements with the House.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen other people were convicted in connection with
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea agreement, Perkins faces up to a $5,000 fine or six
months in prison for his latest conviction. Sentencing was delayed
when Perkins' attorney, Jeffrey Jacobovitz, argued that District of
Columbia law requires the new plea to be treated as a separate case
rather than a related proceeding. That means it should be randomly
assigned to a new judge, Jacobovitz argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''That strains logic,'' argued U.S. Attorney Jonathan Rusch.
''It clearly pertains to the sentencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth asked both sides to file briefs and said he would then
decide whether to sentence Perkins or hand the case over to another
judge.
</P>
<P>
   A new judge would not be bound by the sentence called for in the
plea agreement, and Perkins could withdraw his plea if that judge
were to require a lengthier sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is studying to become a Presbyterian minister and asked
Lamberth not to sentence him before May because it would interfere
with his classes. The judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll be able to tell some interesting stories from the
pulpit someday,'' Lamberth said.

<HEADLINE> Wrong Students Given Scholarships  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty-nine students were told last month they
had won prestigious government scholarships for graduate study,
only to find out later that it was all a big mistake and they were
only runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think my heart snapped in half,'' a California doctoral
candidate wrote her congressional delegation in a plea for help.
</P>
<P>
   Help came Wednesday when the Education Department called the
runners-up and said they will get the fellowships after all, as
will the rightful winners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were working at first to find out what happened and why an
error occurred. After reviewing that, we came to the conclusion
this was the right thing to do,'' Education Department spokeswoman
Erica Lepping said.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost taxpayers close to $1 million to fix the error,
which the government is blaming on a private contractor that sent
the wrong letters.
</P>
<P>
   Lepping said the mistake was discovered when a runner-up,
officially called an ''alternate,'' called the agency with a
question.
</P>
<P>
   At stake were the prestigious Jacob K. Javits Fellowships, which
have been awarded since 1986. Named for the late liberal Republican
senator from New York, the fellowships pay tuition and fees plus a
stipend for doctoral and master's candidates in the arts,
humanities and social sciences. Current stipends are $15,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The winners are selected on merit and financial need and get up
to four years of financial support. Some 1,100 to 1,300 students
apply each year. This year there were 138 winners, in addition to
39 alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Under privacy rules, the names of scholarship winners are
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who got the good news and then the bad news was the
California student, who found a message on her answering machine
telling her she wasn't really a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The way she found out ''was devastating'' and ''very flaky,''
said Nancy Coolidge, coordinator for government relations and
student financial support at the University of California system.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge shared the student's e-mail but said the woman didn't
want to be named. It was one of many such pleas to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government is considering legal action against the
contractor, DTI Associates of Arlington, Va. The company has a
one-year, $190,000 contract to handle applications.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Rankin, director of government services at DTI, said
Wednesday: ''We physically mailed letters that were developed by
the Department of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he issued a statement saying: ''An unfortunate
miscommunication between both parties led to a clerical error. We
are actively working with the department to resolve this issue. Our
sincere concern is with the scholars and that is that they're
treated with respect throughout this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39 students had the law on their side, though Lepping said
no lawsuits were threatened. An amendment to the Higher Education
Act of 1992 bars the department from retracting Javits fellowships
after they are awarded, unless the student lied on the application.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, alternates get fellowships only when winners decline
the fellowship because they have gotten money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates the mistake could cost up to $975,000,
depending on how many winners take the fellowships.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hartle, lobbyist for the American Council on Education in
Washington, an umbrella group for higher education institutions,
applauded the government's move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows the sort of government errors that hurt individual
people,'' Hartle said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Retool for Gen. Election  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore, party nominations
assured, reached out to John McCain's independent-minded primary
voters Wednesday, each man determined to capture the middle ground
where the battle for the White House will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore and Republican Bush also planned to replenish
their campaign treasuries, tinker with their senior staffs and
coordinate political operations with their national parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain tapped into a vein,'' Bush told The Associated
Press. ''The McCain supporters will hear my message of reform:
reforming schools, reforming the military, reforming the tax code,
and renewal, renewing the spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, the vice president invoked McCain's name more often
than President Clinton's. In a round of TV interviews, he twice
started a sentence, ''Like John McCain, I. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Both nominees-in-waiting are scouring exit polls that validate
McCain's ability to draw Democrats, independents and first-time
Republican voters into the political process. In Republican
contests Tuesday, 60 percent of the independent voters backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where candidates were ranked by all voters on a
single ballot, McCain finished third overall to Gore and Bush. But
he was the top vote-getter among independents, securing more than
one-third of the total.
</P>
<P>
   His strength is the weakness of both Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   National polls suggest the two are virtually even among
independent voters. Bush held a wide lead over Gore in the category
a few months ago, and his slippage helps explain why his overall
lead in head-to-head matchups against the vice president has
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   One third of Americans see Bush as too conservative and about a
third see Gore as too liberal, most national polls say. The numbers
broke the same way Tuesday in California, the nation's biggest
general election prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bigger problem for Bush than Gore, but both of them are
going to have to focus on a broader constituency than they have so
far,'' said Al From, chairman of the moderate Democratic Leadership
Council.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, both candidates courted their party's most
active primary voters, who tend to be more liberal or conservative
than the average American.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested in a debate that he would require top military
leaders to accept gays serving openly in the military. He backed
off the remark, but Republicans plan to use it against him in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush allies are poised to accuse Gore of putting himself in
labor's pocket in exchange for its support in the primaries. They
will also compare Gore's call for universal health coverage to
Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed plan and criticize the vice
president's courtship of New York's controversial Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to hoard his money and stick to a moderate message
throughout the primaries, but scrapped the strategy when McCain
thumped him in New Hampshire. He seemed to lurch to the right,
visiting a staunch conservative university in South Carolina,
refusing to meet with a gay GOP activists group and fostering
informal ties with evangelical leader Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain fanning the flames, Bush lost the independent vote
by a 3-to-1 margin in some states.
</P>
<P>
   ''He obviously took a few hits, but it's all curable,'' said
Charlie Black, a GOP strategist and informal Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking that antidote, Bush is promising change, character and
compassion -- dubbed ''the three C's'' by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting McCain supporters, he is telling voters he reformed
schools, the civil justice system and welfare in Texas. He has
McCain's coalition in mind, too, when he attacks the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is touting his education proposals to appeal to a larger
pool of independents -- suburban voters who swing between the two
parties but don't participate in GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''While McCain voters are a priority, they're only one of
several groups of swing voters we'll be going after,'' said Bush
strategist Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for the same audience, Gore is promising to restrict
access to guns, protect the economy and save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates tinker with the messages, their operatives
are getting general election campaigns into shape:
</P>
<P>
   --The Republican National Committee and Democratic National
Committee are planning multimillion dollar ad campaigns to benefit
their nominees.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore is considering moving his campaign manager, Donna Brazile,
to the DNC to oversee the party. Bush plans to install an ally at
the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush's team in Austin was meeting with RNC officials this week
to discuss how the party is gearing up for the general election.
One topic: Opposition research on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --The RNC is polling to find Gore's vulnerabilities. A copy of
the polls, obtained by the AP, shows that voters are being asked
about his ''flip-flopping'' on abortion, his claim to have invented
the Internet and his involvement in questionable 1996 fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush plans to add heft to his senior team by bringing aboard
strategists with presidential campaign experience.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush plans to raise $10 million in the next few weeks to refill
his campaign coffers. Gore spent his money more prudently, but must
abide by spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   --As early as next month, Bush could begin airing ads aimed at
general election audiences.
</P>
<P>
   --Both campaigns plan to reduce their payrolls by shipping aides
to national party payrolls.

<HEADLINE> US, NKorea Start Visit Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After a day of preliminary meetings, the United
States and North Korea began formal talks Wednesday to lay the
groundwork for a visit by a senior North Korean official next
month.
</P>
<P>
   No high-ranking North Korean has visited Washington since the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Charles Kartman and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan met at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, a State
Department official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has said the talks would be the last
session required before high-level talks in Washington that would
reciprocate a visit to Pyongyang last May by former Defense
Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sees the meetings as a milestone in the path
of normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the United States lifted trade, banking and other
sanctions that had been in place against North Korea for decades.
In exchange, North Korea promised not to test an intercontinental
ballistic missile so long as normalization talks with the United
States continue.
</P>
<P>
   During this week's talks, the U.S. coordinator for
counter-terrorism, Michael Sheehan, is to inform the North Koreans
of the steps they must take to be removed from the U.S. list of
countries that engage in international terrorism activities, U.S.
officials have said. One such step is a public pledge foreswearing
future involvement in terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries on the terrorism list. The
State Departments says North Korea has not been linked to any
terrorist incident since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Qwest Denies 3-Way Merger Is Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Qwest Communications Inc. gyrated in
morning trading Wednesday as the company denied a report that its
negotiations with another telecommunications company had broken
down.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that negotiations between Qwest and
Deutsche Telekcom AG had ''essentially ended,'' citing executives
close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, a long-distance company with an aggressive Internet
strategy, saw its shares fall as much as 10 percent in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The shares, however, regained much of the lost ground after
Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach said The Times' story was
''inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Qwest fell $2.56\ to $53.43} in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Though Qwest has confirmed it is holding talks with another
telecom company, it never has revealed which one. However, it has
been widely reported that Deutsche Telekom is the suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still in discussions with that telecommunications
company,'' Gronbach said Wednesday. ''When we have news either
regarding an agreement or the end of discussions, we will notify
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Qwest struck a deal to acquire U S West, a regional
telephone company based in Denver. Rumors spread last week that
Qwest, a long-distance phone company with an aggressive Internet
strategy, was negotiating with another company.
</P>
<P>
   U S West fired off a heated letter to Qwest Friday threatening
to sue Qwest if they backed out of their merger. Qwest responded by
saying it would only agree to a deal that included both Qwest and U
S West.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom would not comment on the report or on talks
with Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't join in media speculation about us ever being in
talks, so there is no need for us to comment the other way around,
that talks have ended,'' said spokesman Hans Ehnert.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for U S West also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   U S West's stock rose $1.50 to $69.62{ on the NYSE, where
Deutsche Telekom's U.S. shares fell $2.93} to $92.25.

<HEADLINE> Gerber taking on Johnson &AMP; Johnson in baby products war  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The two most recognized names in baby care --
Gerber and Johnson &AMP; Johnson-- are going head to head for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber Products Co. on Thursday is launching a line of powders,
oils and other toiletries for infants and toddlers, a move that
pits the king of baby food against baby care giant Johnson &AMP;
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Summit, N.J.-based Gerber has developed 14 new baby
products, including shampoos, diaper rash ointment and vitamin
drops. The most unique items in Gerber's new assortment are an
apple-banana flavored tooth and gum cleaner and a lavender-scented
baby wash.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber officials say they have high expectations for the
products because of their strong brand recognition. Gerber, which
began selling baby food in 1928, controls about 75 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the most trusted brand name going,'' said Frank
Palantoni, Gerber's president and chief executive officer. ''We
almost owe it to our customers to give them new products.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerber's products will cost slightly less than J&AMP;J's. For
example, Gerber's 15 ounce baby powder is priced at $3, compared to
$3.29 for Johnson's baby powder, which holds 57 percent of the
market, according to Information Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber's new products, which began rolling out in February,
should be in most pharmacies and grocers nationwide by the end of
this month, when the company plans to kick off its advertising
campaign. In addition to television and print ads, the company
plans a big direct marketing effort that will offer coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts say it's wise for Gerber, a subsidiary of
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, to try to leverage its brand
to other types of baby goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gerber has a really well established name connected to
babies,'' said Roland Rust, professor of marketing at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn. ''So they stand a really good chance
of making it work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rust said New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&AMP;J, can control product
placement on store shelves and can fight back to limit Gerber's
visibility. And J&AMP;J has the edge because consumers know exactly
what they're getting with its skin care goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers may trust the Gerber brand in general, but they are
still not sure what they are buying'' with Gerber's new products,''
Rust said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Gerber has ventured out of the food
aisle. The company also sells baby furniture such as guard rails
and it licenses a line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;J officials refused to comment on Gerber's move.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of the new pianos sold in the United States
last year, 32,000 were grands, 60,000 were uprights and 86,000
digitals, for a total value of $830 million.
</P>
<P>
   The International Music Products Association says that was up
from $799 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Terry Lewis, a vice president of the major piano
manufacturer Yamaha, estimated that there were at least 17 million
used pianos in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated that 20 million Americans play the piano.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Gallup survey of 1,740 Americans reported that 31 percent
of youngsters between the ages of five and 17 played an instrument,
and that one in three of those played the piano. The margin of
error for the poll was 5 to 10 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Mazuka Appointed Rwanda Premier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda's president on Wednesday named a
new prime minister to succeed Pierre-Celestin Rwigema, who resigned
amid corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Makuza was expected to name a new Cabinet when he
returns this weekend from Germany, where he has been serving as
Rwanda's ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Makuza is a member of the main Hutu political party, the
Republican Democratic Movement, or MDR. Under power-sharing
agreements, the MDR appoints the prime minister while the Tutsi-led
Rwandan Patrotic Front, which stopped the 1994 genocide, holds most
other seats in the government, including the presidency and vice
presidency. The prime minister's post is largely ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   State-run Radio Rwanda announced President Pasteur Bizimungu's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rwigema resigned Feb. 28 after a parliamentary commission blamed
him for mishandling part of a $23 million donation by the World
Bank while serving as education minister. He was the third top Hutu
official to step down in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   A Tutsi-led rebel force seized power and formed a government of
national unity in 1994 after its Hutu extremist successor killed
500,000 minority Tutsis and political moderate Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Caucus Results Not Ready Yet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The final results of Tuesday's Hawaii Democratic
Party caucuses won't be ready until early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts on islands beyond Oahu are having trouble
compiling their numbers and sending them to party headquarters in
Honolulu, a party official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers should arrive by Friday and should be compiled by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary figures compiled at midnight Wednesday,
Vice President Al Gore won nearly all of Hawaii's 14 delegates to
the national convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, won at least one
delegate from the 1st Congressional District, which encompasses
urban Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   The early count from the 2nd Congressional District,
encompassing rural Oahu and the other Hawaiian Islands, shows Gore
with a similar lead, although only about half of those districts
have reported results to party headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 60.50; Nasdaq Up 49.55  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks finished a turbulent session mostly
higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's latest assessment of
the economy reassured investors who were still uneasy following
Tuesday's huge selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.50 to close at
9,856.53, recovering some of the 374 points it lost Tuesday. The
Nasdaq composite index, which had tumbled as much as 125 points in
early trading Wednesday, finished up 49.33 at 4,897.17.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher, with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 up 11.08 at 1,366.70. But declining stocks were ahead of
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock
Market, a sign that investors remained on edge.
</P>
<P>
   The market showed signs of stabilizing in the morning and
afternoon although the Dow and the Nasdaq changed direction several
times while investors, still stunned by Tuesday's profit warning
from Procter &AMP; Gamble, tried to determine their next moves. The
Nasdaq was in negative territory much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But in late afternoon, some of the market's gains solidified
after Fed economists released their ''beige book'' survey of
economic conditions. The Fed found that although workers' wages are
rising, there is little evidence of inflation in the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which central bankers will consider when they meet
March 21 to discuss their interest rate policy, calmed investors'
fears that rates are headed sharply higher. The Fed has raised
rates four times since last June, and Chairman Alan Greenspan has
made no secret of his willingness to raise rates further to slow
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate concerns have undermined industrial and financial
stocks for weeks, bringing the Dow down sharply from the closing
high of 11,722.98 it set in mid-January. With such an atmosphere of
uncertainty, Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning Tuesday that higher costs
for raw materials would depress its earnings completely unnerved
investors; they became convinced that profits would suffer at other
companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble remained out of favor Wednesday, falling 3 to
58 and extending its loss of 25 7/16 from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said investors seemed to believe the blue chips
had paid too great a price for Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense to the magnitude of the selloff,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo. ''It was an overreaction that has really
created some good buying opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2{ to 71, and Merck rose 2~
to 56 13/16. Drug stocks outside the Dow were higher, too.
Bristol-Myers Squibb soared 4\ to 47}.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some beaten-up sectors of the market are finally getting some
attention,'' said Francis Gannon, senior vice president and
portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's performance was mixed as investors continued taking
profits from some of the stocks that propelled the index above
5,000 for a brief time on Tuesday. Technology high-flyer JDS
Uniphase fell 11} to 275|, and Applied Materials fell 4} to 179].
</P>
<P>
   Buyers stepped in by midafternoon to pick up some high-tech
favorites. Oracle rose 8 3/16 to 83[ after announcing that it will
join with Wal-Mart and Chevron Corp. to launch an online supply
exchange for the convenience-store industry. Also, Microsoft rose 2
11/16 to 95 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to continue to buy the stocks that are leading the
market, and for the forseeable future, that means technology,''
Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The market was also listening closely Wednesday morning as
Greenspan spoke to a banking conference in San Antonio, Texas. The
Fed chairman warned banks to maintain their lending standards even
in the face of strong economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's speech contributed to some nervousness, traders
said. While Greenspan did not discuss interest rates or monetary
policy, he repeated his concerns about Americans' inflated
expectations of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, five stocks fell for
every four that rose.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.48 billion shares, compared with 1.30
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.79 to 594.68.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.9 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index slid 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.5 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Urge Restricting IMF  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders embraced
proposals Wednesday to radically restrict the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, limiting future IMF loans to
short-term emergency funds and eliminating most World Bank loans in
favor of grants to the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   But top Democrats contended the members of the congressional
advisory committee who approved the recommendations were engaged in
a reckless ''slash-and-burn'' attack that threatened to destabilize
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The International Financial Institution Advisory Commission
accused both the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending agency, the
World Bank, of getting into activities far beyond their original
missions. The panel's report, approved 8-3 and formally given to
Congress on Wednesday, called for drastically cutting back the
scope of both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Both institutions were wasting billions of dollars by making
loans to countries that had access to private capital flows, the
panel said.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that the IMF restrict its future loans to
providing short-term emergency funding to countries facing
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   And the World Bank, it said, should eventually halt 75 percent
of the loans it is now making to countries such as China that can
raise capital from commercial banks. Instead, it should be renamed
the World Development Agency and refocus its efforts to supplying
grants instead of loans to the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, composed of six members appointed by Republican
congressional leaders and five by Democratic leaders, was created
as part of 1998 legislation that boosted U.S. support for the IMF
by $18 billion to replenish resources strained by the Asian
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, praised the panel for devising bold recommendations
that they said should set the stage for legislative reforms in
coming months. Any U.S. proposals for changes could not take effect
unless endorsed by the institutions' other member countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''This report will help reverse years of IMF mission creep,''
Armey told reporters at a ceremony where Commission Chairman Allan
Meltzer, a Carnegie Mellon University economics professor, formally
turned over the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we implement the commission's recommendations, we will turn
the IMF around. No longer will the IMF offer overly ambitious
schemes to redesign entire economies. No longer will it impose
Herbert Hoover-style austerity plans on countries in trouble,''
Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the
recommendations ''an extreme, neo-isolationist attitude toward key
institutions. ... Instead of proposing thoughtful reform, the
report takes a slash-and-burn approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., accused the group of
adopting a ''reckless'' approach to the two institutions that would
''likely increase, not decrease, world poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp division in views extended to the panel itself. All
six commission members appointed by Republicans supported the final
report along with two Democratic appointees, Jeffrey Sachs, a
Harvard University economist, and Richard Huber, the former
chairman of insurance giant Aetna Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the report were the other three Democratic
appointees: C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for
International Economics in Washington; former Rep. Esteban Torres,
D-Calif., and Jerome Levinson, a former Agency for International
Development official.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten, speaking at an acrimonious news conference where both
sides traded charges, said he and others dissented because the
majority views, if adopted, would ''totally gut the role of the IMF
as a defender of international financial stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sachs, a longtime IMF and World Bank critic, said he
supported the recommendations because he believed they represented
a good starting point for achieving necessary reform at the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said the panel unanimously agreed on limiting the IMF to
short-term loans and forgiving the debts of the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's proposals were more modest,
including halting the IMF's long-term development loans.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Industry Stock Drop Mulled  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Cruise industry executives see no good
reason for their plunging stock prices and believe drops as big as
50 percent this year represent only a hiccup in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see no justifiable reason why our company is worth 45
percent less than it was two months ago,'' Richard Fain, chairman
and CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. told the industry's annual
Seatrade conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are concerned about the industry's ability to fill
17,633 newly made beds on 13 ships adding 10 percent capacity this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We not only expect to fill that increased capacity but to do
so at higher prices,'' said Fain, who heads the industry's
second-largest cruise company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fill our ships. Will there be a hiccup along the way?
Perhaps. Who's to tell?'' said Carnival Cruise Lines president Bob
Dickinson. ''Do you suppose we're being penalized for being
profitable? Look at the dot-coms.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry-leading Carnival Corp.'s stock was trading above $50 in
January but closed Tuesday at $24.50, forcing it to cancel the
purchase of a time-share company.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking stock price also prompted a lawsuit on behalf of
shareholders who bought Carnival shares between Feb. 25, 1999 and
Feb. 16, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach LLP, which
has offices in Boca Raton, New York and elsewhere, announced
Wednesday it has filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Southern
District of Florida, claiming Carnival and certain executives
violated securities law by issuing ''false and misleading
statements'' about the company's finances. At the same time, the
suit alleges, they were selling the company's ''artificially
inflated'' stock, gaining $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said, ''We believe the
complaint is completely without merit, and there is absolutely
nothing to support the allegation made in the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise industry executives maintain it's not fundamentals that
are weighing down their share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Calian, president of money-losing American Classic
Voyages Co., suggested online commerce companies with triple-digit
growth are just more exciting than the cruise industry's steady
growth, regardless of profits.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't done much for share prices, the Internet has
been a ''godsend'' for making information about the industry more
accessible, Dickinson said. Although Carnival sells less than 1
percent of its trips directly to consumers over the Internet, he
estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of sales have an Internet
component.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of soaring fuel costs shouldn't hurt industry performance,
executives said. Rising oil prices aren't as important as they were
25 years ago when fuel was as much as 25 percent of operating
costs, Dickinson said. More efficient ship engines have brought
fuel costs under 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Higher gasoline and aviation fuel prices actually might push
summer vacationers to keep their cars parked, skip flights and hop
ships instead, some speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The industry blames Y2K worries for a slowdown in cruise
bookings last November and December. But Dickinson noted Monday's
bookings at Carnival were up from a year ago, feeding his
enthusiasm for sailing full.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the industry remains bullish on its prospects.
Executives are investing $15 billion in new ships in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson is more worried about ''a serious problem of imbalance
of supply and demand in four or five years, where we won't have
enough supply.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush Must Woo Independents  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's fierce nomination fight
against John McCain appears to have hurt him with the independent
voters he'll need in November, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush and Al Gore have solidified their support among
party regulars and claimed sweeping victories in this week's
primaries, both must turn their attention to the independent voters
who often decide general elections.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was far ahead in the national polls, he fared much
better among independents than Gore. Now the two candidates are
very close in national polls, and among independents, who flocked
to the insurgent candidacy of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nomination struggle drew independents into the
GOP primaries by the tens of thousands, but that was a decidedly
mixed blessing for the party and for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters across the nation Tuesday were about evenly
split on whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of Bush,
who started his campaign by appealing to that group and to
moderates of all sorts. The exit polls were taken in 11 states
Tuesday by the Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated
Press and the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had to veer to the right politically to win the crucial
South Carolina primary last month, including his now well-known
stop at Bob Jones University. And Bush's campaign against McCain, a
senator from Arizona, turned increasingly personal and nasty in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of independent voters in the Republican primaries
said they would vote for Gore, while six in 10 said they would vote
for Bush in a November matchup. Among the independent voters who
participated in Democratic primaries, a fifth said they would vote
for Bush, while three-fourths said they would vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of independents in the GOP primaries said
Bush is too conservative, while four in 10 said his positions on
the issues are about right. About a fifth of independents in
Democratic primaries said Gore is too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Mathews, a 57-year-old Republican from Ellicott City, Md.,
said Bush's battle with McCain gave Bush a right-wing image that is
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that he got labeled as 'Christian right,' but that's
not the way he really is,'' said the budget official with the
Howard County Sheriff's Office. ''That whole Bob Jones thing was
just a debacle, but he's more mainstream than that.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the independent voters in Republican primaries
said Bush made unfair attacks against McCain, a candidate admired
by many independents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like McCain,'' said Kathy Sullivan, 49, who works at a
travel agency in the Providence, R.I., area. ''I think McCain is
admirable and Bush is a little arrogant and cocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's battle against Bradley didn't seem to drive a wedge among
independents to the extent the Republican battle did. Independent
voters in the Democratic primaries viewed Gore favorably by a 2-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Some remain wary of Gore, however, giving Bush room to win them
back.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Jolene Cook, 23, of Westfield, Mass., joined the
Democratic Party to vote for Bill Bradley, and she said Gore
''seems to believe what he hears in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   California, with its nonpartisan primary, had an exit poll that
offered results from the state's entire electorate. A slight
majority there saw Gore favorably, with more than four in 10 having
an unfavorable view.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers on Bush were reversed, with a majority seeing him
unfavorably and just under four in 10 having an unfavorable view.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has his work cut out for him,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press.
''He has to get the independents back and the Democrats who once
had wandered away from Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter News Service interviewed 11,420 voters in the Democratic
primaries and 13,156 voters in the Republican primaries at
precincts in states across the country holding primaries Tuesday.
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 1 percentage point
for the Republicans and for the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall As Stocks Revive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds prices fell moderately Wednesday, amid a
rebound in the stock market following Tuesday's drop in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32 point, or
$2.18} cents per $1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves the
opposite direction, rose to 6.16 percent from Tuesday's 6.14
percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Ties With Pakistan, India Urged  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maintaining contact with both India and
Pakistan could be ''extremely important'' to U.S. national
interests, the State Department said Wednesday in defending
President Clinton's decision to add Pakistan to his tour of South
Asia this month.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin noted that Clinton's contacts with
former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last summer helped defuse
tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to depart Washington on March 18 and
return the following weekend, will spend several hours in Pakistan
after a much longer stay in India. A stop in Bangladesh also is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The president made his decision to go to Pakistan after an
internal debate about the propriety of visiting a country where the
military seized power from an elected government in October.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are U.S. concerns about Pakistani support for
the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which harbors reputed
terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Also of concern are the ties
between Pakistani authorities and Islamic militants trying to oust
India from the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Clinton does not intend to mediate the Kashmir
conflict, a stand certain the please India because of its unbending
opposition to any outside intervention in the dispute. India and
Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences over the Himalayan region took on a new
dimension when both engaged in underground tests of nuclear devices
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Pakistan enjoyed close Cold War ties but
there has been a deterioration of late, as Rubin noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made clear our concerns about democracy, made clear
our profound concerns about not enough being done to combat
terrorism. And we've made clear our profound concerns about
nonproliferation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he said, Clinton is going to Pakistan
''because the United States is a friend of the Pakistani nation. It
is not because he approves of or acquiesces in the government of
the General (Pervez) Musharraf.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pakistani Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi expressed hope
Wednesday that Clinton's visit will pave the way for some type of
U.S. role in resolving Indo-Pakistani disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try to set in motion a peace process,'' she told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries have never resolved disputes on their own and
make progress only when there is third party intercession, Lodhi
said.

<HEADLINE> House Challenging Gun Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Appropriations Committee is
challenging the Department of Housing and Urban Development's use
of money designated for fighting drugs to instead fund a federal
gun buyback championed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't about the efficacy of the program; it is a question
of whether HUD has the legal authority for it,'' Elizabeth Morra,
an Appropriations Committee spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morra said the challenge to HUD's authority on the gun buyback
is based on a decision from a similar conclusion reached by
congressional auditors this week.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the purchases, averaging about $50 a gun, now flows
through HUD's Drug Elimination Program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere in the grant does it authorize using the funding for a
gun buyback program,'' Morra said. ''HUD would have to prove that
the gun buyback will directly eliminate drugs and they haven't
provided us any proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appropriations Committee, as part of an $9 billion emergency
appropriations bill, plans to vote Thursday on rescinding the
$700,000 that HUD has earmarked for the buyback program this year,
Morra said.
</P>
<P>
   Housing authorities in 80 cities have signed up for the gun
buyback program, HUD spokesman David Egner said, but only
Louisville, Ky., has begun buying back guns under the federal
program. Egner said 179 guns were purchased Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its unfortunate that some members of Congress want to stop
public housing authorities and police departments from carrying out
local programs to by back guns, reduce violence and save lives,''
Egner said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced last September what was billed as
the nation's largest gun buyback program with the goal of removing
300,000 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia bought 2,306 guns during an
experimental two-day offer in August. That no-questions-asked
program took in guns from across the city, not only from
neighborhoods near housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Washington program, the national buyback offer would
not include amnesty for any crimes committed with the guns.
District of Columbia police are now running ballistics tests on the
purchased guns in trying match them with crimes or suspected
criminals.

<HEADLINE> An AP News Analysis  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS MARTELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Woodrow Wilson's New Jersey legacy remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Super Tuesday vanquished New Jersey favorite son Bill
Bradley's presidential ambitions for this year, Wilson will
continue to be the last New Jerseyan to occupy the White House --
and he did that more than three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with publisher Steve Forbes' early departure, the two
New Jersey candidates for president didn't get a chance to see how
they would have fared with New Jersey voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden State never expected to have much of an impact on
presidential politics during the primary season once forces from
both major parties conspired to retain the state's
last-in-the-nation primary date. Bradley, shut out in the primary
battles, never endured such a losing streak when he played
basketball for Princeton and the Knicks. He would surely have loved
to have had an early New Jersey primary to give him some kind of
boost against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls showed New Jersey could have been a kind state to
Republican John McCain, whose presidential ambitions were delivered
a potentially mortal blow on Tuesday. But state voters won't settle
anything presidential when they hit the polls for the June 6
primary.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean New Jersey politics won't continue to buzz.
There's still the battle for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by
Democrat Frank Lautenberg. There is the continuing speculation
about what kind of role Gov. Christie Whitman will have in the Bush
campaign. And, of course, the candidates for the 2001 governor's
race will begin to line up in earnest come June.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic State Committee Chairman Thomas Giblin has mixed
feelings about Super Tuesday. Giblin supported Bradley, but said
New Jersey Democrats were scared out of their wits by a potential
McCain candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather be facing George Bush in
the general election than John McCain,'' said Giblin.
</P>
<P>
   Giblin pegs Bradley's poor showing on reports of his irregular
heartbeat (''Americans kind of have superhuman expectations of
their presidents''), a lack of support from traditional Democratic
strongholds such as labor, and McCain's public battles with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bradley started out as the reformer,'' Giblin said. ''But John
McCain became the darling of this issue, and took away his thunder.
But Bradley proved to be a blessing in disguise for Al Gore,
forcing him to get his campaign apparatus up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican State Committee Chairman Garabed Haytaian, meanwhile,
said he believes Bush can carry New Jersey because Republicans
''will be going hard after Al Gore, questioning his honesty and
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain drew headlines, Bush always had the support of the
organization Republicans who usually carry the day in primaries.
One was Whitman, who found herself in an interesting position.
Republican presidential candidates generally play to the right
during the primaries and then try to moderate for the general
election. Bush is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, used Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University
in South Carolina to attack the religious right in the party. This
is the same religious right that has made a living attacking
Whitman for her support of abortion rights. But Whitman supported
Bush, even though the announcement was a Saturday night affair in
Connecticut, a state that went for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has long called for Republicans not to be held hostage
by the right wing of the party. But unlike other moderates, she has
stayed away from making this an all-or-nothing issue, seeking to
preserve a semblance of party unity. She said those who try to kick
other Republicans out of the party get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reading people out of the party doesn't seem to work,''
Whitman said. ''It doesn't benefit anyone to do that kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said her role in the Bush campaign is not clear, but she
is willing to help in any way she can. The governor's role may be
higher key during the general election because Republicans will try
to entice the voters who liked McCain -- independents and moderates.
Many in the party discount her as vice presidential timber because
of the abortion issue, but nothing is set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   While Giblin feared McCain, Republican Haytaian says he fears
the Senate candidacy of former Gov. Jim Florio, an old warhorse who
is squaring off in the Democratic primary against rich rookie Jon
Corzine, the former Wall Street maven.
</P>
<P>
   Haytaian says even though the Democratic establishment doesn't
like Florio for his tax increases a decade ago, ''Voters may not
remember that. And he's a good campaigner.''
</P>
<P>
   Giblin doubts that, saying if Florio is nominated, ''Chuck will
go out and buy a box of cigars.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 60.50; Nasdaq Up 49.42  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks finished a turbulent session mostly
higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's latest assessment of
the economy reassured investors who were still uneasy following
Tuesday's huge selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.50 to close at
9,856.53, recovering some of the 374 points it lost Tuesday. The
Nasdaq composite index, which had tumbled as much as 125 points in
early trading Wednesday, finished up 49.42 at 4,897.26.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher, with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 up 11.08 at 1,366.70. But declining stocks were ahead of
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock
Market, a sign that investors remained on edge.
</P>
<P>
   The market showed signs of stabilizing in the morning and
afternoon although the Dow and the Nasdaq changed direction several
times while investors, still stunned by Tuesday's profit warning
from Procter &AMP; Gamble, tried to determine their next moves. The
Nasdaq was in negative territory much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But in late afternoon, some of the market's gains solidified
after Fed economists released their ''beige book'' survey of
economic conditions. The Fed found that although workers' wages are
rising, there is little evidence of inflation in the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which central bankers will consider when they meet
March 21 to discuss their interest rate policy, calmed investors'
fears that rates are headed sharply higher. The Fed has raised
rates four times since last June, and Chairman Alan Greenspan has
made no secret of his willingness to raise rates further to slow
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate concerns have undermined industrial and financial
stocks for weeks, bringing the Dow down sharply from the closing
high of 11,722.98 it set in mid-January. With such an atmosphere of
uncertainty, Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning Tuesday that higher costs
for raw materials would depress its earnings completely unnerved
investors; they became convinced that profits would suffer at other
companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble remained out of favor Wednesday, falling 3 to
58 and extending its loss of 25 7/16 from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said investors seemed to believe the blue chips
had paid too great a price for Procter &AMP; Gamble's warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense to the magnitude of the selloff,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co. in Kansas City, Mo. ''It was an overreaction that has really
created some good buying opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2{ to 71, and Merck rose 2~
to 56 13/16. Drug stocks outside the Dow were higher, too.
Bristol-Myers Squibb soared 4\ to 47}.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some beaten-up sectors of the market are finally getting some
attention,'' said Francis Gannon, senior vice president and
portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's performance was mixed as investors continued taking
profits from some of the stocks that propelled the index above
5,000 for a brief time on Tuesday. Technology high-flyer JDS
Uniphase fell 11} to 275|, and Applied Materials fell 4} to 179].
</P>
<P>
   Buyers stepped in by midafternoon to pick up some high-tech
favorites. Oracle rose 8 3/16 to 83[ after announcing that it will
join with Wal-Mart and Chevron Corp. to launch an online supply
exchange for the convenience-store industry. Also, Microsoft rose 2
11/16 to 95 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to continue to buy the stocks that are leading the
market, and for the forseeable future, that means technology,''
Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The market was also listening closely Wednesday morning as
Greenspan spoke to a banking conference in San Antonio, Texas. The
Fed chairman warned banks to maintain their lending standards even
in the face of strong economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's speech contributed to some nervousness, traders
said. While Greenspan did not discuss interest rates or monetary
policy, he repeated his concerns about Americans' inflated
expectations of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen growing evidence of credit granted solely on the
expectation that current robust conditions will continue
indefinitely, with little thought as to how borrowers might perform
under more stressful conditions,'' Greenspan told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, five stocks fell for
every four that rose.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.48 billion shares, compared with 1.30
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.79 to 594.68.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.9 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index slid 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.5 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes China Trade Pact  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress on Wednesday
to approve a major trade agreement with Beijing, saying it offers
the most significant opportunity for positive change in China since
President Nixon's historic visit three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can work to pull China in the right direction or we can
turn our backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong
direction,'' the president said as he submitted legislation to
establish permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would scrap Congress' annual, contentious review of
China's human rights and trade record. The promise of permanent
trade privileges was part of a market-opening deal under which
China pledged to cut import barriers on American goods and services
in return for U.S. support for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization
</P>
<P>
   China's trade status is one of the biggest battles facing
Congress. It's an issue complicated by election-year politics and
an alignment of strange political alliances linking Clinton with
Republicans and their business allies against Democrats and their
supporters among organized labor, environmentalists and human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The White House argues that open trade with China would be a
bonanza for American companies and workers, tearing down barriers
that have prevented U.S. firms from competing in the world's most
populous country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that China violates workers' rights, persecutes
religious minorities and cannot be trusted to honor any trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spelled out his case in an address to a sympathetic
audience at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advance International
Studies. He said the United States has a profound stake in what
happens in China and how China relates to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voting against (permanent trade status) won't free a single
prisoner (in China) or create a single job in America or reassure a
single American ally in Asia,'' the president said. ''It will
simply empower the most rigid anti-democratic elements in the
Chinese government. It would leave the Chinese people with less
contact with the democratic world and more resistance from their
government to outside forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our friends and allies would wonder why, after 30 years of
pushing China in the right direction, we turned our backs now that
they finally appear to be willing to take us up on it,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the people of Taiwan, despite tensions with China,
want to see Beijing in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton said that Martin Lee, the Hong Kong leader who
has struggled for free elections and freedom of speech, supports
the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quoted a letter from Lee as saying that the agreement
''represents the best long-term hope for China to become a member
of good-standing in the international community. We fear that
should ratification fail, any hope for political and legal reform
process would also recede.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the agreement ''represents the most significant
opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China
since the 1970s, when President Nixon first went there and later in
the decade when President Carter normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am working as hard as I can to convince Congress and the
American people to seize this opportunity,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are wary about Clinton's commitment and are pushing
the president to intensify his efforts. ''Clearly, we're not going
to get any help from Democrats in the House unless the president
gets the votes,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said, ''It's fair to
say that a day doesn't go by with the president not working on
trying to get permanent normal trade relations with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules
Committee and a leader on trade matters, said he was convinced
there will be enough votes to grant permanent trade benefits to
China. He said Clinton has been working hard and needs to continue
pressing Democrats. ''Republicans are overwhelmingly supportive of
this.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Airport Funding Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of battling over the fine print,
the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill Wednesday that will
significantly increase money for airport safety and modernization
in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 82-17 to pass the compromise bill that
authorizes $40 billion over three years for Federal Aviation
Administration programs. The far-reaching bill also allows airports
to raise passenger taxes, increases flights out of some of the
nation's busiest airports and takes steps to make smaller-market
airports more economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to approve the bill next week, sending it
to President Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said it was a
''comprehensive and forward-looking bill'' that would ''add to the
capacity and efficiency of the system with record-level
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first shot we've got at really making the airways
safe for the American people,'' said Sen. John D. Rockefeller of
West Virginia, ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee's
aviation panel.
</P>
<P>
   New federal funding for aviation projects has been on hold since
the government's fiscal year began last Oct. 1 because the House
and Senate couldn't find common ground on how to set aside money
for aviation modernization. The two sides have finally reached a
compromise under which new money for aviation programs every year
will at least equal the revenues and interest of the Aviation Trust
Fund, which takes in some $10 billion a year in airport user fees.
</P>
<P>
   Spending in fiscal 2001 will be $12.7 billion, up $2.7 billion
from this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also:
</P>
<P>
   --Allow airports to raise their passenger taxes, or Passenger
Facility Charges, from $3 to $4.50, bringing in up to $700 million
more a year for local construction.
</P>
<P>
   --Phase out by 2007 flight limits out of New York's LaGuardia and
Kennedy airports. These ''high-capacity'' limits will end at
Chicago's O'Hare Airport in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   --Allow 24 more flights a day out of Washington's Reagan National
Airport, with 12 of those flights to destinations beyond the
current 1,250-mile ''perimeter rule.''
</P>
<P>
   --Provide matching grants of up to $500,000 to improve air
service in small communities.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase the air traffic control modernization budget by 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Require new criminal background checks and training for airport
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   --Impose new and increased penalties on airlines that violate
customer service agreements.
</P>
<P>
   --Amend the 1920 Death on the High Seas Act which bars families
of those lost in air disasters at sea -- such as the 1996 TWA 800
crash that killed 230 people -- from collecting non-economic
damages.
</P>
<P>
   --Regulate commercial air tours over national parks.

<HEADLINE> Helms Opposes Balkan Appointment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms said Wednesday he will oppose any attempt to promote a
senior U.S. diplomat who now oversees American policy in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., cited reports that the Clinton administration
would name James Dobbins assistant secretary of state for European
Affairs without submitting the appointment to the Senate as a
nomination. A State Department official said any possible
nomination would go through the normal procedure and require Senate
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his opposition, the senator referred to
allegations that Dobbins may have misled Congress about death
squads in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration knows that the Senate could not possibly
confirm anyone who has conducted himself in such a fashion, but for
some reason that I cannot fathom, some top officials of the
administration insist on promoting Mr. Dobbins,'' Helms said in a
statement. ''I hope and suggest that they reconsider this
position.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said through
a spokesman she had the highest confidence in Dobbins' integrity
and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins has served her and the United States ''extraordinarily
well'' and ''so far as I know he has been fully cleared of all
these allegations,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   On the reports of a promotion, Rubin said he could not comment
on any ''possible nominations by the president.'' But Rubin said if
Dobbins were to be promoted, it would go through the usual process
and require Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins, a former ambassador and a former member of the White
House national security staff, has produced documents showing he
was cleared in 1998 of accusations of intentionally misleading the
House International Relations Committee. But a letter was placed in
his file that year cautioning him to be more careful in future
testimony in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's inspector general, Jacquelyn L.
Williams-Bridgers, had found Dobbins ''acted with reckless
disregard'' in his testimony in 1995 about an FBI investigation
into the murder of a right-wing critic of President Jean-Bernard
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   A later inspector general found the allegations could not be
substantiated, a State Department official said. That inspector
general and a top Justice Department official are ready to testify
in support of Dobbins if he were nominated to the post, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also concluded Dobbins had not been briefed
fully by the FBI and that the information the FBI gave the U.S.
Embassy in Haiti was not specific, and in some cases inaccurate,
department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Albright selected Dobbins to oversee U.S. policy
in Bosnia and in Kosovo, Helms wrote Albright suggesting she pick
someone ''who has not been accused by the State Department's
inspector general of lying to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms said that any attempt by the State Department to try to
give Dobbins the new post without submitting his name to the Senate
would be ''a particularly egregious abuse of the nomination
process.''

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- A 32-year-old man admitted sexually
assaulting a 96-year-old woman at the nursing home where he works,
according to a police affidavit released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Dequoy was charged Tuesday with felonious sexual assault
after the woman told a supervisor at Integrated Health Services she
didn't want Dequoy washing her any more because he had ''been
fresh'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   Dequoy told police he touched the woman for his own sexual
gratification during a routine check last month to see if she had
wet her pants, according to the affidavit, written by Detective
Joseph King.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is punishable by 7{ to 15 years in prison. Dequoy was
in jail in lieu of $10,000 bail and faces a preliminary hearing
March 21.

<HEADLINE> UTC head promises no more layoffs for two years  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. will not make any
more deep cuts to its Connecticut workforce for at least the next
two years, the company's chief promised Connecticut lawmakers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the state's congressional delegation, UTC
Chairman George David also reiterated his company's plan to appeal
a court ruling blocking some of the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been in the process of eliminating 3,500 jobs
since it started a major restructuring and consolidation effort in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, UTC officials announced they'll add 1,700 more
jobs to that list by the end of the year mostly from the companies
Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet-engine manufacturing plants in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit brought by
the Machinists Union that plans to move some 500 repair jobs from
Connecticut to other states violates contractual requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers characterized Wednesday's meeting as positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any of us expected they would turn around the
layoffs but we hope they keep in mind as we go forward that
Connecticut is not just any state. We are their home state. We've
given a lot and we expect a little in return,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hartford, Conn., dozens of unionized workers
protested the planned job cuts in front of UTC headquarters. They
marched carrying signs that read ''Good Jobs, Strong Communities.''
</P>
<P>
   James Parent, with The Machinists union, District 91, said the
cuts would have an impact far beyond the fences of Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every 100 aerospace manufacturing jobs, it affects 393
other jobs,'' Parent said. ''This will affect the entire state of
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 of the job cuts will come from Pratt's the hourly
work force, mostly line workers in the company's East Hartford,
North Haven and Middletown plants. The remaining 200 cuts will come
from salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt &AMP; Whitney designs, manufactures and services jet engines,
space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cuts are due to contracts with foreign governments
that agree to buy Pratt products in return for some of the
manufacturing being done in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said David will now provide them with information
about these agreements, known as offsets, before they happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to know what these are about so we know if we are
lobbying for support of something that means a loss of jobs in the
state,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposed cuts are the result of the company's desire to
move operations to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he is hoping to convince David to compromise
rather than appeal the union's lawsuit. '' Every day, everywhere in
America, parties after a lower court's decision get together and
settle. Maybe that could mean keeping some of those jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   David said he was willing to consider the lawmakers' requests
but also wanted to make clear that ''we do not want to have
labor-management negotiations via the United States Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Air Crash Victims' Kin Hail Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air crash victims' families cheered the Senate
passage of an aviation bill Wednesday that would expand the scope
of damages for fatal crashes in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would amend the 1920 Death on the High Seas Act to
allow victims' families to seek ''non-economic'' awards in court
from airlines for loss of care, comfort and companionship. The law
currently allows relatives to seek only ''economic'' damages, such
as loss of wages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's call it a good first step,'' said Jim Hammond of Brier,
Wash., whose parents died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off
Nova Scotia in 1998. ''I am pleased that we are moving away from
the contours of an outdated and grossly unfair law.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also changes the definition of international waters
from three miles to 12 miles from U.S. coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The change would be retroactive to July 16, 1996, the day before
the crash of TWA Flight 800, which went down nine miles off Long
Island, N.Y. It also would remove any doubt that an Alaska Airlines
plane that crashed in January went down in territorial waters. That
plane crashed about nine miles from the California coast and about
three miles from some California islands.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were included in the $40 billion Federal Aviation
Administration bill, which the House is expected to approve next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, families of crash victims within the
12-mile zone could get damages under the same state laws that
govern land crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Death on the High Seas Act was passed four years before the
first commercial aviation flights in the United States and was
intended to help widows recover income they would have had from
sailors lost in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   But as air travel increased in the latter half of the 20th
Century, airlines used the 1920 law to limit damages in plane
crashes in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families are still not completely happy with the
proposed amendments. Many also want to be able to sue for damages
for the pain and suffering of crash victims.

<HEADLINE> ABC Waives Esiason From broadcast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Boomer Esiason was fired from the Monday Night
Football broadcasting team by ABC on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The network did not say who will be hired to join play-by-play
announcer Al Michaels in the booth next season.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason, a former Pro Bowl quarterback, retired from the
Cincinnati Bengals in 1998 to join the ABC telecasts. He lasted
only two seasons, one as part of a three-man booth with Michaels
and Dan Dierdorf, and then alone with Michaels in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also released by ABC were longtime producer Ken Wolfe and
director Craig Janoff after the show's ratings plummeted. Don
Ohlmeyer, who produced the broadcasts in the 1970s when Frank
Gifford, Don Meredith and Howard Cosell made Monday nights a
happening, was rehired as producer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a sameness,'' ABC sports president Howard Katz said.
''I feel we have to figure out how to make it special again. It has
to be a big event again. There was nothing wrong. There was a
sameness.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's 13.7 rating and 23 share were down 1 percent from 13.9 and
22 in 1998. The numbers were the lowest ever for the Monday night
series.
</P>
<P>
   Katz would not say who is being sought to replace Esiason, nor
would he criticize Esiason's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Boomer did everything we asked him to do,'' Katz said.
''I just think it could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer said he is not committed to a two-man or a three-man
booth. Nor would he speculate on the possibility of hiring Bill
Parcells or Jimmy Johnson, who retired from coaching in January.
Others mentioned as candidates have ranged from John Elway to Dan
Marino or Steve Young, should Marino or Young retire.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohlmeyer emphasized the broadcast must improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't bring Howard back from the grave and we can't bring
Don back from Santa Mesa,'' Ohlmeyer said. ''What we're saying is,
is there another version of what happened in the '70s that can
happen today.''

<HEADLINE> Occidental Buys Altura Energy  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Occidental Petroleum Inc. announced Wednesday
that it will pay $3.6 billion for Altura Energy Ltd., an oil and
gas production venture jointly owned by BP Amoco PLC and Royal
Dutch Shell AG.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental will pay $1.2 billion in cash and borrow the rest to
acquire Altura, which operates 6,400 wells in the Permian Basin of
western Texas and southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and Shell will loan Occidental $2 billion, while the
rest will be borrowed from other sources, Occidental said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was expected to boost Occidental's earnings in
2000 by 50 cents per share, said Ray R. Irani, Occidental's
chairman and chief executive officer. Altura averaged the
equivalent of 150,000 barrels a day of oil and gas during 1999,
compared to Occidental's 425,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strategic acquisition not only immediately increases our
earnings per share and cash flow, but will do so over a range of
energy prices,'' Irani said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a big one for Occidental, which has a market value
of only $6.5 billion. It also follows Occidental's strategy of
buying mature but proven oil and gas fields in a bid to boost
production at a relatively low cost, said Alvin Silber, an oil
industry analyst with Herzog, Heine Geduld in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company purchased the 47,000-acre Elk Hills Naval
Petroleum Reserve in California's San Joaquin Valley from the U.S.
government for $3.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Occidental management these days is more interested in buying
these older properties and then reducing costs and doing things to
squeeze some of the reserves out rather than take exploration
risks,'' he said. ''It's sort of in the same pattern of their
having bought the Elk Hills property.''
</P>
<P>
   The sellers' willingness to carry the majority of debt --
apparently at very favorable terms -- was a key to Occidental's
ability to make the deal, given its relatively small market value,
Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would probably end up being a reasonably good
situation for Occidental,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, seemed skeptical. Occidental shares fell 12{
cents to $17.43} at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares sold for as much as $22.50 in early January.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, the value of Occidental's proven reserves is less
than $2 per barrel. It paid $4.24 per barrel for Altura, said Fadel
Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental can make money if oil prices remain strong, but there
is no realistic chance the value of Altura's holdings will grow
through discovery of additional reserves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically an oil price play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental would be better off buying back it's own stock or by
selling itself to a larger company. Gheit predicted the company
could be sold at a 50 percent markup from the current share price.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental raised cash for the deal last week when it sold its
interest in Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. for about $828
million. The company reaped about $700 million in net after-tax
proceeds from that deal, Occidental said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to raise another $500 million through the
sale of ''various non-strategic assets before yearend,'' Irani
said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Probes Pro-Bush Group  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is
investigating Republicans for Clean Air, a group backed by Texas
entrepreneurs that began running ads last week touting George W.
Bush's environmental record and criticizing John McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   The ads ran in New York, Ohio and California in advance of
Tuesday's primaries. It initially was unclear who was behind the
group or who paid for the ads until Sam Wyly, a Dallas software
magnate and longtime Bush supporter, stepped forward last Friday to
take the credit.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign complained to the FCC, arguing that the ads
should indicate they were actually funded by Wyly and his brother.
At least one commissioner suggested she might agree.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters had until the close of business Wednesday to submit
information to the agency explaining what they did to uncover the
group's true identity. The agency is trying to determine whether
broadcasters conducted proper investigations before airing the ads,
said Bobby Baker, an FCC attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't tell broadcasters to take something off the air,'' he
said. ''We could say that at least as facts exist in this
situation, we have serious questions about whether you should add
Sam Wyly to the identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stations have done just that, Baker added.
</P>
<P>
   One commissioner, Gloria Tristani, issued a statement saying it
appears the Republicans for Clean Air identification may be
misleading because the ads are actually controlled and funded by
the Wylys. She suggested the FCC should act quickly on McCain's
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disclosure of a political advertisement's true sponsor, like
disclosure of campaign contributions, help(s) ensure that the
American public is fully informed about who is trying to influence
their vote,'' Tristani wrote. ''But time is of the essence. It will
do little good to find, after the presidential primaries are over,
that these advertisements should no longer air unless the Wylys are
identified as the true sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain close to leaving the Republican race, FCC action in
his favor may come to late to help him. But Wyly said last week
that Republicans for Clean Air may run ads during the general
election, so any FCC action may still be relevant.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also complained to the Federal Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Senate Battles Over FEC Nominations  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Mitch McConnell, angry that two
Democratic senators are blocking floor action on the Republican
nominee to the Federal Election Commission, threatened on Wednesday
to sink the Democrats' choice for the FEC if the GOP choice doesn't
get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley A. Smith, an Ohio law professor who opposes limits on
campaign contributions, was recruited by McConnell to fill a
vacancy on the commission. Democrat Danny Lee McDonald, an FEC
member since 1981, is up for confirmation to a new term.
</P>
<P>
   The two appeared Wednesday before the Rules and Administration
Committee, which is chaired by McConnell, R-Ky. ''If Professor
Smith is confirmed, I will not oppose you,'' McConnell told
McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The committee later recommended approval for both nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure
candidates comply with disclosure requirements and contribution
limits. The six-member commission is evenly split among Republicans
and Democrats, all of whom serve six-year terms and must be
approved by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's nomination has drawn intense criticism from groups such
as Common Cause and Democrats including President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried for nearly a year to get Republicans to offer any
other name, but they stuck with Smith. The president gave in last
month, saying he didn't like the selection ''but I decided that I
should not shut down the whole appointments process.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sens. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and Russ Feingold,
D-Wis., have used a procedural move to keep consideration of
Smith's nomination off the Senate agenda.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, the leading foe of efforts to enact new restrictions
on campaign contribution, introduced into the committee record 32
letters from campaign law experts who endorsed Smith's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional scholar Daniel Lowenstein, a former Common Cause
board member and a Democrat, wrote that he disagrees with Smith's
views on campaign law but thinks he's an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who chose Smith ''deserve considerable credit for
having picked a distinguished individual rather than a hack,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus,
Ohio, says existing laws have failed to rid the system of
corrupting influences while unconstitutionally infringing on free
speech. He would rather see a system with no limits on how much
candidates can raise and spend, though he tried to emphasize to the
senators that he would ''enforce the law as it is, even when I
disagree with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough for one committee Democrat. Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., said he still planned to vote against the
nomination. Smith, he said, should not be given a job enforcing
campaign laws because he believes those laws to be seriously
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing could send a worse signal to everyone who has to obey
the campaign finance laws,'' Schumer said. ''I think it's a pretty
fair analogy to say that I would not nominate an attorney general
who did not believe in incarcerating people.''

<HEADLINE> Chile Vows Pinochet Can Be Tried  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's interior minister on Wednesday
said he wants to show the world that Gen. Augusto Pinochet can be
tried in Chile, vowing that scores of criminal complaints against
the former dictator will be heard out.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups had expressed fears that the former dictator -- who
still enjoys the loyalty of the country's army and right-wing
politicians -- had effectively escaped justice when Britain released
him from house arrest last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Interior Minister Raul Troncoso said that isn't so -- and
that Chile has the court documents to prove it: 72 complaints of
murder and torture committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime, at
last count.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that all the complaints will go forward,''
Troncoso said. ''This shows that justice works in Chile and that
all the criticism and doubts expressed abroad were baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet left his heavily-guarded suburban home Wednesday for
the first time since he arrived aboard a plane from England on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to the Santiago Military Hospital in a convoy of
three armored sedans for medical tests, and returned home after a
little more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said in a press statement that Pinochet should rest and
have few visits, and that ''his medical conditions have remained
stable, in a situation of recovery from the physical and emotional
effort'' demanded by the 20-hour flight from London.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean judge Juan Guzman, who is handling the complaints
against Pinochet and who asked a court to strip Pinochet of
immunity from prosecution, has braved harsh criticism from
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the international community has any doubts as to whether
there is justice in Chile, it should look at what is going on
now,'' Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   And the state prosecutor's office has joined as a plaintiff in a
case in which Pinochet is accused of responsibility for a series of
1973 killings known as ''the caravan of death.'' Several other
retired officers have been indicted in that case.
</P>
<P>
   The State Defense Council said it was joining the case ''to help
establish the truth and let all those responsible be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Council's bold step was saluted by authorities as
proof a trial is possible, rightist supporters of the former
dictator called the step politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Hernan Larrain of the far-right Independent Democratic
Union said the State Defense Council ''acted in a politically
biased manner'' in joining that suit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the courts are feeling pressure from leftist and human
rights groups to act against Pinochet, thus ''making a fair trial
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pinochet left his heavily-guarded suburban house
in his usual motorcade of three Mercedes Benz cars and two security
vans, to go to a military hospital. Aides said he was visiting his
doctors, an eye specialist and repeating a medical exam he had
taken earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has hired a lawyer and retired army colonel, Gustavo
Collao, to represent him. He had no comment on the new lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Marco Antonio Pinochet, one of Pinochet's sons, told the
Santiago daily La Tercera that the family was ready for what legal
battles may lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always said that the only place where he could be tried
is Chile; therefore the family accepts this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Truck Accident Sparks Riot in Lagos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- A truck trailer slammed into a passenger
bus Wednesday, killing eight people in a popular Lagos market and
sparking a brief riot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident in Lagos' Mile Twelve neighborhood, enraged
residents surrounded the truck trailer, doused it with gasoline and
set it alight. The driver escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd then blocked off the road and began attacking other
trucks parked nearby. They threw stones and smashed windows. Some
chanted ethnic Yoruba war songs against northern Nigerians, who
dominate the country's trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, police had dispersed the rioters and no ethnic
fighting was reported. A police spokesman blamed the accident on
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses said 13 people were killed in the crash, but this
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The clash drew special concern because ethnic fighting
sporadically erupts throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has been torn in recent weeks by religious violence
between Muslims and Christians and thousands of people are believed
to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, is dominated by
southwestern Yorubas and is regularly the scene of violent clashes
between Yorubas and northern Hausas.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Labor Fund Hits Snag  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiators failed to agree on a compromise
plan for compensating former Nazi-era forced and slave laborers
Wednesday because of differences over whether unpaid Holocaust
insurance claims will be included.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they said they hoped to finish the work at another
meeting they set for March 22 and 23 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after all sides negotiated a $5.2 billion
compensation program planned by German business and industry, there
is a difference ''of opinion'' on exactly what the fund will cover,
said U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had one understanding, evidently, and we found the other
side had another,'' Eizenstat said in a State Department press
conference closing two days of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The difference centers over how much of the money will be used
to pay people with unpaid World War II insurance policies -- a
highly complex issue that also has long been in negotiations by a
separate commission headed by former U.S. Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said some negotiators had met with Eagleburger this
week and would continue the discussions over the next few days to
try to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that main problem, survivors groups also still
disagree with each other over how much money should be allocated
for the other categories to be covered by the fund.
</P>
<P>
   German industry and government last year suggested the so-called
German Foundation initiative partly to recognize a moral
responsibility for having used slave and forced laborers in wartime
Germany -- and to end labor lawsuits filed against German companies
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations with survivor representatives,
German government and business agreed to contribute equally to a
$5.2 billion foundation in return for a promise the U.S. government
would guarantee all further claims would be handled by the
foundation and further lawsuits would not be allowed in the states.
</P>
<P>
   To assure this peace, the foundation is to not only pay claims
submitted for unpaid labor but also establish a ''future fund'' for
education and research on the Holocaust, as well as pay claims from
people on whom medical experiments were done, from Jews whose
property was taken by the state, and some people whose insurance
policies were unpaid or bank accounts appropriated after they were
killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Though they agreed to the lump sum in December, lawyers for
survivors now say it is too small to accommodate all of the things
Germany wants it to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Another stalemate for more than a month has been a proposal by
five Central and Eastern European nations that 90 percent of the
money go to forced and slave laborers. Others want more money to go
to property claims or other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the war, Germany has paid about $60 billion in
pensions and other programs to compensate for Holocaust wrongs such
as imprisonment, physical injury, loss of property and so on. But
this is the first substantial program in which businesses are
attempting to pay back people for work they did.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers Show Resolve  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Nobody thought it would last this long. After
all, what do engineers know about going on strike?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since engineers and technical workers at The Boeing Co.
walked off the job Feb. 9, their numbers have remained relatively
steady. About 17,000 remain on strike, causing numerous slowdowns
in the delivery of jetliners and stalling a number of high-priority
military projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we surprised ourselves,'' said one striking worker,
who asked not to be identified, outside Boeing's offices in
suburban Renton. ''Nobody thought we'd be able to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace, which represents some 22,600 workers at
Boeing plants in Washington, California and Kansas, had only about
30 percent membership, no strike fund to speak of and a history of
toeing the company line.
</P>
<P>
   ''In November alone, membership went up from 40 to 60 percent,''
said SPEEA Executive Director Charles Bofferding. ''We were
probably the fastest growing union in the world, and all because
The Boeing Co. was making everyone so angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the union has over 13,000 dues-paying members, and at
least 4,000 nonunion members on the picket lines as well. Instead
of designing planes, the engineers are designing fuel-efficient
burn barrels to warm pickets. And the once-independent union is
making the most of its new allegiances with the AFL-CIO and the
International Federation of Professional and Technical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The union is getting weekly infusions of $25,000 from both the
AFL-CIO and the Communications Workers of America. Other unions
have pledged financial support as well, which will be used to help
striking workers pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a union whose only other labor action came in
1992, when it rejected a Boeing contract offer and staged a one-day
walkout. The union later accepted the very same offer, which Boeing
refused to change.
</P>
<P>
   Now, SPEEA has fought Boeing at nearly every step, filing at
least a half-dozen unfair labor practice complaints with the
National Labor Relations Board. The two most serious accuse Boeing
of failing to negotiate in good faith, and declaring an impasse too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are so many people involved in this, we're trying to
investigate these charges as quickly as possible,'' said Paul
Eggert, regional director of the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   The regional board could rule by the end of next week, Eggert
said, though he noted that if Boeing appeals, the process could
drag on for weeks, even months.
</P>
<P>
   There is a question, however, of how long the company can hold
out before encountering serious problems. Nearly every company
division has been affected, and Boeing's stock price has fallen
nearly 19 percent since the day before the strike began, finishing
Wednesday at $33.37{ a share, down $1.37{, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Boeing delivered 27 jetliners to its customers, 16
of which were delivered after the Feb. 9 walkout. During February
1999, the company delivered 47 planes, including 35 after Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   At Boeing Field in Seattle, where the company makes its final
checks and delivers its aircraft to customers, at least 39
commercial jets sat on the tarmac, 12 of which were parked in areas
customarily reserved for military planes.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said he did not know how many of the planes
on the field were awaiting certification or delivery. A number of
the airlines with planes at Boeing Field did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   In Boeing's military divisions, the U.S. Department of Defense
and the company both have said that key projects -- including
development of the military's new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft --
have been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight of the Joint Strike Fighter prototype, due this
spring, has been postponed indefinitely, said Boeing spokesman
Michael Tull. Only about 30 percent of the JSF engineers have been
on duty since the strike, which has slowed down software
development as well as first-flight preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The engineers have done an awesome job, and I know we want to
have them back and working on this project,'' Tull said. ''For now,
we're reprioritizing and moving ahead as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike has also affected testing of the F-22 Raptor, though
the U.S. Air Force said that program remains on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been no problems here that we've even heard
about,'' said John Haire, chief spokesman for Edwards Air Force
Base in California, where Boeing engineers work on the new air
superiority fighter that the company is developing with Lockheed
Martin and Pratt &AMP; Whitney. ''There's a couple of guys at the gate
with signs every morning, but the work is still getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding said the union will continue to put pressure on the
company. Union representatives in Washington, D.C., were scheduled
to meet Thursday with Jane Garvey, head of Federal Aviation
Administration, to bring up concerns about Boeing's airplane
certification processes. SPEEA representatives will also meet with
members of Congress and the Clinton administration, Bofferding
said.

<HEADLINE> Talk show host Judy Jarvis succumbs to cancer  </HEADLINE>
prsdhfcho
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Judy Jarvis, who battled lung cancer
while continuing to host her nationally syndicated radio talk show,
died Tuesday. She was 54.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis had been the host of ''The Judy Jarvis Show'' since 1993.
The showed airs on more than 50 stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   She formerly was a reporter for Time Magazine and The Boston
Globe. She also was a frequent contributor to the op-ed pages of
newspapers throughout the nation and appeared as a pundit on CNN,
NBC and C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, the self-described ''feisty, independent-minded broad,''
had been ill since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She found herself with a sharp cough and shortness of breath
while in Seattle to host her show from the National Association of
Broadcasters annual meeting. Upon returning home, Jarvis, a
nonsmoker, was diagnosed with a particularly virulent strain of
lung cancer that quickly spread through her body, forcing the
amputation of her left leg.
</P>
<P>
   When Jarvis took a medical break from her Farmington-based show,
her son Jason, the show's executive producer, filled in for his
mother on the air. When she returned to the air early in 1999,
Jason stayed on as co-host making them the only mother-son team in
talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   Her final broadcast came Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone that she came into contact with remembered her, and
was touched by her. Everyone,'' Jason Jarvis said. ''She was a
larger-than-life figure. She lived out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Long Island, N.Y., Jarvis was a political science
graduate from Boston University, a former teacher, and the
President of Jarvis Productions, Inc. which syndicates The Judy
Jarvis Show.
</P>
<P>
   The radio show made Jarvis a broadcaster of national renown.
Talkers, the industry trade magazine, named Jarvis one of the most
influential people in talk for five straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kurtz, the media writer for The Washington Post,
described her as a ''radio rebel'' in his talk-radio book ''Hot
Air.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which airs in Connecticut on WTIC-AM in Hartford and
WSTC-AM in Stamford, will continue with Jason as host.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is survived by her husband Wal; two sons, Jason and
Clayton; several grandchildren; and her mother Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at noon Friday at Trinity Church
in Portland. Jarvis will be buried at Mosswood Cemetery in Cotuit,
Mass.

<HEADLINE> Czech Statue Becomes New Symbol  </HEADLINE>
By NADIA RYBAROVA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- A statue of Christ with a Hebrew
inscription that Jews consider a centuries-old humiliation was
turned into a symbol of reconciliation Wednesday when Czech and
Jewish officials unveiled some changes.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Calvary statue on the capital's Charles Bridge
has a gilded inscription paid for from a fine imposed on a Prague
Jew who allegedly mocked the cross.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony Wednesday, Prague Mayor Jan Kasl unveiled three
new bronze plaques in Czech, English and Hebrew explaining the
inscription's origin and acknowledging that it was intended to
insult Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''This symbol has long been one of pain to the Jewish
community,'' Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the North American
Boards of Rabbis, said during the ceremony. ''Now this statue
stands not for conflict, but for harmony and respect.'' Members of
the Czech Jewish community, the U.S. ambassador and representatives
of the Czech Roman Catholic Church also attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, Jewish tourists have complained about
the Hebrew inscription, reads, ''Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of
the Multitude'' -- attributing divinity to Christ, something Judaism
does not recognize. It was put on the statue in 1696, about 40
years after the statue was put on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   While some insisted on the removal of the inscription, municipal
authorities and Jewish officials here and abroad agreed that a note
explaining its origins should be sufficient. ''By keeping the
statue intact, it is transformed into a symbol of reconciliation,''
Schneier said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaque, and the fact that you have gathered together on
this historic bridge, symbolize the growing bonds between the
Jewish and Christian communities in Prague and throughout the Czech
Republic and beyond,'' said a message from U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, read by Ambassador John Shattuck.
</P>
<P>
   The plaques unveiled Wednesday explain that the Hebrew
inscription was the ''result of improper court proceedings against
Elias Backhoffen,'' who had been accused of mocking the cross, and
was meant ''to humiliate the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching on another sensitive issue, Schneier told a reporter
later he was confident that a solution could be found in the case
of a Jewish cemetery unexpectedly unearthed in downtown Prague two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th-century Jewish cemetery, which was unused after 1478,
was unearthed during construction of a parking garage under the
building of Ceska Pojistovna, the country's biggest insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community demanded that the government declare the
site a national heritage and that the construction stop.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Draws Castro Comparison  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday
that Venezuelans and Cubans are ''navigating in the same sea,''
comments likely to raise concern among Chavez's critics who say
he's getting too close to Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The Chavez administration also seems willing to confront the
United States: on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel
said Venezuela opposes two anti-drug monitoring centers the United
States has set up on the Dutch islands of Curacao and Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a group of Cuban doctors who came to Venezuela to
help in relief efforts following December's devastating landslides,
Chavez lauded Cuba's achievements in health and education and said
Venezuela should follow the communist island's example.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is necessary that the peoples of this continent march
toward that sea of happiness, of equality and justice,'' Chavez
said. He told the Cuban doctors, ''Go tell Fidel that we love
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who broke into Venezuela's
national scene eight years ago by staging a failed military coup,
was elected president in December 1998 promising to champion the
rights of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba sent 450 doctors and other medical personnel to Venezuela
after flooding and mudslides killed thousands of people on the
country's northern Caribbean coast in December.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the doctors have since defected to Venezuela, saying
they were seeking a better standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez assured the Cuban delegation that his policy toward the
United States is based on ''demanding respect for sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference, Rangel stressed that position
when he criticized the U.S. drug monitoring centers on the
Caribbean islands of Curacao and Aruba, saying ''that is a security
zone for Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has refused to permit U.S. airplanes from those staging
centers to fly over Venezuelan territory en route to Colombia,
seriously hindering the centers' anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is Venezuela's No. 1 trading partner, and
Venezuela is one of the top three foreign suppliers of oil to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez stirred controversy during a visit to Cuba last November
when he said Venezuela is marching ''toward the same sea as the
Cuban people ... a sea of happiness, true social justice and
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez is immensely popular in Venezuela, enjoying
approval ratings upwards of 70 percent, he may be in the minority
when it comes to his feelings about Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust of communism in Venezuela is strong: a poll released
late last year showed that 85 percent of the population is opposed
to a Castro-like regime.

<HEADLINE> YankeeNets Make $200M Bond Offering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- YankeeNets, the new company that controls the
New York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets, has sold $200 million in
bonds, despite being saddled with a lackluster rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was considerable interest in the offering and we are
pleased with the outcome,'' Howard Rubenstein, a company director,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said the bonds will pay 12.75 percent interest to
investors over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who made $135 million from
his team's business merger with the Nets, will get another $40
million from the junk bonds sale.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was branded at ''junk'' levels by two major credit
agencies because of the high risk associated with running the
sports teams. Big salaries, unpredictable performance, strikes and
lockouts were just some of the reasons the YankeeNets had to offer
investors more to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's, which assigned the YankeeNets' notes a B1 rating, noted
that half of the company's revenue comes from variable sources,
such as ticket sales, which are vulnerable to a change in the
teams' performance.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees alone have taken two financial hits recently,
one when Darryl Strawberry tested positive for cocaine and was
suspended for a year, another when the club doubled the annual
salary of shortstop Derek Jeter to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, YankeeNets is expected to get a boost in
revenue when it negotiates new contracts for broadcasting and media
rights, perhaps starting a regional cable network that it will own
wholly or in part.

<HEADLINE> 2 Confess To Portugal Consul Slay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Two male prostitutes confessed to
killing a Portuguese consul in a dispute over money, police in the
southern state of Parana said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects were arrested after they appeared on a
television program and claimed they had gone to meet the consul,
Miguel Jose Fawor, at his home but that robbers had killed him
before they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When police confronted the two with the evidence in the case,
they broke down and confessed to killing Fawor because of a dispute
over payment, police inspector Fauze Salmen said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fawor's body was found on Sunday hidden in the bushes on the
outskirts of Curitiba, the capital of Parana state, 420 miles
southwest of Rio de Janeiro. He had been beaten to death and his
had were tied behind his back.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Sets New Election Dates  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- After two postponements, Haiti's
electoral council on Wednesday rescheduled the country's
long-delayed elections for April 9 and May 21.
</P>
<P>
   The elections for more than 1,000 local and parliamentary
offices were originally set for last November and December. But
organizational problems forced the electoral council to reschedule
the two rounds for March 19 and April 30, for a second time. Those
dates were postponed last week.
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval called legislative and municipal elections
after dissolving Parliament in January 1999 to end a political
impasse that had paralyzed Haiti's government since disputed
elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2.9 million people -- out of a possible 4 million who were
eligible -- have registered. But registration was hampered by
problems at the electoral council, including shortages of
materials, pay and staffing disputes and theft of registration
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The council has extended voter registration to March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council last week had urged Haiti to
stick to its elections timetable ''as closely as possible'' because
it considered the vote crucial for the country's fledgling
democracy. With the new dates, the Caribbean nation should induct a
new parliament on June 12, the electoral council said in a
statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 international election observers are expected to
monitor the vote. The international community is paying about half
of the $20 million elections budget.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks White House E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican committee chairman said Wednesday
he will issue a subpoena covering hundreds of thousands of e-mails
sent to the White House, some of which may relate to the campaign
fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana said White House
officials have known of the e-mails for some time but failed to
determine if any of them related to congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said that ''we will be happy
to look at the chairman's letter and respond accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said his Government Reform Committee interviewed ''a
number of individuals who work on the White House e-mail system''
and ''what they told us was ... profoundly disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hundreds of thousands of e-mails sent to White House employees
from outside the White House complex between September 1996 and
Nov. 20, 1998, have not been reviewed,'' Burton wrote White House
counsel Beth Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an appearance that White House lawyers have made a
conscious decision to do nothing to solve the problem posed by so
many documents being improperly managed,'' said Burton, who
requested a meeting with Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   A former White House employee, Sheryl Hall, revealed the
existence of the unexamined e-mails last month in a lawsuit filed
by a conservative group, Judicial Watch.

<HEADLINE> Winter Storm Hits Northern Plains  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Thunderstorms and blizzard conditions raked the
Plains early
Thursday, stranding travelers on snow-covered interstates, toppling
mobile homes and peeling up roofs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winds gusting over 70 mph in Oklahoma and Kansas blew trucks off
highways and yanked down strings of power lines.
</P>
<P>
   One person was injured in Texas, where hail up to 1.75 inches in
diameter pounded Del Rio; and four injuries were reported in
Kansas, where 21 mobile homes there were damaged at Mulvane.
</P>
<P>
   At a Wal-Mart store in wind-whipped Weatherford, Okla., the roof
''just kind of rolled up like a can opener,'' said Mark Norton,
assistant store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a mobile home was ripped open and turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ''That trailer went over and I hit the floor,'' said neighbor
Karen Hennigh, who was getting ready to leave for work when the
storm hit late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing snow across South Dakota early Wednesday forced police
to shut down 135 miles of Interstate 90, and zero visibility and
growing drifts forced the shutdown of more than 100 miles of
Interstate 80, a major east-west trucking route, across Wyoming and
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Wednesday, more than 19 inches of snow had fallen at
Deadwood, S.D., and 3- to 5-foot drifts had piled up at Black Hawk,
S.D. Twenty-four hours earlier, the temperature hit 80 degrees in
Sioux Falls, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Thursday's high in Sioux Falls was only expected to
reach 25, but the storm began to weaken late Wednesday and the snow
was expected to taper off, National Weather Service forecasters
said. The storm's showers and potentially powerful thunderstorm
were moving east over the Mississippi Valley and were expected to
reach into Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a near-whiteout of blowing snow along Interstate 90, South
Dakota Highway Patrol troopers inched along behind a plow, stopping
every few miles to rescue a stranded traveler.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did have the Department of Transportation take their plows
out and we were following with a four-wheel-drive Suburban, and we
filled the plow and Suburban up,'' said Highway Patrol Sgt. Steve
Vostad of Rapid City. ''In that process, they saw other people in
their vehicles, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just go out with the four-wheel-drives, follow the plows
and pick up whoever we can.''

<HEADLINE> Denny Arrests Said Race Motivated  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Two black Notre Dame students arrested
by off-duty police officers working security at a local Denny's
said Wednesday the incident was racially motivated and they were
manhandled by the cops.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Johnson said an officer used pepper spray on her while
she was handcuffed in the back of a closed squad car, and April
Allen said a third woman arrested had her nose bloodied when an
officer slammed the woman's head into a trunk.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen were arrested along with two other friends early
Feb. 27 by two Roseland police officers over a sign that had been
knocked off the restaurant wall.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's officials, stung by a series of incidents with minority
customers, said Wednesday they had fired the officers for acting
without involving the restaurant's management.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's paid $45.7 million in 1994 to settle a discrimination
suit by black customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't doing anything,'' Allen said. ''What they did was
not logical, so you have to think (race) was a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, Johnson and seven friends were waiting for a table early
Feb. 27 at the Denny's restaurant about a mile from campus when
Johnson said she tried to re-attach a sign that had fallen off the
wall. Johnson said after she hit the sign twice to make its
adhesive stick, the two officers began questioning the group.
</P>
<P>
   The officers cited the four students for disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest, and three were released on $100 bond. But Johnson
was cited for a felony and was held overnight at the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph County Prosecutor Chris Toth said a videotape shows
the students were not the aggressors in the incident. He elected
not to press charges against the four students and will ask the
court to expunge their arrest records.
</P>
<P>
   Roseland police Chief Larry Miller said the small department
outside of South Bend does not have a policy regulating officers'
conduct on off-duty assignments. The incident will be reviewed by
the town council.
</P>
<P>
   The university said it planned to speak with local authorities
and Denny's management to ensure the incident didn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know this is more than an isolated incident,'' said the
Rev. Mark Poorman, vice president of student affairs.

<HEADLINE> Merit Found in Gore NASA Mission  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A space mission proposed by Vice President Al
Gore and nearly killed by House Republicans has been assessed by
independent experts as a potentially valuable scientific project.
</P>
<P>
   A task force of the National Academy of Sciences said in a
report Thursday that a Gore-backed plan to put a satellite in space
to focus on the Earth could provide important data about
environmental events.
</P>
<P>
   Among the data from the satellite would be a constant, full-sun
view of Earth. Gore has called for that view to be always available
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, named Triana, calls for launching a spacecraft to
an area between the Earth and the sun, called the Lagrangian point
1. Objects put into the L1 point remain in the same place relative
to the Earth and sun.
</P>
<P>
   NASA planned to arm the Triana spacecraft with instruments that
would study both the Earth and the sun, along with sending to Earth
the constant planet view.
</P>
<P>
   Gore first proposed the idea, but Republicans in the House
objected. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, called it ''a
far-out boondoggle.'' In a partisan vote, the House Science
committee last May cut from the 2000 NASA budget a total of $32
million that had been set aside for Triana. The action would have
killed the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, House-Senate negotiators on the 2000 budget agreed
not to terminate Triana, but instructed NASA to suspend work on the
mission until its merit could be evaluated by an independent panel
from the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the NAS panel says, with some reservations, that ''the
scientific goals and objectives of the Triana mission are consonant
with published science strategies and priorities for the collection
of climate data sets and the need for development of new
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report said it is also possible that Triana would be
able to gather useful information about environmental events, such
as forest fires and volcanoes on Earth, or solar eruptions on the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Triana, the panel noted, ''has experimental and innovative
aspects that carry higher than usual risks, but have the potential
to make unique scientific contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, notes that NASA is under a tight deadline
to launch the mission and said the agency should ''seriously
consider increasing the level of effort'' to develop ways to
receive and process data from Triana.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Triana hardware, including several instruments, have
already been manufactured. Under current plans, the mission could
not be launched until after January, 2001.

<HEADLINE> N.Korean Delegation Visits Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- North Korean officials visited Canada for the
first time in an effort to expand dialogue between the countries,
the Canadian government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The four Foreign Ministry officials arrived March 2 and left
Tuesday after holding informal talks with Canadian officials, said
Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Marie-Christine Lilkoff.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Canadian-North Korean contacts came amid a thawing
in relations between Western nations and the communist country. In
January, Italy became the sixth European Union member to establish
diplomatic relations with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A senior North Korean official is scheduled to visit Washington
next month, the first such trip since the 1950-1953 Korean War.
Formal talks on planning the trip began Wednesday at the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations between U.S. Ambassador Charles
Kartman and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, a U.S.
State Department official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation's visit to Canada was in
reciprocation for a Dec. 5-11 trip to North Korea by three Canadian
foreign affairs officials, Lilkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the visit was to broaden dialogue with North Korea
and improve firsthand knowledge of the political and economic
conditions in that country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that any talks on either trip were informal, since
there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Lilkoff said there were ''no immediate plans'' to establish ties.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation was composed of a foreign ministry
director and three other officials.

<HEADLINE> 10 Dominican Migrants Die in Surf  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A wooden boat jammed with illegal
migrants from the Dominican Republic smashed apart in heavy surf
within sight of Puerto Rico Wednesday, killing at least 10 people
and leaving dozens missing.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 people on the boat undertook the voyage just as
thousands of other Dominicans before them, attempting the dangerous
75-mile crossing in hopes of higher wages and better lives. But
survivor Laura Pichardo Garcia said the sea on Wednesday was too
rough.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we reached the coast, a wave came over us and swept the
boat around after one of the women fell into the water,'' said
Pichardo, who was in U.S. Border Patrol custody. Shoes, purses and
boat debris littered the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told authorities that the crew had dropped anchor to
rescue the woman when the waves dashed it apart.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coast Guard and police helicopters searched for victims in
the swift Atlantic Ocean currents off the northwest town of Isabela
until nightfall when they suspended the search. Ten bodies were
recovered, said Ivan Ortiz, spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 27 of the people on the boat made it to shore and
were taken into custody, according to police and the U.S. Border
Patrol. An unknown number of passengers disappeared in the coastal
brush and hills.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo, 28, said the migrants had paid a total of $12,000 --
about $170 per person -- to be smuggled across the perilous Mona
Passage that separates their land from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Flores, assistant chief of the U.S. Border Patrol station in
nearby Aguadilla, cited an unconfirmed report from a helicopter
crew that at least 20 bodies were floating offshore. A U.S. Coast
Guard spokesman said later Wednesday that Coast Guard aircraft
hadn't been able to find them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small area and the water is pristine. Some of the
aircraft would have seen it by now,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Johnny
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can confirm the information from the helicopters, we
could be speaking about 20 or more bodies,'' Border Patrol Chief
Carlos Marrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, thousands of people from the relatively impoverished
Dominican Republic illegally try to reach Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make it quickly disappear in the mountains along the
west coast, hoping to find work as domestic helpers, coffee pickers
and construction workers. Others try to make it to the U.S.
mainland, exploiting the absence of border and customs controls for
passengers on flights from the U.S. territory's capital, San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 Dominicans illegally entered Puerto Rico in
the past two years, U.S. authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, the wooden boat, known as a ''yola,'' left
the east coast Dominican town of Bavaro on Monday night and arrived
off Isabela, about 70 miles west of San Juan, about 2:30 a.m.
Wednesday, Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   A fateful decision to change course may have played a role in
the boat's destruction on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing survivor accounts, Flores said two captains on the boat
had an argument before deciding to abandon their original
destination -- west-facing beaches near Aguadilla, where waters can
be calmer -- for Isabela, known for its swift ocean currents and
rugged coastline. Why they made that decision wasn't known.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 yards off Isabela, a woman fell overboard in heavy
surf. Trying to rescue her, the crew swung around and dropped
anchor, and the seas wedged the boat into rocks, Flores said,
citing survivors' accounts. A first wave swamped the wooden craft;
a second demolished it.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 20 migrants, said police Agent Felix Adames
said. Flores said seven migrants were in Border Patrol custody.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Montas, the Dominican consul in Puerto Rico, said his
government would begin an education campaign ''to spare more
Dominicans from being exploited in this human trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dominican government has promised to crack down on the
trade before, and despite patrols by the Dominican Navy and U.S.
authorities, hundreds keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   Another boat with an unknown number of Dominican migrants made
it to shore safely near Isabela early Wednesday, Flores said.
Patrol agents were searching for its passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 650 migrants have been detained since October, while the
sinking of three boats off Puerto Rico this year have claimed
dozens of lives, said Border Patrol Agent Carlos Marrero.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Stocks Soar on Ratings Boost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican stocks closed at a record high
Wednesday as investors took advantage of the country's first full
day at investment grade.
</P>
<P>
   The market's key IPC index closed up 3.6 percent or 289.25
points to 8,295.20, breaking the previous record of 8,131.27 set
March 3. At the end of 1999, the IPC stood at 7,129.88.
</P>
<P>
   Market bellwether Telmex L shares rose 4 percent to 35.30 pesos,
or about $3.81.
</P>
<P>
   Traders attributed the bullishness to Tuesday's upgrade by
Moody's Investors Service of Mexico's credit rating from junk to
investment grade, essentially saying it was confident Mexico could
pay back its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Chile had been the only Latin American country with such a
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were also supported by a rally in the United States,

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Quit; Gore, Bush Move On  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe
Al Gore on Wednesday as he scripted his exit from the Democratic
presidential campaign. John McCain went home to Arizona, his
Republican challenge near an end, voluntarily or not.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nominees-in-waiting, reached
out to their defeated rivals and jabbed at one another as they
pivoted toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush labeled the vice president ''an agent of Washington,'' and
Gore returned the insult, saying Bush was too cozy with the
''extreme right'' as personified by the National Rifle Association
and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bradley nor McCain scheduled any public appearances
Wednesday. For both, it was a sobering day after a Super Tuesday
that effectively ended their hopes of winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain huddled with senior strategists and major financial
backers at his mountain cabin near Sedona, Ariz., to assess his
candidacy. The campaign also plans a noon EST news conference
Thursday for what spokesman Todd Harris called ''a major
announcement about our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two senior aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were urging McCain to quit. Key to the decision, they said, was
finding a way to effectively push McCain's campaign themes of
broadening the party's base and overhauling reforming campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   All signs were pointing to a graceful exit from the race. McCain
aides said campaign events scheduled in Colorado and Illinois had
been canceled. More to the point, the large press contingent
traveling with McCain was being sent to Phoenix after the news
conference -- without McCain. Aides said McCain had no public
schedule at this point after Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior McCain aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a list of all possible options had been prepared for his
meetings during the day. These included staying in the race to
further his political reform agenda, getting out and supporting the
GOP ticket, and leaving to mount a third-party bid. McCain has said
previously he would not leave the GOP, and the adviser said he had
no reason to believe the senator had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser said one option had been ruled out -- the third
party bid. ''There's been no change'' from a long-standing decision
not to leave the party, the McCain aide said.
</P>
<P>
   He did nothing to discourage speculation that McCain was leaving
the race. ''All signs do point that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said there had been discussions about how to
ease McCain's return to the Senate after a campaign in which he
often attacked his own party as beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bradley, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the former New Jersey senator would announce his withdrawal on
Thursday and throw his support to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, plans to stay active in public life and is not
expected to rule out another presidential run, the advisers said.
They also said he has no interest in the vice presidential spot on
the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gore was thinking along those lines. One senior adviser
to the vice president, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that Bradley had not won any contests in his quest for the
nomination and Gore would want someone on the ticket who had
demonstrated an ability to carry a state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered warm words for Bradley, whom he had attacked
repeatedly in debates and advertising when the nomination was at
risk. ''Throughout the campaign I've affirmed my belief that he is
a good person,'' Gore said on NBC. ''I have worked with him in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appealed to McCain's desire, often stated on the
campaign, to deny Gore the White House. ''I would say, 'John, let's
team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore,'' the governor said. He
hastened to add he wasn't extending an offer of the vice
presidential spot on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign was at a pivot point, but there were
still primaries to come, and both Bush and Gore continued to seek
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had Michigan and Minnesota on his itinerary for the day,
two states where Democratic delegates will be selected over the
next few days. At the same time, given the collapse of Bradley's
candidacy, the vice president's aides decided to pull back $500,000
in television advertising that had been slated for Southern states
holding primaries on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set stops Thursday in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, where
delegates will be picked in primaries and caucuses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the virtual nationwide primary on Tuesday, the AP delegate
count showed Gore with 1,424 delegates, to 412 for Bradley, out of
2,170 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, it was 617 for Bush to 231 for McCain, with
1,034 needed to nominate. Those numbers told the hopelessness of
McCain's position. An additional 91 delegates are stake in Western
states on Saturday, and 351 more on March 14 in states across the
South, the part of the country where Bush is strongest.

<HEADLINE> Money laundering focus on high-risk zones  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to crack
down on money laundering, is designating Los Angeles, New York City
and northern New Jersey, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the Southwest
border as high-intensity zones for increased law enforcement
activities, officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of federal, state and local law enforcement officers will
be formed in those high-risk money laundering and financial crime
areas designated by the Treasury Department. Police forces and
local prosecutors will be trained in detecting money laundering, a
new activity for many of them, as part of the administration's new
strategy to fight laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money laundering is a growing threat to the United States,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said at a news
conference. ''It undermines confidence in the integrity of our
financial systems, facilitates crime and corruption, and allows
criminals to savor the rewards of their illegal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, deputy attorney general of the Justice Department,
called the administration's new money-laundering strategy ''a
highly ambitious and far-reaching agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who worked with the administration
on the strategy, said the new designations of high-intensity zones
''will concentrate law enforcement efforts'' against money
laundering in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other geographic areas or industry sectors are expected to be
named in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, applauded Treasury's new
designation of the Mexican border area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no higher priority than stopping the $10 billion in
drugs coming across our Southwest border,'' she said in a
statement. ''Stemming the cash flow to the drug lords is an
essential part of this effort, and this designation will help do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, seeking to stem the flow through U.S. banks
of billions of dollars from drug trafficking and other illegal
activities, also is seeking new powers from Congress to fight money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative proposal outlined last week by Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers would give the government the authority to ban
financial transactions between offshore financial havens and U.S.
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government is putting new rules into effect
that eventually will require storefront check cashers and money
transmitters, brokerage firms and casinos to notify authorities of
suspicious transactions, as banks now must do.
</P>
<P>
   The new program also includes some $2.5 million this year in
grants to state and local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors'
offices, appropriated by Congress, to help them fight money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is estimated to absorb nearly $600 billion
annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and other criminal
activities are moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts
to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, the Treasury Department is seeking the power to
ask U.S. financial institutions to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an offshore bank or financial company. In cases
where foreign governments shield banks from investigation, Treasury
wants the authority to cut them off from the U.S. financial system
without seeking congressional approval.

<HEADLINE> Height Said Factor in Truck Crashes  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- An insurance institute's crash tests have found
that the height of a pickup truck or sport utility vehicle can play
a role in how much damage it causes to the occupants of a car in a
side-impact crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's study called on
automakers to focus more on improving safety in passenger cars,
especially smaller ones, saying such moves would save more lives
than redesigning pickups and SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Light trucks generally are heavier, ride higher and have stiffer
frames than cars, which means more energy in a crash is transferred
to the car in an accident. Regulators have been increasingly
worried about this mismatch between light trucks and cars as trucks
have become more common on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The study presented Wednesday at the Society of Automotive
Engineers World Congress in Detroit looked at five crash tests
involving 30-mph side impacts into a 1992 Mercury Grand Marquis.
The institute crashed a 1995 Lincoln Town Car, three 1997 Ford
F-150 4x2 pickups of varying weights and heights, and a 1997 Ford
F-150 4x4 that was the highest-riding and stiffest vehicle of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the tests found that the injuries increased along
with a crash vehicle's stiffness and ride height; the Town Car
caused less damage than all the pickups. In a video of the crashes,
the head of the dummy in the car can be seen smacking the hoods of
the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But the F-150 4x4 caused less overall injury than the other
pickups, even though it was the stiffest and highest vehicle.
Researchers said the reason was a pair of tow hooks installed below
the bumper of the F-150 4x4. The hooks hit the Grand Marquis lower
than the other pickups, causing the force of the crash to be spread
over a wider area of the car and reducing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Several automakers have lowered the riding height of their light
trucks or are considering doing so. Ford Motor Co. installed a
tubular steel beam on its hulking Excursion SUV to prevent it from
riding over the frame of a smaller vehicle in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The study also argued that although evidence shows pickups and
SUVs pose a greater danger in crashes than passenger cars, a
greater need was for better overall safety for passenger cars,
especially smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal data from 1991-97, researchers said only 16
percent of traffic crash deaths in passenger cars were caused by
collisions with SUVs or pickups. Larger causes were single-car
accidents, which accounted for 38 percent of deaths, and car-on-car
crashes, 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said lighter vehicles were more dangerous to
their passengers than heavier vehicles, regardless of whether they
were cars or trucks.

<HEADLINE> Bradley quitting, McCain apparently next as Bush, Gore move on  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe
Al Gore on Wednesday as he scripted his exit from the Democratic
presidential campaign. John McCain went home to Arizona, his
Republican challenge near an end, voluntarily or not.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nominees-in-waiting, reached
out to their defeated rivals and jabbed at one another as they
pivoted toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush labeled the vice president ''an agent of Washington,'' and
Gore returned the insult, saying Bush was too cozy with the
''extreme right'' as personified by the National Rifle Association
and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bradley nor McCain scheduled any public appearances
Wednesday. For both, it was a sobering day after a Super Tuesday
that effectively ended their hopes of winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain huddled with senior strategists and major financial
backers at his mountain cabin near Sedona, Ariz., to assess his
candidacy. The campaign also plans a noon EST news conference
Thursday for what spokesman Todd Harris called ''a major
announcement about our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two senior aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were urging McCain to quit. Key to the decision, they said, was
finding a way to effectively push McCain's campaign themes of
broadening the party's base and overhauling reforming campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   A senior McCain aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a list of all possible options had been prepared for his
meetings during the day. These included staying in the race to
further his political reform agenda, getting out and supporting the
GOP ticket, and leaving to mount a third-party bid. McCain has said
previously he would not leave the GOP, and the adviser said he had
no reason to believe the senator had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said there had been discussions about how to
ease McCain's return to the Senate after a campaign in which he
often attacked his own party as beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bradley, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the former New Jersey senator would announce his withdrawal on
Thursday and throw his support to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, plans to stay active in public life and is not
expected to rule out another presidential run, the advisers said.
They also said he has no interest in the vice presidential spot on
the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gore was thinking along those lines. One senior adviser
to the vice president, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that Bradley had not won any contests in his quest for the
nomination and Gore would want someone on the ticket who had
demonstrated an ability to carry a state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered warm words for Bradley, whom he had attacked
repeatedly in debates and advertising when the nomination was at
risk. ''Throughout the campaign I've affirmed my belief that he is
a good person,'' Gore said on NBC. ''I have worked with him in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appealed to McCain's desire, often stated on the
campaign, to deny Gore the White House. ''I would say, 'John, let's
team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore,'' the governor said. He
hastened to add he wasn't extending an offer of the vice
presidential spot on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign was at a pivot point, but there were
still primaries to come, and both Bush and Gore continued to seek
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had Michigan and Minnesota on his itinerary for the day,
two states where Democratic delegates will be selected over the
next few days. At the same time, given the collapse of Bradley's
candidacy, the vice president's aides decided to pull back $500,000
in television advertising that had been slated for Southern states
holding primaries on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set stops Thursday in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, where
delegates will be picked in primaries and caucuses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the virtual nationwide primary on Tuesday, the AP delegate
count showed Gore with 1,424 delegates, to 412 for Bradley, out of
2,170 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, it was 617 for Bush to 231 for McCain, with
1,034 needed to nominate. Those numbers told the hopelessness of
McCain's position. An additional 91 delegates are stake in Western
states on Saturday, and 351 more on March 14 in states across the
South, the part of the country where Bush is strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain ran as insurgents against the
establishment favorites -- ''entrenched power,'' as Bradley liked to
say.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator's campaign took flight briefly
last year and early in 2000. But, hampered by his own strategic
efforts and McCain's stronger appeal among independents, he lost
the leadoff caucuses in Iowa, then the first primary in New
Hampshire. He was shut out on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ride -- aboard a bus he dubbed ''the Straight Talk
Express'' -- was more successful. He defeated Bush in New Hampshire,
then stunned him a few weeks later in Michigan, riding a wave of
support among independents and Democrats attracted by his pledge to
break the ''iron triangle'' of lobbyists, money and legislation in
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   By Super Tuesday, though, he was cornered in New England. And
while he defeated Bush in Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and
Connecticut, McCain lost in the big states of New York, California,
Ohio, Georgia and Missouri and watched while his rival piled up the
delegates.

<HEADLINE> Chen Backers Unfazed by China  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) -- China's latest threats to use its
massive military against this small island might seem scary to many
Taiwanese. But for others, Beijing's warnings are just a tired ploy
to frighten them away from their favorite presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies in Taiwan's three largest cities Wednesday, thousands
turned out to support Chen Shui-bian -- China's least favorite
candidate in next week's vote, Taiwan's second direct presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney and former Taipei mayor, locked in a tight
three-way race, is disliked in Beijing because he and his
Democratic Progressive Party have supported formal independence for
Taiwan. Since the two sides split amid civil war in 1949, China has
threatened to attack if the island tries to break away permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has recently softened his position on the issue, saying
Taiwan should only seek independence if China invades. But still,
Beijing doesn't trust him.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Chinese military newspaper accused Chen of having a
hidden agenda for independence, and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
warned that China wouldn't ''sit idly by'' if Taiwan tries to break
away.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's executive campaign manager, Chiou I-jen, acknowledged
that China's threats have had ''negative effects'' on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Chen Shui-bian must convince voters that he is willing to
negotiate,'' Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the threats didn't shake the faith of many Chen
supporters in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second
largest metropolis and a DPP power base. Thousands showed up at a
nighttime rally to hear Chen talk about how he would rid Taiwan of
rampant corruption that has become the trademark of more than 50
years of rule by the Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the air thick with the smell of sausages cooking on a
nearby street vendor's grill, housewife Wu Su-jen explained that
international pressure would force China to keep its warships and
missiles at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the people in the world know that we want our own country
and don't want China to threaten us,'' Wu said. ''So all the
world's nations would come and help us. China knows this.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ironies of the election is that two longtime foes who
agree on little, Taiwan's Nationalists and China's Communist Party,
are teaming up to defeat a common foe: Chen. The Nationalists have
seized on China's threats and use them to warn voters that a Chen
victory would crash the stock market and ignite a war with China.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in the central city of Taichung, software writer Gary
Lin, 29, said he still planned to vote for Chen, but many nervous
voters will switch to Vice President Lien Chan of the Nationalists
or independent James Soong. Both are viewed as moderates less
likely to provoke China.
</P>
<P>
   ''People believe the Nationalists because they're able to
manipulate the media,'' Lin said. ''If you repeat something 100
times, people think it's true.''

<HEADLINE> Man Faces Explosives Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- An Egyptian man charged with possessing
explosives and counterfeit money faces two more weeks in jail after
his bail hearing was postponed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tarek Adealy Khafagy was detained Saturday by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police after a search of his apartment turned up explosives
and 100 counterfeit $5 bills, according to Sgt. Guy Babin, an RCMP
national-security supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, 30, broke into tears when his lawyer explained that the
hearing had been rescheduled for March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, who has lived in Montreal 18 months and speaks little
English or French, has denied any knowledge of the explosives and
counterfeit money found in his apartment, said the lawyer, Tom
Pentefountas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really upset by the situation,'' Pentefountas said. ''He
doesn't understand what's happening, why he's been arrested or why
he has to stay in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday that some of
Khafagy's co-workers at a Montreal bakery had keys to Khafagy's
apartment and sometimes stayed there while Khafagy worked an
overnight shift. The report was based on information from a bakery
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest in December of an Algerian who allegedly tried to
smuggle bomb-making supplies into the United States from Canada
raised concern that international terrorist networks were operating
out of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Thursday amid
market caution over central bank efforts to curb the Japanese
currency's rise. Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.22 yen, up 0.14 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 107.04 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 60.91
points, or 0.31 percent, to 19,827.71 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed down 177.44 points, or
0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar hovered in a narrow range in
early Asian trading, one day after the Bank of Japan intervened in
the Tokyo market.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Japan's central bank sold yen and bought
dollars between 106.30 yen and 106.40 yen and again around 107.00
yen, traders said. The amount of the intervention was estimated at
$1 billion to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders said Thursday there were rumors that the central
bank had also sold the yen and bought the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Zembei Mizoguchi, the director-general of the international
bureau at Japan's Ministry of Finance hinted Thursday further
intervention could occur.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are watching the foreign exchange markets closely, and will
take appropriate measures as needed,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.22 yen, up from
102.62 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, share prices rose moderately as investors
were encouraged by gains on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.50 to
close at 9,856.53. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index
closed at 4,897.26, up 49.42.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 1.98 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,663.12. The
TOPIX closed down 4.39 points, or 0.26 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7400 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its

<HEADLINE> Hearing Date Set in Bribery Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge on Wednesday set a May 3
hearing date to talk to lawyers in the case of former Florida State
kicker Sebastian Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski faces a bribery charge for allegedly offering a
police officer $300 to release his roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Janikowski, nor his lawyer -- Tallahassee-based attorney
Steve Dobson -- were in court at Wednesday's hearing. Dobson has
entered an innocent plea on Janikowski's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is a third-degree felony, and Janikowski, a native of
Poland, could face deportation if convicted. If found guilty, he
also faces up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski reportedly rejected a plea bargain deal, and Leon
County Circuit Judge George S. Reynolds III set a May 3 case
management conference to discuss the case with lawyers on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from a Jan. 24 incident at The Grove nightclub
in Tallahassee, where, according to police, Janikowski offered cash
to an off-duty officer so his roommate would be released from
custody. The roommate, Aaron Silverman, had been refused service at
the club and was arrested for trespassing when he refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time All-American kicked 50 field goals the past two
seasons, and many of his kickoffs flew through the end zone. He is
the only current player on a recently selected college team of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski has been projected as high as a late first-round NFL
draft pick, unusually high for a kicker.

<HEADLINE> Wild Elk Stampede in Washington  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA ASHTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- About 60 wild elk corralled from the arid
shrubland of south-central Washington stampeded from their corral
on Wednesday, thwarting government efforts to stem the herd's
population.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Three elk were trampled, then destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter had herded the elk from the Rattlesnake Hills into
the figure eight-shaped corral on Wednesday morning, the second day
of what officials had billed as the state's largest wildlife
roundup.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all went perfectly, like yesterday,'' said Kathy Criddle, a
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman. ''Then they busted
through the fence, knocked about 20 feet down, and they all
escaped.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife managers had hoped to round up 200 elk this week from
the 120-square-mile Arid Lands Ecology Reserve, on the western edge
of the Hanford nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up with 130 elk -- half of which were transported to
the Selkirk Range of northeastern Washington, and half to the Blue
Mountains of southeastern Washington. Another 20 elk had been moved
to the mountains in February.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation program is part of a plan to manage the size of
the fast-growing Hanford elk herd, estimated at nearly 1,000 head.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the animals pose a threat to fragile shrub
vegetation on the no-hunting reserve, and have wandered outside its
boundaries to eat nearby farmers' crops.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, wildlife managers hope to move 500
elk out of the herd, which could double in size every four years if
left unchecked.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Cornhill residents are trying to stay upbeat
and focused on progress in light of the recent rash of fires. It
isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 residents attended a meeting Tuesday night of city
officials, council members and Utica Neighborhood Housing Service.
The meeting was conducted in response to the outbreak of eight
fires between Friday to Monday, and emotions ran high as many spoke
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is getting too dangerous,'' resident Wendy Tarver said in
Wednesday's Observer-Dispatch of Utica.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two suspects 14 and 15 years old were charged with
third-degree arson in the Cornhill fires, said Deputy Police Chief
Nicholas Yagey.
</P>
<P>
   More arrests are expected, Yagey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of it was just for something to do,'' he said. ''At this
time, that is what the investigation reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, whose names were not made public, will be
prosecuted as juveniles in Oneida County Family Court, Yagey said.

pleaded. ''It's like a cancer and it's spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't sleep at night,'' added Samuel Bal, who once lost his
garage when a neighboring building burned. ''They should be tearing
down all of the abandoned houses.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials agreed. Chief Codes Officer Phillip Montana said
33 vacant structures will be demolished in the next three weeks.
Structures next to occupied homes will be given first priority. The
demolition will be paid for through a $1.3 million capital
improvement project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need your cooperation, we need your eyes and ears,'' Public
Safety Commissioner Cornell Maye said. ''Please leave with the idea
that you're going to keep your eyes opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace pledged his support.
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing is getting to be old-hat for the city. In 1997,
Utica made a demolition blitz, targeting 100 abandoned buildings
with the help of the Army National Guard in an effort to stem a
string of arsons.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, the federal government helped set up the Utica
Arson Strike Force, which combines federal, state and local
investigative resources to probe suspicious fires.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Shanley, Utica Community Action Inc. executive director,
said Tuesday his agency is working with the city to board up vacant
buildings in central city neighborhoods, including Cornhill.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ''will consist of a major effort to board up and
seal vacant buildings,'' Shanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Park resident Venice Ervin said he was concerned because
of the many vacant buildings around the corner from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a lot different than the last time there was a rash of
fires,'' Ervin said before Tuesday's meeting. ''They're going up so
fast it's not a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Rev. Johnny M. Wilson Jr. said Cornhill
residents need to concentrate on progress, not panic. Wilson,
pastor of St. Paul's Baptist Church and a strong proponent of
economic redevelopment for Cornhill, said he hopes concern about
the fires serves to unite, not divide, the inner-city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult situation,'' Wilson said. ''It's so easy
to just point the finger at authorities or people in the
community.''

<HEADLINE> Ravens Sign Dilfer As Banks' Backup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens signed free agent
quarterback Trent Dilfer to a one-year, $1 million contract
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback lost his starting
job to rookie Shaun King in an injury riddled 1999 season. He
became expendable after King led the Bucs to the NFC championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer broke his right collarbone Nov. 28 at Seattle, giving
King an opportunity to showcase himself.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore was looking for a veteran to back up Banks, who began
last season as the third-stringer, but then moved into the starting
job and played well.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer, a 1994 first-round draft choice by the Buccaneers, was
taken with the sixth overall selection. He led the Bucs to the
playoffs in 1997 and made the Pro Bowl, but generally has been
considered an underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs declined to exercise a $4.6 million option on Dilfer's
contract, allowing the 27-year-old quarterback to become an
unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer started 76 games over six seasons with the Bucs.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Waive Dennis Rodman  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dennis Rodman needed less than a month to wear out
his welcome in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks gave up on their biggest drawing card Wednesday,
releasing him hours after he lashed out against owner-in-waiting
Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas went 4-9 during his 29-day tenure, falling from eight
games out of the final playoff spot to 10{. Rodman's biting words
came Tuesday night following a fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''The comments had nothing to do with it,'' Cuban said. ''We all
are upset about losing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would do this all again and sign Dennis in a heartbeat. It
was the right move, we just didn't get the wins we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the end of the line for the most-pierced,
most-tattooed player in league history, albeit someone who won
seven rebounding titles and played for five championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is 38 and may not find another team willing to hire him.
Even if he is signed, he wouldn't be eligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas was willing to suffer his off-court antics as a tradeoff
for his on-court production and his box-office attraction. He
signed only after being convinced no contenders were interested.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his five home games were sellouts, with his debut
drawing the second-largest crowd in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman also was ejected twice, suspended once and fined $13,500.
One of the victories during his tenure came in the game he missed
because of the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoyed getting to know Dennis as a person and enjoyed
coaching him,'' coach-general manager Don Nelson said in a
statement. ''He was brought here to help us make a playoff run,
which obviously hasn't happened. Therefore, it is in the best
interest of the organization to play our younger players throughout
the remainer of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman did not immediately comment. His Los Angeles-based
publicist was preparing a response.
</P>
<P>
   The stint in Dallas is the shortest of Rodman's career. He
lasted 48 days with the Los Angeles Lakers last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman grew frustrated because he'd only been on a losing team
once before in his 14-year career. Still, as a Dallas native he
should've known what he was getting into with a team that hasn't
had a winning season since 1989-90 -- so long ago that Rodman didn't
have any tattoos then.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman may have tried forcing his way out by slamming Cuban
following a 101-86 loss to Seattle on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't need to be hanging around the players like he's a
coach or something,'' Rodman said. ''That's like Jerry Jones, and
it's dumb. That's why the Cowboys went down. He needs to be the
owner, step back and put people in who can get this team in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sharp turn against a boss who had jeopardized his bid
to buy the team by buddying up to the league's biggest thorn.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban had personally wooed Rodman and gave him permission to
skip practices and show up late for games. He even became Rodman's
landlord, letting him live in a guest house until the league ended
that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he ''absolutely'' considers Rodman still his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the world of Dennis,'' he said. ''He is a great
competitor and rebounder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks play Minnesota at home Thursday night. Attendance
surely won't be as high as it had been with Rodman wearing No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was thrown out of his second game for sitting down on the
court. He berated officials, then left the court slowly, drawing a
one-game suspension and $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrown out of his next home game for taunting Utah's Karl
Malone and again lingered on the court. He was fined $3,500 that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Fans loved it all. They brought signs to cheer him and lined up
to buy Mavs jerseys with his name and number on back. Many will be
disappointed to miss seeing him with his latest hairdo: blue and
green, just like the team's colors.
</P>
<P>
   Ever-changing hair patterns and a postgame jersey toss into the
stands brought Rodman more attention than any other player who
averaged 7.3 points for their career.
</P>
<P>
   Self-promotion is what made him stand out -- like the time he
showed up at a book signing wearing a wedding dress. If this is the
end of his career, Rodman will have left without fulfilling what he
said was his basketball fantasy: leaving the court naked.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA office can probably breathe easier now knowing that's
unlikely to happen. In the little time he was in Dallas, he
challenged commissioner David Stern to a fight and constantly
accused the league office and officials of being out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 games for the Mavericks, Rodman averaged 2.1 points and
11.2 rebounds. He averaged 13.1 rebounds per game for his career,
which also included stops in Detroit, San Antonio and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Even without basketball, Rodman is sure to remain in the news.
</P>
<P>
   He has a March 27 trial in Las Vegas on a cocktail waitress'
claim that he grabbed her breasts and an April 3 arraignment in
Costa Mesa, Calif., for a misdemeanor drunken driving charge.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Officer Gets Sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A federal judge sentenced a
former naval officer Wednesday to a three-month suspended sentence
for published comments in which he said he did not regret human
rights abuses committed during Argentina's former dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Former Capt. Alfredo Astiz had been called to answer a judge's
questions after he declared in a 1998 interview with Trespuntos
magazine that he felt ''nothing'' close to remorse over the crimes
against ''subversives'' under Argentina's 1976-83 military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Astiz proudly told the magazine he ''was the best prepared
person to kill a politician or journalist ... The navy taught me to
destroy, to plant bombs, to infiltrate and to kill,'' he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Astiz did not speak to reporters after the judge read his
sentence in a downtown Buenos Aires courthouse, convicting him
under laws that forbid public expressions in support of the Dirty
War.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have in the past accused Astiz of heading
one of several navy teams charged with kidnapping accused leftists
and other dissidents, who were often tortured and executed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a French court tried Astiz in absentia and sentenced
him to life in prison for the 1977 killings of nuns Alice Domon and
Leonie Duquet. Both were active in human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Benefitting from a 1990 immunity granted by President Carlos
Menem to all middle- and low-ranking military officers, Astiz
cannot be tried for human rights abuses in Argentina. He has not
admitted to any killings, but has acknowledged he was trained to
commit political murders.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Argentine government report, 9,000 people
disappeared during the dirty war; human rights groups insist the
number is closer to 30,000.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Aleah Johnson scored 18 points as No. 6
Texas Tech built an early lead and cruised to a 76-60 victory over
Colorado on Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 Conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (25-3) led by as many as 20 points in the first half
before taking a 43-29 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders kept the margin between 12 and 18 most of the
second half. Colorado managed to cut it to 61-52 with 6:50 left,
but Tech responded with a quick seven-point run.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (10-19), with only eight players on its roster,
appeared to run out of gas against the deeper and rested Lady
Raiders. Colorado beat Missouri in the first round on Tuesday,
while Texas Tech had not played in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Schmucker-Pharies scored 14 points in the first half for
Texas Tech, including 4-for-4 on 3-point shots. She finished with
16. Amber Tarr added 11 and Keitha Dickerson grabbed 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado was led by Britt Hartshorn with 17 points and 13
rebounds. Sabrina Scott added 13 points and Mandy Nightingale had
11.

<HEADLINE> Bush Admits Hurdles To Overcome  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush says that in the marathon
presidential race, the biggest hurdle he sees is simply this:
''Convincing the American people that I've got the right judgment
to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after his Super Tuesday triumph, and just an hour after
he voted for himself in next Tuesday's home-state primary, the
Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner sat in the
sunny conservatory of the Governor's Mansion, reflecting on the
path he's taken and the road before him.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the azaleas bloomed and the Lone Star flag flapped.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge, Bush said in an interview with The Associated
Press, is ''convincing the American people that I'm a good, sound
decision maker, that I'll make decisions of peace and prosperity
that will not only be well thought out, but lead to results.''
</P>
<P>
   While his Democratic opponent will be Vice President Al Gore,
''the hurdle is talking to the people,'' Bush said. ''I know
exactly to whom I must speak, and it's the people of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's contests, Bush beat his chief GOP rival, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, in seven primaries and two caucuses. He won the
biggest prizes -- California, New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was considering his options, including dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   However, exit polls suggested Bush still must convince Americans
that he has the intellectual heft to lead the nation. More than
four in 10 independent voters in the Republican primaries said they
didn't think he had the knowledge to serve effectively as
president. Among all voters in the GOP primaries, one-fourth felt
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Bush views the election not just as a test for
himself, but also for his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a full arrival of the baby boomer generation in
American politics,'' he said, referring to a matchup with Gore.
''Two baby boomer candidates. As I've always said, our generation
will have a chance to lead, and we'll show whether or not we've got
the capability to do so, and if not, there's another generation
coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the chief distinction between himself and Gore, Bush
said: ''I think the people are going to find a difference of
attitude between having great faith and wisdom in Washington, in
the federal government, or having faith in the people, and my
policies will reflect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has been most impressed with the heavy voter
turnout in the GOP primaries. He said it was partly a reflection of
dissatisfaction with the current administration, but also a sign of
renewed interest in the Republican Party and its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain tapped into a vein; people came into our primary
as well for him. Alan Keyes has energized some people,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the primary campaign, the Bush team has
faced criticism for some of its ads and for stirring controversy by
his speaking at the conservative Bob Jones University. Bush said he
retains faith in his advisers -- although he and his staff plan a
thorough review.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of tasks at hand, a lot of decisions that will
be made, and before I make the decisions, I want a full analysis
done of what the environment's like today and what the environment
will likely be come the summer and then the fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush spoke, he occasionally blinked in sleepiness. His
spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, hacked away with a cough making the
rounds through the campaign entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The wear of the road was apparent on both faces, but Bush was
buoyed by his trip to the voting booth. He and his wife, Laura,
visited the Travis County Courthouse a block away to cast early
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to remind Texans of next Tuesday's state primary,
a task that hardly seemed necessary as the local newspapers carried
headlines screaming of his Super Tuesday wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much different to vote for yourself, to mark 'George W.
Bush' on a ballot,'' said the son of a president. ''It's an overall
experience that's hard to describe, but the campaign and the
primaries and the competition, last night and now voting for
myself, is all part of what it means to become the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, he added: ''It's evolutionary, going from governor to
president, and this is a significant step, to be able to vote for
yourself on the ballot, and I'll be able to do so next fall, I
hope.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israelis Set To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Gritting their teeth, Palestinians and Israelis
ended a crisis in the peace process Wednesday by each conceding
what had been a cardinal ''no'': Israelis allowed greater U.S.
involvement, and Palestinians accepted territory not abutting
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling sign of the renewed U.S. role, it was President
Clinton's top envoy, Dennis Ross, who announced the resumption of
peace talks, flanked by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who said the peace talks would resume in Washington after
the four-day Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday beginning March 16, said
the sides are committed to ''work in the spirit of partnership and
mutual confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated pace -- aiming for the outline of a permanent
agreement by May, and for a full-fledged deal by Sept. 13 -- was
nonetheless fraught with issues that could sideline an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The sides are far apart on the status of Jerusalem, the future
of Jewish settlements and the status of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the seriousness each side attached to renewing the talks
was underscored by their major reversals.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had suspended the talks early last month over an interim
Israeli troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians wanted the withdrawal to include three West
Bank suburbs that abutted Jerusalem, a pullback that would enhance
his stake in the disputed city. Israel resisted, offering the
Palestinians unpopulated patches of land. Arafat said if he could
not trust the Israelis on relatively minor matters, there was no
way he could work with them on the major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. pressure, Arafat backed down. Palestinian officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Barak has handed Arafat a
map featuring 10 percent of the West Bank, out of which Arafat
could choose the 6.1 percent he wanted. The new map includes
populous areas near, but not adjoining, Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy said the withdrawal would be
''soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's concession is a deeper U.S. involvement, which in the
past has forced Washington to back off its uncritical support for
Israel for a more neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
   Levy insisted ''the United States does not determine what we
do'' but acknowledged the negotiations would alternate between
Washington and the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, who have favored active U.S. involvement
ever since it led to Clinton's virtual endorsement of Palestinian
statehood in December 1998, said Ross would attend every meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian and Israeli leaders both face pressure to reach
a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has staked his reputation on declaring statehood by Sept.
13, but fears the violence -- and the total collapse of peace -- that
a unilateral declaration would entail. A Palestinian threat last
week to assume authority in areas now under joint control prompted
warnings by Israel that it outgunned the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who had been banking on what he perceived as a more
straightforward peace treaty with Syria, saw those ambitions
collapse over Syria's insistence on a prior commitment to withdraw
from the Golan Heights -- and the ensuing escalation of violence in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and other ministers warned Barak that neglecting the
Palestinians could have disastrous consequences: a war at home much
costlier than the limited war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinian process above all, I have always said this,''
Levy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The sides also achieved a compromise on an additional withdrawal
phase, a Palestinian demand Israel had rejected until now, by
agreeing to time it for June, between the outline of a final
agreement and the deadline for the agreement itself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a compromise that accommodated a deep-seated mutual
distrust that still haunts the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want as much territory as they can get before
going into final status talks, fearing Israel will use a permanent
agreement to consolidate its presence in the 60 percent of the West
Bank it still wholly controls. Israel has the opposite concern: it
fears that once the Palestinians have enough land to declare
statehood, they will retreat from a commitment to a full-fledged
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were to meet again in the Egyptian resort of
Sharm el-Sheik on Thursday, where they would set a timetable for
implementing outstanding minor agreements, including arrangements
in the volatile West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   That summit is also a nod to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his efforts to get the sides back together.

<HEADLINE> Candidates, Parties Seek More Funds  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the presidential nominations all but
settled, the candidates and the political parties are replenishing
their campaign coffers, raising money for TV ads to sharpen their
differences before the first delegates arrive at the conventions
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the most cash-flush presidential candidate in history,
George W. Bush is raising another $10 million after taking in just
$2.8 million in February -- less than one-third of the $10 million
John McCain raised during the month. Bush now has raised more than
$73 million, a record.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore who, unlike Bush, is subject to
federal spending limits, plans to raise an additional $3 million to
supplement some $7 million in unspent taxpayer funds for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a spending time, this is a raising time,'' said
Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y. ''You restore the arsenal so you are
prepared to fight the next battle.''
</P>
<P>
   That battle will be fought over millions of independent and
moderate voters, many of whom sided with their rivals -- Bill
Bradley or John McCain -- during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question the battle is for the hearts and souls of
that vast majority in the middle,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., a leading GOP moderate and Bush supporter. ''The winner of
that election will be the one who is best able to appeal to the
rather significant majority of Americans who are centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the post-Super Tuesday fund-raising spurt is a
reversal of fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   After batting away a tougher-than-expected challenge from
McCain, Bush has only $5 million to $10 million left of his record
million warchest, according to the Campaign Study Group.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore was able to cut his spending in February and
early March as the threat from Bradley unexpectedly faded after the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Aides have pulled back $500,000 in television advertising that
had been slated for Southern states holding primaries in March 14,
including Florida, where Gore had intended to advertise most
heavily. The campaign now did not plan to place any ads in states
with primaries next Tuesday, said senior adviser Carter Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Gore did not spend any of the $7 million he recently
received in federal matching dollars -- the taxpayer assistance his
campaign got for agreeing to spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is limited to spending just $40.5 million through the
Democratic convention in August. Even before February started, he
already had spent more than half that total.
</P>
<P>
   But he is expected to enter the post-primary period with more
than $10 million to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has no spending limits and intends to make up any gaps with
a spree of 10 fund-raising events through April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts suspect both sides will have plenty of money
to begin to shape their fall battle on the airwaves this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see contrasts between Gore and Bush up to the
convention,'' Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said. ''You're going
to see some ads on the environment, on education, on health care,
on the economy, on paying down the debt and taxes. The differences
are very stark.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign messages are likely to be augmented by their
political parties, which continue to collect huge six-figure
donations from companies and labor unions that can be used for
generic issue advertising that further draw distinctions between
the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties aren't saying much yet about their summer plans.
Bush was asked Wednesday for his thoughts about the prospect of
Republican issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the RNC is planning some ads to, some issue ads, obviously
I want to make sure -- if I'm the nominee, .... I'd like to know
what they're about, but I think we're in March,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called soft money donations also can be used by the
parties to court those independent and moderate voters with
get-out-the-vote drives, direct mail and voter registration
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On that front, Republicans have an edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee reported $16.4 million in the
bank as of Jan. 31, compared to just $2.5 million for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been trying to narrow that gap for Gore,
raising $5 million for the party already this year and planning 10
more fund-raising events this month.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Eye Lifting Gas Tax  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soaring gasoline and oil prices are prompting
talk in Congress about temporarily lifting a 4.3-cent per gallon
gas tax imposed seven years ago, and giving renewed attention to
opening an environmentally sensitive Arctic refuge to oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators acknowledged the Arctic drilling proposals,
which attracted 31 GOP senators Wednesday, was a long shot and
aimed at dealing with long term oil import problems.
Environmentalists immediately denounced the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But with gasoline prices projected to possibly hit $2 a gallon
this summer, a growing number of lawmakers are suggesting a
temporary cut in the 4.3 cent tax imposed in 1993. At the time
Democrats were in the majority and pushed the tax through over
solid Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to take down the price of gas this summer,'' said
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, suggesting one way to help do that was
suspending the 1993 excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said
the high cost of oil is being felt by the government as it is by
the average motorist.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is $2 billion short in meeting its fuel costs
because of the price increases in diesel, jet fuel and gasoline, he
said. The House this week approved $1.8 billion more for the
Pentagon to pay fuel bills, and Stevens says the Senate will do
something similar.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a cut in the federal gasoline excise tax was
getting a cool reception from the very lawmakers who write the tax
laws.
</P>
<P>
   While it might be politically attractive, Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he
was troubled by the idea of cutting a tax and then reinstating it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am for tax reduction whenever you can put them on the books.
I'm a little concerned when we say we're going to do it, then we're
going to take it back,'' said Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Such a tax cut, even if temporary, also would take billions of
dollars away from the federal trust fund for highway construction,
something that does not set well with lawmakers planning the
transportation budget, nor the powerful highway lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who favors suspension of the 4.3
cent tax, said the lost revenue could be made up later when gas
prices go down.
</P>
<P>
   But Murkowski said the turmoil over oil prices -- and America's
growing dependence on foreign oil -- is clear evidence that an
Arctic refuge in northern Alaska should be opened to drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's two senators for years have tried to get Congress to
approve drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. One year a
bill passed to allow such development, but was vetoed by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski acknowledged this would do nothing to ease the current
gasoline price crunch, but that the United States must take steps
to produce more oil domestically. Otherwise, he said, the country,
which now relies for 56 percent of its oil from abroad, will see
that number continue to climb to nearly two-thirds by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   He said his bill had 31 co-sponsors. The Interior Department has
estimated there are between 9 billion and 16 billion barrels of oil
beneath the refuge's coastal strip on the Arctic Ocean east of the
Prudhoe Bay fields.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he strongly opposes oil
developing in the refuge and that President Clinton against would
veto such legislation. ''We've made it clear again and again. We
will protect this last undeveloped fragment of America' arctic
coastline,'' he said, adding that it's home to thousands of
caribou, polar bears, swans, snow geese, musk oxen and other
species.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave unanimous
support to a nonbinding resolution calling on President Clinton to
communicate the need for increased oil production to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries before their meeting
March 27.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Subway Derails; 4 Killed  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC PRIDEAUX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A Tokyo commuter train peeled away the side of an
oncoming train car that derailed during rush hour Wednesday
morning, unleashing a shower of glass and metal in an accident that
killed four people and injured 33.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a 'boom' and an impact, my body was lifted up from the
seat and I wondered what happened,'' passenger Motoshi Yamabe, 30,
was quoted as saying in Thursday's Japan Times.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified woman living nearby told the paper, ''I heard a
very loud noise, and windows shook like it was an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloodied garments lay strewn about the scene. Shocked passengers
wandered near the ground-level track. A police blockade at the busy
crossing near the station caused a huge traffic jam. Metro train
service was disrupted for the morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33 people injured, several were in critical condition,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began when a car in the rear of a train emerging
from a tunnel derailed on a curve just short of the elevated
Nakameguro station in western Tokyo and struck two cars of an
oncoming train packed with 1,300 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the derailed car was ripped away from end to end.
Two hundred and forty passengers were aboard that train.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known. An early
media report blamed the derailment on an explosion, but officials --
including the prime minister -- quickly denied it.
</P>
<P>
   All the air was gone from the hydraulic shock absorber under the
derailed car, and that may have played a role in the accident,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Ministry officials said a possible cause of the
derailment was the tracks' sharp curve along a slope, Kyodo News
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi instructed the Transport Ministry to
investigate, spokesman Akitaka Saiki said.
</P>
<P>
   A police probe was focused on suspicions of professional
negligence, a Tokyo police spokesman said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the worst Tokyo rail accident since 1988,
when one train rammed into the back of another stopped at a station
during rush hour, killing two and injuring 92.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway killed 12 people and
sickened thousands.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Denver Nuggets coach Dan Issel and
forward Chris Gatling were ejected in separate third-quarter
incidents in Wednesday's game against the Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling was tossed with 3:54 left for a flagrant foul on John
Crotty. With Crotty driving for a breakaway layup, Gatling
bodychecked him to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Issel was ejected with 1:39 left in the period when he was
called for his second technical for arguing a foul call. He had
been called for a technical midway through the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach John Lucas replaced Issel, but it didn't help.
The Pistons outscored Denver 41-17 in the period to take a 104-83

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Held on Explosive Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- An Egyptian man charged with possessing
explosives and counterfeit money faces two more weeks in jail after
his bail hearing was postponed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tarek Adealy Khafagy was detained Saturday by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police after a search of his apartment turned up explosives
and 100 counterfeit $5 bills, according to Sgt. Guy Babin, an RCMP
national-security supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, 30, broke into tears when his lawyer explained that the
hearing had been rescheduled for March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, who has lived in Montreal 18 months and speaks little
English or French, has denied any knowledge of the explosives and
counterfeit money found in his apartment, said the lawyer, Tom
Pentefountas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really upset by the situation,'' Pentefountas said. ''He
doesn't understand what's happening, why he's been arrested or why
he has to stay in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday that some of
Khafagy's co-workers at a Montreal bakery had keys to Khafagy's
apartment and sometimes stayed there while Khafagy worked an
overnight shift. The report was based on information from a bakery
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest in December of an Algerian who allegedly tried to
smuggle bomb-making supplies into the United States from Canada
raised concern that international terrorist networks were operating
out of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Fla. 22 Vehicle Pileup Kills Three  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLBORN, Fla. (AP) -- Twenty-two cars and trucks slammed into
each other Wednesday in a pileup along a highway shrouded by
blinding smoke from a forest fire. Three people were killed and 21
injured, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand how I lived through that,'' said Erik
Gebauer, whose Mustang slid under a tractor-trailer. ''I felt death
right behind me. I can't believe I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial pileup involved 16 vehicles in the westbound lanes
of Interstate 10 about 90 miles east of Tallahassee in northern
Florida, officials said. Some of those vehicles crossed the median,
causing a six-car pileup in the eastbound lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were the driver of a pickup truck that caught fire; the
driver of a tractor-trailer; and a motorist who stopped to help and
was crushed when a load of plywood fell off a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people remained hospitalized Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the pileup, as salvage crews began pulling apart the
twisted wreckage, the full extent of the carnage could be seen.
Three vehicles were burned. Five tractor-trailers had jackknifed.
Cars had slid underneath trucks. A sport utility vehicle rested on
its side.
</P>
<P>
   The lone police car for the town of Jennings was crushed beneath
a tractor-trailer so tightly that when the truck was righted, it
also came off the ground. The officer was hospitalized in serious
condition with a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The low visibility was a result of the forest fire,'' said
Highway Patrol Lt. Ken Knowles.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke came from a 7,000-acre arson fire in Osceola National
Park, about 10 miles away. Visibility was further reduced when
three of the vehicles caught fire, and that caused more vehicles to
plow into the wreckage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really smokey -- you couldn't see but a few feet in
front of you,'' said trucker Richard Smith, who was heading east to
Jacksonville and able to stop safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could hear popping and snapping,'' he said. ''I couldn't
believe it. First time I have ever seen anything this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen miles of highway were closed after the 8 a.m.
chain-reaction accident.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, eight people were killed and five were injured
in Nevada when a van skidded across an interstate highway, plunged
down a steep highway median and flipped over several times. The van
was carrying 13 passengers toward Las Vegas when it rolled over
about 30 miles south of the city.

<HEADLINE> China Executes Senior Official  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China executed a corrupt deputy provincial
governor on Wednesday, underscoring the government's determination
to end pervasive graft that has eroded support for Communist Party
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The execution was timed to coincide with the country's most
public political event, and was followed by televised images of the
official's ill-gotten gains: caches of cognac, piles of U.S. and
Chinese cash, gold watches, diamond rings and a golden Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Changqing was put to death in southern Jiangxi province after
the Supreme People's Court, ruling on his appeal, said the
execution could proceed. He was the most senior official ever
executed as part China's accelerating campaign against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''For such a flagrant criminal, only the death penalty is
sufficient to safeguard national law, satisfy popular indignation,
rectify the party's work style and fight against corruption,'' the
People's Daily said in an editorial broadcast on state television
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The execution came on the fourth day of the annual session of
the National People's Congress and was deliberately timed to
impress the delegates. Although largely powerless, the
party-dominated national legislature has routinely expressed its
displeasure with the government's inability to effectively combat
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption has so far dominated the congress' 11-day session and
overshadowed its modest agenda of approving government work reports
and budgets, and passing a procedural law. Congress leaders opened
the session by acknowledging that a vice chairman, Cheng Kejie, was
under investigation for economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the congress Sunday, Premier Zhu Rongji promised to
prosecute the corrupt no matter how powerful but conceded
government efforts have so far fallen short of public expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The public wants the government to do more, Shanghai legislator
Zhang Zhongli told reporters Wednesday after meeting with members
of his delegation. ''The amount of money (involved in bribe-taking)
is getting worse and worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the displays of party resolve, Chinese leaders are
concerned about the fallout from wide-ranging scandals that have
shaken the communist machines in at least three provinces and
reached into the apex of power, the ruling Politburo.
</P>
<P>
   A half-year investigation into billions of dollars in smuggling
through the port of Xiamen has uncovered a web of payouts. At least
30 officials have been arrested and hundreds questioned, one party
official said. Among those implicated was the wife of Beijing party
secretary Jia Qinglin, a protege of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about losing an ally in the Politburo, Jiang moved to
defend Jia, ordering his wife and state media to say she had been
cleared, party officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters covering the congress, the party secretary
of Fujian province -- where Xiamen is located -- said Wednesday that
there had been ''a big breakthrough'' in the case, but more
investigations were needed. ''When this case has been wrapped up we
will responsibly tell everybody,'' Chen Mingyi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party rode to power in part through harsh
criticism of the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist
government. Party officials maintained a reputation for frugality
until the rapid growth brought on by capitalist reforms made the
privileges of public office tempting.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Hu reached as high as the State Council,
China's Cabinet, where Hu served as deputy director of the
council's Religious Affairs Commission. During four years of
bribe-taking that began in 1995, Hu was convicted of accumulating
$658,000 in bribes and $194,900 in property from unidentified
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted last month, Hu appealed twice, first to the Jiangxi
Higher People's Court, which ruled the evidence used against him
was authentic and sufficient, and then to the Supreme People's
Court, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a senior government official, Hu should have acted as a
model and strictly abided by state laws, instead of abusing his
power to make illegal profits,'' Xinhua cited the high court as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the norm, state media accounts did not
describe how Hu was executed. China leads the world in judicial
executions, and most executions are carried out by gunshot,
although China has been experimenting with lethal injection.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hits Near Milwaukee Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A tornado touched down near Milwaukee's
Mitchell International Airport late Wednesday and roared among
businesses and homes, overturning vehicles and damaging buildings
before heading out over Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Only minor injuries were reported. Airport officials said
emergency power sources kept the outage from affecting operations.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Miller said she saw the twister travel along a service
road near here home in suburban St. Francis, just northeast of the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just went by so quickly,'' Miller said. ''It was just an
incredible roar.''
</P>
<P>
   As hail fell during the evening, authorities ordered an
evacuation of homes in about a 40-square-block neighborhood while
crews worked to fix a natural gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Electric Power Co. spokeswoman Margaret Heffernan said
the tornado knocked down four power lines, cutting electricity to
about 80 customers, most of them industrial, in an area that
included the airport. Service was restored later in the evening.

Quebec To Fire Officers if Convicted of Crime
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The Quebec government announced Wednesday it
will pass legislation to fire police officers convicted of criminal
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The power of police and their unions have come under scrutiny
since two Montreal police officers convicted in the fatal beating
of a taxi driver won the right to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law has to be changed,'' Justice Minister Serge Menard
said in Quebec City. ''This can't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Menard said under his planned law, officers with criminal
convictions would be ''automatically fired.''
</P>
<P>
   But the law, which has been in the works for months and covers
other aspects of police conduct and training, won't be passed until
some time this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Menard acknowledged there's nothing he can do to prevent the two
Montreal officers from returning to work after serving their
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Constables Pierre Bergeron and Louis Samson, convicted of
assault causing bodily harm, were ordered fired for using excessive
force on cabbie Richard Barnabe.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabe never regained consciousness. He died at 41 in 1996
after 29 months in a coma.

Ralph Klein at Odds With Stockwell Day
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Stockwell Day's plan to keep his day
job if he challenges Preston Manning for leadership of the Canadian
Alliance isn't finding favor with his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said Wednesday that Day will have to
step down as provincial treasurer once he declares himself a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He said that's what he and other cabinet ministers had to do in
the campaign to replace outgoing premier Don Getty in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once he's in the race, he would have to do as I had to do, as
Nancy MacBeth and Rick Orman had to do, and that is take a leave of
absence while he's seeking the nomination,'' said Klein.

<P>
   He added that Day ''would have to be very careful how (he)

Egyptian-born Refugee Remains in Custody
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Weeping and bowing his head, an Egyptian-born
refugee stood in handcuffs Wednesday as his bail hearing on charges
of possessing explosives was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Tarek Adealy Khafagy couldn't keep from crying when he heard he
must stay behind bars until March 22.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer said Khafagy, 30, knows nothing about any plot to
bomb Israeli diplomatic buildings -- an allegation made in published
reports but not in the current charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't understand what's happening, why he's been arrested
or why he has to stay in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was more than one key to Khafagy's home and
friends sometimes stayed overnight, as a convenience or a temporary
refuge when their domestic lives were in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, who arrived in Canada about 18 months ago, was arrested
Saturday on three charges of possessing an explosive substance with
the intent to endanger life or to damage property.
</P>
<P>
   RCMP have said they got a tip and searched his home.

Newfoundland Vows To Solve Chronic Aboriginal Problems
</P>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- As an Inuit village grieved the
violent death of another young resident Wednesday, Newfoundland's
government said it's time to study the chronic problems faced by
Labrador aboriginals.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came hours after a 17-year-old Inuk from Nain
was shot to death in the tiny coastal community in northern
Labrador. A suspect was later arrested, but RCMP didn't release
details.
</P>
<P>
   Nain has also suffered through three suicides in the last three
weeks -- a shocking blow to a community that is home to only 1,300
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of hurt in the community, a lot of sorrow,''
said Wally Anderson, an Inuk and member of the Newfoundland
legislature from Labrador.

Chretien Ready To Name Campaign Team
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien is putting the
finishing touches on a Liberal campaign team for the next federal
election, a move calculated to reaffirm to party faithful his
intention to run for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say the official announcement, naming national and
provincial campaign chairmen and a national platform committee,
could come any time in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The betting, however, is that Chretien will move within days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't be surprised to see him do it sooner rather than
later,'' said a party official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim would be to send a message to delegates -- and any
would-be leadership challengers -- as rank-and-file Liberals prepare
for the biennial party convention that opens March 16 in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   There is no thought of an election this year, but senior
strategists say it's time to take the next organizational step and
name the official team for the vote expected in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Gore Trying To Oust Hussein  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore assured a young
Iraqi-American man, who lamented that his Christian relatives had
been starved and murdered in Iraq, that the United States is trying
to have Saddam Hussein removed from power.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been maybe 10 years now that I haven't seen a smile from
my parents or any emotion due to lost relatives in the country,''
Jason Kado, 19, told Gore at a forum with undecided Michigan
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Kado, who said his uncle -- part of Iraq's Caldian Christian
minority -- was killed by the Iraqi military and that his cousins
died of malnutrition, asked Gore what he would do as president to
end Saddam's dictatorship and the international sanctions tied to
his reign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam Hussein is the reason for this suffering,'' Gore said
in a sympathetic tone. ''We have tried to remove him. We are now
engaged in some efforts that we're not talking about publicly but,
no doubt, you've seen (them) reported in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to reiterate his support for continuing sanctions
against Iraq, with their exemption for food and medical supplies.
''If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will move Heaven and
earth to bring an end to the suffering; it has gone on too long.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Gore added, ''We can't go in there without troops'' and
impose a change in government.
</P>
<P>
   Kado told a reporter after the forum that Gore's answer was
half-satisfying. ''I wanted to hear that Iraq would be the next
democracy ... that the United States would use its power,'' he
said. ''But he at least made an attempt to please me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the question-and-answer session, convened three days before
Michigan's Democratic caucuses, Gore also was asked about peace in
Kosovo and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He reported slow progress in Kosovo but offered a vague pledge
to ''continue our commitment to see this process through to a
conclusion that is respectful of the people and their aspirations
for peace with security.''
</P>
<P>
   On Northern Ireland, he said he would like to follow President
Clinton's precedent with his own peace missions to Belfast and
Dublin. ''I will never give up until our country succeeds in
facilitating the completion of this peace process. I think it's
that important,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Nets 115, Trail Blazers 103  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Portland's slide turned into a
slump Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off their most lopsided loss of the season, the Trail
Blazers were maybe even worse against the New Jersey Nets as they
played with a lack of energy and cohesiveness and lost 115-103 to
the 11th-place team in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Portland fell behind for good less than six minutes into the
first quarter, trailed by 14 at halftime and by as many as 25 in
the third quarter to lose for the third time in four games -- making
it the Blazers' worst stretch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, playing with a pass-first mentality, led New
Jersey with 24 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds. Jamie Feick
had 16 points, Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn added 15 apiece and
Kendall Gill had 14.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace had 19 and Arvydas Sabonis added 16 for the
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   After being tied with the Lakers for the league's best record
just over a week ago, the Blazers (46-14) are now 3{ games behind
Los Angeles in the Pacific Division. Their
four-games-in-five-nights road trip only gets tougher Thursday with
a game at Indiana, where the Pacers have won 24 in a row. Portland
will be trying to avoid its first three-game losing streak of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had eight assists before he even scored a point, and
Kittles scored 13 points in the first quarter as the Nets quickly
moved ahead. The Blazers were a step slow of defense and out of
sync at other times, three times losing the ball out of bounds
while fighting among themselves for a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets took their first 18-point lead on a three-point play by
Gill to make it 59-41 with 1:50 left in the second quarter, and the
lead reached 22 when Marbury banked in a 3-pointer as the 24-second
clock expired midway through the third.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury laughed as he backpedaled downcourt, and Portland point
guard Damon Stoudamire could only smirk and shake his head as he
realized it was going to be one of those rare poor nights for a
team that had spent most of the season atop the overall NBA
standings.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that kept Portland somewhat close by halftime was
the play of Sabonis, who shot 7-for-10 and scored 16 points while
the Blazers' other starters combined to shoot just 6-for-25.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of coming out fired up for the third quarter, the
Blazers remained flat and trailed 94-70 entering the fourth quarter
after Feick hit a 22-foot jumper at the third-quarter buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets went ahead 108-82 in the fourth quarter before Portland
used an 11-0 run to make the final score somewhat more
respectable.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Nets center Jayson Williams took a strength test Wednesday
morning on his injured right leg and was cleared to begin
full-scale practices. He has been sidelined since last April 1 when
he broke his leg in a collision with Marbury. ... Wallace picked up
his league-leading 24th technical foul. Referee Steve Javie nailed
him for taunting after a dunk. ... The Nets are 23-23 since their
abysmal 2-13 start. ... Portland had its five-game road winning
streak snapped. ... The Blazers dropped to 22-4 against sub-.500
teams. ... New Jersey was just the eighth Portland opponent to
reach 100 points. ... Feick hit consecutive 3-pointers late in the
fourth quarter. They were his first attempts from behind the arc
this season.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 130, Nuggets 116  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored a career-high
40 points and Grant Hill added 27 points and 10 assists Wednesday
night as the Detroit Pistons started the George Irvine era with a
130-116 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked Irvine's coaching debut for Detroit after he
replaced Alvin Gentry, who was fired on Monday. Irvine, who has
already said he doesn't want the job permanently, is expected to
coach for the rest of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Denver also finished the game with a temporary coach as John
Lucas took over after Dan Issel was ejected in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse went 13 of 21 from the floor, including six
3-pointers, and hit all eight free-throw attempts in 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess led the Nuggets with 29 points and Nick Van Exel
added 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons reached 130 points for the second time in two weeks.
Before their 131-99 win over Golden State on Feb. 25, they hadn't
done it since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Denver jumped out to an 11-point lead in the first quarter and
still led 66-63 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit started the third period with a 14-2 run to take their
first lead of the game. Jerry Stackhouse had 5 points in the run,
which was helped by five Denver turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons outscored Denver 41-17 to take a 104-83 lead into
the final period. Stackhouse had 10 points in the period, as the
Pistons shot 72 percent (13-18) from the floor and added 11 free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit led by as many as 26 points in the fourth before a
meaningless Nuggets comeback.
</P>
<P>
NOTES: The Pistons will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of
their 1989-90 championship team this week. Irvine is the sixth
Pistons coach in those 10 years. ... Tariq Abdul-Wahad missed the
game with a sprained left wrist. ... Irvine left the Detroit
starting lineup intact and didn't make any major changes to the
playing rotation. ... Denver's Chris Gatling was ejected with 3:54
left in the third quarter after a flagrant foul on John Crotty.

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Stu Barnes scored 1:54 into overtime as the
Buffalo Sabres ended a three-game winless streak, beating the
Boston Bruins 2-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-on-1 break, Barnes capped a give-and-go with Vaclav
Varada, snapping in the returning pass over fallen Bruins goalie
John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Woolley also scored for the Sabres, who snapped an 0-2-1
streak and gave them only their second victory in seven games
(2-4-1).
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, which entered the night in 11th place in the Eastern
Conference, remained in the thick of the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Antti Laaksonen scored for the Bruins, who have lost five
straight and are 0-5-1 in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy Ruff became the fourth coach in Sabres' franchise history
to record 100 victories. Scotty Bowman, the Detroit Red Wings
coach, is atop the list with 210 wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have had a difficult week after trading away veteran
defenseman Ray Bourque to Colorado on Monday and learning a day
later that Marty McSorley would be charged by Vancouver police for
slashing Donald Brashear of the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   After Woolley opened the scoring 4:45 in, when his intended
centering pass pinballed in off the skate of Boston defenseman Kyle
McLaren, Laaksonen tied it with 10:12 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on a Buffalo miscue when defender Jay McKee fell,
Laaksonen rushed in alone and snapped a 15-footer just inside the
left post. It was Laaksonen's first goal of the season and second
career.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley's goal was the first by Buffalo in almost 135 minutes
against the Bruins. The Sabres were shut out in their last two
meetings with Boston, including a scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres played their first game without captain Michael Peca,
who sustained a dislocated shoulder that could sideline him for the
rest of the regular season (14 games). Peca was injured Sunday in a
2-1 loss at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston, one of three players acquired in the deal for
Bourque and Dave Andreychuk, made his Bruins debut.

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Bates Battaglia scored three third-period
goals as the Carolina Hurricanes won their third straight, beating
the Chicago Blackhawks 4-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, who matched their season-high winning streak,
improved to .500 for the first time since Jan. 9 and remained in
contention for the final two playoff spots in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Mironov's shot from the right circle beat Arturs Irbe high
on his glove side 45 seconds into the third period to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Battaglia scored his 12th goal 1:43 later as he shook off
defenseman Anders Eriksson in the corner, skated to the front of
the net and beat Jocelyn Thibault from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Battaglia, a Chicago native, iced it with 2:48 left with a
30-foot slap shot and added an empty-netter with 7.7 seconds
remaining for his first hat trick of his three-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina scored five goals in three straight games for the first
time since the 1993-94 season on its West Coast road trip, but
found few scoring chances against the last-place team in the
Central Division until the third period.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first, Glen Wesley joined the rush and was
able to beat Thibault low on the glove side from the slot for his
sixth. Ron Francis received one of the assists to give him a
five-game point streak.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's defense scored an NHL-low 15 goals last season, but
Wesley's was the unit's 32nd this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks were 0-for-2 on the power play and are just
1-for-19 with the man-advantage in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was without 23-goal scorer Eric Daze (back spasms) and
second-leading scorer Doug Gilmour (bruised ribs).

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Heckled Over March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton was confronted at a
meeting of a homosexual Democratic group Wednesday by two hecklers
who demanded to know why she plans to march in the St. Patrick's
Day parade, which excludes homosexual marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate was addressing about
100 members of the Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats at a
community center in Greenwich Village when a man and then a woman
interrupted by shouting questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are you marching in the St. Pat's parade?'' asked
Christina McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady asked the hecklers to allow her to finish her
remarks and promised to answer theirs questions afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The hecklers allowed her to proceed, and she later told the
audience she was marching in the parade because of her interest in
supporting the Irish peace process, a cause she and President
Clinton have been involved in for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic club held a closed meeting after Clinton left and
voted to endorse her for candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton marched in an early St. Patrick's Day parade
in Queens that was billed as an inclusive parade because it allowed
homosexual groups to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said she hoped the March 17 event would also be
inclusive, but its organizers, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a
fraternal Catholic group, have maintained their right to exclude
the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats avoid the main St. Patrick's Day parade because
of its ban on homosexual groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's likely Republican rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has
said he'll march in this year's parade.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Clinton said she would march in the gay pride
parade in June, an event Giuliani regularly attends.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe
Al Gore on Wednesday as he scripted his exit from the Democratic
presidential campaign. John McCain canceled further campaign events
amid signs his presidential challenge was near an end.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nominees-in-waiting, reached
out to their defeated rivals and jabbed at one another as they
pivoted toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush labeled the vice president ''an agent of Washington,'' and
Gore returned the insult, saying Bush was too cozy with the
''extreme right'' as personified by the National Rifle Association
and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   McCain huddled with senior strategists and major financial
backers at his mountain cabin near Sedona, Ariz., to assess the
situation. Campaign events in Colorado and Illinois were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scheduled a news conference for noon EST Thursday. It was
unclear whether the Arizona senator would end his campaign
entirely, or simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his options.
One senior aide said he would halt the campaign. Another said
McCain would quit outright. Both spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of McCain's senior aides have been urging him to withdraw,
saying Bush has built an almost impossible lead in the delegate
count.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said there was no campaign schedule after Thursday's
announcement, except for an off-the-record barbecue with
journalists at McCain's rustic cabin near Sedona. Reporters were
told they would be dispatched to Phoenix at the end of the day --
without McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For both Bradley and McCain, the day was spent reflecting Super
Tuesday defeats that effectively ended their hopes of winning the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were urging McCain to quit. Key to the decision, they said, was
finding a way to effectively push McCain's campaign themes of
broadening the party's base and overhauling reforming campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   A list of options had been prepared for McCain's meetings
Wednesday. These included staying in the race to further his
political reform agenda, getting out and supporting the GOP ticket,
and leaving to mount a third-party bid. McCain has said previously
he would not leave the GOP, and by day's end one adviser said a
third-party bid had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said there had been discussions about how to
ease McCain's return to the Senate after a campaign in which he
often attacked his own party as beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bradley, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the former New Jersey senator would announce his withdrawal on
Thursday and throw his support to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, plans to stay active in public life and is not
expected to rule out another presidential run, the advisers said.
They also said he has no interest in the vice presidential spot on
the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gore was thinking along those lines. One senior adviser
to the vice president, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that Bradley had not won any contests in his quest for the
nomination and Gore would want someone on the ticket who had
demonstrated an ability to carry a state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bradley as a running mate, Gore said in Nashville,
Tenn.: ''I'm not drawing up a list -- short, long or in between. It
is just too early.'' But he credited Bradley, whom he had attacked
repeatedly in debates and advertising when the nomination was at
risk, for prompting ''a very constructive and healthy debate,''
especially on health reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appealed to McCain's desire, often stated on the
campaign, to deny Gore the White House. ''I would say, 'John, let's
team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore,'' the governor said. He
hastened to add he wasn't extending an offer of the vice
presidential spot on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign was at a pivot point, but there were
still primaries to come, and both Bush and Gore continued to seek
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had Michigan and Minnesota on his itinerary for the day,
two states where Democratic delegates will be selected over the
next few days. At the same time, given the collapse of Bradley's
candidacy, the vice president's aides decided to pull back $500,000
in television advertising that had been slated for Southern states
holding primaries on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set stops Thursday in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, where
delegates will be picked in primaries and caucuses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the virtual nationwide primary on Tuesday, the AP delegate
count showed Gore with 1,424 delegates, to 412 for Bradley, out of
2,170 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, it was 617 for Bush to 231 for McCain, with
1,034 needed to nominate. Those numbers told the hopelessness of
McCain's position. An additional 91 delegates are stake in Western
states on Saturday, and 351 more on March 14 in states across the
South, the part of the country where Bush is strongest.

<HEADLINE> Boy Lives With Dead Mom for Weeks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINES TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- For three weeks a 6-year-old boy
tucked himself into bed, poured his own cereal and went out to
play, each day passing the body of his mother, who lay on the
living room floor covered by a blanket and crib mattress,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few weeks ago ... he had heard his mother fall and ...
covered her up,'' Kent County Undersheriff Larry Stelma said
Wednesday. ''We are assuming that he thought she was sick or had
fallen asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, alerted by concerned school officials, went to the
family's apartment Tuesday in this comfortable Grand Rapids suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found the badly decomposed body of the child's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy, who was dirty and hungry but otherwise in good
health, is in state custody until authorities officially confirm
his mother's identity and notify relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary autopsy results suggest no foul play was involved.
Officials did not release any names, but say it appears the boy and
his mother were the only two people living in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The case is not the first of its kind. Among recent cases,
authorities in Memphis, Tenn., discovered a 9-year-old boy who had
been living with his mother's corpse for a month. Authorities said
he did not call for help, for fear he would be placed in foster
care.

<HEADLINE> Israel Court OKs Arab Land Purchase  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Since she entered first grade in 1996, Eiya
Kaadan has dreamed of leaving behind her crowded, asbestos-lined
classroom in an Arab town for the clean white rooms of a school in
the nearby Jewish community of Katzir.
</P>
<P>
   Now she may get her chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Eiya's parents can buy
land and settle in Katzir, meaning Eiya can change schools.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark decision overturned a 52-year-old state policy of
restricting land sales to Arabs. It was hailed as a breakthrough in
the struggle for equality by Israeli Arabs who make up about 20
percent of Israel's population of just over 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the ruling could undermine Israeli security by
letting Arabs establish majorities in key areas, including those
close to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Avi Yehezkel, a legislator
from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's One Israel party, said he
would submit legislation to try to sidestep the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Areas within Israel adjacent to the Palestinian entity could
over time and under pressure become less Israeli,'' said Sallai
Meridor, head of the Jewish Agency, which oversees almost all land
sales in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a few mixed cities, communities in Israel
are segregated. Arab towns are generally overcrowded and have poor
infrastructure, a result of decades of lower budget allocations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kaadans, the court order forcing the state to let them
live in Katzir will mean paved streets, a sewage system and a
soccer field at Eiya's school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy,'' Eiya, 10, said outside the court, flanked by
her two sisters, father and mother. ''I want to live there because
everything will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision said that restricting land sales to Jews was not
compatible with democracy. ''The Jewish character of the state does
not permit Israel to discriminate among its citizens,'' said the
ruling. ''In Israel, Jews and non-Jews are citizens with equal
rights and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling will allow Arab Israelis to buy land in almost
100 Jewish communities that do not have a legitimate reason for
segregation, said Oren Yiftachel, geography professor at Ben Gurion
University. Kibbutzim, or communal farms, would remain closed to
Arab residents.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's founding in 1948, Arab Israelis have been unable
to establish new communities, expand the boundaries of existing
ones or move to expressly Jewish areas, said Mohammed Barakeh, an
Arab legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Lands Authority, in cooperation with the Jewish
Agency, had earmarked Katzir in northern Israel as a Jewish
community and rejected the Kaadan's application to buy land in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Eiya's father, Adel, a nurse who has treated Jews at a hospital
for 24 years said Wednesday's ruling reversed an injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you allow me in a hospital to treat the soul and the
body of a person and be responsible for him but not accept me as
his neighbor,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Magic 103, Bulls 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Darrell Armstrong paced six Magic players
in double figures with 17 points Wednesday night and Orlando took
advantage of 25 Chicago turnovers and a 33.3 shooting percentage to
beat the Bulls 103-67.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando has won four of its last five and has moved into a tie
with Milwaukee for the eighth playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference following the Bucks' loss to Boston. Chicago has dropped
nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   John Amaechi had 16 points for Orlando, with Corey Maggette
adding 15, Anthony Johnson 12, Bo Outlaw 11 and Pat Garrity 10.

throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Chris Carr scored 13 points Elton Brand had 11 points
and 11 rebounds. They were the only Chicago players to score in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando outscored Chicago 23-11 in the third quarter and led by
29 points twice, including 76-47 at the end of the quarter
following Magette's layup. Orlando led by as many as 38 in the
final quarter and no fewer than 29.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's 67 points was one point off the Orlando franchise
record for fewest points scored by an opponent. Orlando held Dallas
to 66 points in a 1997 game.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando never trailed after the 11:39 mark of the first quarter
and the Magic went on to lead by as many as 15 points. Chicago
could get no closer than 10 points in the second quarter as the
Magic led 53-36 at the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Orlando's Ron Mercer missed his second consecutive game
with a sprained ankle. Mercer is listed day-to-day. ... Chicago's
John Starks (knee tendinitis) did not travel with the team. ...
Johnson's 12 points were a season high.

<HEADLINE> UN: Rapes Continue in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council demanded Wednesday
that Sierra Leone rebels stop attacking civilians and cooperate
with the beefed-up U.N. peacekeeping presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The council issued a statement to the press after hearing a
briefing about the human rights situation in the war-battered West
African country from Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Hedi Annabi.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some improvements in the human rights situation, former
junta soldiers and rebels are still abducting, abusing and raping
civilians and looting entire villages, Annabi said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone was sent to the West African
nation to monitor a cease-fire agreement reached by rebels and the
government in July and to oversee the disarming of fighters in the
country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council increased the force size from an initial
6,000 to 11,100 last month, but Annabi said the United Nations was
still trying to find enough troops to go.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the press, the council urged governments to
quickly provide well-equipped troops for the force.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Shipyard May Sack Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's biggest
single employer, the Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was built,
has run out of orders and notified its more than 1,700 workers
Wednesday that they face unemployment in 90 days if no new
contracts can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Harland and Wolff Shipbuilders says it is facing serious
trouble. But if it succeeds in its effort to win a $632 million
contract to build the oceanliner Queen Mary II for Cunard, it will
have an estimated 10 million hours of labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harland and Wolff face either a feast or a famine,'' said East
Belfast legislator Peter Robinson. ''It is a very serious matter,
but I do not think the situation is without hope.''
</P>
<P>
   If the contract is not secured, ''then it's fairly clear ...
that Harland and Wolff cannot see a way to continue to trade,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harland and Wolff served the legally required notice of
impending unemployment to all 1,754 staff working for it and its
two subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We very much hope that we shall not have to action this
notification in its entirety,'' group chief executive Brynjulv
Mugaas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything now hinges on the Queen Mary II,'' trade union
leader George Matchett said. ''Management has done an awful lot of
work ... but we'll have to wait until the final contract is
submitted.''

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Antoine Walker scored 30 points, pulled down a
season-high 19 rebounds and had 10 assists Wednesday night to lead
the Boston Celtics to a 112-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth triple-double of Walker's career and his first
since Feb. 1, 1998, against the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Boston's second straight after the Celtics
dropped 12 of their previous 15. The Bucks have lost eight of their
last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee led by one point to start the fourth quarter and went
up 91-88 on Sam Cassell's hoop with 9:32 left. Less than three
minutes later, the Celtics took a 96-91 lead on Paul Pierce's
3-pointer from the wing.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's dunk with 5:05 remaining gave the Celtics their largest
lead of the game, 102-93.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson scored 15 points and had a 9 rebounds. Pierce
added 20 points for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen led the Bucks with 28 points, including 22 in the
first half. Scott Williams and Cassell each added 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks led 66-65 in the third quarter before the Celtics went
on an 8-1 run, capped by an Adrian Griffin layup off a Walker pass,
to put the Celtics in front 74-67. Milwaukee came back to take an
84-83 at the end of the third quarter on Tim Thomas' alley-oop dunk
from Vinny Del Negro.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks used an 18-8 run midway through the second quarter to
take a 59-52 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee starting center Ervin Johnson missed the game
with acute back spasms suffered during warmups. Backup forward
Mirsad Turkcan skipped the Boston trip and is day-to-day with an
injured right foot suffered in the Bucks' 111-78 victory over
Atlanta on Monday night. ... Celtics forward Danny Fortson has

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rebels Seize Radio Station  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Thousands of masked
rebels and supporters marched through this tourist town Wednesday
and briefly seized a radio station to demand greater rights for
women and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised tourists snapped photos of the brightly clothed
marchers, most of them women and some of them carrying children in
the event timed to coincide with International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The masked protesters jumped out of trucks that had brought them
from rural communities and then marched along the cobblestone
streets of San Cristobal, where they forced their way into XERA
radio, owned by the state of Chiapas, and held it for about 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women historically have been and are the poorest and most
excluded by a racist society and a government which refuses to
recognize our existence,'' said a Tzotzil woman who gave her name
as Angelica Maria, over the radio.
</P>
<P>
   She accused the government of carrying out ''a war of
extermination in our settlements ordered by President Ernesto
Zedillo.''
</P>
<P>
   San Cristobal was the most prominent of the towns seized by the
Zapatista National Liberation Army on Jan. 1, 1994, when it shocked
Mexico by emerging from remote jungle communities to demand greater
Indian rights and to call for a Marxist-flavored sort of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas soon retreated from the town and open fighting
lasted only two weeks before a cease-fire took hold. But efforts to
reach a formal peace have been deadlocked since 1996 and Chiapas
state has seen repeated clashes between pro-government and
pro-rebel groups.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Bride Files for Divorce  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- TV's instant bride has filed for an annulment,
saying that her quickie marriage to a multimillionaire was a fraud
and that he never mentioned he had ''a history of problems'' with
women.
</P>
<P>
   Darva Conger said in court papers filed Tuesday that the
marriage was never consummated and she and Rick Rockwell barely saw
each other on their Caribbean honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither the contestants nor the show's producers seriously
contemplated creating a proper marriage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, 42, selected Conger, 34, from among 50 contestants on
the Fox TV special ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.'' They
married on the spot in Las Vegas during the Feb. 15 show, with more
than 22 million viewers tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not what I wanted, not what I expected. I've never felt
that trapped before,'' Conger said Wednesday night on CNN's ''Larry
King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew from their first kiss the marriage was a
mistake, but she went through with it out of a sense of obligation
-- and the dress was ''so big I couldn't run.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the smash ratings, Fox canceled a rebroadcast of the
show and swore off a sequel and similar program after it was
disclosed that a former fiancee took out a restraining order
against Rockwell in 1991 for allegedly hitting and threatening her.
He denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Conger said in court papers that Fox misrepresented Rockwell's
personality and background. Conger said she was unaware that
Rockwell ''had a history of problems with his prior girlfriends and
was the subject of at least one restraining order for threatening
and dangerous behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox declined to comment. Rockwell could not be reached for
comment because the home telephone number listed for him has been
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Conger had said after returning alone from her honeymoon that
she participated in the show on a lark.
</P>
<P>
   She said in court papers that the marriage was a ''mutual
mistake of fact and was entered into solely for an entertainment
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Conger and Rockwell both signed an agreement before the show
that they could annul the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Clark County has no residency requirements to file for an
annulment. It takes four to six weeks on average for an annulment
to be approved.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Eric Desjardins scored a power-play goal with
71 seconds left in overtime as the Philadelphia Flyers beat the
Tampa Bay Lightning 3-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Desjardins scored on a one-timer from the slot with Robert
Petrovicky in the penalty box for hooking.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros and John LeClair scored second-period goals as the
Flyers moved within six points of Atlantic Division-leading New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, who have dropped five straight, received a
standing ovation from the crowd of 17,004 after dominating the
first-period and taking a 2-0 lead on goals by Mike Sillinger and
Chris Gratton.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' physical play changed the momentum as goals by
Lindros and LeClair tied it after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Sillinger scored his 19th goal on Tampa Bay's first shot at 33
seconds of the first period. The Lightning, who outshot the Flyers
9-1 in the game's first 11 minutes, also got a power-play goal from
Gratton with 4:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the 12th time Tampa Bay has led after one period.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's league-leading power-play unit converted with
Lindros' 26th goal at 7:43 of the second. LeClair's 34th goal tied
it with just 4.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair has 26 goals and 42 points in 35 career games against
Tampa Bay. Mark Recchi, the NHL's assist leader with 55, set up all
three Flyers goals. He has six assists in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defenseman Jassen Cullimore left the game in the
second period with dizziness and did not return.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juwan Howard scored six of his 29 points in
overtime and the Washington Wizards beat the New York Knicks
118-113 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Howard scored the first six points of the overtime as the
Wizards posted their first two-game winning streak since December.
The game, the Wizards' third in three days, was originally
scheduled for Jan. 25, but was postponed by a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards hit a season-high 61 percent (46 of 75) from the
field and 83 percent from the free throw line (25 of 30).
</P>
<P>
   Washington sealed the victory with a 6-1 run in overtime. After
Howard made a layup to tie the score at 108, Rod Strickland made
two free throws to give Washington the lead for good, 110-108, with
1:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell made one free throw for the Knicks 21 seconds
later. But Strickland answered with a 10-foot jumper over the
outstretched arms of Patrick Ewing with 1:05 left for a 112-109
lead. New York never got closer than three points again.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond led Washington with 32 points, 16 of which came
in the first quarter. Strickland finished with 15 points and 10
assists, while Gerard King had 12 points and nine rebounds for the
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell led the Knicks with 33 points, while Ewing and Allan
Houston both added 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing dominated play inside, finishing with 16 rebounds before
fouling out in the final minute of overtime. Ewing missed 10
minutes due to foul problems and the Wizards often took advantage
of his absence.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led 53-52 at the half, but Washington used a 20-5
third-quarter run to take a 79-73 lead going into the final period.
The Knicks moved back in front in the second minute of the fourth
quarter, and the game remained tight the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards had two chances to win in the final 10 seconds of
regulation, but King and Richmond each missed 12-foot jumpers. New
York's Larry Johnson then missed a 3-point attempt as time expired
to force overtime with the score tied at 102.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Retool for Nov. Election  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore, party nominations
assured, reached out to John McCain's independent-minded primary
voters Wednesday, each man determined to capture the middle ground
where the battle for the White House will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore and Republican Bush also planned to replenish
their campaign treasuries, tinker with their senior staffs and
coordinate political operations with their national parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain tapped into a vein,'' Bush told The Associated
Press. ''The McCain supporters will hear my message of reform:
reforming schools, reforming the military, reforming the tax code,
and renewal, renewing the spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, the vice president invoked McCain's name more often
than President Clinton's. In a round of TV interviews, he twice
started a sentence, ''Like John McCain, I. ...'' And Gore, who
campaigned in Detroit, added to the week's schedule another two
stops in Michigan in an effort to convert the voters who handed
McCain his Feb. 22 primary victory there.
</P>
<P>
   Both nominees-in-waiting are scouring exit polls that validate
McCain's ability to draw Democrats, independents and first-time
Republican voters into the political process. In Republican
contests Tuesday, 60 percent of the independent voters backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where candidates were ranked by all voters on a
single ballot, McCain finished third overall to Gore and Bush. But
he was the top vote-getter among independents, securing more than
one-third of the total.
</P>
<P>
   His strength is the weakness of both Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   National polls suggest the two are virtually even among
independent voters. Bush held a wide lead over Gore in the category
a few months ago, and his slippage helps explain why his overall
lead in head-to-head matchups against the vice president has
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   One third of Americans see Bush as too conservative and about a
third see Gore as too liberal, most national polls say. The numbers
broke the same way Tuesday in California, the nation's biggest
general election prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bigger problem for Bush than Gore, but both of them are
going to have to focus on a broader constituency than they have so
far,'' said Al From, chairman of the moderate Democratic Leadership
Council.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, both candidates courted their party's most
active primary voters, who tend to be more liberal or conservative
than the average American.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested in a debate that he would require top military
leaders to accept gays serving openly in the military. He backed
off the remark, but Republicans plan to use it against him in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush allies are poised to accuse Gore of putting himself in
labor's pocket in exchange for its support in the primaries. They
will also compare Gore's call for universal health coverage to
Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed plan and criticize the vice
president's courtship of New York's controversial Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to hoard his money and stick to a moderate message
throughout the primaries, but scrapped the strategy when McCain
thumped him in New Hampshire. He seemed to lurch to the right,
visiting a staunch conservative university in South Carolina,
refusing to meet with a gay GOP activists group and fostering
informal ties with evangelical leader Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain fanning the flames, Bush lost the independent vote
by a 3-to-1 margin in some states.
</P>
<P>
   ''He obviously took a few hits, but it's all curable,'' said
Charlie Black, a GOP strategist and informal Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking that antidote, Bush is promising change, character and
compassion -- dubbed ''the three C's'' by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting McCain supporters, he is telling voters he reformed
schools, the civil justice system and welfare in Texas. He has
McCain's coalition in mind, too, when he attacks the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is touting his education proposals to appeal to a larger
pool of independents -- suburban voters who swing between the two
parties but don't participate in GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''While McCain voters are a priority, they're only one of
several groups of swing voters we'll be going after,'' said Bush
strategist Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for the same audience, Gore is promising to restrict
access to guns, protect the economy and save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates tinker with the messages, their operatives
are getting general election campaigns into shape:
</P>
<P>
   --The Republican National Committee and Democratic National
Committee are planning multimillion dollar ad campaigns to benefit
their nominees.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore is considering moving his campaign manager, Donna Brazile,
to the DNC to oversee the party. Bush plans to install an ally at
the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush's team in Austin was meeting with RNC officials this week
to discuss how the party is gearing up for the general election.
One topic: Opposition research on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --The RNC is polling to find Gore's vulnerabilities. A copy of
the polls, obtained by the AP, shows that voters are being asked
about his ''flip-flopping'' on abortion, his claim to have invented
the Internet and his involvement in questionable 1996 fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush plans to add heft to his senior team by bringing aboard
strategists with presidential campaign experience.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush plans to raise $10 million in the next few weeks to refill
his campaign coffers. Gore spent his money more prudently, but must
abide by spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   --As early as next month, Bush could begin airing ads aimed at
general election audiences.
</P>
<P>
   --Both campaigns plan to reduce their payrolls by shipping aides
to national party payrolls.

McCain Campaign Events Canceled
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain met with senior strategists and
major financial backers at his mountain cabin near Sedona, Ariz., and decided to
halt his presidential challenge against Texas Gov. George W. Bush for now, a
senior aide said. McCain campaign events in Colorado and Illinois were canceled.
Meanwhile, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of old foe Al Gore today as he
scripted his exit from the Democratic presidential campaign. Gore and Bush,
nominees-in-waiting, reached out to their defeated rivals and jabbed at one
another as they pivoted toward the general election.

Castro Attacks U.S. Immigration Laws
</SUBHEAD>

   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro assailed U.S. immigration
policies that he blames for the plight of Elian Gonzalez, a day before a major
U.S. federal court hearing in the months-long custody dispute over the
6-year-old boy. Speaking for the first time at one of the scores of mass
protests held here almost daily since Dec. 5, Castro described the Cuban
Adjustment Act as a ''monstrosity'' and said the law lures Cubans like Elian's
late mother to risk their lives and those of their children. The law, passed in
1966, allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay and apply for political
asylum.

services in return for U.S. support for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.

   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A 17-year-old computer hacker questioned by FBI agents
about February's crippling attacks on big Internet sites was charged today with
defacing an anti-drug Web page months before the spree. He allegedly used the
Internet name ''Coolio'' and defaced a Los Angeles Police Department anti-drug
Web site with pro-drug slogans and images, including one depicting Donald Duck
with a hypodermic syringe in his arm. Dennis Moran surrendered without incident
at his home in Wolfeboro and was charged as an adult with two counts of
unauthorized access to a computer system. Each charge carries up to 15 years in
prison. He was released on $5,000 bail.

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's biggest single employer,
the Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was built, has run out of orders and
notified its more than 1,700 workers Wednesday that they face unemployment in 90
days if no new contracts can be found. Harland and Wolff Shipbuilders says it is
facing serious trouble. The shipyard is trying to win a $632 million contract to
build the oceanliner Queen Mary II for Cunard. If the contract is not secured,
''then it's fairly clear ... that Harland and Wolff cannot see a way to continue
to trade,'' said East Belfast legislator Peter Robinson.

himself into bed, poured his own cereal and went out to play, each day passing
the body of his mother, who lay on the living room floor covered by a blanket
and crib mattress, authorities said. ''A few weeks ago ... he had heard his
mother fall and ... covered her up,'' Kent County Undersheriff Larry Stelma said
today. ''We are assuming that he thought she was sick or had fallen asleep.''
Authorities, alerted by concerned school officials, went to the family's

involved.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Coming off their most lopsided loss of the
season, the Trail Blazers were maybe even worse against the New Jersey Nets as
they played with a lack of energy and cohesiveness and lost 115-103 to the Nets
tonight. Portland fell behind for good less than six minutes into the first
quarter, trailed by 14 at halftime and by as many as 25 in the third quarter to
lose for the third time in four games. Stephon Marbury, playing with a
pass-first mentality, led New Jersey with 24 points, 13 assists and seven
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 107, Grizzlies 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Toni Kukoc
each scored 20 points to lead five 76ers in double figures in a
107-90 win over the Vancouver Grizzlies Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc's 20 points and nine assists were both his best since
coming to the 76ers in a midseason trade with Chicago. George Lynch
had 19 points and 10 rebounds, Theo Ratliff had 16 points and Matt
Geiger added 13 points for the Sixers, who have now won four in a
row and seven straight over Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Othella Harrington paced the Grizzlies with 20 points. Shareef
Abdur-Rahim added 17 points, Mike Bibby had 15 points and 10
assists, and Michael Dickerson had 13 points for Vancouver, which
has lost six in a row and is now just 1-7 against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers, who trailed by three at halftime, scored 22 of the
first 26 points of the third period, including 14 in a row, to open
up a 75-60 lead with 5:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   After a 3-pointer by Bibby, Philadelphia scored four more
points, capped by a fastbreak layup by Eric Snow, to open up a
16-point advantage. The Grizzlies turned the ball over seven times
in the first nine minutes of the quarter. Philadelphia's biggest
lead was 23 late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver made 12 of its first 19 shots and took a 32-16 lead
with 1:52 remaining in the first quarter. But the 76ers used a 23-8
run to pull within one, 40-39, with 7:38 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   During the spurt, Kukoc had seven points, including a
spectacular baseline spin move that got him past Doug West and
Abdur-Rahim. The Grizzlies led by three at the half.
</P>
<P>
NOTES: The 76ers had just four rebounds in the first quarter, a
team low and tying a floor record. ...Vancouver coach Lionel
Hollins made his first head coaching appearance in Philadelphia,
where he played from 1979-82. ...Philadelphia has beaten the
Grizzlies seven straight times, its longest win streak against any
team.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Arrives for Caribbean Tour  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- French President Jacques
Chirac arrived Wednesday for a tour of three Caribbean islands
clamoring for more autonomy as France prepares to redraw a
54-year-old law governing its relationship with far-flung former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The visit comes amid growing economic gloom and labor unrest on
the islands, where prices are some of the highest in the region and
unemployment tops 30 percent, caused in part by their ties to
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Massive state subsidies, including social security, keep the
814,000 islanders in Guadeloupe and Martinique better off than
their neighbors but totally dependent on the money flowing from
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac presides over the first Franco-Caribbean summit in
Guadeloupe on Friday, then goes to Martinique the next day before
heading to St. Martin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Ernest Moutousamy of Saint Francois in Guadeloupe
said the Caribbean nations are waiting to hear Chirac's position on
a new bill to replace a 1946 law that made the colonies ''overseas
departments,'' an integral part of France.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac so far has made no public pronouncement on the bill,
called the ''law of orientation,'' which does propose institutional
change but not as radical as many politicians here would like.
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, which gathers the 15 nations of the Caribbean
Community, Chirac will also discuss the preferential trade terms
under which the European Union imports goods and produce from its
former colonies, terms the World Trade Organization has ruled are
unfair in response to U.S. complaints.

<HEADLINE> Fla. 24 Vehicle Pileup Kills Three  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLBORN, Fla. (AP) -- Twenty-four cars and trucks slammed into
each other Wednesday in a pileup along a highway shrouded by
blinding smoke from a forest fire. Three people were killed and 21
injured, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand how I lived through that,'' said Erik
Gebauer, whose Mustang slid under a tractor-trailer. ''I felt death
right behind me. I can't believe I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the twisted wreckage, it took several hours for
authorities to determine how many vehicles were involved in the
accident on Interstate 10 about 90 miles east of Tallahassee in
northern Florida. At least five tractor-trailers could be seen
jackknifed in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were the driver of a pickup truck that caught fire; the
driver of a tractor-trailer; and a motorist who stopped to help and
was crushed when a load of plywood fell off a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people remained hospitalized Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the pileup, as salvage crews began pulling apart the
twisted wreckage, the full extent of the carnage could be seen.
Three vehicles were burned. Five tractor-trailers had jackknifed.
Cars had slid underneath trucks. A sport utility vehicle rested on
its side.
</P>
<P>
   The lone police car for the town of Jennings was crushed beneath
a tractor-trailer so tightly that when the truck was righted, it
also came off the ground. The officer was hospitalized in serious
condition with a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The low visibility was a result of the forest fire,'' Highway
Patrol Lt. Ken Knowles said.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke came from a 7,000-acre arson fire in Osceola National
Park, about 10 miles away. Visibility was further reduced when
three of the vehicles caught fire, and that caused more vehicles to
plow into the wreckage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really smokey -- you couldn't see but a few feet in
front of you,'' said trucker Richard Smith, who was heading east to
Jacksonville and able to stop safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could hear popping and snapping,'' he said. ''I couldn't
believe it. First time I have ever seen anything this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen miles of highway were closed after the 8 a.m.
chain-reaction accident.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, eight people were killed and five were injured
in Nevada when a van skidded across an interstate highway, plunged
down a steep highway median and flipped over several times. The van
was carrying 13 passengers toward Las Vegas when it rolled over
about 30 miles south of the city.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 3, Stars 3, tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Alexander Mogilny's rebound with 9:41 left in
regulation capped a two-goal comeback and gave the Vancouver
Canucks a 3-3 tie with the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny scored his 19th goal, tucking a loose puck past Dallas
backup goalie Manny Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez got the start in place of Ed Belfour, who was in
police custody earlier in the day following a scuffle with a local
hotel security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a 7-0 shots advantage in the overtime, but the Stars'
best scoring chance by Jamie Langenbrunner from the slot with 30
seconds left was stopped by Garth Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cassels and Harold Druken also scored for the Canucks,
making a late bid for a playoff spot. Vancouver is 6-2-3-1 in its
last 12 games to move into position to challenge for eighth place
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks denied Stars coach Ken Hitchcock his 200th NHL
victory. Hitchcock, who coached his 355th game, is trying to become
the fourth-fastest to reach the milestone in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, a key contributor in the Stars' run to league title
last season, spent more than six hours under arrest Wednesday
morning. He was charged with assault and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was not scheduled to start, but was expected to be
available as Fernandez's backup. Belfour was scratched from the
lineup and was not at the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Marty Turco was recalled up from Michigan of the
International Hockey League and served as the No. 2 goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Center Guy Carbonneau, out with a hairline fracture of his right
wrist, was placed on injured reserve to make room on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Marshall's power-play goal at 18:16 of the first pinballed
in off the stick of defenseman Chris Joseph and gave Dallas a 2-1
lead. Referee Lance Roberts consulted video replay before ruling
that Marshall scored his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull and Jon Sim also scored for the Stars. Hull has 606
career goals, four behind his father, Bobby, for eighth place in
NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took a 3-1 lead into the third period, but Vancouver made
it a one-goal game at 1:19 by catching Fernandez out of position.
Fernandez roamed out of his crease to play the puck and Harold
Druken took advantage by firing his fourth goal into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks thought they had tied it with 17:41 left, but after
another replay review, Trent Klatt's goal was disallowed because
Markus Naslund interfered with Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's 20th goal at 9:30 of the first gave Dallas a 1-0 lead and
gave Hull his 13th consecutive season with at least 20 goals.

<HEADLINE> Gore Stops for Senate Vote  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore abruptly cut short a
Midwest campaign swing late Wednesday so he could be on hand for a
potentially tie-breaking vote in the Senate, which was holding
confirmation votes on two of President Clinton's long-stalled
judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was at an open meeting with undecided Michigan voters when
he learned that Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had
requested his presence in Washington for the Thursday afternoon
vote on Richard Paez to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, press secretary for Gore's presidential campaign,
said Daschle telephoned Gore's White House office on Wednesday
evening to say he ''anticipated a very, very close vote'' on Paez
and to request that the vice president be on hand. Gore is
president of the Senate and break tie votes.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, was first
nominated by President Clinton more than four years ago and he has
been in limbo longer than any judge-nominee in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore considered it to be ''a very, very critical
nomination'' and ''a vote that's very important to Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate conservatives have blocked action on Paez and Marsha
Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer also nominated to the 9th Circuit,
claiming they are too liberal and would add to the activist
tendencies of the court, which covers California and wide areas of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Berzon's nomination also was on the Senate schedule for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Detroit appearance, Gore was to continue on to
Minneapolis, where on Thursday he was to accept the formal
endorsement of former Vice President Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Julie Green said Gore now plans to arrive
in Minnesota on Friday night and stay until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the second time that Gore interrupted his
campaigning to seize an opportunity to thwart the Senate Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, the day after winning the New Hampshire primary, Gore
raced back to Washington on a commercial flight from New York for a
vote on violence at abortion clinics. But in the end, Republicans
voted with Democrats and denied Gore the chance to make a stand on
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Zhitnik Injures Finger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Alexei Zhitnik's tough season took a turn
for the worse when the Buffalo Sabres defenseman sustained a
possible broken finger Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik was injured during his first shift in the third period
of the Sabres' 2-1 overtime win over the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said the finger is either cracked or
broken, but that Zhitnik would only miss one day.
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik has struggled this year. After recording 33 or more
points in each of his last four seasons, he has only two goals and
12 points this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres can't afford to lose anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Michael Peca might be out for the rest of the regular
season with a dislocated shoulder, sustained in Sunday's 2-1 loss
at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Geoff Sanderson has missed three games with a knee
sprain while Michal Grosek just returned after being sidelined four
games with a groin strain.

<HEADLINE> Castro Attacks U.S. Laws Over Elian  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro assailed U.S.
immigration policies that he blames for the plight of Elian
Gonzalez on Thursday, a day before a major U.S. federal court
hearing in the months-long custody dispute over the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the first time at one of the scores of mass
protests held here almost daily since Dec. 5, Castro described the
Cuban Adjustment Act as a ''monstrosity'' that lures Cubans like
Elian's late mother to risk the lives of themselves and their
children by undertaking the risky journey across the Florida
Straits.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many lives has this law cost our nation? How many lives of
innocent children pulled out of school by mothers or fathers who
are irresponsible or tricked by illusions,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The law, passed in 1966, allows Cubans who reach American soil
to stay and apply for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was still 5 when he was rescued at sea by fishermen who
found him lashed to an inner tube floating off the coast of South
Florida on Nov. 25. The boy's mother and her boyfriend were among
11 people who perished when the boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   Only Elian and two adults survived. All three were allowed to
remain in the United States under the law, but Elian immediately
became enmeshed in a custody battle between his father, who wants
the child returned to him in Cuba, and his parental great-uncle,
who is fighting to keep the child in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban authorities say the act contradicts migration accords
signed with the United States in 1994 and 1995, which are aimed at
stopping illegal departures and encouraging legal and orderly
movement between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreements, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriates most
Cubans picked up at sea and a minimum of 20,000 American visas are
provided annually to those wishing to immigrate legally to the
United States. The Cuban government is to work to prevent illegal
departures from the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will Elian's return to Cuba mean if every day at least
four children leave or 34 every week who run the same risks -- or
worse?'' Castro said, addressing about 1,500 members of the
Federation of Cuban Women as the group wrapped up its 7th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has taken on impassioned and often ugly ideological
overtones that underscore the differences separating Cubans in the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in early January
ordered that Elian be returned to his father in Cuba -- a decision
backed by President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But the order was put on hold pending legal attempts by Elian's
Miami relatives to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At issue now is a federal lawsuit filed by Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez seeking political asylum for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government argues that the child is too young to seek
political asylum, and notes that the INS earlier ruled that only
his father is capable of speaking for Elian on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore is to hear arguments in the
case Thursday and afterward can decide whether to intervene in the
earlier INS decision or let it stand.

<HEADLINE> Man Allegedly Stabs Father  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- A man stabbed his 76-year-old father to
death Wednesday, then chased his 75-year-old mother to a nearby
elementary school and stabbed her in the arm, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Bridgeford, 37, of Urbana was arrested at Westview
Elementary School after being subdued and disarmed by the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred just inside the school near an office.
Champaign school Superintendent Mike Cain said no pupils saw the
woman, who volunteered at the school, or the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Students were kept in their classrooms as required by the
school's crisis plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God they weren't out on lunch,'' Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeford's father was found dead inside the family home,
police said. His mother was in fair condition. The victims' names
were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeford was in custody Wednesday night in the Champaign
County Jail on preliminary charges of homicide and attempted
homicide. He was scheduled for arraignment Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Quit, McCain May Be Next  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain intends to halt his
presidential campaign Thursday, conceding that George W. Bush has a
stranglehold on the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday
voting, two campaigns aides said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Bill Bradley readied an endorsement of
old foe Al Gore as he scripted his Thursday exit from the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not expected to endorse Bush, and it was unclear
whether the Arizona senator would end his campaign entirely, or
simply suspend his candidacy to preserve his options. At least one
senior adviser, John Weaver, has urged McCain to consider launching
a third-party bid, but his staff believes that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   One senior aide said he would halt the campaign. Another said
McCain would quit outright. Both spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nominees-in-waiting, reached
out to their defeated rivals and jabbed at one another as they
pivoted toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush labeled the vice president ''an agent of Washington,'' and
Gore returned the insult, saying Bush was too cozy with the
''extreme right'' as personified by the National Rifle Association
and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   McCain huddled with senior strategists and major financial
backers at his mountain cabin here to assess the situation.
Campaign events in Colorado and Illinois were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scheduled a news conference for noon EST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of McCain's senior aides have been urging him to withdraw,
saying Bush has built an almost impossible lead in the delegate
count. Weaver suggested that McCain could be ''pushed'' into
running as a third-party candidate -- a remark Bush supporters
viewed as an attempt to gain leverage as McCain seeks to extract
promises from Bush in exchange for an endorsement. McCain has said
his campaign finance crusade would continue even if his candidacy
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said there was no campaign schedule after Thursday's
announcement, except for an off-the-record barbecue with
journalists at McCain's rustic cabin near Sedona. Reporters were
told they would be dispatched to Phoenix at the end of the day --
without McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For both Bradley and McCain, the day was spent reflecting Super
Tuesday defeats that effectively ended their hopes of winning the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were urging McCain to quit. Key to the decision, they said, was
finding a way to effectively push McCain's campaign themes of
broadening the party's base and overhauling reforming campaign
finances.
</P>
<P>
   A list of options had been prepared for McCain's meetings
Wednesday. These included staying in the race to further his
political reform agenda, getting out and supporting the GOP ticket,
and leaving to mount a third-party bid. McCain has said previously
he would not leave the GOP, and by day's end one adviser said a
third-party bid had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said there had been discussions about how to
ease McCain's return to the Senate after a campaign in which he
often attacked his own party as beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bradley, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the former New Jersey senator would announce his withdrawal on
Thursday and throw his support to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, plans to stay active in public life and is not
expected to rule out another presidential run, the advisers said.
They also said he has no interest in the vice presidential spot on
the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gore was thinking along those lines. One senior adviser
to the vice president, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that Bradley had not won any contests in his quest for the
nomination and Gore would want someone on the ticket who had
demonstrated an ability to carry a state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bradley as a running mate, Gore said in Nashville,
Tenn.: ''I'm not drawing up a list -- short, long or in between. It
is just too early.'' But he credited Bradley, whom he had attacked
repeatedly in debates and advertising when the nomination was at
risk, for prompting ''a very constructive and healthy debate,''
especially on health reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appealed to McCain's desire, often stated on the
campaign, to deny Gore the White House. ''I would say, 'John, let's
team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore,'' the governor said. He
hastened to add he wasn't extending an offer of the vice
presidential spot on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign was at a pivotal point, but there were
still primaries to come, and both Bush and Gore continued to seek
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had Michigan on his itinerary for the day, which chooses
Democratic delegates Saturday. At the same time, given the collapse
of Bradley's candidacy, the vice president's aides decided to pull
back $500,000 in TV advertising that had been slated for Southern
states with March 14 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set stops Thursday in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, where
delegates will be picked in primaries and caucuses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the virtual nationwide primary on Tuesday, the AP delegate
count showed Gore with 1,424 delegates, to 412 for Bradley, out of
2,170 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, it was 617 for Bush to 231 for McCain, with
1,034 needed to nominate. Those numbers told the hopelessness of
McCain's position. An additional 91 delegates are stake in Western
states on Saturday, and 351 more on March 14 in states across the
South, the part of the country where Bush is strongest.

<HEADLINE> Gerber, J&AMP;J Go Head to Head  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The king of baby food is taking on the giant of
baby care.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and Johnson &AMP; Johnson -- the two most recognized names in
baby needs -- are going head to head for the first time today as
Gerber Products Co. launches a line of powders, oils and other
toiletries for infants and toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Summit, N.J.-based Gerber has developed 14 new baby
products, including shampoos, diaper rash ointment and vitamin
drops. The most unique items in Gerber's new assortment are an
apple-banana flavored tooth and gum cleaner and a lavender-scented
baby wash.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber officials say they have high expectations for the
products because of their strong brand recognition. Gerber, which
began selling baby food in 1928, controls about 75 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the most trusted brand name going,'' said Frank
Palantoni, Gerber's president and chief executive officer. ''We
almost owe it to our customers to give them new products.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerber's products will cost slightly less than J&AMP;J's. For
example, Gerber's 15 ounce baby powder is priced at $3, compared to
$3.29 for Johnson's baby powder, which holds 57 percent of the
market, according to Information Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber's new products, which began rolling out in February,
should be in most pharmacies and grocers nationwide by the end of
this month, when the company plans to kick off its advertising
campaign. In addition to television and print ads, the company
plans a big direct marketing effort that will offer coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts say it's wise for Gerber, a subsidiary of
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, to try to leverage its brand
to other types of baby goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gerber has a really well established name connected to
babies,'' said Roland Rust, professor of marketing at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn. ''So they stand a really good chance
of making it work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rust said New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&AMP;J, can control product
placement on store shelves and can fight back to limit Gerber's
visibility. And J&AMP;J has the edge because consumers know exactly
what they're getting with its skin care goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers may trust the Gerber brand in general, but they are
still not sure what they are buying'' with Gerber's new products,''
Rust said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Gerber has ventured out of the food
aisle. The company also sells baby furniture such as guard rails
and it licenses a line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;J officials refused to comment on Gerber's move.

<HEADLINE> Shell Test Markets Robotic Gas Pump  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTFIELD, Ind. (AP) -- A robotic fuel pump being test-marketed
in this Indianapolis suburb just might be the future of petrol
pumping, an independent trade association said. But its
introduction could hardly be more ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Oil Co. is test marketing the computerized pumps in this
affluent Indianapolis suburb starting this month -- and plans to
charge an extra $1 per fill-up -- just as gasoline prices hit
historic highs, and the end of winter removes a big incentive for
staying snugly behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Fully-automatic fueling could eventually become as popular as
pay-at-pump systems that allow drivers to swipe a credit card or
wave an electronic keychain before filling up themselves, Tom
Osborne, spokesman for the Society of Independent Gasoline
Marketers of America, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, at present prices, it's not economically
feasible,'' Osborne said. ''Once the bugs are worked out and it is
mass produced, we think it is more than a passing phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shell project manager Jerry Buri said Wednesday that more
than 1,000 customers have already signed up to use the pumps in the
handful of stations where they will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we're looking at the system being a more popular
product in bad weather conditions because people would be more
inclined to want to stay in their car then,'' he said. ''The other
features would still make it advantageous.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a mother wouldn't have to leave her children alone
in the car while she pumped gas. Patrons wouldn't be exposed to gas
fumes or risk spillage.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies, including Exxon Mobil, are
experimenting with different versions of robotic systems, Osborne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Oil and HR Textron spent eight years developing the
SmartPump, which uses a combination of cameras, sensors, computer
technology and robotics to guide the fuel pump into a vehicle's gas
tank.
</P>
<P>
   First a motorist places a coded computer chip containing vehicle
information on the windshield. The car must also be equipped with a
special, spring-loaded gas cap, which costs $20.
</P>
<P>
   As the driver approaches the SmartPump, sensors read the
computer chip and let the robotic arm know what type of car to
fuel. The motorist then drives up to the terminal, which adjusts to
the height of the driver's window, swipes a credit card and selects
the preferred fuel grade.
</P>
<P>
   The robotic arm then gets to work. A soft, suction-like device
extends and opens the gas tank's door and the pump enters the tank
and begins fueling. A fillup is the only option available.
</P>
<P>
   Some motorists remained wary Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Krakora, an electrical engineer who has worked with robots,
doesn't trust the SmartPump to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way. I ain't gonna scratch this baby,'' Krakora said,
patting his sport-utility vehicle. ''I've seen robots go wild, it
could go through my windshield. It's just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell's Buri said the soft, flexible extensions on the robotic
arm make scratches unlikely, and most patrons are more accepting of
the technology after they learn about it.
</P>
<P>
   Paulette Jones, a saleswoman who filled up at a regular gas pump
Wednesday, said she signed up for SmartPump and looks forward to
using it when the weather turns cold again.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the wintertime it's great if I don't have to get out of
the vehicle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buri said Shell plans to install SmartPumps at two other
Indianapolis-area locations before expanding in the city and other
markets. He would not specify when the technology would be
introduced in other cities.

<HEADLINE> New Volatility in Agitated Market  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock market volatility may send speculators
rushing from one sector to another in search of the 'next big
thing.' But financial advisors who cater to small investors are
urging their clients to tune out the latest market gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term investors who stick to the old fashioned ''buy and
hold'' method will be just fine, say these pros.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility is ''always a curse'' because it frequently causes
investors to make rash decisions, said John Markese, president of
the American Association of Individual Investors.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who are saving for their retirements or their
children's' college funds should ignore temporary market
fluctuations, he said, reiterating advice that's often heard from
experts during turbulent times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard not to look at those headlines, but it's a
mistake,'' he said. ''Day to day, week to week, month to month,
even year to year volatility is irrelevant to the long-term
investor.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest market swings were prompted by consumer products
maker Proctor &AMP; Gamble, a component of the Dow Jones industrial
average, which announced on Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings
growth would fall below Wall Street analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted immediately, dumping shares of P&AMP;G and shaving
374 points from the benchmark Dow index.
</P>
<P>
   Market observers said the bad news from the old line company
provided justification for participants in the current technology
stock frenzy. Moreover, it helped exacerbate a widening chasm
between so-called 'old economy' stocks which dominate the Dow Jones
index, and the 'new economy' tech stocks that comprise much of the
Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Dow is down nearly 15 percent, while the
Nasdaq has risen about 20 percent. Stocks swung wildly between
positive and negative territory Wednesday before closing mostly
higher. The Dow finished up 60.50 to close at 9,856.53. The Nasdaq
closed up 49.42 at 4,897.26.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors said Wednesday they have learned to take in
stride the media cacophony that inevitably follows a large market
dip or upswing.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Burrows, 48, an insurance and health care administrator
in Chicago, said he isn't selling or switching any of his mutual
funds, but added to his portfolio of technology shares Wednesday,
saying all of his new investments are going into that sector.
</P>
<P>
   Burrows said he isn't down on blue chips over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who are in blue chips should ride it out. If they're
going to sink, the whole economic structure's going to sink,''
Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wheeler, 41, a retail manager in Atlanta, said she owns
both older blue chip stocks and newer technology companies, and has
no plans to concentrate exclusively on one sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a wait-and-see kind of person,'' she said. ''I don't see
the sky falling. Corrections take place from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Fleming, 41, a Chicago lawyer, has a shorter view of the
market, but also hedges his bets.
</P>
<P>
   He headed an investment office Wednesday to sell two mutual
funds that are geared to the Dow and invest in high-tech funds
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to ride the wave while the wave's going,'' he said
of tech stocks. ''Sure, they'll fall eventually. But it could be a
long while yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, however, isn't getting entirely out of blue chips. His
retirement fund is still evenly split between those old-fashioned
stocks and technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Wall Street observers note that volatility is relative.
</P>
<P>
   The 374 point decline in Dow stocks on Tuesday was the fourth
largest ever. But since the Dow has advanced so rapidly in recent
years, the drop didn't even register in the top 100 in terms of
percentage declines.
</P>
<P>
   Markese said volatility was much worse in late 1987, when the
Dow hovered in the 2,200 range. So when the Dow index dropped more
than 500 points in October of that year, the loss represented
nearly 25 percent of its total value, a substantial figure.
</P>
<P>
   Still concern is rising that exists that stocks -- especially
high flying tech stocks -- are poised for an extended fall.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parks, a longtime Wall Street economist, author and
finance professor at Pace University in New York, said if the
Federal Reserve succeeds in slowing down the U.S. economy by
raising interest rates, technology stocks will feel the sting
because investor faith in many of those stocks isn't strong.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in tech stock prices has been fueled primarily by
so-called momentum investors who are merely riding a successful
wave, according to Parks. ''But when people realize that all
bubbles burst, the momentum that has driven these stocks up will
reverse overnight,'' he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Money Laundering Focus Shifts  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to crack down on money laundering, the
government has identified several ''high-intensity zones'' for
increased law enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of federal, state and local authorities will be formed in
these areas identified by the Treasury Department as: Los Angeles;
New York City and northern New Jersey; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and
the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   Police forces and local prosecutors will be trained in detecting
money laundering, a new activity for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Other geographic areas or industry sectors are expected to be
named in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money laundering is a growing threat to the United States,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday at a news
conference. ''It undermines confidence in the integrity of our
financial systems, facilitates crime and corruption, and allows
criminals to savor the rewards of their illegal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, deputy attorney general of the Justice Department,
called the administration's new money-laundering strategy ''a
highly ambitious and far-reaching agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat was testifying on the plan today at a hearing of the
House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, seeking to stem the flow through
U.S. banks of billions of dollars from drug trafficking and other
illegal activities, also is seeking new powers from Congress to
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer,
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative proposal outlined last week by Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers would give the government the authority to ban
financial transactions between offshore financial havens and U.S.
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody needs to come out of the closet and expose them for
what they are,'' said convicted former money launderer Kenneth
Rijock, referring to island nations in the Caribbean that are
havens of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's financial terrorism,'' he said in an interview this week.
A former Miami lawyer who did two years in federal prison, Rijock
explained in an Associated Press story in September how he used to
fly from Florida into islands such as Anguilla and easily deposit
millions of drug dollars into a dummy corporation's local bank
account. Sometimes he and his cohorts used rubber stamps of cartoon
characters as signatures on deposit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying at today's hearing was Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who has criticized the administration's plan as
insufficient because it gives the Treasury Department discretion to
decide whether to take action, rather than requiring it. Schumer
and Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of the House Banking Committee like the
administration's proposal so much they have said they would
co-sponsor it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and the
panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, proposed a
stricter measure that would have required U.S. banks to collect
detailed information on their customers from countries considered
to be money-laundering havens. The administration's proposal would
leave it up to Treasury to decide whether to impose data-collecting
requirements on banks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new strategy, the government is:
</P>
<P>
   --Putting new rules into effect that eventually will require
storefront check cashers and money transmitters, brokerage firms
and casinos to notify authorities of suspicious transactions, as
banks now must do.
</P>
<P>
   --Making some $2.5 million this year in grants to state and local
law enforcement agencies and prosecutors' offices to help them
fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is estimated to absorb nearly $600 billion
annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and other criminal
activities are moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts
to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
