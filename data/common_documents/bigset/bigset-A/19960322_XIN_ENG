<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Russian delegation
is now in Libya to discuss trade and economic ties with Libyan
officials, Libya's official news agency JANA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Libya Thursday night. It was led by
Oleg Davydov, Russia's deputy prime minister and minister for
foreign economic relations, JANA said.
</P>
<P>
Davydov met Thursday night with Libya's Foreign Secretary, Omar
el-Muntasser, and the secretaries of economy and energy, JANA
added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides mainly discussed bilateral trade and ways of
strengthening ties for the joint benefit of both friendly peoples,
JANA noted.
</P>
<P>
Davydov's visit came when the United States, Britain and France
called for tightening enforcement of the sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has agreed to maintain the sanctions
for another 120 days.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed diplomatic sanctions, a ban on air travel
and an arms embargo on Libya in April 1992 after the government
refused to extradite two Libyan suspects in the case. The
sanctions were tightened in 1994 to include a freeze on some
foreign assets and a ban on the sale of oil equipment.

<HEADLINE> New Treatment Keeps New York TB Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A New York public health
official announced today that New York city recorded 2,445 new
tuberculosis cases in 1995, down 18.4 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
This marked the third consecutive drop in new cases following a
14-year increase in the largest commercial city in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the United Nations
Headquarters, Thomas R. Frieden, Director of New York TB Control
Bureau, said that the decrease in TB case cut down hospitalization
costs in the city by more than 40 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The press conference is held in connection with the observation
the world tuberculosis day.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fall in TB cases to the adoption of the
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT), a treatment under which
health-care workers observe patients taking their anti-TB
medications.
</P>
<P>
Frieden told reporters that New York city witnessed a sharp
rise in TB patients in early 90s due to the widespread of aids
epidemic, social contact with homeless and prisoners and inflow of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city's TB rate is 33.4 cases per 100,000
people, and foreign-born patients accounted for approximately 40
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1995, he added, the number of TB patients born
in the country fell nearly 60 percent, while cases among the
foreign-born shot up by 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Bans on UK Beef not Justified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The bans declared by some European
countries on importing British beef to protect their people from
contracting a fatal brain disease are not justified by scientific
evidence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of existing scientific evidence about "mad cow
disease", the risks of people contracting its human equivalent
from eating beef were remote, said the U.N. health agency.
</P>
<P>
"The chance of humans becoming contaminated is absolutely
remote," said Dr Lindsay Martinez, of WHO's division of emerging
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Martinez made the remarks at a news conference in response to
growing European fears of British beef and announcement on
Thursday of bans on importation by France, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Sweden and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
So far, at least 13 countries around the world, including 11
European Union countries have announced bans on the importation of
British beef and cattle.
</P>
<P>
The fears followed the British government's announcement on
Wednesday of a suspected link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, so-called "mad cow disease", and its human
equivalent, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD),
which has killed 10 young people so far.
</P>
<P>
Standard strain of CJD, which affects the brain and the nervous
system, causes infection of about one person, mainly the elderly,
among a million.
</P>
<P>
Martinez said British sanitary measures introduced in 1989 had
led to a recent decline in cases of "mad cow disease" among
British cows and consequently had minimized any risk to humans.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that the 10 reported case of CJD were contracted
before 1989, she added.

<P>
TUNIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. special aid to Africa,
which U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali has recently
declared, is a ten-year program aimed mainly at boosting
development in the poverty-stricken continent.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here today by Balrozoq Mohammed,
African representative at the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), in
a joint press conference with some other representatives of a
number of U.N.-affiliated organizations here.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. initiative, the first of its kind that involves 25
billion U.S. dollars in funds, will contribute to the development
of Africa, which faces several obstacle due to civil wars,
overpopulation, and economic recession in most of the African
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Only a few of the African countries witnessed economic revival
with annual economic growth rate exceeding six percent, Mohammed
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. initiative focuses on the health and education sectors
with all of the U.N.-affiliated organizations and the World Bank
taking part, he said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve desired development in the continent, the aid
program will promote the peace efforts, settle internal disputes
and facilitate national reconciliation, and boost foreign support
through writing off some of Africa's external debts.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed pointed out that the African debts constitute a big
obstacle in the way of the African development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. project aims also at making available basic education
for the new generations in Africa and providing them with proper
job opportunities to combat poverty, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. plan provides for a multilateral participation of
government and non-government organizations in the implementation
of the 25-billion-dollar plan.

HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU (PF)

JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Safety and

</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, Mufamadi said a government

public places throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said a total of 74 magisterial districts in South
Africa had been identified as the areas in which violent crimes

<HEADLINE> China: Removing Political Disruptions Priority for  Talks on China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China said Friday for talks on its
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the priority is
to remove political disruptions and put it back into the normal
track of international economic and trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the top priority at this date for China's
accession is to keep political interference of all kinds out of
this process and put the accession negotiation back into the
normal track of international economic and trade negotiations",
said Chinese chief negotiator Long Yongtu Friday morning at the
WTO headquarters in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Long, also China's Assistant Minister of trade, made the
statement at the first formal session of the WTO working party on
China's accession since WTO replaced the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT) last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 9-year delay in the negotiation, Long noted, China's
policy in participating in the multilateral trading system does
not change, and will not either.
</P>
<P>
"China's application for resuming its status in GATT and
proceeding to WTO is an integral part of China's general policy of
opening up and reforms", he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Long said, it should be recognized that the opening
of the market in China, like that in all other countries, is an
evolution process that ought to be compatible with the development
levels of China.
</P>
<P>
Long stressed that the international rules China will observe
can only be those contained in the Uruguay Round Agreement signed
by all participants and any additional conditions of
discriminatory nature will just be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
An outsider of GATT, China had actively participated in the
whole process of the Uruguay Round negotiation and signed the
final documents, Long pointed out, saying this reflects a solemn
commitment of the Chinese government to abide by international
trade regulations and a strong support to the multilateral trading
system.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, over recent years China has made enormous
efforts in further opening its market, such as cutting tariffs,
reducing non-tariff measures and liberalizing the service sector.
All the ever efforts, according to Long, can justify China's entry
into WTO.
</P>
<P>
Long regarded it unpopular to deliberately keep China outside
WTO, which he said will harm the universality and impartiality of
the multilateral trading system as well as the economic good of
all.
</P>
<P>
It is agreed that the inclusion of such a dynamic economy as
China in the multilateral trading system will contribute
significantly to the stable growth of the world economy as well as
the strengthening of the multilateral trading system, Long noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese chief negotiator made clear that the accession of
China and other economies to WTO is an important component of the
historic process of world economic integration. "it requires both
political will and economic vision to push forward this process",
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the session, a number of WTO member states expressed their
support for China's early entry into WTO. In a summing-up,
Pierre-Louis Girard, chairman of the WTO working group on China's
accession, said:
</P>
<P>
"There is much work to be done. But following our discussions
in 1995 and earlier this week, it seems to me that now is a good
time to reorient our approach and to give new impetus to China's
accession negotiations."

<HEADLINE> City's Maritime Earnings Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The City's earnings from
maritime-related services, such as ship-broking, legal services
and banking, fell sharply in the decade to 1994, according to a
study published Thursday by the Chamber of Shipping.
</P>
<P>
Total maritime services earnings, including those from the
troubled Lloyd's insurance market, fell from 1.28 billion pounds
(2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1984 to 980 million pounds (1.5
billion U.S. dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
This represented a decline of 600 million pounds (918 million
U.S. dollars) or 53 percent in real terms, after excluding the
impact of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Even assuming that Lloyd's earnings recovered to their 1984
level, which would produce 1994 earnings figure of about 1.3
billion pounds (2 billion U.S. dollars), that still would
represent a decline of 37 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The fall reflected the decline in the UK merchant fleet. The
chamber, which represents British ship owners and managers, has
been campaigning for greater government support for the UK
merchant fleet in the form of tax breaks and help with financing
training for seafarers.
</P>
<P>
The financial services sector, including banks, finance
companies and equity providers, suffered the sharpest decline.
</P>
<P>
Financial services earnings fell from 387 million pounds (592
million U.S. dollars) in 1984 to 156 million pounds (239 million
U.S. dollars) 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
The most marked falls occurred in the fields of ship mortgage
loans, down from 275 million pounds (421 million U.S. dollars) to
74 million pounds (113 million U. S. dollars).

<P>
LUANDA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of tuberculosis
patients in Angola is expected to grow to 3.5 million in the next
decade, if the country does not take effectively preventive
measures.

Association in a document released here today just before the

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate, following on
the heels of the House, approved a non-binding resolution Thursday
evening, "deploring" China's military exercises near Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The house resolution, passed earlier this week, has been
condemned by Beijing as "a serious encroachment upon China's
sovereignty and a gross interference in China's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The Senate resolution asked President Clinton to "re-examine"
Taiwan's defense needs, but avoided the language contained in
the House resolution, which wantonly claims that the U.S. should
come to Taiwan's defense in case of attack, invasion or blockade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressional actions, taken at the present sensitive
time, are seen to serve only to intensify the tensions across the
Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Exports to Reach 3 Billion Dollars in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government estimates
that Yugoslavia's exports will reach the value of about 3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The estimate of the export value was based on an expected
production increase of at least 20 percent, Serbian Minister and
President of the Serbian government Economic Recovery Central
Coordination Team Dragan Tomic said in an interview with Belgrade
daily Politika Ekspres which was published today.
</P>
<P>
Tomic said that a number of important inter-state arrangements
worth about 1 billion dollars had been made and that protocols on
economic cooperation had been signed with a large number of
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the suspension of U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia last
November, the companies in the country have been trying to export
their products to foreign countries to earn hard currency badly
needed by the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that banks would direct the majority of funds
towards production, securing more working assets for the
export-oriented companies, but banks will have to constantly
adjust to market conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Yugoslav parliament would hold a session
in April, at which the most important systemic laws should be
adopted, such as the laws on enterprises and labour relations.
</P>
<P>
Preparations were being made for law amendments which would be
more favorable for foreign investors, he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Denmark for Allowing Meeting of Kurdish Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry
today lodged a protest against Denmark for not stopping the
so-called "Kurdish Parliament-in-Exile" to hold a meeting in
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Danish Ambassador to Ankara Niels Helskov was summoned to the
foreign ministry and was given a note of protest against the
Danish government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Kurdish Parliament-in-Exile in Copenhagen
held on March 11 has cast its shadow over the bilateral ties
between Turkey and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel said last week
that the negative results would appear in the bilateral
relations between the two countries as Denmark did not ban the
meeting of the Kurdish parliament-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
However, Denmark replied that the convention of such a
meeting did not require the permission of the government.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains that the Kurdish Parliament-in-Exile is the
arm of the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Over 20,000 people have been killed in the armed clashes
between the Turkish government security forces and the PKK
rebels since the PKK started to fight for independence in
southeastern Turkey in 1984.

<HEADLINE> UK Beef Industry in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's cattle industry has been
plunged into crisis after British scientists said on Wednesday
that they had discovered a likely link between the mad cow disease
and its lethal human equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Eleven foreign countries have so far imposed bans on imports of
British beef and more countries are considering to do so,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
On the home markets, beef prices have slumped by 15 per cent,
and many schools have banned beef from their canteens.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Association, Britain's main consumer group, has
told people to stop eating beef, and a leading food retailer has
said it may have to buy beef from abroad for the first time in its
150-year history.
</P>
<P>
The British government admitted on Thursday that it was
considering mass slaughter of 11 million cattle to tackle the
problem and restore public confidence.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the slaughter could cost the government an
estimated 20 billion pounds (30 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
British beef industry is worth two billion pounds (three
billion US dollars) a year and employs about 350,000 people
directly and indirectly.
</P>
<P>
It exported some 240,000 tons of beef last year, including
nearly 100,000 tons to France.

STOCKHOLM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Goran Persson was sworn in as
Sweden's new prime minister this morning after Monday's
resignation of Ingvar Carlsson.
</P>
<P>
He announced minor changes in the cabinet, with the job of
finance minister, a post Persson held before his appointment, going
to Erik Asbrink and former Minister of Culture Margot Wallstrom
becoming the new minister of health and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
Persson stressed in his announcement the importance of economic
restructuring and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
He said the primary target of the new government is to bring
down unemployment. He promised to cut the jobless rate by half by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Persson, who was elected chief of the ruling Social Democratic
Party (SDP) last Friday, was appointed as prime minister after
Carlsson announced his retirement after 10 years as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
By convention, the head of the ruling party also assumes the
position of the head of government in Sweden. Carlsson resigned
as chairman of the SDP last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Persson's new government doesn't enjoy an absolute majority in
parliament. His SDP has 161 of parliament's 349 seats.

<HEADLINE> EU to Decide on Banning British Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the European
Union (EU) has defended member countries who have banned
imports of British beef due to the "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
Britain has claimed that decisions by some EU countries to stop
importing British beef break European trade laws.
</P>
<P>
But EU deputy spokesman Vale de Almeida told a press briefing
that the EU will judge the legality of the restrictions soon.
</P>
<P>
France, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands have decided to
halt imports of British beef and all related products for the time
being after the British government admitted that "mad cow"
disease, a fatal brain disease formally known as Bovine Spongiform
Encephalophathy (BSE), could be transmitted from cattle to humans.
</P>
<P>
Almeida said that new worries about BSE, following the British
government's announcement, had caused great concern in Europe,
adding that those countries had the right to temporarily take
preventive measures to protect the health of their people.
</P>
<P>
Britain's beef industry is worth three billion U.S. dollars a
year and employs about 350,000 people directly and
indirectly. About one third of production is exported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a group of experts would gather in Brussels
to study the disease today and Monday. Based on the results of the
study, the EU would decide whether or not countries would be
allowed to stop importing British beef.

<HEADLINE> IRA Rejects UK Election Plans in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
declared today the plans for elections to a forum in Northern
Ireland outlined by British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday
are "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
An unnamed senior IRA source in a statement in Belfast said the
government's election blueprint did not contain the dynamism need
to carry all political parties forward into meaningful peace
negotiations free from preconditions.
</P>
<P>
It is considered that the statement may indicate that a new
IRA ceasefire which is crucial to all-party talks to be convened
on June 10 is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Major outlined his election plans in the parliament on Thursday
and he reiterated that the IRA's political Sinn Fein would be
excluded from all-party talks unless the IRA ceasefire is
restored.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a shadow was cast over the damaged Northern Ireland
peace process as a splinter armed group from the IRA announced it
has placed its units on standby from noon today.
</P>
<P>
The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) accused the British
government of "cynically drawing out the peace process" and
threatened that it would be operating from "a position of defense
and retaliation".
</P>
<P>
INLA, which split from the IRA 25 years ago, never declared a
ceasefire, but observed an unofficial truce during the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the splinter group has been involved in
a bitter internal feud and three people, including its chief of
staff Gino Gallagher, have been killed.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Receives Invitation to Anti-Terrorism Meeting in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today received an
invitation to attend an follow-up committee meeting of the recent
anti-terrorism summit in Egypt, which is to be held in Washington
on March 28-29.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to the meeting of the follow-up committee was
delivered by U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Jones to Lebanese
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz this morning.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was decided during the international anti-terrorism
summit held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with the U.S. envoy, Lebanese foreign
minister announced that he would consult with President Elias
Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri to map out a "suitable
position" on the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Alluding a possible Lebanese boycott of the meeting, Boueiz
pointed out that since this meeting comes as part and result of
the Sharm el Sheikh summit, "we will probably be not enthusiastic
for obeying the invitation."
</P>
<P>
On the tension in south Lebanon which was heightened by a
Hezbollah suicide bomber who charged into an Israeli army convoy
in south Lebanon and killed an officer and wounded seven soldiers,
the foreign minister said that his country has been keeping in
touch with the United States and a number of "friendly countries"
in order to let them know better the Israeli threats in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of these countries have conducted intensive
contacts with Israel in a bid to press for a stop of these threats.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question whether he expects a large-scale Israeli
operation, the foreign minister said that Israel's will to hit
back "have not been a secret" but have been clearly exposed in
the statements and positions made by Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
"But we hope that Israel will be convinced by the
(international) contacts and the facts that this style (of
reaction) does not serve the peace and does not serve the
security," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out an abandonment by Lebanese people of the
resistance against Israeli occupation of its land, reiterating a
call for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon,
in accordance with all related U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined a "big difference" between the right of the
Lebanese people to resist the occupation and the activities of
some organizations.
</P>
<P>
He refused to turn Lebanon into a base for some foreign
organizations, noting that Lebanon has paid a high price for
others and "it will never accept after today to sacrifice
the Lebanese cause for the causes of those organizations which
have nothing to do with the Lebanese cause."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Warns against Israeli Aggression in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul today warned against any Israeli operation in south
Lebanon, saying that any aggression against this country would be
"costly" for the Israelis and bring down the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Lebanese army would continuously stand
on the side of the resistance movement "no matter how sharp
the Israeli threats will be."
</P>
<P>
Dalloul was quoted by the 'Sawt Al-Watan" radio as saying
that Lebanon would never give up its political position.
</P>
<P>
A unity of the Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the peace
negotiations is "complete and continuous," he added.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister stressed that the policy Lebanon follows
derives from its national interests and that unified viewpoints
and tracks with Syria are for Lebanon and Syria as well as for all
the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr,
after a meeting with President Elias Hrawi, announced that his
country is totally cautious of a possible Israeli aggressive
operation.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out a "big" military Israeli action because
it would be harmful for the approaching Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz warned that any
Israeli military adventure in Lebanon would inevitably come across
a military reaction.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz expressed the hope that Israel would be convinced by
the current international contacts and the facts that a military
operation against Lebanon "does not serve the peace and does not
serve the security."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated a call for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon in an compliance with all of the relevant
U.N. resolutions and other international decisions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Chief of Staff Riyad Taqia Din today inspected some
units of the Lebanese army in western Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
He visited the most forward positions and examined the field
measures taken in compliance with an order of the Army
Command to block any Israeli aggression, Lebanese army sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south lebanon following a suicide attack
carried out by the guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, Wednesday on an Israeli military convoy in the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombing attack immediately triggered Israeli intensive
bombardments on southern Lebanese villages, and threats by
Israeli leaders for a large-scale action against Hezbollah in
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launched New Standards for Vegetative Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Growing concern over wrong
diagnoses has led to new guidelines for determining the
vegetative state of patients with severe brain damage.
</P>
<P>
The British Royal College of Physicians today issued new rules
clarifying the difference between permanent and persistent
vegetative states and introduced a third, intermediate, stage called
continuing vegetative state or CVS.
</P>
<P>
The distinctions are important because only when a permement
vegetative state has been diagnosed can application be made to the
High Court to allow a patient to die by withdrawing artificial
feeding. So far eight patients have been allowed to die in this
way and four cases are pending.
</P>
<P>
But last week, two more cases came to light of patients who
were diagnosed as PVS but later made progress. One man regained
consciousness after seven years and another was able to use a
computer and buzzer to communicate with others after two years.
</P>
<P>
Now the Royal College says a patient should only be diagnosed
as being in a permanent vegetative state (PVS) after being in a
continuing vegetative state for 12 consecutive months after head
injury or for six months after damage caused by a brain
haemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
The present definition of PVS confuses persistent and
permanent vegetative states and experts recommend introducing a
intermediate stage - continuing vegetative state or CVS, starting
from the fifth week after the injury.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is increasingly unlikely that a patient would
recover after a month in the vegetative condition.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Hospital for Disability in southwest London, a
hospital specialising in treatment of PVS patients, is expected to
publish research soon giving details of misdiagnosis of PVS
patients.

<HEADLINE> More Countries Ban Imports of British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Six more countries -- Germany,
Finland, Greece, Austria, New Zealand and Singapore -- joined a
growing list of countries imposing bans on British beef imports on
Friday for fear of mad cow disease, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Portugal all
suspended imports of beef from Britain on Thursday after British
scientists said they had discovered a likely link between the
disease and its fatal human equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Britain has protested on the bans, saying that they were
illegal and unnecessary, but the European Commission has rejected
the claim, saying that the moves were acceptable because they were
precautionary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile at home, Britain's main consumer group has told
people to stop eating beef.
</P>
<P>
"There is currently an unquantifiable risk in eating beef," a
spokesman of the Consumers' Association said.
</P>
<P>
And the Co-op, a leading food retailer with 3,000 stores across
the country, said it was considering buying beef from abroad for
the first time in its 150-year history.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Soeharto Calls for Boosting Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called for restructuring state-run trading companies to
boost exports and control imports.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at a meeting marking the
completion of the merger of the trade and industry ministries.
</P>
<P>
In view of the increasingly stiff competition on the
international market in the last few years, Soeharto said, "There
is no other way (to increase exports) than to stabilize reliable
export products."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of stabilizing the growth of
the industrial and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia must increase its export commodities and expand its
list of export destination countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's non-oil imports grew by 32.4 percent
while exports in the same sector rose by only 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing that should be done is to control
imports," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the decrease in export activities could also be
overcome by improving services in the technical, management
marketing sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to continue economic deregulation and cut red
tape to improve the country's competitiveness and efficiency.

<HEADLINE> US Concerns with Situation in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. today showed concern with
the situation in south Lebanon, where clashes occurred recently
between the guerrilla resistance and Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
In his fist visit to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry since a tension
escalated in south Lebanon following Wednesday's suicide attack on
an Israeli military convoy in the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone," U.S. ambassador Richard Jones reiterated
Washington's call on the Lebanese government to curb operations by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in the south in fear that
the operations would affect an international peace effort in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the visit by the U.S. ambassador
came within the current contacts conducted by the United States
with parties concerned, especially Syria, Lebanon and Israel, to
ease the tension in south Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
No official statement was issued on the one-hour talks between
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz and Jones.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous diplomatic source in the Lebanese capital said
that the U.S. ambassador asked for the meeting with the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri stressed on Wednesday,
hours after the suicide bombing, that the guerrilla resistance
against the Israeli occupation was justified and the government
could not rein it in as long as the occupation continued.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any Israeli military operation in south Lebanon
would not not only against Lebanon but also against the peaceful
solution to the Middle East problem because "it will complicate
the things."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah announced in
Beirut Thursday that Hezbollah would launch more attacks
against Israeli forces in the south despite Israeli threats of
harsh retaliation.
</P>
<P>
He also threatened to rocket northern Israel if Israeli
forces attacked Lebanese civilians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on Racism, Racial Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese delegate Friday stressed
at the 52nd session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights the continued presence of racism and racial discrimination
in the world, urging further efforts against the violation of
human rights in this form.
</P>
<P>
"We must not lose sight of the fact that racism and racial
discrimination still plague the world to this day and the struggle
of the international community against racism is far from over",
said Zhang Fengkun, Alternate Representative of the Chinese
Delegation.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the doctrine of racial superiority that
underpinned colonial rule in the past is still driving certain
countries and groups towards new forms of racism and racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
She added that recent years have seen the surge of xenophobia,
ethnic exclusion, intolerance and Neo-Nazi extremism in some parts
of the world, as well as racial and ethnic conflicts that
sometimes led to violence and war.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that some developed countries, whose might
and wealth breed in them a sense of superiority, do not treat
others as equals and try to impose on others their own political
systems and models of economic development as well as their norms
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, their hue and cry about human rights is but a
pretext to justify their racism and racial discrimination."
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged at the session the Commission on Human Rights to
mobilize the international community in denouncing all forms of
racism and racial discrimination, especially the kind inspired by
doctrines of racial superiority.
</P>
<P>
At the session that opened Monday, the Chinese delegate also
appealed for opposition to the hegemony of the large, the
powerful and the rich over the less well-endowed and the
advocation of equality of all countries regardless of size, might
or wealth.

<HEADLINE> Technical Fault Causes Flyover Collapse in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Soeharsono Martakim, director
general of the Ministry of Public Works, said today the cause of
the flyover collapse in western Jakarta in the morning was a pure
technical fault.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is questioning the very person who had
ordered the early removal of the prop stands for the flyover,
which caused the collapse.
</P>
<P>
According to Soeharsono, the collapsed part of the reinforced
concrete bridge was a 30-meter long, 10-meter wide section built
on March 8. Normally, only after becoming completely dry, could
the prop stands be removed.
</P>
<P>
However, several prop stands had already been removed at the
time of the accident, which killed five instantly and injured a
dozen others. The ministry is determined to find out who issued
the order leading to the flyover collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 250-meter long flyover is being constructed by one South
Korean company together with two local firms. The five-million
U.S. dollars project is scheduled to be completed in May.
</P>
<P>
Soeharsono said the ministry has dispatched seven 150-ton
cranes to try to retrieve the victims still trapped under the
broken flyover weighting 600 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, this is the third flyover collapse in
Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Seeks Fund for Repatriation of Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) appealed on Friday for 30
million U.S. dollars to help repatriate some 300,000 Angolan
refugees this year.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR wants the money to pay for transport, water supply,
healthcare, shelter and education as well as road and
bridge repairs.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR predicted repatriation of refugees from several countries
including Zaire, Zambia and the Congo may gain momentum this year
with significant progress being made in the demobilization of
troops in Angola and clearance of land mines on major routes.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's organized repatriation is scheduled to begin in June or
July, depending on security conditions in the refugees' home
villages in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation program was launched last June following the
signing of a peace accord in November 1994 to end a 20-year civil
war which has left more than 600,000 Angolans dead and over 3
million others homeless.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of Angolan refugees is the second major
operation conducted by UNHCR in southern Africa. They
successfully sent home 1.7 million Mozambican refugees last June.

ATHENS March 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece is seeking a joint statement
from the European Union on the crisis in Greek-Turkish relations,

</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Greece would not veto EU customs union
funding for Turkey only if Ankara satisfied the three conditions
set by Athens.

According to the spokesman, the three conditions were that
Ankara renounced the use of force, respected existing borders and
referred any disputes with Greece to the international court at
the Hague.
</P>

Reppas said that the status quo in the region of the eastern
Aegean was ''clear and a given fact.''
</P>

Meanwhile, the country's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
said from Tirana where he is paying a two-day visit that the

now on ''depend on Ankara's abandoning its territorial claims
against Greece.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey Cautions Germany against PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (xinhua) -- A senior Turkish official today
cautioned Germany to take measures against supporters of the
separatist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Nahit Mentese issued the warning
while meeting with Germany's new ambassador to Ankara
Hans-Joachim Vergau. Mentese urged Germany to step up cooperation
with Turkey in anti-terror and security fields, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"As we see, the PKK is stirring up troubles in Germany
as it does in Turkey," said Mentese. "We are sure that our
friends will take necessary precautions on the issue."
</P>
<P>
He added that a protocol foresaw the deportation of PKK
supporters had been signed before but he regretted that so far no
PKK supporters had been expelled to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Mentese reiterated that the PKK was a terrorist organization
which had been involved in bloody separatist activities in
southeastern Turkey since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Vergau, on his part, said that his country was the most
important economic partner of Turkey, adding that "terror and the PKK
were not the key point of the Turco-German relationship".
</P>
<P>
Vergau, who stressed his country was against all kinds of
terrorism, maintained that the cause of the PKK or the Kurdish
issue lied in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the Turkish side to solve the problem," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed that the European allies were prepared
to help Turkey in coping with the problem.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people were injured in pitched battles as German
police tried to stop thousands of Kurds from attending a banned
protest last weekend in Dortmund. The protest was organized by the
 PKK.
</P>
<P>
PKK supporters brutally attacked German policemen, which caused
a wrath among German public.
</P>
<P>
German chancellor Helmut Kohl indicated Tuesday that those
who abuse their residence permits in Germany with such acts of
violence should be tried in the most expeditious way and
deported.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to show that the statement 'no PKK
member will be able to engage in terror anymore in Germany'
is not merely words," Kohl said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Visits Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President George
Bush today arrived in Kuwait on his second visit to the country in
five years and was greeted at the airport by the Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait News Agency, a mission of honor led by
Minister of Information Saud Nasser al-Sabah will accompany the
former U.S. president during his stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bush is adored by Kuwaitis because he geared the international
coalition that ejected the Iraqi forces from Kuwait after seven
months of occupation during the 1990-1991 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference before leaving Doha, Qatar, today, Bush
said his tour was mainly to thank the states that supported the
United States and Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
adding that the world today seemed better because they supported
right, legitimacy and principles.
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition did the right thing during the
liberation of Kuwait by deterring the Iraqi aggressors and by
sticking to the international law for driving out Saddam's forces
from Kuwait, he said.
</P>
<P>
This could not have been possible without full support from
the Gulf states such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United
Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At that time the allied states could not have been able to
stand still and permit the Iraqi army to invade its neighbor,
because this contravenes with the U.N. Charter. he said.
</P>
<P>
To him, the commencement of the war or the firing of the first
bullet was the most crucial moment during the drive to liberate
the Gulf state, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime concern throughout the war was how to end the war
with minimum loss for the coalition forces and how to protect the
innocent Iraqi children, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During his Gulf tour, Bush visited the air carrier "George
Washington" anchoring in Gulf waters and thanked its commander
and marines for supporting him during the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> India's Election Commission Says No Change in Poll Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission
today rejected the plea for changing the first phase of Lok Sabha
(lower house of parliament) poll scheduled for April 27 which is
close to the Muslim festival of Id-Ul-Zuha that falls on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced on Tuesday that the general elections
will be held in four phases on April 27, May 2, May 7 and May 21.
</P>
<P>
But the Janata Dal and some Muslim organizations have demanded
postponement of polling on April 27 to a later date because it
clashes with the Muslim festival of Id, the Press Trust of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
The three-member commission, which met here today, discussed
whether the poll dates will interfere with any religious
observances.
</P>
<P>
A commission press note later said that the commission's
endeavor always had been to make sure the various stages of the
elections were so fixed as to ensure that they did not fall on
festival days.
</P>
<P>
In fixing April 27, the commission has taken into account the
fact that the notified holiday for Id-Ul-Zuha is on April 29, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"While continuing to respect the sentiments of all religions
and groups, the commission has considered it not feasible to
change the date of poll from April 27, as per program already
approved," the note said.

HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Crimes in Hong Kong involving
young people under the age of 21 decreased by over two percent to
11,608 cases in 1995 from 11,858 cases in 1994, said Police
Commissioner Hui Ki-on today.
</P>
<P>
Hui said that the number of young offenders arrested also went

in serious assault, burglary and shoplifting cases involving
young people, and are vigorously tackling the issue, he told a press
conference called to launch the "Hang Seng Bank - Help the Police
Fight Youth Crime Competition 1996."
</P>
<P>
The competition, instituted by the police in 1975, aims to
encourage young people to put forward good suggestions for raising
public awareness of the serious consequences of criminal offenses,
and more importantly, to curb juvenile delinquency, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vietnam, Cambodia Vow to Boost Ties Despite Border  Dispute (by Ling Dequan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Cambodia have vowed to
solve their problems peacefully and to continue their friendship
and cooperation in spite of tension over border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk told a delegation of the
Communist Party of Vietnam on Thursday that importance should be
attached to the development of Cambodian-Vietnamese friendship
and that all problems regarding bilateral relations should be
solved through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
A border dispute erupted last December when Vietnamese
villagers allegedly entered Cambodian territory to farm in the
eastern provinces of Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng and Takeo.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, the king's
son, hinted last Thursday that his country may use force if the
border issue could not be solved by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
But Cambodia later softened its tone and agreed to settle the
border issue peacefully after the prime minister held talks Monday
with Vietnamese Communist Party chief Do Muoi during the Sixth
Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party in Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
Official reports say Do Muoi told Ranariddh that Vietnam, Laos
and Cambodia, which all shared the experience of invasion by
Western colonialism and imperialism, should rely upon one another,
work together, respect each other's independence and sovereignty,
fight poverty and rebuild their own countries.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also hoped the two countries would boost bilateral
cooperation, especially in agriculture and energy.
</P>
<P>
A Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman disclosed at a regular
press conference Thursday that the Vietnamese side has proposed
expert working groups on the border issue should meet as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is now waiting for the Cambodian side to respond, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is ready to
meet Cambodia's two prime ministers at an appropriate time and
place to further exchange ideas on the border issue.
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the Cambodian side for overreacting, saying
that no "critical" problems have taken place in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to create a positive atmosphere for high-level
meetings and the development of bilateral relations, the two sides
should observe a constructive, self-controlled attitude to show
mutual respect, and both sides should refrain from any action that
could further complicate the situation.

<HEADLINE> Second Briton Gets Electric Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A 64-year-old British man on
Wednesday became the second person in the world to be fitted with
a battery-powered heart.
</P>
<P>
The operation, carried out five months after the success of
the world's first operation, was performed by the same team which
installed a battery heart in Abel Goodman, a 64-year-old retired
London film producer, the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford said.
</P>
<P>
Goodman is recovering well and will go home soon, a consultant
heart surgeon with the hospital said. The surgeon said they are
considering removing the battery-operated heart as Goodman's own
heart has substantially recovered.
</P>
<P>
Details of the operation were given as the Oxford Heart Center
showed new techniques in heart treatment to 400 leading
surgeons worldwide by television.
</P>
<P>
The hospital also displayed a new surgery technique of keeping
blood circulation going during the operation, which could greatly
reduce a patient's recovery time. The usual method of stopping
heart and lungs during surgery with machines results in a seven to
ten day stay in hospital.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Water Resources Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (xinhua) -- China will strengthen the
protection and sustainable utilization of water resources for its
social and economic development, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Zou, speaking at a gathering at the Great Hall of the People,
lauded the United Nations for designating March 22 as World Water
Day, saying that the decision is of great significance for the
promotion of the effective protection and sustainable utilization
of the global water resources.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was attended by Chinese officials, delegates from
some 50 other countries, and representatives of the United Nations
and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that China has always attached importance
to the issue of water, citing the fact that China drafted its own
Agenda 21 in 1994 soon after the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development.
</P>
<P>
At the National People's Congress annual session, which has
just ended, he said, China further stressed the need to preserve
land, water and other natural resources in the course of pursuing
economic development, as can be seen in the country's Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and its long-term goals up to the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that he appreciated the fact that the United Nations
Center for Human Settlements chose China as center stage for the
observance of this year's World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
"China will make active contributions to the protection of the
earth, our home, along with other nations of the world," he said.

TOKYO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
outlined its largest ever stopgap budget totaling 11.6 trillion
yen (116 billion U.S. dollars) designed to stimulate the domestic
economy, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The provisional budget will be announced to the Diet
(parliament) on Tuesday after endorsement by the cabinet of the
three-party ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News quoted government sources as saying the provisional
plan covering the first 50 days of fiscal 1996 starting April 1,
incorporates about 2.8 trillion yen (28 billion dollars) in
spending on public works projects, equivalent to nearly a third
of planned public works expenditure for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Diet debate on a draft budget has been stalled
because of confrontation between the ruling coalition and the
leading opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) over a
government plan to use 685 billion yen (6.85 billion U.S. dollars)
of taxpayers' money to bail out seven failed housing loan
companies.

<HEADLINE> "China Has Urgent Task to Fight Tuberculosis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- With about one fourth of
population infected and 250,000 people dying of it every year,
China is facing a difficult task to control tuberculosis, the most
deadly infectious disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
The situation is very serious in China, Minister of Public
Health Chen Minzhang said here today at a forum to mark World
Anti-Tuberculosis Day, which falls March 24.
</P>
<P>
The disease especially endangers the health of people living in
poor and remote areas, and thus hinders the development of the
local economy, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the World Health Organization
(WHO) show that tuberculosis has infected about one third of the
world's population, killing three million people each year. In
April, 1993 the WHO called on governments of all countries to take
urgent measures to deal with the tuberculosis crisis.
</P>
<P>
China has six million tuberculosis patients.
</P>
<P>
By using World Bank loans China has conducted
tuberculosis-control projects in Sichuan, Gansu, Hebei and eight
other provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a
total population of 560 million since 1992, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
About 2.4 million people have received free medical checks and
340,000 TB sufferers among them have been treated.
</P>
<P>
The cure rate among the patients, Chen stressed, is 87.3
percent, about two percentage points higher than the goal set by
the WHO for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China has launched another anti-tuberculosis project in 250
counties in 15 provinces and autonomous regions since 1993. Some
12,000 patients have been treated and the cure rate has reached 89
percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the WHO and other international organizations were
also present at the forum, organized by the Ministry of Public
Health and the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association.

companies of Germany, the Sofretu Company of France (the current
subway constructor) and over 30 domestic construction companies
have expressed their intention to bid.
</P>
<P>
It is also learned that the major facilities of the subway are
to be imported from countries such as Germany, Britain, the US and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
At present, the No. 1 line of the subway is taking shape, and
the total investment is 5.59 billion yuan. It is expected to

<HEADLINE> British Government Calls For Internet Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- British Internet carriers must
control access to illegal and unsuitable material, Science
and Technology Minister Ian Taylor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the government was keen to see the Internet global
computer network fully exploited for business, education and
leisure. But he warned that this may not happen if people were
afraid of what they might find on-line.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.3 million people have accessed the Internet from
Britain since August 1995, and this number is expected to double
every nine months.
</P>
<P>
"The government's preference is for a voluntary approach. An
imposed regulatory regime is not likely to solve all our
problems," said Taylor, adding that legislation in other
countries has been largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The recent American Telecommunications Act has attempted to
restrict access to indecent material by minors, but there has been
a swift response from civil liberties groups, with injunctions
sought to have parts of the Act declared unconstitutional on the
grounds that it inhibits free speech.
</P>
<P>
"Now the Net is being used for business and education as well
as in the home, there is no doubt there is genuine concern about
some material on it," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was important to distinguish between illegal
material -- such as child pornography -- and offensive, but legal
material, such as soft pornography. The answer should be filter
software that restricts access by children to offensive material,
said Taylor.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's import of milk
powder more than doubled during the first eight months of the
current fiscal year to reach 37.38 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan
imported 14,853 tons of milk powder and baby milk food during
July-February of 1995-96, 91.40 percent up from 7,760 tons
imported in the same period of the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of value, the import went up by 118.24 percent to
37.38 million dollars from 17.12 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Importers attributed the increase of milk powder import to a
buying spree last year in Pakistan and the withdrawal of
government's 15 percent sales tax in last June.
</P>
<P>
Low supplies by drought-hit New Zealand and Australia last year
resulted in a buying spree in Pakistan, a dealer said.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Missile Designer Killed in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A prominent missile designer has
been shot dead in an apparent contract killing outside his home in
Yekaterinburg, 1,200 kilometers east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to local news reports today, Valentin Smirnov, said
to have been one of the key players in the sale of a Russian
missile system to the United States, was shot in the head with a
nine-millimeter bullet by an unidentified killer, who attacked the
victim on his way to work on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the mafia could have ordered the murder.
</P>
<P>
Smirnov, 62, was the inventor of the Russian S-300V missile,
the Russian counterpart to the U.S. Patriot Missile.
</P>
<P>
The death of Smirnov, 62, a recipient of the coveted Soviet
Hero of Socialist Labor medal sent shock waves through the law
enforcement community.
</P>
<P>
Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Yevgeny Ryabtsyev said: "
Smirnov was a very important person, a famous scientist and
inventor," he said. "Naturally, his murder requires a serious
investigation."
</P>
<P>
A special task force has been set up to investigate the crime,
consisting of about 150 people from four different governmental
organizations -- Yekaterinburg police, the Federal Security
Service, the Prosecutor General's Office and investigators from
the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow press suggested that Smirnov's death was connected
to the U.S. purchase of Smirnov's S-300V missile system, for 60
million dollars in last April.
</P>
<P>
That purchase aroused controversy at the time. Many Russian
military experts believed the sale amounted to a betrayal of

Russians say has a tracking system superior to that of the
U.S. Patriot, was designed to shoot down radar-evading Stealth
warplanes.

<P>
The S-300V -- the most recent version of the Russian
anti-defense system -- can destroy flying objects as small as a
duck, experts said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said at the time of the sale that they intended
to analyze the missile system, aiming to upgrade and modernize its
Patriot system, which gained fame for shooting down Iraqi Scud
missiles during the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Attempt to Commit Suicide illegal in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court ruled
Thursday that attempt to commit suicide or its abetment is a penal
offense, the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling reversed an earlier judgment of the court which had
declared that the provisions for punishment on attempt to commit
suicide or its abetment under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
A five-judge bench headed by Justice J.S. Verma set aside the
judgment delivered by a division bench headed by Justice B.L.
Hansaria two years ago.
</P>
<P>
It rejected all contentions challenging IPC provisions for
punishment on abetment to suicide or attempted suicide, saying the
provisions were not violative of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Abetment to suicide or attempted suicide is a distinct offense
which is found enacted even in the law of the country where
attempted suicide is not made punishable," the court said in its
40-page verdict.
</P>
<P>
Referring to contention that the right to die was as
constitutional as the right to life, the court said that the right
to life was a natural right embodied in the Constitution but
suicide was an unnatural termination or extinction of life and,
therefore, incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of the
right to life.

JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today in Gaza that the
Palestinian police have arrested 900 Hamas and Islamic Jihad
activists since late last month and the prisons in Gaza are full.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a meeting with a delegation of leaders of
American Jewish Congress, Arafat also said that among the
detainees are 35 extremists who are on the wanted list provided
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Palestinian police are making every effort
to capture Hamas activist Mahammed Dief, who is suspected of
having masterminded the recent wave of Hamas suicide bombing
attacks in Israel, which killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli security forces today
arrested three Palestinians in the El-Farwa refugee camp near
Hebron on suspicion of terror-related activities.

capability to do more.

"They have to decide to destroy the infrastructure of

<P>
"We think they (the PNA) can do more, but they have to
understand that we have the right even in Area A (Palestinian
self-rule towns) if we don't see they are acting completely
against the terrorist organizations," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Foreign Minister Meets with U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz met here today with the ambassador of the United States in
Beirut, Richard Jones, who requested for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit by the U.S. diplomat to the Foreign
Ministry since tension escalated in south Lebanon following
Wednesday's suicide attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which led to the killing of an Israeli captain and
the wounding of five soldiers, was carried out by a Hezbollah
guerrilla at an Israeli military convoy in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
No official statement has been made on the talks between
Boueiz and Jones which lasted an hour.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous diplomatic source in the Lebanese capital said
that the U.S. ambassador earlier asked the meeting with the
foreign minister and was agreed.
</P>
<P>
The source said the U.S. ambassador conveyed to the Lebanese
foreign minister Washington's concern on the situation in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jones reiterated Washington's call on the Lebanese government
to curb operations by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, in the south in fear that the operations would have negative
impact on international peace efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic source noted that the visit of the
U.S. ambassador to Boueiz came within the current contacts
conducted by Washington with parties concerned, especially Syria,
Lebanon and Israel, to ease tension in south Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, only hours after the suicide bombing, Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri stressed that the guerrilla
resistance against the Israeli occupation was justified and the
government could not rein it in as long as the occupation
continues.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any Israeli military operation in south Lebanon
"would not be against Lebanon but against the peaceful solution in
the region because it will complicate the matter."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah announced in
Beirut on Thursday that Hezbollah would launch more attacks
against Israeli forces in the south despite Israeli threats of
harsh retaliation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his guerrillas act "independently away from
all political considerations."
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said Syria and Iran "support the Lebanese
resistance, but Hezbollah has never had requests or faced
pressures from the two countries to escalated or de-escalated
military operations for political considerations."
</P>
<P>
He said that Wednesday's suicide attack was carried out by a
19-year-old guerrilla called Ali Munif Ashmar, who was carrying
about 10 kilograms of explosives.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that a cautious
calm returned to the area this morning except sporadic shellings
by Israeli forces at some hills and heights opposite the buffer
zone where Moslem guerrillas suspectedly hide.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, the Israeli occupation forces violently
bombarded guerrilla bases in south Lebanon and Western Beqaa
in retaliation for the suicide attack, but no serious casualties
were reported.

<HEADLINE> Divisive Policy Disaster For Taiwan's People: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent days, instability and anxiety have been on the rise in
Taiwan, accompanied by a decline in stock prices, sluggish
investment, increasing outflow of funds, and decline in factory
orders.
</P>
<P>
To avoid disaster, a large number of Taiwan residents are
competing to leave the island, while more and more people have
showed their disagreement with "Taiwan Independence" by casting a
dissenting vote.
</P>
<P>
A great number of politicians supporting "Taiwan Independence"
failed to win in the election for members of the "Legislative Yuan"
at the end of 1995, indicating that the majority of Taiwan's
people are looking for social stability and oppose "Taiwan
Independence" and that divisive policies run counter to wishes for
stability, development, and reunification cherished by the Taiwan
residents.
</P>
<P>
The splittist actions of Lee Teng-hui led to tensions between
the mainland and Taiwan. Facts show that Lee's perverse acts
poisoned the atmosphere over the Taiwan Straits, caused a reversal
in cross-straits ties, and caused huge losses for the
people in Taiwan, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's people have come to see the essence of Lee Teng-Hui
in his activities aimed at dividing the country and destroying the
fraternal relations of their countrymen. They have gradually
understood that if they allow Lee Teng-hui to continue on this
path, he will push them to an abyss of suffering.
</P>
<P>
Only when Taiwan's authorities return to the one-China
principle, can relations across the Straits relax and a secure
life prevail on the island, the article said.
</P>
<P>
So long as the splittist activities of the Taiwan authorities
do not stop, the fight against "Taiwan Independence" by the
Chinese government and the Chinese people will not stop, the
article said, noting that the people in Taiwan will surely make
their choice with their own actions.
</P>
<P>
National reunification is the common desire of all Chinese
people, including the Taiwan compatriots, and an inexorable
historical trend. The fundamental interests of Taiwan's people lie
in relaxation of cross-Straits relations, in direct mail service,
direct trade and direct aviation and shipping services between the
two sides, and in social stability and further economic
development on the island, the article said.
</P>
<P>
If Lee Teng-hui really meant what he said with, "I bear the
people's desire in mind", he should conform to the wishes of
Taiwan's people and do something concrete for promoting
relations across the straits and the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
If he clings obstinately to his course of harming the interests
of Taiwan's people and sabotaging the cause of reunification of
the motherland, he will be cast out by the Chinese people, the
article concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The divisive policy of Taiwan's
leader Lee Teng-hui has been pushing Taiwan's people to the "abyss
of misery," said an article released here today.
</P>
<P>
The article, by Peng Fu, noted that, "what the Taiwan people
want is social stability and protection of their own interests."
</P>
<P>
What is essential for realizing their aspiration is the
relaxation and steady development of relations across the Taiwan
Straits, the end of the separation at an early date, and China's
reunification, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Facing fiercer and fiercer international competition and
growing trade protectionism, industrial and commercial circles in
Taiwan are eager to have direct cross-straits mail service, trade,
shipping, and air services at an early date, and to invest in and
trade with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The article criticized Lee Teng-hui for disregarding the
fundamental interests of Taiwan's people and doing things that
damage their interests and run counter to their wishes.
</P>
<P>
It said that since coming to power eight years ago, Lee has
gradually abandoned the one-China principle, wantonly pursued the
"two Chinas" and "one China and one Taiwan" policies, and gone so
far as to overtly carry out activities aimed at dividing the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
He has also protected and backed those pursuing "Taiwan
independence" and suppressed those supporting China's
reunification, it said, adding that he has used the hard-earned
money of Taiwan's people to buy America's support.
</P>
<P>
The article also denounced Lee for deceiving Taiwan's people
and engaging in splittist activities against the motherland by
using their calls for democracy as a banner.
</P>
<P>
Lee has also ordered large amounts of weapons and ammunition,
called for arms expansion and conducted frequent military
exercises directed at the mainland, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-hui has fallen squarely into the quagmire of dividing
China," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The divisive policy being pursued by Lee has seriously damaged
the interests of Taiwan's people," it added, and denounced Lee for
engaging in politics controlled by underground societies and
backed by money from those preaching "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Consequently, "Taiwan independence" activities have run rampant
and the island's society has been thrown into chaos and people's
feelings have been hurt.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Hails China's Gold Production Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, in a
letter of congratulations to the ongoing third national gold
conference today, praised China's gold industry for developing
rapidly during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) and
having made a significant contribution to the country's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's gold production reached 108 tons, eight tons
over the year's target.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng urged in the letter that the gold industry continues to
deepen its reform and opening to the outside world in order to
raise its production and efficiency simultaneously during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), and to raise the annual
gold production to 150 tons.
</P>
<P>
Li also called for strict management of gold resources and
elimination of reckless.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
China's gold production increased by 10 percent annually and
produced 447.2 tons of gold altogether, thanks to a series of new
regulations concerning the gold industry set forth by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
In the five years China found 1,735 more tons of gold deposits,
23 percent more than was found in the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The development of the gold industry has also promoted local
economic development and has helped poverty-stricken areas
extricate themselves from poverty. Statistics show that among
China's over 2,000 counties, 95 have the gold industry as their
main industry while in 63 gold production is the top income
earner.

financial soundness and companies that others try to emulate.
</P>
<P>
The criteria for the review 200 list of leading Asian companies
are "beyond sales and profit figures," the magazine's editor and

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
businesses in Hong Kong are facing difficulties in finding
expertise and technical talents, in tapping overseas market and
enhancing research and development, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
Labor, market, and research and development are the three major
 problem areas that affect small and medium-sized businesses,
according to a survey conducted by the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association (CMA) of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, a manufacturing business that employs less than
100 persons is defined as small and medium-sized one.
</P>
<P>
These businesses are facing keen competitions in the overseas
markets and the shrinkage of market shares.
</P>
<P>
And they are not financially strong to promote research and
development.
</P>
<P>
The survey aims to look at the current business situation and
identify the difficulties facing local small and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the businesses in Hong Kong are
small and medium-sized. Statistics from the APEC show that
270,000 out of 280,000 businesses in the territory were small or
medium-sized in 1993, accounting for 98 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls For Greater Efforts in Water Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations official
called on all nations to pool more funds and efforts for
protecting diminishing water resources.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that, today, the world needs such a strong
voice on water if it is to wake up to the growing water crisis
that is threatening the very sustainability of our
settlements: cities, hamlets and towns across the world," said
Dr. Wally N'Dow, Secretary-General of Habitat II and Head of the
UN Center for Human Settlements, at the inauguration ceremony for
World Day for Water observances.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 50 countries, or about 40 percent of the
world population, suffer from water shortages and that depletion,
pollution, and degradation of freshwater supplies will pose one of
the toughest challenges to mankind in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He urged nations around the world to increase cooperation and
take concerted actions on the issue, warning that, "if we fail to
meet this challenge now, we may soon witness major social and
political conflicts in our societies."
</P>
<P>
N'Dow explained that because China has been paying closer
attention to the water issue and has been observing World Water
Day for several years, the United Nations decided to put Beijing
at center stage for this year's observance of World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutros-Boutros Ghali
sent a message to the gathering, urging all donor nations to
increase their commitment to assisting poorer nations in their
endeavours, while reminding the latter of the need "to put in
place policies and strategies which ensure more sustainable water
resources management."
</P>
<P>
Delegates from UNICEF and other UN agencies, the World Bank,
and some 50 countries attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dengquan, vice minister of Water Resources, one of the
hosts of the event, pledged to continue in the battle against the
water problem, and said that more than 300 cities, about half
China's total, lack water resources and that pollution and wastage
exacerbate the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has put conservation and sustaining water
resources on Agenda 21 and has placed water resources construction
at the top of the country's infrastructure plan.
</P>
<P>
"China has completed a plan for supplying water to 270 cities
with water deficiencies and is drafting the country's medium and
long-term water plan," he said. "Water supplies for cities have
been given preferential treatment in construction."
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying that World Water Day also coincides with
the start of "China Water Week", which is being observed in
various ways across the country.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation Of Refugees Pritority, S. Leone President-Elect Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The President-Elect of
Sierra Leone, Tejan Kabbah, said today the ''repatriation,
resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced Sierra Leoneans and
refugees (in Guinea and Liberia)'' top his list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said he ''welcomes'' the progress made so far in the
peace talks between the military government and the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Head of State Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio and the leader
of the RUF, Foday Sankoh, are to meet on Monday in Abidjan, two days
after the fifth anniversary of the rebel war.
</P>
<P>
''Sankoh and his people are all Sierra Leoneans and they have
a right to take part in the political process of Sierra Leone,''
Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''I hope that with the trauma of the (rebel) war
nearly behind us, the military will become active partners with
government in the development of Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
Kabbah paid tribute to Nigerian and Guinean troops helping the
Sierra Leone army battle against rebels, saying, ''I am aware of the
debt of gratitude to these fighting forces.''
</P>
<P>
The president-elect said his administration ''will ensure the
efficient delivery of judicial services and good governance to all.''
</P>
<P>
''Emphasis will be placed on the observance by all including
myself of the constitutional and fundamental rights of all citizens,"
Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to critics who said that the political support given
to the S. Leone People's Party by six other parties after the
election ''is likely to tempt the SLPP to form a one party
state'', Kabbah said, ''this would never happen. What the country
needs is a government of national unity.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile as the two month ceasefire announced last Sunday by
the RUF continue to hold for the fifth straight day, reports from
Bo in the south, said over seven vehicles and two tractors
with over 300 people, mainly displaced and businessmen, returned
to Mattru Jong, also in the south, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Correspondents who watched the exodus from Bo said it was ''the
second adventure'' made by drivers to the area since the road was
closed a year ago due to rebel ambushes.
</P>
<P>
The first trip was made 10 days ago when over 100 malnourished
people, mainly women and children were brought to bo for urgent
medical treatment from Mattru Jong.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists estimate that over 3,000 people have already
returned to Mattru within the past three weeks, many of them
trekking to their villages.
</P>
<P>
''Farming has already started and civilians are being guarded
by government troops and a special task force,'' one journalist
reported.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua)-- Four farmers in eastern Sri Lanka
were beaten up Thursday by Tamil rebels for failing to pay
"protection money," according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that one of the farmers was in serious
condition after they were "punished" by the rebels for not
complying with the order to pay a monthly sum of about 18.5 US
Dollars per acre of land.
</P>
<P>
Many of the farmers who could not pay as demanded by the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were similarly harassed by
the rebels recently, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, an armed Tamil group, has been fighting a 13-year
guerrilla war with the Sri Lankan government for a separate Tamil
state in the north-east of the country.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Terms Bite Poors in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditionalities have
reportedly accelerated the decline of income of the majority of
workers in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A senior Tanzania Federation of Trade Unions (TFTU) official,
Tuntufye Kasilati, said here Thurday that increasing corruption,
nepotism, lack of accountability, embezzlement and moonlighting
were linked to adjustment programs devised by the two
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper "Social Dimensions of Structural
Adjustment" at a regional trade union seminar, Kasilati asked how
could they ever hope to increase productivity under these
conditions?
</P>
<P>
He cited devaluation of local currencies as a conditionality
which led to persistent inflation, while salaries and wages
continued to be compressed.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and IMF conditionalities had also led to lack
of transparency in the pay systems, hence eroding responsibility
and accountability in public offices, he added.
</P>
<P>
The offiial said that some forms of taxes were regressive and
hit harder the poor. Such policies, he said, had pushed up the
cost of living.
</P>
<P>
Kasilati deplored the two institutions for recommending the
freezing of employment.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent retrenchment in Tanzania had affected more
than 50,000 workers, but very little had been done on re-training
or redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Kasilati said that there were job creation attempts which,
however, were "ill-devised self-employment schemes", lacking a
linkage between the formal and informal sector. This consequently
caused a labor marketing problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such an environment, he said, in most cases affected women
whose contribution is cruial to generating income for the family.
</P>
<P>
"There is an inherent exploitation of the poor in the
adjustment programs," noted the TFTU official.
</P>
<P>
The four-day regional trade union seminar organized by the
Nairobi-based Public Services International (PSI), was opened
here on Tuesday.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, MARCH 21 (Xinhua) -- German health and agriculture
ministries issued a joint statement today, calling on the European
Union (EU) to impose blanket restrictions on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after the British government said
Wednesday that scientists had found a likely link between "mad
cow" disease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and its
fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Diseased (CJD).
</P>
<P>
The findings followed studies of 10 young people who died from
the CJD during the past two years. Most cases of the European "mad
cow" disease were reportedly found in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and the Netherlands have already suspended British beef
imports.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Direct Investments Surpass 10  Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's cumulative actual
overseas direct investments exceeded the 10-billion-U.S.-dollar
mark by the end of last year, the International Trade and
Industry Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
South Korean firms had made investments in over 5,890 projects

South Korea's investments in Asia were, for the most part, made

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Security in Colombo has been
tightened from this morning and all leave for policemen has been
canceled until after the forthcoming Sinhala and Hindu New Year,
according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this is being done to pre-empt any Tamil
rebel attack during the new year which falls on April 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Security vigilance in the city is usually tightened during
festive seasons but this year both police and security forces are
on high alert especially in view of certain incidents and
detection of arms and explosives in the city in the recent past.

security forces have stepped up their operations in the city and
timely recovery of several Tamil rebels' arsenal has prevented
rebel attack on the city.
</P>
<P>
The army will assist the police in providing security in

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Economic Upsurge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has lagged far behind coastal areas in economic
development because of natural conditions and lack of funds,
technical personnel, and technology, but is now having a heyday
with economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the central government strategy to develop
central and western parts of China during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, one of five autonomous regions in China, lies on the
ancient Silk Road between China and the west that dates back to
the 4th or 5th centuries B.C. It has vast natural resources, with
129 of the 145 minerals found in China.
</P>
<P>
Forty oil and gas fields have been discovered in the region
with proven reserves of two billion tons of oil and 160 billion
cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil output there had a double-digit increase, or 1
million tons, during each of the past several years. Western oil
experts consider the region the most promising for oil and gas
production in China.
</P>
<P>
With state financial and technical assistance, the region has
completed two key ethyl projects. Another 39 large chemical works,
which are estimated to cast 30 billion yuan, are expected to
become operational in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
With good harvests for 18 years running, Xinjiang has become
the largest cotton producer in China.
</P>
<P>
As a new hub of communications for northwest China, Xinjiang
has connected with 25 bus lines and 41 international and domestic
air routes. To make its airports more compatible with the region's
status as a gateway to China and a transfer point on the Euroasian
Continental Bridge, the region has invested two billion yuan in
new airports or in repairing existing ones.
</P>
<P>
This border region is now easily accessible to the outside
world thanks to improvements in telecommunication facilities in
recent years. An additional one billion yuan will be invested this
year in this key sector.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale oil exploration has helped the petrochemical
industry to become Xinjiang's pillar industry, with output worth
20 billion yuan, accounting for one third of the region's total.
</P>
<P>
Its new economic belt from Urumqi to Karamay, Shihezi, and
Changji cities on the north of the Tianshan Mountains, is becoming
an economic power. In 1995, its GDP made up 40 percent of the
region's total and its industrial output value made up 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
A recent plan for the next century calls for turning the region
into the top cotton, sugar-cane, petrochemical, natural gas, gold,
and nonferrous metal producer in China.

<HEADLINE> China Breeds First Asian Elephant Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zookeepers have solved a
jumbo sized problem by establishing the country's first zoo-bred
family of Asian elephants.
</P>
<P>
The mini-herd in Yunnan province's Kunming Zoo includes one
adult male elephant, two adult females and five young elephants -
all bred in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The zoo has also provided three young elephants to zoos in
Beijing, Shanghai and Jinan, provincial capital of coastal
Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
There are about 70 Asian elephants in 23 zoos across the
country, with Kunming Zoo having the biggest collection.
</P>
<P>
Liang Zhixian, head of Kunming Zoo, said it was impossible to
meet demands from domestic zoos by capturing Asian elephants in
the wild, because of their limited numbers.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there are only about 230 Asian elephants in
the wild in China, mainly living in two nature reserves in
Yunnan. Around the world only about 50,000 of the animals survive,
mainly in south Asia. The Asian elephant is described as
intelligent and gentle-tempered.
</P>
<P>
Liang said an adult male Asian elephant eats 100 kg of fresh
grass, and an adult female needs 70-80 kg. Only mild weathered
Yunnan produces fresh fruit, vegetable and green grass all the
year round.
</P>
<P>
In early 1970s, Beijing and Guangzhou Zoos tried to breed Asian
elephants, but failed because of limited local grass resources,
and because the elephants in general are choosy about their food
-- they eat only fresh green grass, sugarcane and bamboo leaves.
</P>
<P>
Kunming Zoo started work in 1978 on establishing Asian elephant
groups by introducing three females and a male elephant from the
tropical rain forests in Dehong prefecture. The captured animals
were aged between eight and 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Zoo keepers still remember how the elephants appeared very weak
after the journey, affected by at least five species of parasites.
</P>
<P>
"They were ill-tempered and refused to be approached," the
keepers recalled.
</P>
<P>
A playground and living place covering nearly 3,000 sq.m was
built especially for the four elephants, along with a big pool in
1978.
</P>
<P>
Zoo keepers watched the elephants day and night, and observed
their habits and customs, provided the food they like in the wild,
including fresh rice straw, bamboo leaves and sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
The keepers also managed to establish close relations with the
animals, and encouraged them to accept fruit, vegetables and
grain, and they cured the elephants' diseases.
</P>
<P>
By February of 1994 five elephants have been born in the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the zoo also discovered the exact age when Asian
elephants are sexually mature, and the exact number of days of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Experts earlier believed that Asian elephants became mature at
the age of 30 to 40 years old. The zoo found it takes an elephant
only 10 to 14 years to mature, and the number of months of
pregnancy is 21 to 22 months, not the 18 months depicted in
books.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Struggle against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has called for the government to take effective and
immediate measures to fight against drugs trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Demirel said that in recent
years terrorist organizations from within or from outside of the
country have incited young Turks to take drugs in a bid to bring
them to go astray.
</P>
<P>
He believed that in face of this situation, it is necessary to
take measures against not only the drug traffickers, but also the
drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to fight against drugs trafficking both
for the growing of our young people in a healthy way and for the
stopping of the financial sources for the terrorist
organizations", said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
He urged ministries of justice, interior, education, health
and tourism to carry out a campaign to arouse the young Turks to
stop taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
The drugs are usually taken in schools, places of recreation
and holiday.
</P>
<P>
Tuncay Yilmaz, chief of the anti-smuggling department of the
Turkish police, has said that in 1995, the Turkish police seized
2,307 kilograms of heroin, 73 kilograms of base morphine, 56
kilograms of cocaine, 112 kilograms of opium, 9,731 kilograms of
hashish and 51,139 kilograms of anhydride acid.

<P>
KUNMING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 pirated discs
and cassettes have been confiscated during a major clampdown in
Southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The province introduced an intellectual property protection
system and has scored successes in cracking down on copyright
piracy, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Provincial intellectual Property Right
Office said that in the past year Yunnan's anti-piracy campaign
was concentrated in the provincial capital of Kunming, and the
Dali area.
</P>
<P>
The official said that law-enforcers confiscated and destroyed
100,000 pirated compact discs, video compact discs, laser discs,
and audio-video cassette tapes in the two areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 35 firms and individuals turning out pirated
audio-video products were punished according to law, he added.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Anti-Smuggling Unit of the
Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) yesterday impounded another 50
trucks hired by the World Food Program (WFP) for inspection, the
local daily the New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the impounding of the trucks hired by the WFP
from the NABRESCO, a jordanian transport company, follows alleged
failure by the WFP Country Officer in Kampala to produce contract
documents it signed with the company.
</P>
<P>
The URA officials were quoted as saying that the documents are
to ascertain whether the trucks are covered under the privilege
and immunity of the United Nations which the WFP enjoys.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, nine trucks belonging to the company were
impounded at various points in Masaka and Kampala for allegedly
evading taxes.
</P>
<P>
The trucks have been reportedly delivering relief aid to
Rwanda, Zaire and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The URA officials claimed that the trucks were impounded until
the tax issue is solved. enditem

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills Police Officer in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A gunman opened fire today
from his home in Eastchester, New York, killing one policeman and
wounding another.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified by police as Richard Sacchi, 26, also
held other officers at bay for two hours before an armored car was
finally used to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
Sacchi opened fire at about 3:30 p.m. local time as the
officers answered a call from a man saying he needed
assistance. One officer was shot in his car, the other slumped
outside the home.
</P>
<P>
Sacchi, armed with "a variety of weapons," holed up in the
house as police officers crouched behind parked cars along the
street and two helicopters buzzed overhead.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the quiet small town said the last gunfire from
the house came at about 5 p.m. It was unclear whether Sacchi had

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Public Service Reform Program Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua)-- The Zambian government has
postponed the retrenchment of public workers under the public
service reform program due to financial straits, the Zambia daily
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Finance Minister Ronald Penza as saying that
the government had diverted about 10 million US Dollars intended
for the exercise to other urgent financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
Penza singled out domestic costs on debt service and balance
of payments pressure as some of the developments that had forced
the government to divert the money.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment would wait until next year when the
government hoped to mobilize enough funds with the support of the
donor community, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the decision to postpone the redundancies should
not be viewed as political in view of this year's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The move had been taken to ensure that the victims of the
reform program were paid the final packages without delay, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, some 9,000 government employees will
be retrenched this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> More Comfortable Houses For Shanghai Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More low-income residents in
Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial center, are
expected to have new apartments as work on 600,000 sq m of
housing is completed this year.
</P>
<P>
The city also intends to start building another 740,000 sq m of
such housing this year, up 34.5 percent over last year, Wenhui
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
These efforts are part of the state's "Anju Project", a
national program for providing comfortable and affordable
residences for low-income residents.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the number of households with per capita living
space of less than four sq m has dropped from 74,6000 to 64,6000,
the Shanghai newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has promised to guarantee the design,
quality, management, and funds for the project.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the newspaper said home decoration is all
the rage in Shanghai nowadays. About 96 percent of Shanghai
residents want to refurbish their apartments, and every ten years
people will redo their rooms.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper predicted that the local people will spend 10
billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars) this year on
decorations and additions, which will further help the development
of the local building materials industry.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Businessmen Confident About Investment in Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Taiwan entrepreneurs who have
invested in Fujian Province have expressed confidence in
investment prospects in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Shu, president of the Fuzhou Huo Chong Textiles Corp.,
and Li Hsi Cheng, manager of the Anton Group, told Xinhua that the
improvement of the investment environment in Fujian is attracting
more and more Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Shu is now building his third and largest textile company in
this capital of Fujian. His total investment is projected to reach
30 million US dollars. Since May last year Shu has invested more
than 20 million US dollars in basic construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has decided to invest another 10 million US
dollars in the new company, as his other two companies in Fuzhou
enjoy stable social environment and normal production.
</P>
<P>
According to Shu, the new project will go into operation in the
near future and provide products for both local and export markets.
</P>
<P>
Shu said he invests in the mainland because he thinks "blood is
thicker than water" and he feels personally safe and confident
about the future of his companies on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Li Hsi Cheng holds the same opinion. He said that the local
government pays close attention to protecting the interests of
Taiwan companies.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Anton Group is preparing to open 100
shops in Fuzhou, thus boosting the local service industry.
</P>
<P>
The Anton Group has interests in agriculture, industry and the
service sector in the province. Its total investment in Fuzhou is
expected to reach 120 million US dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the some 1,000 Taiwan-invested companies in
Fuzhou has stopped production, taken back funds or moved to other
areas, according to Wei Limu, director of the Taiwan affairs
office of the local government.

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Dhabi-based Arab
Monetary Fund (AMF) said that the total payments overdue from
Arab states until the end of 1995 have reached 400 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report obtained here today, the AMF said total
arrears represented 54 percent of the total paid up capital of the
fund until the end of 1995 against 51 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the total assets, including the paid up
capital and reserves reached about 1.5 billion dollars until the
end of 1995 against 1.3 billion dollars in 1994, an increase of
4.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the AMF gave loans to the Arab states totaling 1.6
billion dollars against 1.5 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Iraq, Sudan and Somalia were among the
top list of defaulters.
</P>
<P>
The AMF officials are continuing its deliberations with these
states to find a solution, it added.
</P>
<P>
The AMF, the Arab League's main financial institution, was set
up in 1976. Its primary goal was tackling balance of payments
deficits of members through the provision of soft loans.
</P>
<P>
The loans have exceeded 2.9 billion dollars since its creation.

HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The permit system for the import
and export of all agricultural commodities will remain in place
and the market will continue to determine producer and selling
prices of commodities, Agriculture Minister Denis Norman said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his traditional agricultural policy statement for the
1996/97 marketing year, he said that the permit system would only
be removed for some commodities after the country's disease
monitoring system is adequately in place and the new tariff
structures have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The statement was immediately met with howls of disappointment
from farming leaders who had expected ''much more relaxations of
controls'' from the Agriculture Ministry, local newspapers
reported.
</P>
<P>
President of the Commercial Farmers' Union, Peter Macsporran
said he was very disappointed with the statement, which he said
had nothing to motivate farmers.
</P>
<P>
Norman said the import and export system would always remain
in place for strategic commodities such as maize and maize
products, wheat and wheat products, sugar, cattle and beef,
tobacco and seed (excluding vegetable and flower seed), even
after the review now underway is complete. enditem

FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The provincial capital of east
China's Fujian Province will control land used by real estate
developers and push development of land transfers by contract,
according to the head of the municipal land administration, Li
Yichun.
</P>
<P>
The city will also take steps to encourage the transformation

</P>
<P>
The city plans to do better in developing new zones, and
preferential policies will be given to investment in them or in
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The city has earned more than 2 billion yuan from transfer of
land use rights, since it began the practice in 1988. The total
investment in transferred land has topped 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
New measures will be taken to expand the land market. Land
should be transferred through market means and the amount of
government allocation of land will be reduced, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The city will increase controls of medium and service
institutions in the land market, and the price of land will be
geared to a land price system.

FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- By the end of last year east
China's Fujian Province had approved the establishment of 4,170
Taiwan-invested companies, involving four billion US dollars of
Taiwan funds.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has become the second-largest investment source for the
province, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, as one of the earliest provinces in the country to
adopt the opening-up policy, took the lead in wooing Taiwan funds.
</P>
<P>
Its advantageous geographical position of being close to Taiwan
island and the local government's efficient work style have
promoted the development of Taiwan investment.
</P>
<P>
A lot of large Taiwan-invested projects have been introduced to
the province. In 1995, for example, 22 Taiwan-funded projects
involving over 10 million US dollars each were carried out in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The investment structure was further improved with more and
more funds flowing into the agriculture and service sectors. Last
year 2.3 percent of Taiwan investment flowed into agriculture,
while 76 percent went into manufacturing and 21 percent into the
service sector.
</P>
<P>
Social stability and the improved investment environment have
brought abundant economic returns for Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that 85 percent of the Taiwan-funded
companies in the province are profitable.

<HEADLINE> China Reforming Health Care System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The days of free medical care
for Chinese workers are coming to an end, as more and more people
in state-owned firms pay part of their medical costs.
</P>
<P>
The change comes after millions of workers enjoyed free health
care for several decades.
</P>
<P>
The major health care reform was first launched in 1984 in the
cities of Jiujiang and Zhenjiang, in east China's Jiangxi Province
and Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
So far 28 provinces and municipal cities in the country have
implemented similar health care reforms.
</P>
<P>
Free health care played an important role in the lives of
ordinary workers since it was brought in shortly after the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
But with the co-existence of various economic sectors a free
health care system, which only conforms to a state-owned economy,
can no longer meet the needs of society.
</P>
<P>
In addition, higher medical costs have become a heavy burden on
the country, and state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that medical costs of state-owned enterprises
are increasing by an annual rate of 18.9 percent, surpassing the
growth rate of the gross national product (GNP), and state revenue.
</P>
<P>
In line with the pilot health care reform plans launched in the
two cities, personal accounts and social pool funds for medical
care are being established on a wide scale.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises are expected to contribute ten percent
of their employee's salary, and the employees should pay one
percent of their own wages, to medical departments, as an
insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
Employees can submit their medical expenses to the social funds
after their personal deposits are used up. Jiujiang City has also
introduced a limit on the number of medicines prescribed to 1,100
types.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 5,517 firms, with 473,600 employees in
Jiujiang City, and 3,845 firms in Zhenjiang City have joined such
insurance schemes.
</P>
<P>
The two cities have curbed the rapid growth of medical costs,
and have kept a balance between revenue and expenditure of medical
insurance funds since the implementation of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey shows that over 71 percent of the participants
in new health care systems in Jiujiang City are satisfied with the
system, while 130 out of 150 firms in Zhenjiang City are
satisfied.

BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than a third of families in
urban China will have telephones by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
And millions more will be walking around with mobile phones,
and sending messages by fax machines, as a telecommunications
revolution spreads.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures predict that there will be nine to 10 telephones
for every 100 people in China, and as many as 30 to 40 for every
100 in urban areas, by the turn of this century, the "People's
Post and Telecommunications Journal" reported.
</P>
<P>
It means that by then 130 million telephones, and switchboards
with a handling capacity of 170 million lines, will be in use in
China.
</P>
<P>
Almost 80 million telephones, and nearly 95 million new
switchboard lines, will be added during the coming five years to
boost telephone handling capacities.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the country's total demand for telephones
this year will reach about 65 million, two million more mobile
phones, nine million beepers and almost one million fax machines.
</P>
<P>
Handling capacities of telephone switchboards will be increased
this year to add 20 million lines, with demand for long distance
lines increasing by nearly seven million lines.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 boxes of fake
cookies, supposedly from Kjeldsens, a Danish trade mark registered
in China, were crushed to bits by a steamroller last week in
Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province in south China,
</P>
<P>
The event was part of a crackdown on trademark infringement by
Guangdong authorities over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Information provided by the Provincial Administration of
Commerce and Industry says that it has dealt with 2,300 trademark
infringement cases since 1983, when the Chinese trademark law went
into effect. fines of 20 million yuan were levied and two million
yuan in damages was paid. More than 40 of the cases involved
criminal law offences.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,300 cases, one-third involved complaints from
trademark owners, administration officials said, while the others
were uncovered during market inspections or from tip-offs provided
by consumers.
</P>
<P>
In last October, the Administration of Commerce and Industry of
Shantou City raided a printing house after receiving a tip-off in
a letter, and found materials for printing "Toshiba", "555", and
other well-known brands. The factory was fined severely.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, authorities have uncovered cases
involving infringement of Esso, Shell, Philips, and other foreign
trademarks.
</P>
<P>
In a crackdown during the fourth quarter of 1995, authorities
uncovered 800 cases during a massive sweep of 2,700 stores, 500
markets, 3,000 printing houses, and 2,000 manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The province's efforts at trademark protection have won praise
from foreign businesses. Companies from the U.S., Britain, the
Netherlands, and Hong Kong have expressed their appreciation for
its distinguished work.

<HEADLINE> 5 Nepalese Ministers Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Five Nepalese ministers
resigned today to support a no-confidence motion filed by the
Communist Party of Nepal (NML) against the three-party coalition
government led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
The UML, the country's main opposition, tabled the motion
Wednesday against the ruling coalition of the Nepali Congress (NC)
Party, the National Democratic Party (RPP) and the Goodwill Party.
</P>
<P>
RPP spokesman Narayan Dutta Bhatta told Xinhua that five
ministers from the RPP handed in their resignations this morning.
</P>
<P>
They are Agriculture Minister Padma Sunder Lawati, Local
Development Minister Kamal Thapa, State Minister for Local
Development Ram Krishna Acharya, Assistant Minister for Land
Reform Prem Bahadur Bhandari and Assistant Minister for Commerce
Rajiv Paraguli.
</P>
<P>
The RPP is divided into two camps on the issue of the UML
motion as its parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand stands
for the RPP's withdrawal from the ruling coalition while RPP
President Surya Bahadur Thapa opposes the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The UML has offered to form an RPP-led coalition government
with Chand as prime minister if the motion is passed in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion is scheduled to be put to vote Sunday
at the on-going special session of the Lower House.

<P>
With its 19 members of parliament and 13 seats in the 44-seat
coalition cabinet, the RPP could play a decisive role in the
current political situation in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Lady Died Three Years Ago But Body 'Lives' On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) --As Zhou Fengchen lies in her bed
there is a delicate fragrance. Her hands and feet still retain
their color, and her white hair shines as it has always done.
</P>
<P>
Now a procession of researchers from a wide area are visiting
Zhou's home in an effort to unravel a mystery phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a native of Xianghe County, Hebei Province, died three
years ago, but her body has never decomposed.
</P>
<P>
"The heart of my grandmother stopped beaten in Beijing on
November 24, 1992. However, her temperature remained normal for
ten hours, and her muscles remained elastic," Yang Xueqiang, staff
officer of a research institution of an armored force engineering
institute, recalled.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that his grandmother's temperature did not fall
until two days after her death, but her body remained supple. Her
hands and feet felt just like a living body.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, all the family members and I decided to keep
grandmother's body," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the spring-summer period of 1993, Yang and his family
members were surprised to find that the body was dry, and her face
looked the same as before. Her body was still not decomposing,
had no peculiar smell, and major joints could still be moved.
</P>
<P>
"Her neck was not stiff and her head could be move freely,"
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, 1993, Zhou's body was sent and placed in Huzhuangzi
Village in Xianghe County, Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The body has survived three years of hot summers, with the
temperature as high as 34 degrees centigrade and 90 percent
relative humidity, and of winters as cold as zero degree
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Lit by an electric torch, the woman's hands and feet still
reflect red light, and the body gives off a delicate fragrance.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of Zhou Fengchen has aroused the interest of
experts who have visited Xianghe County, one after another.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jinchuan, a researcher in traditional culture, who inspected
the body, said that the existence of the phenomenon has indicated
that mankind has many unanswered mysteries.

<HEADLINE> Brisbane To Host Asia Pacific Cities Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia took the initiate to
forge political and economic links between cities within the Asian
Pacific region as part of its efforts to put substance in the APEC
framework.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Brisbane, the capital city of
Queensland state in northeast Australia, will host the first
Cities of Asia Pacific Conference between September and October.
</P>
<P>
Jim Soorley, Lord Mayor of Brisbane, said that the conference
would provide an opportunity for mayors of all the major cities in
the Asia Pacific rim to get together and establish political,
economic and trade contacts.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that cities in the region have a
forum to discuss issues they are commonly concerned with.
</P>
<P>
Many of the cities have already been linked with each other.
For example, Brisbane has formed sister-city relations with
Shenzhen, the first coastal city that was opened up to the outside
world in China.
</P>
<P>
Near 50 mayors in the region have received invitation from the
organizers of the conference, so far 30 of them have promised to
attend.
</P>
<P>
"The economy in the Asian Pacific rim, in fact, is going to be
driven by the cities," Soorley said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the cities have a key role to play to make the APEC
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) agreement a reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the most vigorous economic bloc in the world, the Asia
Pacific circle has seen its cities booming. Now there are a total
of 18 million people living in big cities at the rim of Pacific.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the conference organizers showed that
despite the various development conditions in the major cities,
the majority of them have similar issues on top of their agenda.
The issues include waste management, environmental services,
sewage and water treatment, transport, people movement and city
planning.
</P>
<P>
"One of the beautiful things of this conference is that cities
can learn from one another," said conference secretariat Richard
Joel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cities would be able to exchange their
experience and expertise in addressing these problems facing them.
For example, Brisbane could teach other cities on reducing air
pollution, while Hong Kong could teach others how to deal with
traffic movement.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 800-1,000 attendants of the conference will be
representatives from business circles in the cities.
</P>
<P>
"The second element of the conference is to bring the business
leaders together, so we can network and start to look at the
business opportunities that exist between our cities and, maybe
more importantly, by partnership among the cities," Soorley said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference would be like a one-stop shop for
expertise and technologies from all around the region. Attending
companies might also see business opportunities in projects
provided by city governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference has received support from the newly elected
Federal Government under John Howard. The expenses of the
conference will be shared by the attending cities. Australian
companies will also sponsor the conference and hold displays in
the city during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Urged to Allot Tickets to "Tainted" Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Some state leaders of India's
ruling Congress party have put their party leadership in a dilemma
by pleading that former ministers charged in the hawala case be
allowed to contest the general elections, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, including Madhya pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay
Singh who was reportedly at odds with four hawala-tainted
ministers from the state, have urged the Congress party central
leadership not to make charges in the hawala case the sole
criterion while considering the claims of the tainted politicians
for the party ticket.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is a 18-million-U.S.-dollar bribery scandal.
Seven ministers of the incumbent government have resigned for
allegedly receiving money from illegal foreign exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
"Merely filing of the charge sheet does not make these
politicians a criminal. The cases are going on in the court and
one is innocent till proved guilty," Digvijay said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the ability to win and loyalty to the party should
be the grounds for allotting the party tickets to the charged
politicians.
</P>
<P>
However, some other senior leaders of the Congress party have
urged the party leadership not to give tickets to the tainted
politicians.
</P>
<P>
They argue that allotment of tickets to these politicians will
turn the whole exercise of fighting the political corruption
meaningless and the party would lose the electoral advantage that
could come to its way.
</P>
<P>
Congress party President and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
is yet to make his mind public on this thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
Though he had expressed resentment against those who were
pressing for denial of tickets to these politicians, he is still
weighing pros and cons of ignoring the claims of these former
ministers, according to a source to Rao.
</P>
<P>
"They have the potential of damaging the party election in
their respective constituencies if denied the ticket," the source
said.

<HEADLINE> 460,000 Staff Join Unemployment Insurance Scheme in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 460,000 workers in
China's island province of Hainan have joined an unemployment
insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
It represents over 92 percent of staff employed in 8,700 of
the province's work units.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment insurance fees have reached over 17 million yuan
(about 2.05 million US dollars) in this far south province.
</P>
<P>
Some financial institutions have previously been reluctant to
take part in local unemployment insurance schemes. They signed-up
after the unemployment insurance companies made unremitting
efforts to persuade them.
</P>
<P>
According to local unemployment insurance regulations, those
who intentionally delay the payment of unemployment insurance
fees, or refuse to pay, will be legally forced to pay-up, to
ensure the interests of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
At present 400 unemployed people who have registered at the
unemployment insurance institutions, get 200 yuan (about 24
dollars) in unemployment insurance each month.

<HEADLINE> India's Election Commission Urged to Change  Poll Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Some Indian political parties
and Muslim organizations Thursday appealed to the Election
Commission to postpone the polling for general elections from
April 27 to a later date as it clashed with the Muslim festival of
Id-ul-Zuha, the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission announced Tuesday that the elections to
the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) will be held in four
phases on April 27, May 2, May 7 and May 21.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Sehan,
representatives of the Janata Dal, Muslim League and Indian
National League said Id was likely to fall on April 28-29 and
would make it difficult for the Muslims to exercise their right of
franchise properly.
</P>
<P>
As a number of states and union territories were scheduled to
go to polls on April 27, it would be better if the date was
postponed by at least a week, they said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the fixed date, that is April 27, the Muslims can
neither use their right of franchise properly nor take part in the
election campaign as per usual enthusiasm," the Times of India
quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a related report of the Press Trust of India, the
Election Commission will soon take a decision concerning polling
on April 27 as it had received several requests asking it to
postpone voting on this day in view of Id-ul-Zuha festival.
</P>
<P>
The commission said Thursday that it would give a serious
consideration to all these request and decide upon it very soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said in Beijing today that China is ready to further its friendly
relations with the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark during a meeting with visiting ROK
Foreign Minister Gong Ro-Myung and his party, saying the relations
should develop on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence. The host and guest talked about bilateral relations
and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
After conveying ROK President Kim Young-Sam's regards to Jiang,

<HEADLINE> Housing Remains Top Priority in Property Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to give top
priority to urban housing construction in the government's real
estate development programme, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The country expects to see a steady growth in housing demand in
the coming years as a housing shortage still troubles most urban
Chinese families, the English-language newspaper quoted Li
Zhendong, vice-minister of construction, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years China will build 1.24 billion sq m more
floor space in an effort to raise the per capita living space to
nine sq m from the present 7.9 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper went on to say that 60 percent of the new houses
will be commercial because the government plans to reform the
decade-old welfare-oriented public housing distribution system.
</P>
<P>
This year, the ministry will make efforts to improve housing
quality, solve problems in the relocation of families during urban
renovation, and build affordable housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to widespread housing quality problems, the
ministry has vowed to strengthen management in the building market
this year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that in some places improper removal of
old houses and unsatisfactory resettlement of the former residents
have caused serious problems, including complaints from outraged
owners and even seizure of commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
The official urged localities to consider both construction and
the interest of residents. "The two sides concerned with the
removal should reach an agreement about compensation,
resettlement, and the quality of new houses before any
construction is begun."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Refuses Caretaker Government  Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi mainstream opposition
parties Thursday declared that the people who had resisted the
February 15 election would not accept any law passed by the
"illegal" parliament based on that election.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Awami (people's) League (AL), Jatiya (national)
Party and Jamaat-e-Islami observed at a joint meeting that the
parliament had no right to pass the caretaker government bill.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Thursday
introduced in the parliament a constitutional amendment bill
providing for the formation of a non-party caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the BNP government's move to amend the constitution,
AL Organizing Secretary Mohammad Nasim said, "any attempt to
legalize the present parliament will only aggravate the prevailing
political crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the BNP accepted the concept of a caretaker
government it could resolve the crisis by forming this kind of
government through a presidential reference to the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
The BNP argued that only the parliament has the right to amend
the constitution since the constitution has no provision for
holding general elections under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Under the same pretext, the BNP, with some small parties and
independences, on February 15 held a general polls without the
participation of the major opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, who has been seeking a fresh election under a
neutral caretaker government since two years ago, resorted to an
indefinite non-cooperation campaign starting from March 9 to press
for the resignation of the BNP government and annulment of the
February 15 elections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Agrees to Expand B-2 Bomber Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
ordered the U.S. Air Force to expand its planned fleet of B-2
"stealth" bombers from 20 to 21, the Pentagon announced today.
</P>
<P>
The order was seen as a slight compromise by the White House
under pressure from the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that Clinton had
changed his mind and ordered one test model of the B-2 bomber to
be upgraded to operational status for the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had announced on February 8 that he did not intend to
order any more B-2s and that the money appropriated by Congress
for B-2s in the 1996 defense budget would be used to upgrade the
originally planned 20.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon will now spend 493 million U.S. dollars to upgrade
the single extra jet, which includes strengthening the landing
gear and modifying the "skin" of the plane to make it stealthy,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force currently has 10 B-2s in its fleet with five
more in various stages of production.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had said that the planned fleet of 20 B-2s, which
cost 1 billion dollars each, is sufficient for the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
But Congress has been pressing the Clinton administration to
double the B-2 fleet to 40 planes at a cost of up to 30 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon study in 1995 concluded that additional money in the
nation's heavy bomber program should be spent on more
sophisticated cruise missiles, swing-wing B-1s and upgrading
aging B-52 bombers.

<HEADLINE> GM, UAW Union Agree to End 17-Day Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. (GM) and
the United Auto Workers (UAW) reached an agreement today for
ending the 17-day strike that idled more than 177,000 employees
and crippled the world's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
The strike started on March 5 by some 3,000 UAW members at two
braker-making plants at Dayton, Ohio, in protest against the
company's "outsourcing" which could cause reduction of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
The strike, the longest in the past 26 years against GM, has
forced the company to shut down 26 of its 29 North American
assembly plants and 18 parts plants in the United States, Canada
and Mexico. It also affected work at countless independent
suppliers and hurt related services such as restaurants that
depend on the autoworkers.
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement have not been made public. A
ratification vote by the striking workers is set for Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is approved, the factories in Dayton which
supply all brakers and braking parts for the GM assembly plants,
could resume production the same day. However, GM said most other
plants could take one week to return to normal operation after
parts shipments from Dayton resume.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
welcomed a decision by the British government earlier in the day
to hold elections in Northern Ireland ahead of the planned peace
talks on June.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement today is in that context of moving all
parties to the all-party talks," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said in a statement, adding that the White House regards
the British proposal as "a constructive step" towards a lasting
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major has set May 30 as the date
for elections leading to the all-party peace talks in
Ulster. Under Major's proposal, voters from the region will chose
110 members of a forum from which negotiators for the talks will
be drawn.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that the Clinton administration considered the
proposal a positive effort by the British government to break the
deadlock over the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also repeated the call for the parties concerned
to restore ceasefire in the region. The 18-month ceasefire in
Ulster was abruptly interrupted by the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
in February with a bombing in London.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Russian-NATO Talks on Expansion Reach Impasse  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite claims that NATO
chief Javier Solana's Moscow trip was successful, Russia and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization have failed to resolve
their quarrel over the alliance's plan to expand into eastern
Europe, both holding firm to their positions.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a three-day official
visit, the first by a NATO Secretary-General in four years, with
the aim of softening Russia's tough stand against NATO's eastward
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his talks with Russian leaders, including President
Boris Yeltsin, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, Solana told a news conference that "a good
working relationship with Russian authorities has been
established."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two sides agreed to draft a special
program for cooperation in 1996 and to set up a Russian permanent
mission at NATO's headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
However, on NATO's eastward enlargement, Solana said that "the
positions of the Russian authorities are the same today (Thursday)
as they were yesterday (Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
The two sides' positions "are still very much different," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Moscow remains strongly opposed NATO's plan to embrace former
Soviet bloc countries. Grachev said both sides still had
"different approaches" on the issue after his talks with Solana on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in January, Grachev said Russia would be forced to
review the deployment of its tactical nuclear weapons and its
military obligations if NATO expanded eastwards. Yeltsin has also
warned that NATO's enlargement could trigger a new Cold War in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Solana on Thursday, Yeltsin reiterated
Russia's strong opposition to NATO's expansion, stressing that
Moscow is against creating new dividing lines in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said
Wednesday that NATO would press ahead with enlargement.
</P>
<P>
NATO's enlargement "is on track and it will happen," he
stressed at a meeting with foreign ministers of 12 Central and
East European countries in Prague.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in Moscow on Thursday for a three-day visit
expected to cover NATO's expansion plans. He will meet Yeltsin and
Primakov on Friday before attending a meeting of the five-nation
Contact Group on Bosnia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO's decision to expand eastward, taken in 1994,
remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"It will be implemented without regard to any circumstances that
might come up," he said.
</P>
<P>
A final decision to begin admitting new member-nations into
NATO may be made by the end of 1996, according to both Solana and
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's stand, which was repeatedly explained by President
Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Primakov, remains clear and unchanged
-- we are against NATO's extension eastwards," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Grigory Karasin said. "It is not the question of
Russia's obstinacy, it is a question of its national interests."

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Steps Up Protection of Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province has
effectively curbed the sharp shrinkage of arable land by resorting
to legal, economic and administrative means.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the annual decrease rate of arable land has slowed
from 26,600 ha to 13,300 ha.
</P>
<P>
The province, located on the Loess Plateau, has long suffered
severe soil erosion, shortage of arable land and random
occupation of farmland.
</P>
<P>
To protect farmland, the Provincial People's Congress Standing
Committee passed the Basic Farmland Protection Rules, placing
2.84 million ha of farmland, or 76 percent of the total arable
land, under protection.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has recovered 11,300 ha of farmland
by removing illegal constructions, development zones and free
markets which illegally occupied farmland.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Shanxi is launching a large-scale reclamation
project, and has so far reclaimed 182,000 ha of farmland. The
Xiaoyi Aluminum Mine combines mining with land reclamation,
and plans to reclaim 690 ha of arable land, or 73.8 of its total
occupied land in the coming 25 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Some Spanish groups appealed for
saving water today in face of the serious water waste in the
country.
</P>
<P>
People should enhance the consciousness to save water and learn
to be concerned about and protect water resources, said the groups
in their message delivered today in commemoration of Friday's
International Water Day.
</P>
<P>
The groups attached great importance to water saving in
agriculture, which uses 62 percent of the water nationwide. Water
used in industry and by residents account for 26 percent and 12
percent of the water respectively.
</P>
<P>
Spain, in which every person uses an average of 1,188 cubic
meters of water every year, is one of the European countries with
the largest water consumption, according to the statistics of
those groups.
</P>
<P>
The big water consumption is mainly attributed to the
non-restriction on family water use in big cities and the
incomplete water supply system.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Push Anti-Bribery Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The German government has announced
new measures aiming to intensify its anti-bribery campaign by
imposing more draconian punishment against this crime.
</P>
<P>
In a package of measures unveiled on Thursday, Interior
Minister Manfred Kanther and new Justice Minister Edzart
Schmidt-Jortzig suggested the administrative institutions be
restructured to prevent the crime of bribery.
</P>
<P>
The restructured institutions will minimize the possibility of
paying and taking bribes. From now on, there will be at least two
officials to make decisions in awarding bids of public projects.
</P>
<P>
The public services which are vulnerable to bribes will adopt a
rotary system to avoid the personal involvement in
project-bidding, according to the measures.
</P>
<P>
The package also proposed the amendment of criminal laws in
order to deter the illegal bidding for public projects. It called
for the maximum imprisonment of 10 years for the criminals
involving a serious case of bribery, and of 15 years for the
judges who knowingly commit the crime of bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
The government will assign special anti-bribery officials in
the administrative institutions who act as the liaison officers
between the public services and the common citizens, it added.
</P>
<P>
Kanther also announced that the government will require
officials who have a second occupation to report their incomes
from this job.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 3,000 cases of bribery involving German
public servants annually, inflicting an annual loss of 4 billion
marks (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) on the economy.

by one year, Tietmeyer said during a seminar held in Stromberg,
Germany prior to the forthcoming EU Turin summit scheduled for
March 29.
</P>
<P>
He said EMU "would not ease the unemployment crisis" and could
turn out to be a "terrible nightmare."
</P>
<P>
Monetary union would also not help to stabilize exchange rates,
the central banker said, adding that exchange rates between
several major European currencies have in any case stayed nearly
unchanged since 1987.
</P>
<P>
His remarks added fuel to the arguments of Eurosceptics in the
15-member European Union who oppose political and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
However, German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said that EMU was "part of the future" and the inevitable
result of Europe's single market.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Wednesday also voiced opposition
to any delays in the launching of EMU.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Bonn that a postponement would
lead to the appreciation of the Deutschemark and bring "disastrous
consequences" for German exports.
</P>
<P>
Job creation also would be tougher if the EMU was not be
launched on time on January 1, 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
EU Commission president Jaques Santer, government officials,
economists and bankers of EU member states participated in the
Stromberg seminar.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the reform and enlargement of the EU and
the forthcoming inter-governmental conference in Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit in Turin is expected to revise the
Maastricht Treaty, which lays out the goals and deadlines for the
EU's political and monetary union.

PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali today again called on U.N. member-states to pay
their dues, saying the world body faces a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with French President Jacques Chirac here
today, Boutros-Ghali said that unpaid membership dues totaled
nearly three billion U.S. dollars and would hinder the U.N. from

<P>
He also said reforms of the U.N. system could only take place
when the financial crisis is settled.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief thanked France for having paid its membership
dues and for urging other U.N. member countries, especially United
States, to pay their dues as soon as possible.
</P>

for Russia to sign a friendship and cooperation treaty cementing
their partnership.

It also confirmed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will
visit Ukraine on April 4 to 5 after having delayed his visit

The Ukrainian prime minister said that the two countries were
still failing to reach agreement concerning Black Sea ports to be

<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian wool prices
dropped slightly this week.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator ended the week one cent lower than
the close of last week. It stood at 569 cents a kilogram clean
when local markets wrapped up the week, the Australian Council of
Wool Exporters (ACWE) said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator also fell one cent to 553 cents
per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 75,871 bales of wool were offered at auctions in
local markets this week, only 9.9 percent of them were sold.
</P>
<P>
An ACWE official blamed subdued demand in international market
for the drop of wool prices. But he said that there was a positive
sign in the market that China continued to increase orders.
</P>
<P>
However, growing stockpiles of wool and a strengthening
Australian dollar will have a negative effect on wool prices, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Prices will probably fall further when the largest offering in
the season is put on auctions in Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle
next week, with 126,900 bales for sale.

<HEADLINE> OAS Chief Says Congress Must Resolve Colombian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
Congress must resolve the political crisis arising from charges
that President Ernesto Samper had received funds from
drug-traffickers, the chief of the Organization of American States
(OAS) said today.
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that I believe in the Congress' role, that the
Congress is the scenario where the present crisis must be resolved,"
said OAS Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
Samper has been accused of receiving money from the Cali drug
cartel to finance the electoral campaign that brought him to power
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The OAS secretary-general has been here since Wednesday to
participate in a ministerial meeting which aims to lay the basis
for the establishment of an American Free Trade Zone by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
The role of the Colombian Congress in the crisis has been
questioned because of allegations that many of its members also
receive drug-related money and belong to a corrupt political class.
</P>
<P>
"What Congress is doing is the democratic action the national
constitution mandates. I think that it is not fair to disqualify
it beforehand. I think this damages the constitution," said
Gaviria, who governed Colombia from 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria met with Samper today to discuss Colombia's political
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Congress is investigating the charges against Samper while
the General Prosecutor's Office is investigating three cabinet
ministers and several of Samper's former associates for the same
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the demands by several political and business
leaders for Samper's resignation, Gaviria only said that the
crisis must be resolved according to the country's institutions
and laws. enditem

<HEADLINE> Quick Growing Fish is a Real Catch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Genetic science has succeeded in
solving the problem of a slow growing fish that is popular in
northern China.
</P>
<P>
Now crucian carp can grow ten percent quicker, without
suffering in quality, thanks to the new technique.
</P>
<P>
The method, developed by the Heilongjiang Applied
Microorganism Institute through genetic engineering, has now
passed official assessments in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the institute extracted growing hormone genes
from carp, and inject them into fertilized eggs of crucian. The
two kinds of gene combined together to make a "trans-gene crucian".
</P>
<P>
Experiments showed that the introduced gene combined well with
the original gene, enabling genetically-bred crucian to grow 10
percent faster than usual, without affecting the quality of its
taste.
</P>
<P>
Crucian is a freshwater fish enjoyed by northern Chinese, but
slow growth posed a problem until now.

<HEADLINE> China's First Voice-Activated Bilingual Typing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Computer software that can eat its
own words -- bilingually -- has been invented by researchers in
China.
</P>
<P>
The team has come up with a clever idea that combines a
voice-activated word recognition system that can also understand
both Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
The researchers at Northwest China Engineering University in
Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, believe
their invention is the country's first simplified voice-activated
typing system.
</P>
<P>
What makes the invention more impressive is that the VCP-1
system is bilingual. Until now only a few overseas countries had
voice-activated typing systems, and bilingual software. But there
have been no method to combine both functions.
</P>
<P>
The system, aimed at simplifying word processing, consists of
at least a 386 computer, a printer, a microphone, a special
linguistic card, and a set of special software, which runs under
Microsoft Windows. The software is the key part of the system.
</P>
<P>
People who can speak standard Chinese and American English are
best suited to the system, otherwise, users need a little time to
teach the system how to recognize their voice.
</P>
<P>
The system can understand what the user is saying if the words
are repeated five times.
</P>
<P>
The system has an accuracy of above 90 percent in
voice-activated typing, if the number of words to be processed
remains below 2,000. The accuracy is at least 81 percent when the
system is used to do inter-translations of English and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Before starting the system, users need to establish a file
under windows, and then speak to the microphone.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded visit by
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda breathed new life into
relations between Moscow and Tokyo, a Russian Foreign Ministry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
After a period of stagnation, Russo-Japanese ties have gained
momentum toward constructive cooperation in recent years through
the expansion of political contacts, Grigory Karasin, director of
the Foreign Ministry's Press Bureau, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news service quoted Karasin as saying that Russia
had promised Ikeda that it would develop friendly and mutually
beneficial relations with Japan on the basis of the Tokyo
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
During Ikeda's visit, the two sides kept away from their
dispute over the southern Kurile Islands and reached some economic

<HEADLINE> Most Nicaraguan Pre-Schoolers Suffer Vitamin A Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-seven percent of Nicaraguan
pre-schoolers suffer vitamin A deficiency that could cause eye
problems for them, the Health Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of the reported cases were serious, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans, especially women of child-bearing age, are also
suffering iron deficiency. In Nicaragua, women of child-bearing
age account for 36 percent of women's total population.
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency causes pregnancy complications, makes it hard
for the delivery and nursing period, and affects the growth of
children.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry blames the deficiency of these
micro-nutrients to the lack of a balanced diet, which was caused
by bad feeding habits and economic problems that prevent many
families from buying food, rich in vitamin A and iron.
</P>
<P>
Mirna Zelaya, coordinator of the Health Ministry's National
Program of Micronutrients, said the Ministry will continue
administering vitamin A doses to children under 10 years of age
and iron to child-bearing-age and pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry plans to start in April the First National
Health Day, giving doses of vitamin A to a million children and
iron-supplements to 190,000 women in the nation, the coordinator
added.

<HEADLINE> China's Water Minister Calls for All Out Effort on Conservancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Drought and water shortages have
become a bottleneck in the economic development of China, the
country's Water Resources Minister said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister, Niu Maosheng, was speaking on "World Water Day"
on the need for water control in the world's most populated
country.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out a series of activities to mark the fourth
special day devoted to water issues.
</P>
<P>
China, as a country with short supplies of water per head of
population, has spared no effort in protecting water resources,
and raising water utilization efficiency, according to Niu.
</P>
<P>
He said that drought and lack of water has become the
bottleneck of China's economic development, especially in the
northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that drought played the worst role in the
country's grain production problems.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s drought-stricken acreage in China reached 26
million hectares every year. And in the four years in which
China's grain output fluctuated, grain output decreased by 35
billion kilograms each year because of drought.
</P>
<P>
Niu has called for a common effort to build water conservancy
projects to increase irrigated acreage across China's arable land.
</P>
<P>
China has arable land of 64 million ha, which is suitable for
irrigation. But the actual irrigated acreage in the country every
year is only 40 million ha, as a result of inadequate irrigation
construction.
</P>
<P>
At present, north China is suffering from serious drought, and
the situation is getting worse. All drought-stricken areas are
taking steps to fight the problem.
</P>
<P>
Niu's comments came in a full page message to the people of
China, published in today's edition of "People's Daily". He also
spoke of other water related problems in the country, including
flood control and soil erosion problems.

</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, rallying to mark the International Day for

The groups opposed the government's construction of a

They said the wall is an exclusive performance instead of an

PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- French police launched this week a
nationwide crackdown on the Solar Temple doomsday cult in an
attempt to ward off another mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said police, armed with a list of the cult's
members, had arrested about 50 people and searched homes and
offices during the three-day operation.
</P>
<P>
Among those detained were a tailor who made the robes worn by
disciples during rituals and the cult members in charge of
financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the charred bodies of 16 cult members, including
three children, were found in a remote Alpine forest clearing in
eastern France. Police described the deaths as a mix of suicide
and murder.
</P>
<P>
Police launched the crackdown because this week contains three
dates which might have led to another collective suicide: the full

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
increased economic development by paying closer attention to
economic efficiency during the past several years, according to
local government sources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, the province had a gross
domestic product of 345 billion yuan, putting it in the lead in
the country.
</P>
<P>
More prominent success can be seen in farmers' income. In 1995,
their per capita income reached 2,900 yuan, leading the country.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed this to the local government's
efforts to improve efficiency in developing the economy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the local government has made detailed policies to
support companies which show good returns, and has encouraged
large-scale groups and the development of name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial plan, by the end of the century,
the province will have more than 200 products whose names are
known in China.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the building of key projects, the local government
adjusted the investment structure, strictly controlling the
investment scale and the number of new projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, investment in fixed assets in the province reached 130
billion yuan, 39 times that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
The province also promoted the development of open areas, which
now account for 44 percent of the province's total acreage.

<HEADLINE> China's First Couplet Copyright Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The intermediate people's court of
this capital of central China's Hubei Province has made the final
judgment in the country's first copyright suit concerning an
antithetical couplet, a traditional Chinese literary form.
</P>
<P>
Tu Guangyong, an associate professor of the Chinese Department
of the Central China Teacher's University won the case against Li
Yunxian, a woman farmer in Hanchuan County.
</P>
<P>
Antithetical couplets, which consist of two sentences and have
rigid writing formats, are usually written on red paper and pasted
on the door frames, usually during festival seasons.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the authorities of the Yellow Crane Tower Park and the
"Hubei Daily" jointly held a couplet contest to commemorate the
re-opening of the tower, one of the most famous in China. A
couplet by Yin Yunzhang, a retired accountant in Hanchuan County,
was selected and hung at the north gate of the tower. Tu Guangyong
considered that Yin had plagiarized a couplet of his published in
the local "Changjiang Daily" on Feb 22, 1981. The tower
authorities accepted Tu's appeal and erased Yin's signature from
under the couplet. Yin insisted on his authorship until he died of
illness.
</P>
<P>
On June 15, 1995, Li Yunxian, Lin's wife, took the case to the
people's court of the Wuchang District of Wuhan and asked that the
copyright of the couplet be bestowed on her husband. The court
decided that Yin had not plagiarized Tu's work, and the case was
widely reported under the headline "Woman Farmer Defeats Professor
in Plagiary Case". This caused great controversy among
educational, literary and publishing circles.
</P>
<P>
When Tu appealed, the intermediate people's court of Wuhan
consulted experts on couplets and copyright.
</P>
<P>
The experts reached the consensus that, in terms of the time of
creation and publication, Tu's work was at least two years and
three months earlier than that of Yin; and in terms of the format
and contents of the works, only five words of Yin's couplets
belonged to himself and the rest were identical to those of Tu's.
</P>
<P>
The court made the final judgment on the basis of the experts'
opinions.

<P>
CHANGSHA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China
has seen some improvements in its investment environment of roads,
telecommunications, power supply, and other infrastructure over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the 1991-1995 period, the
province spent 26.6 billion yuan on infrastructure projects, which
accounted for 79 percent of investment in key projects.
</P>
<P>
Top priority was given to road construction, where investment
amounted to 7.4 billion yuan in that period, three times that of
the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 4,511 km of highways including 231 km of
high-grade ones, 104 km of electrified railway lines, and one
airport were opened.
</P>
<P>
The province's power generating capacity increased by two
million kw in the same period, thanks to the construction and
expansion of several power plants, with a total investment of 10
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, none of its 14 cities had a digitized phone
system, except for the provincial capital Changsha. Digital
networks have now been extended to all major towns. An investment
of 9.2 billion yuan has added 1.56 million new lines to its
telephone network.
</P>
<P>
Hunan's cities have also been improving their planning and
public utilities, with 90 percent of the cities and 79 percent of
the county-seats having worked out construction plans, compared
with a 30 percent of the nation on average.
</P>

billion yuan on roads, water plants, and sewage treatment plants,
leading to improvements in the quality of life.

BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A family of four people living in
southern Beijing for the first time bought 10,000 yuan (1,205 US
dollars) in half-year discount treasury bonds just before the
Spring Festival which fell on February 19.
</P>
<P>
The wife told "China Daily" that she and her husband like such
investments and they have 40,000-50,000 yuan in bank savings.
</P>
<P>
The financial situation of this family is typical among more
than three million households in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Results from a sample survey by the municipal statistics bureau
suggest that Beijing residents' per capita annual income stands at
6,000 yuan, and the average of urban households per capita income
is around 3,890 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to local banks, savings deposits in Beijing reached
125.39 billion yuan by the end of 1995, in which more than 90
percent was in fixed deposits. Economic experts say actual
personal deposits of Beijing residents should stand at 80-90
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents' foreign exchange deposits totalled 3.47
billion US dollars last year, all of which comprised personal
savings.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 11.55 billion yuan worth of treasury bonds was
issued in the capital city and the figure in 1994 was more than 9
billion.
</P>
<P>
As many as 300,000 Beijing residents now engage in the stock
trade. Share transactions in the city reached 4.7 billion yuan in
1995 while transactions in 1990 were almost zero.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 5.73 billion yuan in enterprise securities were
issued in Beijing last year, which indicates billions of

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan Benefiting Chinese TB Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank loan has helped the
Ministry of Public Health implement a world-standard therapy for
tuberculosis in 1,132 counties in China's 12 provinces, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A six-year program launched in 1992 with a 58 million US dollar
loan from the World Bank has so far covered areas with 560 million
people in China, nearly half of the country's total population,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
More than 340,000 people with infectious TB have received free
medical treatment, and more than 90 percent of them have
completely recovered.
</P>
<P>
TB can be cured if a patient takes medicines regularly and
continues regular treatment for six to eight months. The danger of
starting and stopping treatment is that the patient may develop
drug-resistant TB, which is currently hard to treat.
</P>
<P>
In the treatment program, known as "directly, observed-
treatment, short course" therapy, health workers watch as their
patients swallow a standardized combination of medicine throughout
their treatment, which experts with the World Health Organization
believe is the only effective way to prevent a global plague of
incurable drug-resistant TB.
</P>
<P>
Up to 50 million people worldwide may already carry strains of
TB that are resistant to one or more of the most common anti-TB
drugs.
</P>
<P>
In China, there are currently some six million "smear positive"
TB patients, or patients who can spread the disease to others, a
quarter of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that each of the "smear positive" patients may
spread the germs to 10 to 15 people a year.
</P>
<P>
Each year, some 250,000 people die of TB nationwide, mostly
young and middle-aged people in the remote, underserviced and
economically disadvantaged countryside.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Fengzeng, a member of the National Advisory
Committee on TB, China has greatly reduced the risk of infections
for upcoming generations by vaccinating all children throughout
the country.

<P>
KUNMING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Hospice care, a newly-emerging
service, is making remarkable progress in China as more and more
people are coming to understand and accept it.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's 22 provinces, cities and autonomous regions
have set up some 200 hospice care organizations or started such
services.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 60 countries and regions worldwide which
have opened hospice care services since it appeared in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Medical Sciences University was the first
organization in China to set up a hospice care research center and
sickrooms. The center actively shoulders the tasks of publicizing
the benefits of hospice care and training staff.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese people at first are reluctant to accept the
concept. However, most of them change their minds when they see
the outstanding work done by hospice care organizations.
</P>
<P>
In China these organizations not only conduct medical
treatment, but also arrange corresponding psychological
consultancy or organize sight-seeing tours and other activities.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that, with the improvement of living standards,
people not only hope to live longer, but also hope to be happy and
comfortable during their final minutes.
</P>
<P>
They point out that as the aged people account for a larger and
larger proportion of China's total population, the number of
patients who need hospice care is increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most people are so busy with work nowadays that they
feel that they cannot take good care of relatives who are
terminally ill. All these factors have resulted in the rapid
development of hospice care in the country, insiders conclude.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has made great efforts to crack down on drug
addiction and smuggling in recent years, and has effectively
contained this menace rampant along the southern China coast.
</P>
<P>
The region neighbors Guangdong and Yunnan provinces and
Vietnam, the geographical conditions of which areas attract
overseas drug smugglers. Statistics show that from 1991 to 1995
altogether 21,983 drug smuggling cases were uncovered and 953 drug
gangs were smashed. In the process 421.56 kg of heroin and 10 tons
of opium poppy were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The region began to prohibit drug addiction and help addicts
give up the habit in 1992. By 1995 altogether 69 rehabilitation
centers and consultancy services had been set up in the
region. They have treated 21,000 drug addicts and provided
counselling for another 9,000 drug users.
</P>
<P>
In addition, since 1992 the region has set up offices specially
for combating drug abuse at different government levels. The
region has also been launching massive propaganda campaigns
against drug addiction and smuggling every year. Altogether, eight
local regulations have been enacted concerning this issue.
</P>
<P>
At present, the regional government is carrying out another
drive against narcotics, the highlight of which will be the
sentencing of a number of drug criminals around "International
Drug Day", June 26.

MADRID, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Deportivo de La Coruna and
Zaragoza played to a 1-1 tie Thursday in their away-match and
booked a berth in the semifinals of the European Cup Winners' Cup
with a 2-1 aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
Deportivo has never reached the semifinals of the European
clubs competition in its 92-year history.
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza, which went down 0-1 in the first leg, had pressured
Deportivo while in the 38th minute their efforts paid off when
Fernando Morientes scored on a shot from the edge of the six-meter
area.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian ace Bebeto, who went all out for an equalizer, lost a
chance when he scored in the 43rd minute but the goal was annulled
for offside.
</P>
<P>
Deportivo took complete control in the second half with Bebeto,
backed by fellow Brazilian aces Donato and Mauro Silva, leading a
series of attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Brazilian finally levelled the scoring at the
64th minute when he sneaked from behind to steal the ball and then
hammered the ball past goalkeeper Jose Belman.
</P>
<P>
Zaragoza won last year's European Cup Winner's Cup, its first
ever, by defeating England's Arsenal 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Major Draws Attacks From Ulster Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Protestant unionists and Catholic
republicans from Northern Ireland all expressed their strong
opposition to the plans for election in the crisis-laden province
announced this afternoon by British Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
Major announced in parliament that elections to a peace
forum in Ulster would be held on May 30, from which delegates will
be chosen to attend the all-party talks on the future of the
province to be convened on June 10.
</P>
<P>
But his so-called "fair and balanced" election plans are very
complicated and described by political parties in Northern Ireland
as "mish-mash" or a "hybrid system."
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the conflicting demands of various parties,
Major took much pains to mix proposals raised by these parties
into his blueprint, which he admitted was a compromise that was
not ideal.
</P>
<P>
The plans stipulate that the peace forum will be composed of
110 members. The existing 18 constituencies in Ulster are each to
elect five members on a proportional representation system based
on a party list. Another 20 seats will be awarded on a
deliberately non-proportional basis, with 10 parties that poll
most votes in the province each receiving two seats. This measure
is designed to secure representation for the political
representatives of Protestant paramilitaries who had fought the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) before 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
said that Major had allowed himself to be "blown off course by an
"unholy alliance" of the Irish government, the republican Social
Democratic and Labor party (SDLP) and the smaller Protestant
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
</P>
<P>
Trimble argued that Major should have stuck to proportional
representation rather than a list system of parties.
</P>
<P>
SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon called Major's plans a
"monster raving loony" and warned that the plans had no support
within the republican community.
</P>
<P>
Mallon complained that the plans were unionist-inspired and
unionist-dominated.
</P>
<P>
DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson said that Major was "dancing
on the head of a pin" by splitting two systems.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in a statement in Belfast
described Major's plans as a unionist agenda designed to prevent a
lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
He argued that such elections would merely make rebuilding the
peace process more difficult.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Alliance Party, which is composed of Protestant and
Catholic members and keeps a neutral position in the conflict, has
not commented on the election plans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring refused to
comment until he heard the views of all parties in Northern
Ireland, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated that Dublin preferred no elections at all and
would like to have all-party talks immediately.

<P>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Morocco's former
double world champion Khalid Skah will be a hot favorite to chase
the 24th World Cross Country Championship title here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Skah, champion in 1990 and 91 and reigning Olympic 10,000
metres champion, said he was well prepared and would try to beat
Kenyans and Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
Skah's main rivals will be Kenya's defending champion Paul
Tergat, who is also chasing teammate James Kariuki for the
season's overall title, and Ethiopia's record breaking Haile
Gebrselassie.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie, who broke both the 3,000 and 5,000 indoor records
over the winter, had voed never to run cross country again after
finishing fifth in Durham, England, last year.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie, the first man since Kenya's Henry Rono in 1978 to
hold the 5,000m and 10,000m world records, beat Skah and Tergat
for the 10,00m gold medal in last year's world championships in
Gothenburg.
</P>
<P>
The championships should remain within the African domination
as temperatures are currently 30 degrees Celsius when the race
starts which should count against even the strongest European
challenger.
</P>
<P>
The women's event could produce a home victory through South
African trial winner Colleen de Reuck.
</P>
<P>
She is joined by Zola Pietersee who won this competition twice
in 1985-86 as Zola Budd when she was running for England.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Telecom Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Telecommunications capacity in
Shandong Province, one of China's fastest-growing coastal areas,
will maintain its double-digit annual growth during the remaining
years of the century.
</P>
<P>
The province will give priority to improving efficiency and
service in its telecommunications networks, according to
Communications Weekly.
</P>
<P>
According to a five-year blueprint of the province's posts and
telecommunications bureau, by the end of the century the
telecommunications system will expand its handling capacity by as
much as five times that of 1980, and the combined business volume
of posts and telecommunications will maintain an annual increase
of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that provincial investment in fixed assets in
posts and telecommunications will hit 30 billion yuan during the
next five years, and 130,000 lines will be added to its
long-distance switching capacity, raising the total to 360,000
lines.
</P>
<P>
Three synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) optical cables with a
combined length of 800 km will be laid, forming a broad-band,
large-capacity, long-distance telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
Attention will also be given to phone service by adding 170,000
phone lines to its telephone system and getting 4.2 million
customers in cities and the countryside to bring the total number
to 6.5 million. Telephone use will climb to nine per 100 persons,
and the number of long-distance lines will stand at 1.23 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan proposes to accelerate construction of
data and mobile telecommunications networks in the province. The
numbers of portable phone and pager users will reach 900,000 and
2.5 million, respectively, by the year 2000.

stimulant, at indoor meets in Europe this winter.

Onyali failed a test on February 4 in Stuttgart, while the
Ezinwa brothers tested positive in Moscow on February 14 after
Osmond had finished first and Davidson second in a 60-meter race.

Alhaji Amu, chairman of the Nigerian Athletics Federation, said
the ephedrine was apparently contained in medications which the
runners had taken to relieve colds.

He said the federation would file an appeal on behalf of the

Davidson Ezinwa and Onyali both hold the African records in the

CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Worse than expected economic growth has significantly
boosted the number of people on unemployment benefits and is
likely to lead to a blow-out of more than one billion Australian
dollars (775 million US dollars) in dole payments this year.
</P>
<P>
-- Any new application for uranium mines would undergo the
"strictest" environmental assessments before they were accepted,
the Federal Government guaranteed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The Howard Government is planning the most ambitious
overhaul yet of federal-state relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>

<HEADLINE> London Stock Exchange Body Backs Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A London Stock Exchange steering
committee has recommended unanimously that the UK stock market
should move towards the introduction of electronic order-driven
trading.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that the full Stock Exchange
board will vote today on the next steps towards order-driven
trading, in which buy and sell orders are entered on a central
electronic system and automatically executed when they match.
</P>
<P>
The exchange is expected to vote for order-matching for all UK
stocks, rather than limiting it to the shares of the largest and
most liquid companies.
</P>
<P>
But it is also expected to call for the new trading system to
be phased in gradually, and for further consultation on the rules
governing the market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the exchange will make it clear that a separate
system for trading large blocks of shares will coexist with the
electronic order book.
</P>
<P>
As in the current quote-driven system, where market-makers list
prices on the screen but deal over the telephone, or in New York's
"upstairs trading," prices for block trades will be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote of the steering committee represents a sharp
change in attitude for market-makers such as Donald Brydon, deputy
chief executive of BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays
Bank and one of the largest market-makers.
</P>
<P>
BZW's initial response to the Stock Exchange's proposals for
order-driven trading was to argue that no change was needed.
</P>
<P>
Michael Lawrence, dismissed as the exchange's chief executive
in January, said BZW and other market-makers had engineered a coup
against him because of their hostility to his proposals for
order-driven trading.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Army Enters Mrkonjic Grad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Army today
entered the area of Mrkonjic Grad in western Bosnia, which is
reverted to Serb control under the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Army marked its takeover of the town, captured by
Muslim-Croat forces in an offensive last October, by hoisting the
Serb flag in a barracks close to Mrkonjic Grad, 120 km west of
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Army started their return today in the presence of
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) troops, 91 days after the IFOR
troops began to take command of the peace mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The people can now live in peace and I hope they will be
satisfied. We know our commitments in the implementation of the
peace agreement and it is certain that we will not violate peace,"
Serb Army commander Slavko Culic said while taking over the town
which was looted and burned by the Croats before the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace plan, the Serb Army is to enter Friday
the area of Sipovo and Ribnik, two other Serb towns in central
Bosnia once seized by the Muslim-Croat forces.
</P>
<P>
Culic said that on the whole he was satisfied with the
implementation of the military part of the accord. But he
expressed dissatisfaction with the IFOR's behavior which was not
equal towards all the sides in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This concerns most of all Bosnian Serb Army prisoners of war
who are still being held in Muslim and Croat prisons," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim and Croat sides have held some of the Serb prisoners
although they were supposed to do so by January 19 as demanded by
the peace agreement. But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said the Serbs also still jail some Muslim prisoners of
war.

<HEADLINE> US House Passes Another Stopgap Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed today another temporary spending bill to
keep dozens of federal agencies operating through March 29.
</P>
<P>
The stopgap spending bill, the 11th of fiscal 1996, was passed
in the House with 244-180. The Senate is expected to approve the
bill and President Bill Clinton will sign it in time to avoid a
partial government shutdown when the current stopgap measure
expires midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The stopgap measure would give the Republican-controlled Congress
and the White House another week to work out a compromise on a
broader spending bill, which would finance nine U.S. government
departments and dozens of agencies to operate through the last six
months of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
Different versions of the longer-term bill have cleared the
House and Senate. The Senate measure, adopted 79-21 two days ago,
provided some of the 8 billion dollars in extra funding requested
by the White House. But the House version, approved two weeks ago,
is far more austere.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton held talks with Republican leaders in the
Congress Wednesday on the budget impasses of fiscal 1996 and both
sides expressed a desire to reach agreement before Congress leaves
for its Easter-Passover recess in April.
</P>
<P>
But difficult negotiations remain. The White House wants more
money for some government programs such as education and the
environment while the Congress is willing to give less.

<HEADLINE> Serb Official Seeks Protection of Serb Property  in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik today urged the international community to
protect Serb property in parts of Sarajevo which have just come
under Muslim-Croat control.
</P>
<P>
He made the call while meeting with High Representative of the
international community for civilian affairs Carl Bildt in the
Serb stronghold of Pale today.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Bildt said the situation in Sarajevo was
gradually stabilizing and the property of Sarajevo Serbs was
protected under the agreement reached in Geneva Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Serbs have left Sarajevo because they were not
given the desired guarantees for safe life when the Muslim-Croat
federation took over control Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said the international community did not want any
checkpoints at borders between Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation in the area of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He said he had talked with Serb officials about the opening of
a bus line between Sarajevo's districts of Lukavica under Serb
control and Ilidza so as to facilitate contact between Serbs in
Republika Srpska and those remaining in Ilidza, a Serb sector now
under federal rule.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said he hoped all prisoners would be released before
the ministerial meeting of the five-nation Contact Group in Moscow
on Saturday, March 23. The Contact Group comprises Britain,
France, Germany, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
This obligation of all the sides was confirmed at the enlarged
meeting of the Contact Group in Geneva Monday, Krajisnik said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accords, the former warring sides in Bosnia
had been obliged to release all prisoners by January 19.

LUANDA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the camping
assembly of Angola's UNITA rebel forces is scheduled to begin
next week, the United Nations special envoy, Blondin Beye,
announced here today.

community.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17,000 UNITA troops already assembled in the
camps during the first phase which began on November 20, 1995,
893 officers and soldiers have been found missing so far,
according to the envoy.
</P>
<P>
The remaining of the 62,000 UNITA rebel troops are scheduled

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denounces Republican Effort To Repeal Assault  Weapons Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that the House of Representatives' plans to legalize
assault weapons would be a "deeply wrong" act that could benefit
only criminals.
</P>
<P>
The House Republican leaders have set a Friday vote on
repealing the 1994 ban on manufacture and sale of assault-style
rapid-fire weapons, despite objections from even some of their
fellow Republican members.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Clinton said, "I very much hope it will not
pass. It will endanger law enforcement officials if it does pass.
It will cost more citizens their lives if it does pass. The only
people who will be benefited are people who engage in illegal
activity."
</P>
<P>
"I believe it would be deeply wrong for Congress to repeal this
assault weapons ban and in essence to take the side of the
Washington gun lobby over the interests of the law-enforcement
people of this country and the law-abiding citizens of this
country," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had vowed to veto the measure if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno, at her weekly news
conference today, said that repeal would be an unconscionable
cave-in to special interests.
</P>
<P>
In the year after the ban took effect, the number of assault
weapons traced to crime dropped 18 percent, Reno said. Illegal
assault weapons are responsible for the deaths of one-third of all
police officers killed by guns.
</P>
<P>
"Assault weapons have become the weapons of choice for violent
criminals, drug dealers, gangs and dangerous maniacs everywhere.
They have been used in schoolyards, at airports, in bank lobbies,
on trains, in traffic and in front of the White House," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision by House Republican leaders fulfilled a
promise to the National Rifle Association, which opposes the ban
that applies to 19 specific styles of firearms and dozens of
similar weapons. Overturning that ban has been the NRA's top
legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
Although even Tanya Metaksa, the NRA's chief lobbyist, has
conceded that repeal is impossible while President Clinton is in
office, she nevertheless has pushed for a House vote this year.
</P>
<P>
"Our members who were active in the 1994 elections need to know
the people they helped have stuck to their original promise to
repeal the Clinton gun ban," the Associated Press quoted her as
saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Even if the measure passes the House, its future in the Senate
looks bleak.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Encourages Peace Process in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today congratulated both the Guatemalan
government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG)
on the recent significant step forward in the peace process,
according to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the secretary-general, said
that Boutros-Ghali had "learned with great satisfaction" of the
announcement Wednesday by the URNG to suspend temporarily
offensive military operations in response of President Alvaro
Arzu's instructions to the army to cease counter-insurgency
operations.
</P>
<P>
"These are very positive developments which will alleviate the
suffering of the civilian population, a goal to which both parties
are committed under the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights
signed in March 1994," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed between the government and the URNG set
the stage for an end to the 30-plus-year civil war. The United
Nations General Assembly decided to establish a Mission for the
Verification of Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) so as to help
put an end to the persisting pattern of human rights abuses in
that country in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
The recent developments would no doubt have built further the
sense of mutual confidence that characterized the relationship
between the government and the URNG, and create a climate
conducive to democratic changes and the conclusion of a just
settlement of the armed confrontation. They would also contribute
greatly to strengthening confidence in the peace process among the
Guatemalan people and in the international community at large, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of the mandate of the MINUGUA and measures recently
taken by the government and the URNG have led to a strengthening
of the rule of law and a gradual demilitarization of political
life in that country, the secretary-general noted.
</P>
<P>
On the negotiations on social and economic issues between the
government and the URNG, Boutros-Ghali said that he would continue
to do his utmost to facilitate that process. He hoped that the
round of negotiations to be held next week in Mexico City would
bring concrete results in that respect.

JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) today warned of the impact of the increasing
political violence in the Kwazulu/Natal on its local government
election.
</P>
<P>
"It could threaten the May 29 local government elections in
the province," Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader said.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, who is also the Home Affairs Minister, said if
Mandela used the proclamation to ban Zulu cultural accoutrements,
that would be just the kind of provocation which might threaten
peace in the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha leader accused the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) of "evil attempts" to diminish the role of
traditional leaders whose influence, he said, was "crucial local
poll".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, speaking at an ANC rally today in Kwazulu/Natal,
Mandela said while political violence had ended in all the other
provinces of the country, it continued to cast a shadow on the
strife-torn Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to all parties to commit themselves to
"a code of conduct" for the coming elections and hoped the period
in the run-up to the poll would set an example of political
tolerance and peaceful campaigning.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today met with Haitian President Rene Preval at the White House,
urging Haiti to carry out an economic reform as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters at the beginning of their meeting, "We
want to see them work out an achievable plan of reform to gain the
support of the international financial institutions, so we can get
the investment necessary into Haiti to generate private-sector
jobs and grow the economy."
</P>
<P>
"We know that they have significant challenges economically,"
Clinton said. "I want the president and the country to succeed."
</P>
<P>
Preval agreed that "democracy doesn't go without economic
progress. We have economic challenges that have to be taken up."
</P>
<P>
Preval is making his first visit to the United States since his
inauguration last month as the elected president to succeed former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Preval appealed to the U.S. government to return
documents seized by the U.S. military from an armed group in
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
"The documents belong to us. The documents are very important
for the government of Haiti," Preval told reporters. The documents
could help police resolve numerous crimes committed during the
1991-94 period of military rule in Haiti, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 documents in the
possession of the Pentagon, most of them confiscated from a
pro-military group blamed for the killing of hundreds of civilians,
according to reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of South Africans
today quietly celebrated human rights day in memory of the 1960
Sharpeville Massacre.
</P>
<P>
On March 21, 1960, South African policemen shot dead 69
protesters of the apartheid sysytem at Sharpeville, south of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Sharpeville massacre outraged the international community and
led to South Africa's decades-long international isolation.
</P>
<P>
Today's celebrations included the launching of a human rights
commission in Johannesburg and the opening of an urban health
centre at Sharpeville.
</P>
<P>
At a moving ceremony at Wilgespruit, west of Johannesburg, the
ashes of a passbook belinging to one of the first African
National Congress (ANC)leaders, Chief Albert Luthuli, were
presented at the launch of a peace academy.
</P>
<P>
The academy was set up to commemorate efforts by South Africa's
four nobel laureates: Luthuli, President Nelson Mandela, Deputy
President F W de Klerk and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nine of the 11 human rights comissioners were sworn
in at the Johannesburg metropolitan centre before local and
foreign dignitaries including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and de
Klerk, and truth and reconciliation commission chairman Tutu.
</P>
<P>
About 1500 Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) supporters marched to
the Sharpeville Stadium to commemorate the massacre of 36 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the PAC rally, Sharpeville survivor
David Lengana, 77, said it was time South Africans rised to fight
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
"What we're really after now is houses and uplifting the African
people. The days of the pass book are over," said Lengana.

<HEADLINE> S.African National Party Slams Charge Against Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Thursday, Mandela said the South African police were "being
infiltrated by anti-government agents provocateurs".
</P>
<P>
An hour later, however, the president criticized the press for
having misunderstood him, saying that he was referring "only to
one or two rogue elements" in the police service, and that there
was no known conspiracy against the government.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were today criticized by the National Party.
</P>
<P>
"For a head of state to make such an unguarded statement so
widely publicized and taken as gospel by millions of South
Africans and international listeners, must be condemned as a very
serious indictment against our police services," a NP spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged National Police Commissioner George Fivaz
to investigate into Mandela's claims that "had placed every man
and woman in the police force under suspicion".
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Fivaz said it was "inconceivable" that the
police would seek to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
The police boss also welcomed Mandela's clarification, saying
his police force had already been "completely restructured".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fivaz said he agreed with the president in that
some elements in the police, who are involved in corruptive
activities or political violence, must be ruthlessly rooted out.
