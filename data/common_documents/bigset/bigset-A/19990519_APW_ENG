<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Frenchman and his wine will not be  
parted. That's the latest issue facing Salt Lake City's embattled 
Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday it was  
concerned about a possible clash between Mormon restrictions on 
alcohol and foreign cultures where beer and wine are part of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Its coordination commission for the 2002 Winter Games asked Salt  
Lake City organizers to request ``with great respect'' that Utah 
authorities allow unfettered alcohol sales in the main press 
center, which will be set up in the gigantic Salt Palace convention 
center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Frenchman, I know that a Frenchman kept from his wine  
might get cranky,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, senior vice president for communications for the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, the panel would ``make every 
effort'' to gain an exemption from liquor laws for the Salt Palace 
for the two weeks of the games. Such exemptions can be granted for 
convention facilities, but are limited to one a year. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no plans to request similar exemptions for other  
Olympic sites, SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah officials have repeatedly said that the Olympics would not  
force a relaxation of liquor laws, and the Mormon church, which 
dominates the state's population and politics, has attacked 
requests for changes in the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Mormon teaching forbids alcohol use.  
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left at the offices of Gov. Mike Leavitt and  
House Speaker Martin Stephens were not immediately returned, and a 
call to Senate President Lane Beattie was not answered. Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Department director Kenneth Wynn was away from his 
office and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first visit by IOC leaders to Salt Lake City since the  
bribery scandal broke ends today, and both sides said disputes 
issues were few. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zero surprises,'' Servan-Schreiber said. He compared the  
sessions to ``making wedding plans, but magnified 10 million 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said SLOC presented reports on sports, environmental  
impact, telecommunications, media operations, marketing and other 
areas. She said no SLOC proposals were rejected, although fine 
tuning was needed on some. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the two sides discussed sight lines at the Delta  
Center for figure skating, but that no further action was taken. 
Officials are concerned that some seats at the city's biggest 
indoor arena won't have good views of the ice, and skaters 
complained during the world championships there in February that 
they had trouble seeing the fans, which interrupted their rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas also said SLOC hoped to have its list of Olympic events  
finished by June, with competition schedules done by December. Salt 
Lake City organizers have proposed several new events, including 
skeleton -- a luge-like race where sledders go down the track head 
first -- and women's bobsled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Servan-Schreiber said ``liquor for the bar'' was the issue  
that grabbed the IOC's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery stores here sell beer, but other alcohol sales are  
restricted to state-run outlets, establishments serving food or 
``social clubs,'' where a customer must be sponsored by a club 
member before imbibing. Often the ``sponsorship'' is no more than a 
nod from the guy on the next barstool, but it's a barrier not seen 
in most of the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC bans alcohol from its own sponsorship program, although  
national and local Olympic committees can sign with brewers and 
vintners. Otherwise, Olympic leaders accept alcohol's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Olympic venues in the past have served beer and wine, and  
the press center -- probably the highest concentration of foreign 
visitors to the games aside from the athletes' village, where wine 
is usually available with meals -- always has a least one place 
where thirsty reporters can belly up, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In their bids, Salt Lake City organizers took pains to show how  
easy it was to buy a drink here. Tom Welch, the motivator behind 
the bid and now disgraced for his role in the bribery scandal, used 
to tell Olympic leaders, ``If you can't get a drink in Salt Lake 
City, you can't be very thirsty.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Thomas Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Broderick  
Thomas, arrested on a traffic warrant, was being investigated 
Wednesday after police received information about a possible 
assault on his business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 32, and his partner, Lee Jackson, 34, were arrested late  
Tuesday by officers investigating a report of an altercation in 
north Irving, department spokesman David Tull said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisor, who declined to be identified, said Thomas had  
been ``involved in some type of altercation in Irving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tull said information on the altercation was turned over  
Wednesday to the criminal investigation unit for possible charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Jackson were arrested when a computer check showed  
two outstanding traffic warrants for each -- Thomas in nearby 
Farmers Branch for speeding and for driving without proof of 
insurance. One of Jackson's warrants was out of Dallas, and the 
other out of Irving. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a pass-rushing specialist for the Cowboys, was booked  
into jail at 8:55 p.m. Tuesday and released less than two hours 
later on $865 bond, a jail supervisor said. There was a $399 bond 
on the speeding charge and a $466 bond on the insurance charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 250-pound Thomas missed all of last season after  
injuring his left knee in training camp. Thomas is a free agent who 
worked out at team headquarters until the last three weeks. He is 
not expected to re-sign with the Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Limits on N.Korea Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers led by the chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee proposed new restrictions 
Wednesday on a 5-year-old aid program designed to persuade North 
Korea to scale back its nuclear energy program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be getting more for our money,'' said Chairman  
Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y. The legislation, which goes before 
Gilman's panel, would limit President Clinton's discretion in 
providing money under the program and impose new requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1994 agreement, North Korea agreed to curtail its  
nuclear energy program in exchange for fuel oil for its 
conventional power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton requested $55 million in his budget for fiscal year 2000  
for the oil program, up from $35 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin criticized  
congressional moves to scuttle or alter the agreement. He said U.S. 
inspection teams were in Pyongyang Wednesday and expect to gain 
access Thursday to an underground site that U.S. officials have 
asked to inspect for weapons development activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that we're getting access ... that should  
take the steam out of some of those ill-advised ideas to throw away 
an agreement that has helped us prevent North Korea from becoming a 
major nuclear power threatening our vital national interests,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that some members of Congress have never liked the  
agreement. The administration, he said, would work with Congress to 
iron out concerns but believes the agreement is in the best 
interests of the United States, Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman and other congressional critics of the program contend  
North Korea has not lived up to its end, citing reports that the 
communist nation may be continuing to develop a nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	They have also criticized North Korea's 1998 launch of a  
multistage rocket over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would require North Korea to meet all terms of  
the 1994 agreement, including allowing international inspections of 
suspected nuclear sites. It would also prod Japan and South Korea 
to contribute more to the program. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would permit humanitarian food shipments to North Korea  
only if it could be demonstrated the food ``is not diverted to the 
North Korean military and that North Korea is taking steps to 
regain self-sufficiency in food production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is also sponsored by Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.;  
John Kasich, R-Ohio; Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.; 
and Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The House last year voted to block the oil payments, but they  
were restored in later negotiations with the Senate and the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, U.S. aid to North Korea amounts to $235 million a year,  
Gilman said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> EBay Buying Two Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Online auction company eBay Inc.  
announced two deals to expand services on its Internet trading 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay is acquiring Kruse International, an automobile auctioneer  
aimed at the collector market, and Billpoint Inc., a company that 
facilitates credit card payments over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Kruse, based in Auburn, Ind., offers appraisal and  
authentication services and participates in about 40 car auctions 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of eBay's online auctions, sellers will use Billpoint to  
instantly accept credit cards. The Redwood City, Calif.-company 
also puts together reference reports for buyers, listing all their 
transactions, including status and refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay will issue common stock worth about $275 million in making  
the acquisitions, the San Jose-based company said in a statement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay expects both transactions to close during the second  
quarter of this year.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 50.44  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher in erratic trading today as  
investors pondered the market's next move following the Federal 
Reserve's policy meeting yesterday at which it left interest rates 
unchanged for now. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50.44 
at 10,887.39. Much of the gain came in the final hour of trading. 
Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq composite 
index rose 19.05 to 2,577.41. Rising bond prices boosted a market 
that struggled all day to chart a course. ``The market hasn't 
broken out or broken down,'' said Dan Ascani, president and 
research director at Global Market Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, 
Ga. ``Everyone has adopted a wait-and-see attitude.''

	Gates Meets With More Than 100 CEOs

<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Corporate success will hinge increasingly  
on how well information is organized electronically and made 
accessible to workers who need it, Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill 
Gates said today. To merely have a Web site, computers and e-mail 
is no longer enough, Gates said at the third annual Microsoft CEO 
Summit. He said what's important is how the tools are used within a 
company. Gates' keynote address opened a two-day conference of more 
than 100 chief executives from the world's 1,000 biggest 
corporations. He made no mention of the federal antitrust trial 
against Microsoft that is being heard in Washington, D.C.

shopping around for investments, the company said today at its 
annual shareholders meeting. Chief executive C. Michael Armstrong 
stressed that AT&AMP;T needs a smooth transition at Tele-Communications 
Inc. and MediaOne Group, the two cable TV companies already being 
acquired. AT&AMP;T president John Zeglis added that the company will 
likely make more investments in foreign companies, as it has in 
Canada and Japan, to expand its global network. The company also 
said it has begun testing a new wireless service in Dallas using a 
pizza box-sized receiver for local and long-distance calls. AT&AMP;T 
stock was down 9/16 at 58 9/16 today.

	FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Another $20 million bonus will be

that boasts a family-style ``we're in it together'' philosophy. 
John Tu and David Sun, co-founders of Kingston Technology Co., told 
employees in memos that the big payoff will come in July, company 
spokeswoman Heather Jardin said today. Tenure and performance 
determine how much each employee gets out of the $20 million bonus. 
She declined to provide other specifics, only saying that ``it's a

	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- US Airways Group Inc. shareholders  
overwhelmingly approved today an offer to 30 top executives of up 
to 500 percent of their base salary in potential bonus pay. The 
approval came despite complaints from union members, who say their 
salaries have remained stagnant while management's compensation has 
skyrocketed. The 9,000 flight attendants have not had a 
cost-of-living raise since 1996, and they are working under a 
contract that came up for renewal that year. The 10,000 ticket and 
gate agents, who have not had a cost-of-living raise since 1991, 
joined the Communications Workers of America in 1997. US Airways 
shares were at 52 1/8, down 2 3/4.

``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' But what one heard 
outside movie houses from Charleston, W. Va., to New York City to 
Los Angeles after midnight and early morning showings was that it 
was worth every hour of waiting to get into a showing and worth the 
years of waiting to witness new Star Wars. Some companies were 
bracing for ``Phantom'' sickouts today as people played hooky to go

to an adviser to Olivetti could improperly influence the outcome of 
the takeover bid. Olivetti has offered $65 billion for Telecom 
Italia in a tender offer that ends Friday. If successful, it would

has seen its value increase seven-fold and now has a market value 
of about $5.5 billion. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company 
provides consumers and health-care providers with an easy way to 
monitor insurance claims and get referrals. Doctors also can use 
Healtheon to order supplies and check lab results. Privately held

	Disaster Losses Higher Than Ever

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shortsighted development policies have

rather than lessening it, a new report warned today. Dennis S. 
Mileti, a University of Colorado sociologist, sees a fundamental 
flaw in the U.S. attitude toward disasters: a fantasy that 
technology can make us safe. Mileti headed a panel of experts who 
spent five years studying U.S. handline of disasters. Disasters 
over the past 20 years have cost the United States more than $500 
billion and the toll is rising, due to an increasingly complex 
society and more people moving to disaster-prone areas, according 
to the report ``Disasters by Design.''

	U.S.-EU Beef Confrontation Lingers  
</P>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The European Union's refusal to accept  
North American beef is jeopardizing the integrity of world trade 
law and will lead to retaliatory sanctions, U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman warned today. But European Union Agriculture 
Commissioner Franz Fischler, speaking after Glickman to 600 
delegates at the World Meat Congress, insisted that hormonally 
treated U.S. beef ``does threaten human health,'' so the EU ban 
could not be lifted. The 15-nation union has ignored a World Trade 
Organization ruling requiring it immediately to lift its 
10-year-old ban on the hormone-treated beef from America and 
Canada. U.S. officials warn they will retaliate with $202 million 
in extra tariffs on EU imports when the arbitration deadline 
expires June 3.

<HEADLINE> America, Europe in Beef Trade War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Senior negotiators from the United States  
and European Union say they aren't optimistic of avoiding a 
deepening trade war over the EU's refusal to import hormone-treated 
U.S. beef. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and his European Union  
counterpart, Franz Fischler of Austria, both played hardball in 
public appearances alongside each other at the conclusion Wednesday 
of the World Meat Congress here. 
</P>
<P>
	And the two were locking horns in a Dublin hotel Thursday in  
hopes of narrowing the fundamental divide between them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glickman conceded beforehand that an EU retreat on the issue  
``doesn't look terribly likely'' soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is threatening to impose $202 million in  
tariffs on EU exports June 3 in retaliation for the EU's rejection 
of a World Trade Organization verdict requiring the 15-nation union 
to begin accepting the U.S. product. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has three times accepted U.S.-led studies finding  
hormone-treated beef safe, but Fischler insisted that EU-instigated 
research indicated it was unsafe and more thorough studies needed 
to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he thought Americans who ate their domestic  
beef were running a health risk, Fischler replied, ``Yes, 
absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate press conference, Glickman said he didn't think  
U.S. consumers would be rattled by the Europeans' fears. ``By and 
large the American public have full confidence that the system is 
safe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Glickman's chief science adviser, Dr. Ifi Siddiqui, said the  
latest EU scientific claims looked like ``nothing new,'' compared 
to previous material already rejected by WTO panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Fischler and Glickman shook hands on the same stage,  
then sparred politely while taking questions from some of the 600 
delegates at the meat conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said the EU's rejection of the WTO ruling ``risks  
perhaps destroying the entire world trading system.'' He said it 
would be crucial for the EU to accede to the Geneva-based 
organization's ruling, otherwise ``the WTO will cease to have any 
effect whatsoever'' and ``chaos will reign in the global 
marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized his willingness to see U.S. beef labeled as  
hormone-treated to allow would-be European consumers to weigh 
whether to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Glickman mentioned the idea that the consumer should have  
the choice,'' Fischler responded, as his U.S. counterpart notably 
avoided eye contact by pressing his hand to his forehead. ``But we 
can't accept a choice between, let's say, risky or dangerous meat 
and safe meat.''

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Appoint Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOMA, Congo (AP) -- Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow  
President Laurent Kabila on Wednesday named a new leader in hopes 
of resolving differences that have paralyzed the rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Emile Ilunga was named the new leader of the Congolese  
Democratic Coalition, replacing Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, a former 
history lecturer who was fired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilunga, who is from the southern Katanga Province, had been in  
charge of the movement's health department. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was not expected to have an impact on the  
battlefield, where the rebels rely heavily on Rwandan troops in 
eastern and southern Congo, and Ugandan soldiers in the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel leaders have been meeting behind closed doors since Monday  
and were not immediately available for comment. It wasn't clear how 
Ilunga and several other leaders were elected. The rest of the 
government will be named on Thursday, said rebel spokesman John 
Nsana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wamba and his supporters boycotted the meeting, and he accused  
his political rivals, many of whom are former associates of the 
late Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, of staging a coup. It 
wasn't immediately clear if Wamba will join the new rebel leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Wamba has repeatedly accused fellow rebels of setting the stage  
for the return of politicians who served under Mobutu, whom Kabila 
toppled in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have been divided over their failure to successfully  
organize an administration in the eastern half of Congo that is 
under their control, and to rally popular support behind the 
9-month-old war. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 45-member government will try to balance regional  
representation with representatives from each of the nine provinces 
as well as political and military officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Ilunga, the rebel military chief, Jean-Pierre  
Ondekane, was named the first vice president of the movement, and 
Moise Nyarugabo, an ethnic Tutsi, the second vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilunga spent 30 years in exile in Brussels, Belgium, from where  
he organized an opposition to former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, 
until joining Kabila in 1996-97 war that toppled Mobutu. After 
Kabila failed to award him with a promised vice presidency, he 
joined the rebels who took up arms in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wamba, who flew in to Goma under the protection of a Ugandan  
company and a battered T-55 tank, remained defiant and appeared in 
a military uniform, dismissing Ilunga's election as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwandan and Ugandan political and military officials, who were  
present in Goma, were lobbying for their candidates, although they 
did not take part in the rebel meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two allies have been strained over the  
different approaches of how to defeat Kabila. Uganda appears to 
favor a slower pace of war, which would give more time for 
organizing the rebel administration, while Rwanda seem to want a 
quicker end to an economically exhausting war.

<HEADLINE> Killy Sees Salt Lake Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jean-Claude Killy, the Olympic skiing  
champion now on the International Olympic Committee, says he is 
increasingly confident about Salt Lake's ability to stage ``not the 
best possible games, but the best games ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killy is deputy chairman of the 18-member IOC Coordination  
Commission that is giving advice and surveying Salt Lake's plans 
for the 2002 Winter Games. The meetings began Monday and end 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time in my life that we are asked so many  
questions and listened to,'' Killy said Tuesday. ``My level of 
confidence in the outcome has gone from very high to extremely 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killy was a triple gold medalist at the 1968 Games in Grenoble  
and was president of the organizing committee for Albertville's 
Games in 1992. He also has served on the coordination commissions 
for Lillehammer in 1994 and Nagano in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy said he's been impressed with Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee president Mitt Romney. ``I found him a very smart 
individual and willing to learn from the past,'' Killy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, in turn, called Killy's presence ``very powerful. He has  
been where I am now and he continues to give good advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is saying, `Oh, in Albertville, we found we didn't need to  
do this, we didn't need to do that, we paid too much for some 
accommodations. You don't have to worry about that. You'll make 
more money on the coin program if you do this,' '' Romney added. 
``Lots of ideas -- it's been refreshing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top priority for the SLOC is slicing expenses from a budget  
threatened by lukewarm sponsor interest since even before the IOC 
bribery scandal. Romney has been saying for two months he has 
identified $84 million in frills to trim from the $1.45 billion 
budget. But on Tuesday he said the tally is now up to $98 million 
and growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy declined to specify which cuts the IOC suggested, except  
for one: volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake may reconsider whether it needs all 18,000 volunteers  
now planned. The volunteers are not paid, but it costs an 
organizing committee $3,000 to $5,000 to feed, outfit, transport 
and train each volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the kind of thing we want to tell Salt Lake City now  
and not two years from now,'' Killy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is willing to discuss changes in how it is treated by  
organizers, but Killy said that won't result in much savings. The 
IOC pays for its own rooms and transportation, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not in the millions of dollars,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Romney last week said he would ask the IOC to renegotiate its  
contract to cut SLOC's costs in the same way Sydney's costs for 
2000 are being trimmed; to defer royalty payments on merchandise, 
sponsorships and tickets; and to let SLOC go after technology 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Shelley Thomas said Tuesday that Romney has only  
made general statements and will not discuss his requests in detail 
until an IOC meeting next month in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the IOC communications director, said  
the committee should not expect much in the way of money from the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the sugar daddy who has all this money hidden under  
a tree in Lausanne,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Servan-Schreiber acknowledged the IOC is reconsidering the  
technology sponsor categories because of dramatic changes in 
technology over the past two years. In the past, IOC has sold all 
technology sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
	The complexities of a changing technology field caused the SLOC  
to hire a German company to provide software that delivers the 
judge's scores to broadcasters, scoreboards and a database, said 
Dave Busser, managing director of information technologies for the 
SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee ran out of time to line up a sponsor and had to  
get moving on the software, so it hired Wige Mic for on-venue 
result systems. The committee is still negotiating with potential 
sponsors that will either amplify on Wige Mic's work or pay for it. 
Busser declined to say how much Wige Mic will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed the suggestion sponsors shied away because of the  
scandal. ``None of them said no because of the scandal,'' Busser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the IOC's marketing director said despite the bribery  
case, public support for Olympic athletes remained high -- although 
it ``clearly has been a black eye for the IOC's image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing chief Michael Payne claimed worldwide surveys  
conducted for the IOC found that failure to adopt reforms in the 
wake of the scandal ``would cause certain erosion'' in other areas 
of the Olympic community. But the surveys of 10,000 people in 10 
countries in February and March showed 76 percent had a positive 
attitude toward the games and 85 percent a positive attitude toward 
Olympic athletes.

<HEADLINE> Gates Meets With More Than 100 CEOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Corporate success will hinge increasingly  
on how well information is organized electronically and made 
accessible to workers who need it, Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill 
Gates said today. 
</P>
<P>
	To merely have a Web site, computers and e-mail is no longer  
enough, Gates said at the third annual Microsoft CEO Summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's how you take those technologies and use them inside the  
company ... that's going to differentiate'' the most effective 
businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' keynote address, ``Knowledge Workers Without Walls,''  
opened a two-day conference of more than 100 chief executives from 
the world's 1,000 biggest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	He made no mention of the fededral antitrust trial against  
Microsoft that is being heard in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters watched via a video link from another part of the  
company's sprawling campus in this Seattle suburb. All other 
sessions were closed. A news conference with Gates and some of the 
other CEOs was scheduled in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Building on themes he has emphasized in the past, Gates said  
that making e-mail part of a corporate culture and replacing paper 
forms with electronic outlines are only first steps toward making 
full use of today's technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even what's available right now is vastly underutilized  
throughout the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting-edge corporations are converting their offices for  
wireless communications combining voice, pictures and data; 
reducing the number of face-to-face meetings through ad hoc as well 
as prearranged teleconferencing via computer and outfitting 
employees with ``digital dashboards,'' customized on-screen layouts 
a worker can access from any computer, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital dashboard -- ``your office on any screen,'' as he  
described it -- can be modified both by the employee and by 
executives who might decide everyone should have a given feature, 
be it last month's sales figures or a corporate phone list. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates demonstrated his own digital dashboard, including a  
toolbar featuring buttons for commands he created himself, a panel 
of moving stock quotes, a listing of top news stories on selected 
issues, access to weather maps and real-time photos of his frequent 
travel routes and e-mail ranked by priority, subject and author. 
</P>
<P>
	He also displayed some of the latest devices, including improved  
hand-held devices that instantly convert handwriting on an 
electronic pad into print on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to be a mainstream scenario very soon,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Ends Up 50.44 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied at the end of an erratic session  
Wednesday as investors pondered their next move following the 
Federal Reserve's warning on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.44 to close at  
10,887.39 after changing direction several times during the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher after struggling all  
day to chart a course. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 10.91 
to 1,344.23, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 19.04 to 2,577.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has adopted a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Dan  
Ascani, president and research director at Global Market 
Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow fell 16.52, recovering from a 112-point  
slide that followed the Fed's decision to leave interest rates 
unchanged. But a warning from the Fed that rates are likely to rise 
if inflation reawakens left the market jittery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond traders ultimately welcomed the Fed's determination to  
quell inflation, and pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond 
down to 5.8 percent from 5.88 Tuesday. That helped lift stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to the bond market for guidance,'' said William  
Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. Stocks suffer 
if rising bond yields offer investors a more attractive investment 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking and brokerage stocks, which have slipped in recent  
sessions, rose along with bonds Wednesday. Chase Manhattan, which 
rose 1 7/16 to 80 3/16, led the gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said investors are still wondering what the next  
market trend will be, and many remain on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of confusion, illustrated by the paucity of  
volume,'' said Meehan. While the market outpaced the sluggish 
sessions leading up to the Fed's announcement, volume remained 
light on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks illustrated the market's divergent path.  
Applied Materials, a maker of semiconductors, rose 2 3/16 to 65 
5/16 after it beat earnings expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet search provider Lycos rose 3 15/16 to 116 7/8.  
The company reported massive losses in its most recent quarter, but 
said the number of people using its Web site rose. 
</P>
<P>
	But those big gains were balanced out by Dell, which languished  
throughout the day and finished down 4 1/4 at 39 13/16. Dell held down 
the technology-dominated Nasdaq after releasing earnings that just 
matched Wall Street's expectations. Analysts said they were 
troubled by shrinking profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks were mostly lower after the Air Transport  
Association said industry revenue slipped in April due to steeply 
discounted fares. UAL, which owns United Air Lines, led the 
decliners, falling 5 7/8 to 74 11/16. The Dow Jones transportation 
average fell 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascani said Wednesday's market continued a pattern of investors'  
reluctance to pin their fortunes on any particular industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a rapid-fire industry group rotation,'' he said.  
``It's hard to find a pattern, because most sectors aren't being 
given any time to set one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin on  
the NYSE, with 1,761 up, 1,275 down and 526 unchanged. Composite 
volume came to 953.84 million shares, compared to 917.30 million in 
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.35 to 639.54, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.64 to 788.36. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.69 to 446.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent.  
European indexes were mostly higher, with Germany's DAX index 
rising 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rising 1.0 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 closing 1.5 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert's Profit Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Warner-Lambert needed help to sell its  
promising new cholesterol lowering drug Lipitor, it turned to rival 
pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer agreed to take some of Lipitor's profits, and eventually  
allow Warner-Lambert to co-promote one of its new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 deal has worked almost too well. Lipitor sales have  
soared beyond anyone's expectations. This year, the drug is 
expected to record $3.3 billion in sales. By 2002, the drug is 
expected to become the world's best-selling medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, its time for Pfizer fulfill its quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	But that's proving tricky because it is doubtful that Pfizer has  
a drug under development with the potential to do as well as 
Lipitor, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Lambert officials said they are in negotiations with  
Pfizer, and expect to complete them in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``A quid for a drug like Lipitor is not easily found,'' Lodewijk  
J.R. de Vink, Warner-Lambert's chairman and chief executive 
officer, said at a meeting with analysts on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer has several promising drugs in its pipeline, including  
the first type of inhaled insulin. But figuring out which drug will 
become a mega-blockbuster like Lipitor is fraught with risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a piece of a future Pfizer drug is a critical move for  
Warner-Lambert, particularly as pressure mounts on the company to 
sustain strong earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert said Tuesday that its profit growth would slow  
from 30 percent this year to 20 percent in 2000. That figure is on 
the low end of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert's top officials said the profit growth would  
decelerate because the company is dramatically bigger than before, 
and it plans to puts more money into research and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slowdown, Warner-Lambert's 20 percent growth should  
still be among drug industry leaders, de Vink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are expecting an earnings per share increase of 30  
percent, or $1.92 per share, in 1999, which de Vink said the 
company would meet. The growth will decrease to 20 percent in 2000, 
said de Vink, who did not provide a specific earnings-per-share 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were expecting the company's profit growth to be in the  
20 percent to 25 percent range. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pure statistics,'' de Vink said. ``Anyone who thinks we  
can continue accelerating growth when you put billions on top of 
billions in sales, is not taking a realistic view of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert wants co-marketing rights from Pfizer for a drug  
expected to have at least $1 billion in sales, de Vink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lamberton, an analyst with HSBC Securities, said the  
problem may be that Warner-Lambert may be pushing for marketing 
rights to more than one Pfizer drug to get a return on par with 
Lipitor's sales. But, he said, Pfizer may want to limit 
Warner-Lambert to just one. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Lambert's sales have risen from $8.2 billion in 1997 to  
$10.2 billion last year. Net income jumped from $870 million in 
1997 to $1.25 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the profit growth slowing could hurt the stock  
price, which some said is among the cheapest in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market does not like decelerating earnings per share  
growth even for a company like Warner-Lambert,'' said Hemant Shah, 
an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co in Warren, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Treatment Costs Comparable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) -- Experimental treatments can cost little  
more than standard cancer care, even though most health plans 
refuse to cover clinical trials in the belief that they are 
significantly more expensive, researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference was about $247 a month,'' said Dr. Steve  
Alberts, a Mayo Clinic oncologist and lead investigator of the 
study. ``That's a negligible amount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most health plans refuse to cover experimental cancer treatments  
for cost reasons. Medical experts claim this policy prevents 
patients from receiving the most promising treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	If more people get new therapies, researchers may more quickly  
develop additional treatments and, in turn, provide patients a 
better quality of life and improve their chances of being cured, 
Alberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the study, the first of its kind in the nation, are  
published in Wednesday's issue of the ``Journal of the National 
Cancer Institute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Alberts and his colleagues followed 61 patients  
who entered clinical trials of various treatments at the Mayo 
Clinic from 1988 through 1994. They were compared with the same 
number of patients who had similar tumors and who were eligible for 
clinical trials but opted for standard therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients were followed for five years, or until they died.  
Hospital, physician and related service costs were estimated from a 
population-based cost database that was developed by Mayo Clinic 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the researchers found the average total cost  
in 1995 inflation-adjusted dollars among patients enrolled in 
clinical trials was $46,424, compared to $44,133 for those who 
received standard treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, about 20,000 cancer patients enroll in clinical  
trials each year, experts say. The goal of the Association of 
American Cancer Institutes, which represents the Mayo Clinic and 89 
other leading cancer centers around the nation, is to boost the 
number to 60,000 patients.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is hinting strongly that  
it might raise a key interest rate soon -- possibly this summer. 
That would mean higher borrowing costs for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Federal Reserve is very likely on a course to raising  
interest rates if it looks like inflation pressures will continue 
to build,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist with Primark 
Decision Economics in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a worrisome 0.7 percent jump in consumer prices in April  
-- the biggest one-month increase in nine years -- Fed policy-makers 
decided at a meeting Tuesday that inflation is not yet enough of a 
threat to justify an immediate increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members  
and regional bank presidents, ended closed-door discussions with a 
decision to leave the target for the federal funds rate, the 
interest that banks charge each other, unchanged, at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But they put financial markets on notice that higher rates are  
likely in coming months, warning of the ``need to be alert'' to 
possible inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in the federal funds rate are important to consumers  
because commercial banks normally follow suit in the prime lending 
rates. Borrowers end up paying more for mortgages, auto loans, 
credit cards and business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's next interest rate meeting is June 29-30. While some  
economists believe a rate increase could occur then, many believe 
the central bank will wait until its August meeting or later to 
start raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald D. Cohen of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. was one of a few who  
still predict the economy will slow enough on its own to prove to 
Fed policy-makers that no rate is needed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. economy remains healthy and growth is already  
starting to moderate,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's Fed warning was the first use of a new procedure, put  
into effect in December, by which the central bank immediately 
informs the public of major shifts in its views about the balance 
of risks to the economy. In the past, the central bank has waited 
eight weeks before revealing in its minutes any changes in its 
policy bias. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance  
of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential 
for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the 
favorable performance of the economy,'' the Fed said. The one-page 
statement announced a shift in ``policy bias'' from neutral to 
leaning toward a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say that warning alone may be enough to nudge  
interest rates that are determined by financial markets in the 
direction the Fed wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Some evidence that the economy might be slowing spontaneously  
also emerged on Tuesday. The Commerce Department reported that 
construction of new homes and apartments fell for the third 
straight month with the 10.1 percent April decline the biggest 
monthly drop in more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many economists blamed the April surge in prices on  
one-time factors that they said overstated inflation pressures. 
They noted that other indicators of inflation, including wage 
pressures, had shown no signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers, however, noted in their statement that  
``domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic 
prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last 
fall,'' when the FOMC cut the federal funds rate three times in an 
effort to restore investor confidence and avert a worldwide 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. markets have since soared to record levels, bolstered by  
low interest rates and continued strength in the U.S. economy, 
which is enjoying the lowest unemployment levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, ``against the background of already tight domestic labor  
markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity 
gains, the committee recognizes the need to be alert to 
developments over coming months that might indicate that financial 
conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation,'' 
the FOMC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its series of interest rate cuts last fall, the Fed has  
been in a neutral stance, meaning a rate cut was as likely as a 
rate increase. The federal funds rate has been at 4.75 percent 
since Nov. 17.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Worries about a possible rise in U.S. interest  
rates sent Japanese stock prices sharply lower Wednesday for the 
fifth consecutive trading day. The U.S. dollar climbed to a 
seven-month high against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 250.44 points,  
or 1.53 percent, closing at 16,128.18. The average now has fallen a 
total of 819.18 points in five days, including Tuesday's 
42.40-point drop, or 0.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.70 yen at late afternoon, up 0.84 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
123.20 yen overnight. In Wednesday's trading, the dollar ranged 
between 123.25 yen and 124.03 yen, its highest intraday level in 
Tokyo since Nov. 30, 1998, when it traded at 124.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks remained in negative territory  
throughout Wednesday's trading after the U.S. Federal Reserve's 
Open Market Committee decided Tuesday to leave interest rates 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee did, however, put financial markets on notice that  
it is poised to raise interest rates if inflation concerns in the 
U.S. economy continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more  
attractive to investors, but lighten returns on equities and 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market has been in a correction phase in recent  
sessions since the Nikkei index surged to its highest closing level 
since October 1997 on May 6, some traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market levels have been running ahead of economic  
fundamentals, and if the fundamentals aren't keeping up, share 
values are going to fall to get in line with them,'' said Yasuo 
Ueki, chief executive officer of POCO Financial Business 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also remained under pressure as many investors stayed  
cautious ahead of more Japanese corporate earnings announcements in 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 601  
million shares, up from Tuesday's turnover of 541 million shares. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 937 to 278, with 98 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 23.54 points, or 1.78 percent, to 1,300.61. 
The TOPIX gained 1.72 points, or 0.13 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar advanced on buying from  
overseas players following the Fed committee's decision to assume a 
tightening bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese trust banks were among other dollar-buying players.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also god support from a widening of the interest-rate  
differential between Japan and the United States, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, bond prices dropped Tuesday amid fear of a future  
rise in interest rates, driving the yield on the benchmark 30-year 
U.S. Treasury bond up to 5.91 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.325 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.280 percent, driving its price down to 101.55 yen from 101.96 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 131.60 yen, up from  
131.30 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Lenny Kravitz, retro rocker  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Lenny Kravitz was born on May 26, 1964. His  
mother, Roxie Roker, played Helen Willis in the long-running 
television sitcom ``The Jeffersons.'' His father, Sy Kravitz, 
worked as a television producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kravitz grew up in New York and Los Angeles. At 10, he was  
already learning guitar and writing. He performed with the 
California Boys Choir and on records with Zubin Mehta. By high 
school, however, he was a born-again rock 'n' roller. 
</P>
<P>
	His mixed heritage is echoed in his style of funky rock. ``I'm  
one of these caught-in-the-middle-guys, which is strange,'' he has 
said. ``The white-leaning stations say, 'Oh, it's too funky!' The 
black stations say, 'Oh, it's too rock!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kravitz doesn't consider himself a jazz musician, the  
list of musicians who have inspired him include Duke Ellington, 
Bobby Short, Shirley Bassey, Cleo Laine, Ella Fitzgerald, Count 
Basie and Joe Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have jazz in me, and I think jazz and understand jazz. The  
fact I've experienced lots of different styles of music has helped 
me and been a major asset, and the fact I can play and understand a 
lot of styles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Albums:* Kravitz has been retro since his 1989 debut album,  
``Let Love Rule.'' ``Mama Said'' (1991), ``Are You Gonna Go My 
Way'' (1993) and ``Circus'' (1995) were steeped in the classic 
funk, rock and soul styles of the 1960s and early '70s. He won a 
Grammy for ``Fly Away,'' a song from ``5,'' the title of his fifth 
album. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Upcoming:* ``American Woman'' is the first single from the  
soundtrack of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' which 
opens in theaters June 11. Kravitz covers the 1970 Guess Who song, 
which is the theme of Felicity Shagwell, Powers' new 
babe-of-the-moment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reports Serb Troop Desertions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vigorously defending his Kosovo policy,  
President Clinton said Wednesday NATO airstrikes were ``the best 
available way'' to retaliate against Serb massacres of ethnic 
Albanians. The State Department produced vidotape and surveillance 
photographs it said verified the massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative to the NATO campaign, Clinton said, would have  
been ``sitting on my hands, letting those people be butchered and 
thrown out of their homes and plundered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after Clinton spoke at a Democratic Party  
fund-raiser in New York, the State Department exhibited videotape 
taken with a home camera by an Albanian villager purporting to show 
that Serbs had intercepted a group of elderly men at Izbica in 
mid-April and massacred them. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the film  
confirmed U.S. surveillance photographs that the Yugoslav 
government had dismissed as forgeries. The film is evidence of war 
crimes and will be submitted to an international tribunal at The 
Hague, Netherlands, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to three rows of graves and said they had been dug by  
the villagers. Rubin also said there were eyewitnesses to the 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department also reported at least 500 Serb soldiers  
had deserted in the Serbian province of Kosovo, and said it was a 
sign that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was ``feeling the 
heat'' of the 8-week-old air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, in reporting Serb desertions, said some of the soldiers  
went home to join families demonstrating against the Belgrade 
government. He cited ``credible reports'' without identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the desertions Tuesday were more significant  
than earlier ones because ``it involved entire units.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic himself may now see the writing on the wall and may  
be looking for a way out of the catastrophe that he has created,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``I think you're  
seeing, almost anyplace you look now, signs of problems for 
Milosevic. You have now demonstrations in three different towns 
where he's having to divert troops to go and try to quell these 
internal demonstrations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Armed Service Committee, meanwhile, voted to impose  
new spending restrictions on Clinton's conduct of the military 
operation. Democrats denounced the GOP-led move as sending 
conflicting messages to U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic front, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  
Talbott said there was ``really no fundamental difference'' between 
the United States and Russia on how to settle the conflict in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that there is somebody else who is not  
participating in the meetings, of course, and that's Mr. Milosevic 
and the leadership in Belgrade,'' Talbott said. ``They understand, 
I think, clearly what is necessary to bring about a suspension of 
hostilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott spoke in Helsinki, Finland, after two days of talks with  
the Russian mediator Viktor Chernoymyrdin, who was in Belgrade on 
Wednesday. Talbott and Chernomyrdin are due to resume talks in 
Moscow on Thursday along with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, 
who had joined negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia opposes the NATO bombing and has urged a suspension while  
Milosevic considers demands by the U.S. and its allies that he 
withdraw virtually all of his troops from Kosovo and permit 
refugees to return home under NATO protection. Milosevic has shown 
no sign of accepting the U.S. and NATO demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a passionate defense of his actions in Kosovo, said  
he knew ``a lot of people have questioned what I have done and how 
I have done it in Kosovo. All I can tell you, is I'm convinced I've 
done the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he has worked hard during the past six years  
``to be a force for peace,'' from Northern Ireland to the Middle 
East to the Balkans. And he said he found it ironic that ``in this 
great modern world we live in, we still can't figure out what to do 
about genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would far rather be here today answering the questions that  
I have to answer to the American people and to the press about what 
we have done and why we have done it and how we've done it, than 
... if I were sitting on my hands letting those people be butchered 
and thrown out of their homes and plundered and their records 
erased,'' he said.

	U.S. Reports Serb Desertions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 500 Serb soldiers have deserted in  
Kosovo, a sign that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is 
``feeling the heat'' of NATO airstrikes, the State Department said 
today. Some of the soldiers went home to join families 
demonstrating against the Belgrade government, spokesman James P. 
Rubin said, citing ``credible reports'' without identifying them. 
He said the desertions ``involved entire units, all of one 
battalion, perhaps much of additional battalions.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Russian Envoy Calls for Bombing Halt  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin  
urged both NATO and the Yugoslav army today to ``stop the bombings 
and make a pause.'' Chernomyrdin flew to Belgrade today to meet 
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and was likely to 
discuss details of the latest peace proposal meant to end the 
Kosovo conflict. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's news agency claimed that 
NATO missiles caused ``great'' damage and the deaths of four people 
in Serbia. 

</P>

	Russia Approves New Prime Minister  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's parliament handed Boris Yeltsin another  
victory today, approving loyalist Sergei Stepashin as new prime 
minister just days after the Russian president fired Premier 
Yevgeny Primakov and faced down an impeachment attempt. Stepashin 
said urgent measures were needed to kick-start the country's 
stalled economy. He promised to reinvigorate Russian industry, 
especially the military-industrial complex, and to 
``decriminalize'' the economy.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress today to  
approve $60 million for converting a New York post office into a 
massive transportation hub reminiscent of the city's grand but 
demolished Penn Station. The president took part in a ceremony 
launching the redevelopment of the 1.4 million-square-foot James A. 
Farley Post Office into a new Pennsylvania Station terminal with 
access to Amtrak's high-speed train, commuter and subway rails, as 
well as airports, buses and taxis.

<P>
	OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A blood test has found that a former  
reporter who was fired for writing fictitious columns about her 
health does not have AIDS as she once claimed, the 
Messenger-Inquirer reported today. Kim Stacy was fired by the 
Owensboro newspaper May 10 after she admitted that five columns she 
wrote detailing her battle against terminal brain cancer were 
fabrications. At the time of her dismissal, she said she lied in 
the columns to avoid revealing she had AIDS.

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Bob Smith  
says conservative members of the GOP may move to start a third 
party because they believe too many Republicans are abandoning the 
conservative planks of the party's platform. Smith, a conservative 
senator from New Hampshire, said conservatives are frustrated about 
stands on gun rights, national defense, school prayer, low taxes 
and opposition to abortion.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today renewed its court  
battle to strip U.S. citizenship from John Demjanjuk, an alleged 
Nazi death camp guard who escaped a death penalty in Israel when 
evidence arose that he was a victim of mistaken identity. The 
department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations, which 
was criticized by a U.S. appellate court for ``reckless'' 
withholding of evidence that might have cleared Demjanjuk in the 
earlier case, filed a new complaint in U.S. District Court in 
Cleveland, where the 79-year-old retired auto worker lives.

<HEADLINE> Columbine High Loses Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- For a moment, the scene appeared sadly  
familiar: Columbine High School students huddled together, crying 
and hugging fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
	But tears gave way to laughter at this occasion -- the Colorado  
girl's state soccer championship, a joyful contrast to the horror 
that tore the soul of Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Green Mountain Rams on Tuesday spoiled  
Columbine's bid to win its first girl's soccer crown, beating the 
Rebels 2-0. But the loss seemed almost incidental as thousands of 
fans found cause to cheer in the twilight of a lovely spring 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt so good to hear them sing `We are Columbine,''' said  
senior midfielder Meredith Russo. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand people filled the stands at the Englewood High  
School stadium to root for a team that dedicated its season to the 
12 classmates and teacher who were slain during the shooting attack 
a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fans was Patrick Ireland, a student who was shot in  
the attack April 20. Ireland gained nationwide attention after 
television cameras caught him escaping from the gunmen through a 
second-floor window. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people hugged Ireland during the half-time break, and  
he smiled and cheered along with his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and their families had rallied behind the team as they  
marched into the championship game. ``We are Columbine'' and ``Good 
Luck Rebels'' banners dotted the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	After the loss, the Rebels got a standing ovation from their  
fans -- and from the Green Mountain supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made me a little more sad because it is my last year  
here. I'm going to miss all these people and Columbine,'' said 
senior co-captain Angie Portincaso. Her advice to those she is 
leaving behind: ``Don't take anything for granted. You never know 
what can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Principal Frank DeAngelis, just returning to a normal high  
school event was a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still proud of the girls,'' he said. ``I'm hurting for  
them because they worked so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine coach Peter Horvath said he tried to keep the girls  
focused on the challenge of taking the state title, despite obvious 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have been more proud of them if we had won,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Failed Rockets Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton ordered an investigation  
Wednesday into a troubling string of six U.S. rocket failures in 
less than nine months. Losses have totaled $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is vitally important that we fully understand the root  
causes behind the recent launch vehicle failures and take 
corrective action,'' Clinton said in a memo to Defense Secretary 
William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton instructed Cohen to coordinate his work with CIA  
Director George Tenet and NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin and to 
report preliminary findings within 90 days, with a final report due 
in six months. Neal Lane, the president's assistant for science and 
technology, will assist in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no suspicion of foreign sabotage,'' said National  
Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer. ``The Air Force does not 
believe there's a common technical problem that connects these 
various incidents.'' He said the CIA was involved because it had 
equipment on some of the launches. 
</P>
<P>
	The failed rockets were carrying three military satellites, two  
commercial communication satellites, and a privately owned 
satellite capable of taking detailed, military-quality photographs 
of Earth. Two of the rockets exploded on launch, three satellites 
were stuck in useless orbits and another satellite vaporized in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	With 52 U.S. launches since the beginning of 1998, the six  
failures represent a failure rate of more than 10 percent -- twice 
the rate experienced in the previous six years. Three of the 
rockets were launched by the Air Force and three by aerospace 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our national space transportation capabilities are critical to  
the overall strength and stability of our commercial, civil and 
national security space sectors,'' Clinton said in a memo to Cohen. 
``As we enter the 21st century, reliable access to space will be 
more important than ever in accomplishing our national goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The failures also are being investigated by contractors Lockheed  
Martin Corp. and Boeing Co.

<HEADLINE>  Two U.S. Directors Liven Up Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- After a sluggish start to the Cannes Film  
Festival, American directors Tim Robbins and Jim Jarmusch have 
spiced up the proceedings with two highly praised works that play 
up their particular -- and very different -- skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither man is a stranger to Cannes. Robbins won as an actor in  
1992 for Robert Altman's ``The Player,'' and also presented his own 
film, ``Bob Roberts,'' here. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's back directing an ambitious, ``mostly true'' period  
drama about Depression-era New York and a theater world threatened 
by anti-communist censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cradle Will Rock'' climaxes with the true story of the evening  
in 1936 when a theater troupe tried to open a polemical musical by 
Marxist playwright Marc Blitzstein. Earlier that day, amid 
congressional hearings into communist activity, authorities had 
shut the theater down. 
</P>
<P>
	The troupe marched through Manhattan with the public in tow, and  
the actors, forbidden by their unions from performing, bravely 
stood up from the audience, one by one, to play their roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins' film is a mostly successful rendering of a time many  
young moviegoers know little about, featuring a star-studded cast: 
Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave, John Turturro, John and Joan 
Cusack, Bill Murray, Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen and Hank Azaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the characters are real, some more successfully rendered  
than others. MacFadyen looks like the young Orson Welles but falls 
short of an authentic portrayal, and Sarandon does not quite 
convince as an Italian mistress of Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
	Turturro, though, shines as an actor in Welles' company, John  
Cusack is funny as young Nelson Rockefeller, and Murray is terrific 
as an anti-communist ventriloquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the film got a big ovation from the international  
audience at its premiere, the French press was decidedly lukewarm, 
calling it ``without finesse'' and heavy-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	They surely won't be saying that about Jarmusch's film, ``Ghost  
Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' a brilliantly clever take on the 
dying world of the Mafia and the ancient world of the samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghost Dog is a tranquil-spirited contract killer, played with  
appropriate serenity by Forest Whitaker. He lives with a flock of 
birds on the roof of an abandoned building and communicates with 
his Mafia employers by carrier pigeon. He lives by a strict, 
ancient code -- the Way of the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmusch weaves real passages of an ancient samurai text into  
the film, which has a wistful undertone: Both worlds, it says, are 
ill-equipped for modern times. ``We're like two ancient tribes,'' 
Ghost Dog tells his Mafia boss at one point, ``both almost 
extinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the strength of the film is that it is wickedly funny,  
especially in its portrayal of the aging mobsters -- men who can't 
get up the stairs on their way to a rubout without huffing and 
puffing. In one standout scene, the mobsters joke about the 
ridiculous names of rap singers and Indian chiefs. Then we learn 
their own names: Sammy the Snake, Handsome Frank and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmusch, who's won two awards at Cannes, says he built these  
characters from his experience living in New York's Little Italy, 
where he witnessed the death of the old Mafia order. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he says, some of his actors come from that world.  
``They're gentlemen to me, but they've also killed people,'' he 
says.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Univs. To Tighten Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's Roman Catholic colleges and  
universities are trying to get the U.S. bishops to soften a plan to 
assert tighter control over the nation's 240 church-related 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities said the  
church should recognize that the schools are governed by academic 
expectations and secular law and that their survival depends on 
continued public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	In a draft issued last year, the bishops proposed to require  
that every university president take an oath of church fidelity, 
that Catholics constitute a majority of faculty members if 
possible, and that local bishops have the power to approve 
appointments of theology professors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a counterproposal posted on the Internet over the weekend,  
the Catholic colleges and universities suggested that all three 
measures be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee that drafted the bishops' proposal has received  
more than 100 proposed amendments from bishops and educators. It 
will consider these at a June 28-9 meeting in Washington. The 
committee plans to bring a revised version for debate and decision 
by the full U.S. hierarchy in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the bishops' committee, Bishop John Leibrecht of  
Springfield, Mo., said that all the proposed changes ``will be 
taken seriously by the committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We're looking for a way, agreed upon by bishops and  
universities and the Vatican, that will better ensure the Catholic 
nature of our institutions of higher education, even as they 
continue to participate in the broader context of American higher 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joseph O'Hare, president of Jesuit-related Fordham  
University in New York City, said he is optimistic that the bishops 
will issue a final text that educators can live with. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the Vatican issued a decree asserting its ultimate  
right to intervene in any campus dispute and declaring that 
colleges have academic freedom only ``within the confines of the 
truth and the common good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican officials and some U.S. Catholics have been bothered by  
criticisms of church policy from teachers at church colleges. This 
month, Catholic conservatives protested the abortion-rights views 
of 15 commencement speakers at Catholic colleges, among them 
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Character Development Panel Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to last month's high school  
shootings in Colorado, the Senate approved creation of a national 
Commission on Character Development on Wednesday to study the 
impact of cultural influences on good citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel -- to include one student and one parent among 36  
members -- would have two years to present Congress with 
recommendations for legislation. The provision was approved by 
voice vote -- and attached to legislation that has become the focus 
of a fierce struggle over gun control since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That struggle continued during the day as Democrats sought a  
vote on re-designed legislation they said would close a loophole 
that now allows some sales at gun shows to take place without a 
background check. Republicans said that even as redrafted, the 
measure was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It eliminates all unnecessary bureaucratic paperwork and red  
tape that was purportedly conained in original amendment,'' argued 
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said records of background checks would be expunged  
after 90 days, a gesture to law-abiding gun owners who fear 
creation of a national gun registry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said the proposal would allow  
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to impose a new fee on 
gun purchasers. He also said it would give the government three 
days to complete the background check -- by which time the gun show 
would have ended. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote on the proposal was postponed as the two sides engaged in  
a series of back-room negotiations on the legislation, which has 
been pending on the Senate floor since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The national commission was part of an amendment introduced by  
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. The proposal underscored an effort by 
Republicans to turn attention toward cultural influences on young 
people, particularly in the wake of the shootings in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission would be charged with studying ``the impact of  
current cultural influences ... on the process of developing and 
instilling the key aspects of character, which include 
trust-worthiness, honesty. integrity, an ability to keep promises, 
loyalty, respect, responsibility, fairness, a caring nature and 
good citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel would include members of the clergy as well as  
representatives of law enforcement, the information industry and 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Republicans, Democrats have chosen to place more  
emphasis on gun control issues as the Senate grapples with a 
response to last month's high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the GOP-controlled Senate rejected a Democratic call  
for mandatory background checks for all gun show purchasers, and 
approved a Republican alternative calling for optional checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 24 hours, Republicans backpedaled under pressure, and  
approved a substitute that they said would make background checks 
mandatory at shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said that measure contained a loophole, and would  
continue to permit unlicensed dealers to sell weapons without 
conducting a background check on the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they said it had opened a new loophole by  
permitting individuals to sell their guns at pawnshops and reclaim 
them without a check. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need this amendment to close the gun show loophole once and  
for all,'' Lautenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders were hoping to line up the votes to defeat  
that proposal, and efforts were underway to draft a GOP proposal 
that reversed the pawnshop provision but left the gun show 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate struggle, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, argued at  
length against a proposal by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., to give 
school officials greater leeway in disciplining students with 
disabilities who bring guns to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin refused to agree to limit debate, at one point telling  
inquiring Republicans he needed to continue speaking ``Because I am 
so poor at getting across my point, it seems.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Bill Strips Gore Project Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was political ``Star Wars'' in the House on  
Wednesday as Republicans prevailed during debate on a $42 billion 
NASA bill, stripping an Internet earth-viewing project initiated by 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed 259-168, with most Democrats opposing it.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the eliminating $32 million to continue Gore's  
Triana satellite project was an attempt to embarrass the party's 
2000 presidential front-runner. Republicans said the program was 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin might  
recommend a presidential veto of the bill -- which also sets how 
much is to be spent over the next three years on the space station 
and the space shuttle -- if the Triana program is not revived. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore last year initiated the idea of putting a satellite in  
orbit that would provide 24-hour views of the earth for TV viewers 
and Internet users. NASA, agreeing the project had scientific and 
educational value, plans to launch the Triana spacecraft in 
December next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House Science Committee, on a party-line 21-18 vote,  
decided to close down the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Weldon, R-Fla., who initiated the amendment, said he  
considered it an ``insult'' that NASA was laying off 600 workers at 
Kennedy Space Center at the same time it was ``finding tens of 
millions of dollars to fulfill a vision for the vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that people wanting a view of the earth can  
already turn to the Weather Channel or NASA's TV channel. Triana 
supporters say it will transmit an image twice as clear as new 
high-resolution television sets and will be unique in presenting a 
full-earth view. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Science Committee, Rep. James  
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said it was ``more important to spend $32 
million on medical research than on funding the vice president's 
late-night inspiration for a multimillion dollar screen-saver 
called Triana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are ``Luddites'' who are politicizing science, said  
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane, referring to the 19th century workers 
who smashed newfangled machines in a vain effort to hold onto their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to need a safety lock on the GOP to help protect  
the American people from such blatant partisanship,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., ranking Democrat on the space  
subcommittee, said the move was ``totally parochial, totally 
partisan.'' He said NASA has already spent $40 million on the $75 
million project and it would cost more to cancel it than to save 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope they will change their mind,'' said Dave Steitz,  
spokesman for NASA. ``We would like them to base their decision on 
the science of the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats said they would reluctantly support the bill,  
but hoped the Senate would restore the money for the project, which 
is named for the sailor who first spotted the New World on the 
journey with Christopher Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year bill also sets U.S. spending over the next three  
years at $7 billion for the international space station, $7.8 
billion for space shuttle operations and $4.2 billion for earth 
science programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House defeated, 313-117, an amendment that would have ended  
Russian participation in the space station. Under the proposal by 
Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., Russia could contract for future space 
station work but would no longer be a partner in the 16-nation 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians repeatedly have been behind schedule in completing  
their work, driving up U.S. costs by as much as $5 billion. 
Sensenbrenner said the Russians were ``a miserable failure in being 
a partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others warned the amendment seriously could undermine  
fragile U.S.-Russian relations and kill a project that is finally 
making headway. The first component of the station, the 
U.S.-funded, Russian-built Zarya module, was launched last 
November. NASA followed in December with its Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the House by voice accepted an amendment by Rep. John  
Sweeney, R-N.Y., requiring NASA to certify within 15 days that any 
proposed agreement with China would not improve the missile or 
space launch capabilities of China.

<HEADLINE> Alan Greenspan Contributes / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alan Greenspan contributes to American society  
in many ways, one of which involves the public's economic health, 
while another limits itself to a vigorous segment of the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The first and by far the more important role is in his capacity  
as chairman of the Federal Reserve, a position that grants him and 
his board of governors the power to raise or lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	By most measures, especially the success of the U.S. economy  
during the 1990s, the chairman is awarded gold stars for deftly 
finding a safe lane between recession and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of the style in which he performs this role he also  
provides a service to that vast industry based on trying to dope 
out what the Fed will do and what the consequences might be. 
</P>
<P>
	This the chairman accomplishes by speaking and acting in a way  
that keeps everyone on edge, never certain of what the Fed will do 
and leaving much of the message open to interpretation. A 
predecessor came up with a term for such tactics -- ``constructive 
ambiguity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interpreting Fed messages, such as the one it delivered this  
week, helps provide employment for thousands of economists and 
market analysts who will expend millions of words dissecting their 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
	They will issue interoffice flashes to brokers, update their  
Internet sites to reflect the latest nuances, mail lengthy 
advisories to clients, issue special editions of their newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
	They will explain how the Fed's comments could mean ``good news  
on the one hand but bad news on the other,'' and that while ``we 
remain optimistic (or pessimistic), one never really can be sure,'' 
and that ``our advice is to maintain positions until the air 
clears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From one 134-word Fed statement, they will find enough yeast for  
millions of words to hundreds of thousands of subscribers and 
clients who pay the highest per-word price in the writers' market. 
</P>
<P>
	The gist of the Fed statement issued Tuesday was that demand in  
the U.S. economy is growing faster than the supply of goods and 
services, notwithstanding the growth of productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases in productivity, or output per hour, have for months  
enabled workers to make real gains in take-home pay while allowing 
producers to supply goods without price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of that balance getting out of whack is such, said the  
Fed, that it presents the potential for a buildup of inflationary 
pressures, a suggestion that is hardly new. 
</P>
<P>
	It is well known that the Fed's antidote for such pressures is  
to nudge interest rates higher, hopefully allowing supply to catch 
up with demand. It is equally well known that Wall Street abhors 
such action, since it can also deflate stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, the Fed's message might seem pointedly clear,  
but -- a big ``but'' -- it didn't say for certain that it would 
indeed raise rates. And that gap is where analysts and forecasters 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not they have much worthwhile to say isn't the point.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street wants to know what's next, and in the absence of any  
factual information about that great unknown, various opinions are 
eagerly sampled and maybe acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, it's a living.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 30 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a nearly 2-1 lead 
over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 11 points and the S-and-P 500  
Index is up five points. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say stocks lack direction right now, but that the  
market may be showing some relief following the Fed's meeting 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the central bank signaled a rate hike may be on the  
way, it chose not to bump up short-term rates yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	And since the bond market had already priced in a move by the  
Fed, some market-watchers say there may now be a little room to 
move higher. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Street Wins Philly Mayor Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A politician's odyssey from fiery liberal  
activist to button-downed financial conservative has brought him a 
step closer to becoming Philadelphia's second black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Street, a former City Council president who was endorsed  
by Mayor Edward G. Rendell, won Tuesday's Democratic mayoral 
primary. He immediately became the favorite in the Nov. 2 general 
election to beat Republican financial consultant Sam Katz, who ran 
unopposed in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not just the fact that we won, it is the way that we won  
that makes it so important,'' said Street, thrusting his fist into 
the air. ``We have communicated a message of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 97 percent of precincts reporting early today, Street had  
35.5 percent of the vote, or 100,597 votes, to Marty Weinberg's 
31.2 percent, or 88,564 votes. The rest were split among 
lesser-known Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, a popular Democrat who is credited with bringing the  
nation's fifth-largest city back from the brink of financial ruin, 
is barred from seeking a third consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
	Street, 55, overcame a negative advertising blitz and his  
controversial past to defeat Weinberg, a longtime political power 
broker making his first bid for elected office. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg was virtually unknown in January but raised $5.2  
million and ran a flurry of television commercials blasting Street 
as a dangerous hothead, tax deadbeat and do-nothing legislator. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg reminded voters of Street's past as a community  
activist, showing old TV footage of Street shoving a reporter and 
throwing a cup of water on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad campaign enabled Weinberg, whose mentor and patron was  
the controversial late Mayor Frank Rizzo, to run neck-and-neck with 
Street as the primary approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Katz got into the act, running television commercials  
against Weinberg and other candidates. Pundits said Katz thought he 
had a better chance of beating Street than the other rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg blamed his defeat on those ads.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a close election and I think that Sam Katz achieved  
what he wanted to do, which was to run against John Street,'' 
Weinberg said early today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old Katz pledged to run an issues-oriented campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a campaign about issues, about neighborhoods,  
about the quality of our lives and about our economic future,'' 
said Katz, who made unsuccessful primary runs for mayor in 1991 and 
governor in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz took in $2.2 million and spent only $941,000, leaving him  
well-positioned to mount an aggressive campaign. Street raised and 
spent much of his $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Katz also faces a city in which Democrats dominate:  
Registered Republicans are outnumbered by a 7-2 ratio. And race is 
certain to play a role in a city where more than 40 percent of its 
1.5 million residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Rodriguez, who lives in the north Philadelphia  
neighborhood where Street greeted supporters this morning, 
predicted Street will win despite Weinberg's harsh portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so many other people pulling behind him. He's got  
Rendell,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said. ``God bless Street. May he be a 
good mayor.''

<HEADLINE> California's Health Care Costs Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Signaling an acceleration of health  
care costs, one of the nation's biggest buyers of employee benefits 
has agreed to an average premium increase of 9.7 percent next year 
with 10 HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements announced by the California Public Employees'  
Retirement System and the health maintenance organizations cover 
776,000 state and local government employees and 332,000 retirees 
and represents the steepest increase since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	CalPERS contracts have a national impact. The pension fund is  
the nation's second-largest buyer of health care behind the federal 
government, and is one of the earliest big buyers to negotiate 
rates for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For workers who share health care premiums equally with their  
employers, the CalPERS agreement would add from $8 to $25 a month 
for full family coverage. And analysts and consumer advocates say 
that for workers in plans that have much less clout than CalPERS, 
the trend is ominous. 
</P>
<P>
	John Erb, vice president of Gallagher Benefit Services in Boca  
Raton, Fla., said the new CalPERS contracts will is a warning of 
the threat of a resurgence in ``the malignant inflation that almost 
killed employer-financed health insurance'' a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a huge purchaser. If anyone has negotiating clout  
with insurers, it's CalPERS,'' Erb said Wednesday. ``That's why all 
other employers look to them as a bellwether, and that's why it 
scares us. Advocating on behalf of employers, it kind of makes the 
hair on the back of your neck stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rate announced Tuesday and approved Wednesday compares  
with average increases in CalPERS' HMO contracts of 7.3 percent 
earlier this year and 2.7 percent in 1998. There were small 
declines in average premiums for CalPERS members in each of the 
four preceding years. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other health care consumers, CalPERS had double-digit  
premium increases in the early 1990s: 16.2 percent in 1990, 17.9 
percent in 1991, and 12.1 percent in 1992. The rise in premiums 
narrowed to 6.9 percent in 1993, the year President Clinton began 
an unsuccessful push for national health reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst news we could possibly receive. CalPERS sets  
a benchmark that means the rest of us are going to see double-digit 
increases in our premiums,'' said Jamie Court of the 
California-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Steinmetz, chief of CalPERS' health benefit services  
division, said ``an adjustment was necessary after several years of 
reductions or minor increases. We hope to return to moderation next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinmetz said concern about the solvency of many health care  
provider groups which contract with the HMOs was a factor in the 
increases. He said the CalPERS contracts weren't drafted to require 
that the extra funds are passed on to physicians and other 
providers, but that Calpers would be monitoring all of the HMOs to 
see if that occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Stanley, CalPERS' health benefits manager, said she was  
confident that ``HMOs are still our best bet for controlling health 
care costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CalPERS' aggressive bargaining with HMOs has been criticized  
within California's medical community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually they do too good a job. That's why physician groups  
are going bankrupt,'' said Steve Thompson, lobbyist for the 
35,000-member California Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said recognition of the financial pressures on  
physicians was long overdue, noting that ``of the two largest 
physician associations, one going bankrupt, and the other is in 
conservatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the average rates and look at the cost of  
living over the past six years, CalPERS rates increased about 1.1 
percent, and the cost of living increased about 23 percent. So 
that's a 22 percent real reduction, and the HMOs foisted all of 
that dollar reduction down on physician groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CalPERS officials said the employee share of the rate increase  
varies among the 1,250 government agencies, depending on local 
contracts with employee unions.

<HEADLINE> Inventors Scammed of $60 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Thousands of inventors who dreamed of  
bringing their ideas to consumers were cheated out of $60 million 
by a group that promised to patent and market their designs, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people at a network of companies swindled about 34,000  
inventors, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patenting and marketing services they provided were  
worthless,'' said U.S. Attorney Donald Stern. ``The big dreams of 
small inventors were exploited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In federal indictments unsealed Tuesday, prosecutors named  
Ronald Boulerice, 60, as leader of the network. He was president 
and owner of American Inventors Corp., which closed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Boulerice also controlled American Institute for  
Research and Development, Massachusetts Patent Services, Washington 
Financial Group, and United Patent and Trademark Services. The 
other individuals charged occupied a range of positions for the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulerice pleaded innocent to charges that include mail fraud,  
conspiracy, money laundering and tax evasion. He faces up to 135 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies at the center of the investigation sent mass  
mailings, promising to help inventors patent and market their 
inventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the inventors came up with such ideas as a  
man's suit that could be ``air conditioned'' with cool water, a 
tritium night-vision scope for rifles, and a ``binge buster fork'' 
with a tiny timer that signals when to stop eating. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is in these 34,000, there were probably some very  
good ideas,'' Stern said. ``I'm not sure about the air-conditioned 
suit.''

<HEADLINE> Quayle Speech Draws Fresh Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Seven years after his ``Murphy Brown''  
speech, GOP presidential hopeful Dan Quayle touched off a fresh 
round of criticism Wednesday with an anniversary address scolding 
legal and media ``elites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a May 19, 1992 speech, then-Vice President Quayle accused the  
TV show of glamorizing unwed motherhood by having its title 
character give birth out of wedlock. He blamed ``cultural elites'' 
for eroding moral values. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle returned to the same forum -- the Commonwealth Club of  
California -- on Wednesday to expand his list of villains, most of 
them members of what he called the ``legal aristocracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, this aristocracy has bit by bit undermined  
parental authority, weakened school discipline, and obstructed 
moral education,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, are lawyers. He criticized  
``aristocrats'' who live in gated communities; he has a home in 
such a community, in the Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	He charged that ``children's rights zealots'' are undermining  
parents with lawsuits and that the American Bar Association had 
gone overboard in endorsing an international treaty on children's 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the American Civil Liberties Union of forcing prayer  
out of schools, and said federal appeals courts have helped drive 
from the public square ``anything even remotely tied to religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Quayle's speech leaked out in advance, one of his targets,  
the Legal Services Corporation, implored him to delete an attack 
from his prepared text. The federally funded organization helps 
poor people sue when they believe they have been wronged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party will never gain the respect and support of the  
majority of our citizens if we are viewed as affirmatively denying 
poor citizens access to our system of justice,'' LSC President John 
McKay, a Republican, wrote to Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle went ahead and accused the LSC of advancing ``a left-wing  
agenda'' that elevated children's legal rights over those of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU's legislative office in  
Washington, D.C., said that, if elected, Quayle would oversee ``the 
largest law firm in the United States'' -- the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is frightening that he would be in charge of this legal  
operation and use it to destroy the separation of church and state, 
and impose his religious beliefs on everyone,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association accused Quayle of ``scapegoating.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Presidential candidates could be more productive by looking  
for pragmatic solutions to real problems, such as the easy 
availability of handguns and assault weapons, particularly among 
young people,'' said ABA President Philip S. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle did not mention ``Murphy Brown'' by name, but reiterated  
that ``two parents, married to each other, are better in most cases 
for children than one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the news and entertainment media were also to blame for  
a decline in moral values by conveying ``counterculture values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need help from the entertainment community -- from Hollywood  
-- and from the news media,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a question-and-answer session, Quayle compared present-day  
China to Germany at the turn of the 19th century -- the years in 
which Germany emerged as an aggressive military power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is beginning to develop, flex its muscles, show power,  
wanting to project its influence,'' Quayle said of China. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm correct that it is the Germany of 100 years ago, let us  
hope and pray that we do a much better job of managing the 
situation and the relationship with China than we did managing the 
situation with Germany in the first 45 years of this past 
century,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Shane Wants De La Hoya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He calls himself Sugar, and he wears his hair like another  
fighter who was called Sugar -- one who in the minds of many boxing 
people always will be the sweetest Sugar of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar Shane Mosley, is one of the best fighters in the world,  
but his head still fits his sparring helmet. And he doesn't claim 
to be Sugar Ray Robinson, generally considered the best 
pound-for-pound fighter in history ... or even Sugar Ray Leonard, 
who was no slouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley, however, wants to be worthy of being called Sugar, and  
so far he has been sweet -- 32-0. He has 30 knockouts, and has made 
eight defenses of the IBF lightweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 27-year-old Mosley wants to move up from the 135-pound  
division in hopes of following the two Sugar Rays as champion of 
the colorful and competitive 147-pound welterweight division. He'd 
like to do it by beating Oscar De La Hoya later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight would be one between boxer-punchers, who shun  
hot-dogging in a boxing age when there isn't enough mustard to go 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not going to happen this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Arum, who promotes De La Hoya, thinks it wouldn't be in his  
fighter's best interest at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press would jump all over Oscar for fighting somebody  
little,'' Arum said, but didn't close the door entirely on Mosley. 
``If he fights some top welterweights and beats them, then it 
becomes a legitimate fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mosley, who listens to father Jack, his manager, said if he  
doesn't fight De La Hoya, he will campaign for a time as a junior 
welterweight. He said he is supposed to fight in the 140-pound 
class against an unidentified opponent June 19 in New York, and 
another in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, Mosley said, ``I will never fight again as a  
lightweight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, he wants De La Hoya.  
</P>
<P>
	The reason -- besides the prospect of a big payday and having  
trouble making 135 -- is that Mosley is very familiar with De La 
Hoya. He estimates they sparred about 100 rounds as amateurs from 
1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the ring with Oscar as an amateur and I know who  
he is,'' Mosley explained, saying he has a thorough understanding 
of De La Hoya's style. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite what Arum says, Mosley could give De La Hoya a real  
fight. He's 5-foot-9, only two inches shorter than De La Hoya, and 
big enough to easily handle 147 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, in this era of weigh-ins a day before the fight, he's  
big enough to be in the 150s by fight time. When he was an amateur, 
Mosley fought at 139 pounds. De La Hoya won his 1992 Olympic gold 
medal at 132. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Duran was 5-7. Back in 1978, he relinquished the  
lightweight title after a seven-year reign. Two years later, he 
outpointed the 5-10 Leonard for the WBC welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, Henry Armstrong, the featherweight champion, moved up  
from 126 pounds to challenge welterweight champ Barney Ross. 
Armstrong, who weighed 133 1/2 pounds, 13 1/2 under the class limit, won 
a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In 19 successful defenses, Armstrong weighed less than 140  
pounds 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be better for De La Hoya to fight ``little'' Shane  
Mosley now, before he settles in as a bona fide welterweight.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Grave Robbing Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Tiffany glass expert teamed up with a grave  
robber to sell a 9-foot stained glass window stolen from a 
mausoleum, according to a federal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Alastair Duncan, 57, had worked as an adviser to the FBI,  
various police departments and Christie's auction house, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was charged Tuesday with conspiracy, transporting stolen  
property, witness tampering and structuring the sale of the art to 
evade paying taxes. If convicted, he could face a maximum of 10 
years in prison on the most serious charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The grave robber was not identified or charged.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the government's day,'' said Duncan's lawyer, Peter  
Vigeland. ``We look forward to the opportunity to contest these 
charges in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Duncan first crossed paths with the grave robber  
last year, when the thief wanted to sell the window he had stolen 
about seven years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The grave robber took the glass from the Salem Fields cemetery,  
on the border of Brooklyn and Queens, and offered to sell it to a 
middleman, who contacted Duncan, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, aware that the window had been stolen, bought it through  
a middleman for $60,000 and sold it to a buyer in Japan for 
$219,000, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Mausoleums and cemeteries are inviting targets for the theft of  
glass created by the late Louis Comfort Tiffany because they often 
have little or no security. The potential payout for the glass is 
great because so much of the artist's work was left in churches and 
mausoleums, leaving little to circulate in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
	The grave robber had worked in a cemetery and kept master keys  
for a number of cemeteries when he left, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan also asked the grave robber to shop for special orders,  
prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the thief found a large Tiffany stained-glass window in  
a mausoleum in Westchester County, Duncan allegedly turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``his guy'' needed a window that was bigger and had more  
trees, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Deem Hepatitis B Vaccine Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal scientists say Hepatitis B vaccine is  
safe and effective, despite reports that it can cause serious and 
even life-threatening side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying Tuesday before a House subcommittee investigating  
vaccine safety, officials said use of the vaccine has been 
monitored for 15 years and it has not been proven to be the cause 
of any deaths and is only rarely linked to serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vaccines are extremely safe, but they are not risk-free,''  
said Susan S. Ellenberg, an epidemiologist at the Food and Drug 
Administration. ``While serious complications are extremely rare, 
they do occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellenberg, testifying before the Government Reform subcommittee  
on criminal justice, drug policy and human resources, said a 
federal organization, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 
receives about 12,000 reports a year of incidents related to 
vaccines. Most incidents are minor, such as irritability or fever, 
but about 15 percent are serious, involving death, hospitalization 
or disability. All of the serious incidents are investigated, said 
Ellenberg, but no cause-and-effect connection with the hepatitis B 
vaccine has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,800 or so serious adverse event reports represent only a  
small fraction of the 1.2 million people who annually receive 
hepatitis B shots, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harold S. Margolis, a hepatitis authority at the Centers for  
Disease Control and Prevention, said his organization has seven 
investigations under way to determine whether any of the reported 
side effects can be linked to hepatitis vaccines. So far, no link 
has been found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC, the World Health Organization, the American Medical  
Association and most other major health organizations have 
supported adding hepatitis B to the regimen of childhood 
vaccinations. Forty-two states now require it for school admission.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers Baffled by Late Dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The first three quarters of the Portland  
Trail Blazers' opening game against the Utah Jazz went according to 
plan. Then they played the worst fourth quarter in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers' deep frontcourt had hounded, harassed and hacked  
Karl Malone into ineffectiveness for three quarters. Portland's 
team speed, youth and rest were making Utah look slow, old and 
tired. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was positioned for a Portland win -- but when the  
fourth quarter began, the Blazers' shots mysteriously stopped 
falling. Their poise soon evaporated into a cloud of turnovers and 
ill-advised shots as Utah exploded past them for a 93-83 win in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had a whole lot of things go wrong at the same time,''  
Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``Once we lost that momentum we 
had built up, we were vulnerable, and the Jazz know how to take 
advantage of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the series is Thursday night at the Delta Center.  
Portland's Greg Anthony called it ``a must-win game for us, because 
Utah is too tough to give a two-game lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At practice Wednesday morning, the Blazers weren't sure how much  
they should change their approach. After all, almost everything 
worked -- that is, until nothing did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to pinpoint a turning point there,'' said Damon  
Stoudamire, who committed four turnovers and missed two shots in 
the fourth. ``When you miss 14 of your 16 shots like we did, you're 
not going to win any game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland scored five fourth-quarter points, the fewest in any  
fourth quarter since the inception of the shot clock and the fewest 
in any quarter of any playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of breaks your spirits a little bit when that happens  
at the end of a game,'' forward Brian Grant said. ``We've just got 
to put it behind us, because it can't do us any good now, only 
harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After averaging 19 points and nine rebounds per game during  
Portland's first-round sweep of Phoenix, Grant had another solid 
game. He played just 31 minutes before fouling out, but got 19 
points on 8-of-13 shooting and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't give any fault to the referees, because they're part  
of the game,'' Grant said. ``We did a lot of good things, but 
mistakes down the stretch tend to negate all that good that you 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Jazz, it was their fourth straight game decided in the  
final minute. In the previous two, the Sacramento Kings pushed Utah 
to the brink of playoff elimination before letting the Jazz back in 
with missed shots and bad defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't beat ourselves, and sometimes in the playoffs, that's  
the difference,'' Malone said. ``We haven't played that well yet in 
the postseason, but we don't get caught up in the pressures ... of 
a high-intensity situation like the playoffs. We just take what 
they give us, and sometimes they'll give you the game if you let 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have beaten the Blazers three straight times going back  
to the regular season. Utah coach Jerry Sloan wanted to keep his 
team focused on Portland's three solid quarters of play in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared they knew our plays better than we did  
sometimes,'' Sloan said. ``They were much more lively than us, and 
we were fortunate that their open shots stopped going down. That 
was probably the only reason we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan praised forward Bryon Russell for his 18-point,  
seven-rebound performance. Russell said his sprained ankle is only 
75 percent healed, but he decisively won his matchup with Rasheed 
Wallace, who was 3-of-8 from the field and had just three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, who excels both in slashing to the basket and hitting  
the spot-up jumper, plays the kind of free-flowing game the Blazers 
enjoy. Though he is several inches shorter than Wallace, Russell's 
quickness counted more on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bryon gave us the effort we need at that spot. With all their  
quality big men, Bryon has to have a huge series for us to be 
successful,'' Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 10:35 left in the fourth quarter of Game 1 and the Blazers  
clinging to a 78-74 lead, Wallace slammed Russell to the floor 
while defending Russell's layup attempt. The resulting flagrant and 
technical fouls against Wallace allowed the Jazz to tie the game, 
and they never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
	``That play was no big thing to me, because I knew it was a  
bogus call,'' Wallace said. ``We weren't robbed of that game, but 
that call wasn't the thing that started us playing bad, either. I 
don't know what did that.''

<HEADLINE> Patch Found To Help Ruptured Aorta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When the main artery that carries blood from the heart tears,  
the victim is more likely to survive if doctors patch the hole 
rather than try to sew it closed or treat it with drugs, studies 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, represents the first look at whether a stent -- a 
wire-mesh tube that is inserted into the artery in a non-surgical 
procedure -- is more effective than surgery or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year in the United States, up to 5,500 people suffer from  
what is known as an aortic dissection, a tear in the aorta that can 
get larger. A burst aorta, if left untreated, is usually fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery and drugs are the standard treatments, but they have  
high rates of failure and can themselves result in death. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by Dr. Christoph A. Nienaber and colleagues at  
University Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, looked at 12 
patients who received stents and 12 who had surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery involves sewing the tear closed. To insert a stent,  
doctors thread a catheter -- a long, flexible tube -- into the artery 
and push the stent into place. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who received stents, there were no deaths or serious  
complications, such as stroke, paralysis in the legs, or a blood 
clot that travels to the lungs. Among those who had surgery, four 
died as a result of the operation itself and five suffered serious 
complications within the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	A second study, by Dr. Michael D. Dake and colleagues at  
Stanford University, looked at stents in 19 patients. Sixteen 
lived, and three died. Over the next year, there were no other 
deaths or cases of rupture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very attractive potential treatment that may  
represent a shift in the way we manage this very complex disease,'' 
Dake said. ``Now there is an alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gus. J. Vlahakes of the  
Massachusetts General Hospital cautioned that more research is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people are genetically predisposed to suffer an aortic  
rupture. High blood pressure can also contribute to a burst aorta.

<HEADLINE> Roy, Forsberg Lift Surging Avs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- They vanquished the two-time defending Stanley Cup  
champions, rallying from a 2-0 deficit to win four in a row. Now, 
they face the team with the best regular-season record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody said it was going to be easy for the Colorado Avalanche,  
who enjoyed a well-deserved day off Wednesday after eliminating the 
Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday night but who must quickly turn their 
focus to the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western Conference finals between Colorado and Dallas begin  
Saturday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Forsberg scored two goals as the Avalanche beat Detroit  
5-2 on Tuesday night to wrap up the conference semifinal series in 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Forsberg clearly justified his new $30 million  
contract with his all-around play in the last four games, it was 
goaltender Patrick Roy who was the catalyst for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, whose 12th career playoff shutout led Colorado to a 3-0  
victory in Game 5 in Denver on Sunday, made 35 saves Tuesday night, 
many of them brilliant when the game was close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an awesome feeling, coming back from 0-2,'' Forsberg  
said. ``Everybody's been stepping up, from the last guy to the 
first guy. And Patrick's been great in net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs coach Bob Hartley agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick is Patrick,'' Hartley said. ``He was outstanding. I'm  
not surprised with the way he played. I grew up around Montreal and 
I saw him win with the Canadiens. I saw him win a Stanley Cup with 
the Avalanche. He's rock solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Colorado lost the first two games of the series at home  
and appeared on the verge of being swept, Roy stopped 146 of 153 
shots as Colorado won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win four straight against Detroit -- I didn't think it was  
possible, to be honest,'' Roy said. ``But we had no choice. We put 
ourselves in a really bad position, losing those two games in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great comeback for us, being down 2-0. We took it one  
game at a time and played some great hockey. We won three games in 
Detroit, and it's not every team that can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blessed with talented skaters and puck-handlers, the Avalanche  
faltered early in the series with Detroit when they tried to get 
fancy, making too many passes or attempting the highlight-video 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played simple hockey,'' Roy said. ``That's how we won this  
series. It was a good series, and great for us to beat that team. 
They were the Stanley Cup champions, and we beat them. It feels 
good, but now we've got another series against another very tough 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Hartley predicted his team would wake up  
Wednesday morning ``and the Red Wings are going to be out of our 
system. We're facing a great hockey club in the Dallas Stars. They 
are the regular-season champions and they're going to be a great 
challenge for us. The Red Wings were on the road to the ultimate 
goal. We knew that it would be us or the Wings that would dance, 
and I'm very proud of our players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the bad blood that has defined Colorado-Detroit meetings  
since 1996, the Red Wings were gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose four straight like we did, you can't say the other  
team was lucky,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it as we underachieved,'' Red Wings captain  
Steve Yzerman said. ``Or you can look at it as we got beat by a 
great team. I choose to look at it as Colorado played fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made great adjustments from the first two games to the  
last four. Their top players played very well at both ends of the 
rink. Joe Sakic was excellent on penalty killing, on faceoffs, and 
he did all the little things well. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they got (Valeri) Kamensky back (for Game 3), it enabled  
(Adam) Deadmarsh to go back to that line with (Chris) Drury and 
(Shjon) Podein. They got production from all four lines, their 
defense is good and their goaltender was very solid. They did all 
the things through the last four games that are necessary not just 
to beat good teams, but to win the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While only 2-4 at home during the postseason so far this year,  
the Avs can take comfort in the fact they've been an amazing 6-0 on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Stars' 51-19-12 regular-season record, Colorado  
compiled a 2-1-1 record against them. Dallas defeated St. Louis in 
six games to advance to the next round.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Allows British Sex Slang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's film censors will permit a British  
slang term for sexual intercourse to remain in the title of a spy 
film being released next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Film Censors today announced that the word  
``shagged'' would be allowed to stay in the title of the movie, 
``The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Warner Bros. film is the sequel to the 1997 spoof, ``Austin  
Powers: International Man of Mystery.'' It opens June 24 in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a reversal for the film board, who last week  
said the word would have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The censors changed their minds after watching the film's  
trailer and deciding that ``the title does not reflect the contents 
of the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's educated Singaporeans are more mature and discerning  
enough to see the humor in it,'' the board said in a letter printed 
today in The Straits Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Sex is allowed in movies in Singapore that are considered  
``art,'' but those films ban anyone under 21 from attending. Movies 
for general distribution have nude scenes cut and offensive words 
spliced out.

<HEADLINE>  Two U.S. Directors Liven Up Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- After a sluggish start to the Cannes Film  
Festival, American directors Tim Robbins and Jim Jarmusch have 
spiced up the proceedings with two highly praised works that play 
up their particular -- and very different -- skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither man is a stranger to Cannes. Robbins won as an actor in  
1992 for Robert Altman's ``The Player,'' and also presented his own 
film, ``Bob Roberts,'' here. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's back directing an ambitious, ``mostly true'' period  
drama about Depression-era New York and a theater world threatened 
by anti-communist censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cradle Will Rock'' climaxes with the true story of the evening  
in 1936 when a theater troupe tried to open a polemical musical by 
Marxist playwright Marc Blitzstein. Earlier that day, amid 
congressional hearings into communist activity, authorities had 
shut the theater down. 
</P>
<P>
	The troupe marched through Manhattan with the public in tow, and  
the actors, forbidden by their unions from performing, bravely 
stood up from the audience, one by one, to play their roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins' film is a mostly successful rendering of a time many  
young moviegoers know little about, featuring a star-studded cast: 
Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave, John Turturro, John and Joan 
Cusack, Bill Murray, Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen and Hank Azaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the characters are real, some more successfully rendered  
than others. MacFadyen looks like the young Orson Welles but falls 
short of an authentic portrayal, and Sarandon does not quite 
convince as an Italian mistress of Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
	Turturro, though, shines as an actor in Welles' company, John  
Cusack is funny as young Nelson Rockefeller, and Murray is terrific 
as an anti-communist ventriloquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the film got a big ovation from the international  
audience at its premiere, the French press was decidedly lukewarm, 
calling it ``without finesse'' and heavy-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	They surely won't be saying that about Jarmusch's film, ``Ghost  
Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' a brilliantly clever take on the 
dying world of the Mafia and the ancient world of the samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghost Dog is a tranquil-spirited contract killer, played with  
appropriate serenity by Forest Whitaker. He lives with a flock of 
birds on the roof of an abandoned building and communicates with 
his Mafia employers by carrier pigeon. He lives by a strict, 
ancient code -- the Way of the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmusch weaves real passages of an ancient samurai text into  
the film, which has a wistful undertone: Both worlds, it says, are 
ill-equipped for modern times. ``We're like two ancient tribes,'' 
Ghost Dog tells his Mafia boss at one point, ``both almost 
extinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the strength of the film is that it is wickedly funny,  
especially in its portrayal of the aging mobsters -- men who can't 
get up the stairs on their way to a rubout without huffing and 
puffing. In one standout scene, the mobsters joke about the 
ridiculous names of rap singers and Indian chiefs. Then we learn 
their own names: Sammy the Snake, Handsome Frank and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmusch, who's won two awards at Cannes, says he built these  
characters from his experience living in New York's Little Italy, 
where he witnessed the death of the old Mafia order. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he says, some of his actors come from that world.  
``They're gentlemen to me, but they've also killed people,'' he 
says.

<HEADLINE> Government Provides Free Web Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Web surfers will be able to use a fee-based  
search engine set up through the Commerce Department for free until 
the government decides whether charging for the system conflicts 
with federal policy on unrestricted access to public documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's National Technical Information Service, in a  
joint venture with Northern Light Technology Inc., launched the Web 
site at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours later, however, the NTIS released a statement  
saying the service was being put on hold because it might conflict 
with a Clinton administration policy that all government 
information be ``open and unrestricted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the NTIS again clarified the status of its Web site.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on hold, it's not canceled. It's up and it's  
running,'' said Renee Edwards, a spokeswoman for the agency. 
``They've simply asked the Northern Light company to make this 
service available for free -- not to charge fees just for a short 
period of time while the government reviews its information 
dissemination policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Stearns, a Northern Light spokeswoman, said the company  
expects to provide ``an introductory offer of free access to the 
service through the first of June'' to let people evaluate the 
system and its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The search engine, which can be found at www.usgovsearch.com,  
provides users access to thousands of government and military Web 
sites and documents already available for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Users would have been charged $15 for one-day access, $30 for  
monthly access and $250 for yearly access. Fee revenues would be 
divided between Northern Light and NTIS. 
</P>
<P>
	While some questioned charging for documents already available  
for free, Edwards said they miss the point and noted that the 
proposed fees were only to cover the cost of using the search 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can go to the library and read a free copy of the Wall  
Street Journal but you might not want to do that every day,'' she 
noted. ``You might want to pay for the convenience of having it 
delivered to your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NTIS does not receive any federal appropriation, but is financed  
solely from fees charged to recover costs for the products and 
services provides. The agency also is legally allowed to enter into 
joint ventures with private business to make government information 
not otherwise available accessible to the public.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China's economy should grow by 8.2  
percent in the first half of 1999, surpassing official targets 
because of heavy spending on roads and bridges, according to a 
government forecast published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	China says its economy grew by 7.8 percent last year, and had  
set a target of 7 percent for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports are falling, but spending on roads, bridges and other  
projects is expected to expand by 21 percent, said the report by 
the State Information Center, a government research body. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase is substantially above the 14.1 percent rise in  
infrastructure spending last year, according to the figures 
published in the China Securities Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady decline in consumer prices that has threatened to stall  
the economy should ease in the first half of 1999, with prices 
falling by 2.8 percent, the report said. Prices in the first four 
months of the year were down 3.1 percent from the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price decline, caused in part by overcapacity in many  
industries, threatens to wipe out profits and bankrupt some 
companies. Chinese authorities have imposed minimum prices for some 
goods to prevent ruinous price wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers also are spending less and saving more because of  
fears of economic slowdown and rising unemployment, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of money put in savings accounts grew by 19.2 percent  
in the first four months of the year, it said.

	The report called for lower interest rates to discourage  
savings, and looser credit to encourage consumer spending.

<HEADLINE> Student-Built Satellite in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Boston University-built satellite launched  
this week on a $12.3 million ionosphere research mission was 
apparently orbiting powerlessly today after failing to fully point 
its solar panels toward the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terriers satellite ``seems to have run out of battery  
power,'' the university said. The batteries were good for eight 
hours without being recharged by the solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard from the spacecraft since yesterday, which  
leads us to believe the batteries are probably depleted,'' said Dan 
Cotton, a senior researcher at the university's Center for Space 
Physics who is principal investigator for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton said he was hopeful the solar panels will slowly charge  
the batteries and that eventually Terriers will turn itself on. The 
orbit and spin were believed to be correct. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was developed under a NASA program to increase  
students' access to space. More than 60 students and faculty 
members worked on the mission since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers, carrying instruments to produce 3-D images of the  
ionosphere, cost $6.1 million. Its share of launch costs amounted 
to $6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers and a separate defense communications satellite named  
Mublcom were launched late Monday on an Orbital Sciences Corp. 
Pegasus rocket dropped from a modified L-1011 jet flying off the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	All seemed well when the 274-pound Terriers made its first pass  
over the Boston University ground station at 7:07 a.m. EDT Tuesday. 
On the second pass about 1 1/2 hours later controllers noticed it was 
not properly oriented and tried to reorient it with commands on the 
next pass. Terriers passed over silently 10 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Lugo, NASA launch manager at Kennedy Space Center in  
Florida, said the Pegasus flight appeared normal but the data was 
being reviewed ``to be sure that the launch did not contribute to 
the spacecraft's current problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pegasus winged rocket is a workhorse for Dulles, Va.-based  
Orbital Sciences Corp., which termed the launch itself a success. 
The launch was the 27th of a Pegasus. There have been only three 
failures, the last in 1996. There have been 13 launches since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pegasus is carried by the L-1011 to altitudes around 40,000  
feet. The rocket then drops for a few seconds before its first 
stage ignites. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers was the latest small NASA satellite to run into  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the $73 million Wide-Field Infrared Explorer satellite  
spun out of control on its second orbit. The fatal spin involved 
the unexpected venting of frozen hydrogen intended to cool the 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the $64.8 million Lewis satellite was lost within days  
of launch on what was supposed to be a five-year mission of 
hyperspectral imaging of Earth. It also began spinning, apparently 
due to excessive firing of an attitude-control thruster. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem also comes amid wider problems in the nation's space  
capability. In less than nine months six launch failures have 
wrecked missions involving three military satellites, two 
commercial communication satellites and a private Earth-imaging 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Terriers was worked on for three years in a clean room at the  
university's College of Arts and Sciences, and a ground station was 
established there so students could control the craft as it 
gathered data on the ionosphere, the region of electrically charged 
gases in the upper atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists want to study how changes in the ionosphere affect  
global communications. The ionosphere is affected by solar 
activity, which can cause disruptions in communications on Earth.

<HEADLINE>  Two U.S. Directors Liven Up Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- After a sluggish start to the Cannes Film  
Festival, American directors Tim Robbins and Jim Jarmusch have 
spiced up the proceedings with two highly praised works that play 
up their particular -- and very different -- skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither man is a stranger to Cannes. Robbins won as an actor in  
1992 for Robert Altman's ``The Player,'' and also presented his own 
film, ``Bob Roberts,'' here. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's back directing an ambitious, ``mostly true'' period  
drama about Depression-era New York and a theater world threatened 
by anti-communist censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cradle Will Rock'' climaxes with the true story of the evening  
in 1936 when a theater troupe tried to open a polemical musical by 
Marxist playwright Marc Blitzstein. Earlier that day, amid 
congressional hearings into communist activity, authorities had 
shut the theater down. 
</P>
<P>
	The troupe marched through Manhattan with the public in tow, and  
the actors, forbidden by their unions from performing, bravely 
stood up from the audience, one by one, to play their roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins' film is a mostly successful rendering of a time many  
young moviegoers know little about, featuring a star-studded cast: 
Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave, John Turturro, John and Joan 
Cusack, Bill Murray, Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen and Hank Azaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the characters are real, some more successfully rendered  
than others. MacFadyen looks like the young Orson Welles but falls 
short of an authentic portrayal, and Sarandon does not quite 
convince as an Italian mistress of Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
	Turturro, though, shines as an actor in Welles' company, John  
Cusack is funny as young Nelson Rockefeller, and Murray is terrific 
as an anti-communist ventriloquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the film got a big ovation from the international  
audience at its premiere, the French press was decidedly lukewarm, 
calling it ``without finesse'' and heavy-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	They surely won't be saying that about Jarmusch's film, ``Ghost  
Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' a brilliantly clever take on the 
dying world of the Mafia and the ancient world of the samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghost Dog is a tranquil-spirited contract killer, played with  
appropriate serenity by Forest Whitaker. He lives with a flock of 
birds on the roof of an abandoned building and communicates with 
his Mafia employers by carrier pigeon. He lives by a strict, 
ancient code -- the Way of the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmusch weaves real passages of an ancient samurai text into  
the film, which has a wistful undertone: Both worlds, it says, are 
ill-equipped for modern times. ``We're like two ancient tribes,'' 
Ghost Dog tells his Mafia boss at one point, ``both almost 
extinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the strength of the film is that it is wickedly funny,  
especially in its portrayal of the aging mobsters -- men who can't 
get up the stairs on their way to a rubout without huffing and 
puffing. In one standout scene, the mobsters joke about the 
ridiculous names of rap singers and Indian chiefs. Then we learn 
their own names: Sammy the Snake, Handsome Frank and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarmusch, who's won two awards at Cannes, says he built these  
characters from his experience living in New York's Little Italy, 
where he witnessed the death of the old Mafia order. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he says, some of his actors come from that world.  
``They're gentlemen to me, but they've also killed people,'' he 
says.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen in early  
trading Thursday following its advance Wednesday on Wall Street. 
Japanese stocks rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 124.40 yen in early trading, up 0.70 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
124.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 76.79 points,  
or 0.48 percent, to 16,204.97 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Wednesday, the index shed 250.44 points, or 1.53 percent. The 
Nikkei has lost 819.19 points over the past five full trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened following the  
release of the Bank of Japan's monthly report, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the report, the central bank reaffirmed that although the  
economy appears to have stopped deteriorating, no signs of recovery 
can be seen. The report also noted that the yen has weakened 
recently on interest rate moves in the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 132.66 yen, up from  
131.60 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices advanced as investors picked up  
shares in technology companies and a number of other exporters 
following the dollar's steep gains against the yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong dollar is good for shares in exporters because it makes  
their products cheaper overseas and increases the value of their 
repatriated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the rise in New York stocks also boosted sentiment  
in Tokyo. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 50.44 points to 
close at 10,887.39 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among early gainers in Tokyo were blue-chips Sony Corp, Fujitsu  
Ltd., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 4.10 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,304.71. The 
TOPIX fell 23.54 points, or 1.78 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.370 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.325 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.15 yen from 101.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> Australian Indicted in Spying Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Australian intelligence official,  
arrested in an FBI sting operation, was indicted Tuesday on charges 
of attempted espionage against the United States, the Justice 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in suburban Alexandria, Va., returned the  
one-count indictment against Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, 28, an 
Australian citizen whose last known address was in Australia. He 
faces a maximum penalty of life in prison, or even death if certain 
conditions, like disclosure of nuclear secrets, are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere, an Australian military intelligence official from  
July 1998 until his abrupt resignation Jan. 13, was charged with 
selling secret and top secret U.S. defense documents to undercover 
FBI agents during the last two months. The documents had been 
shared with Australia under U.S.-Australian defense treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also contained a criminal forfeiture count that  
would require Wispelaere, if convicted, to turn over to the U.S. 
government $120,000 he was paid by undercover FBI agents for nearly 
1,000 classified U.S. defense documents and satellite photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere was arrested Saturday at Dulles International Airport  
outside Washington as he flew in from London for what he believed 
was another meeting with spies from a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wispelaere's request, the court appointed attorneys Nina  
Ginsberg and Greg Beckwith to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a detention hearing Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge  
Theresa Buchanan and an arraignment June 1 before U.S. District 
Judge Claude Hilton, both in Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>
	At a secretly videotaped rendezvous in a Bangkok hotel in April,  
Wispelaere told FBI agents, who he thought were spies for a foreign 
country, that he was in ``very dire, dire financial need'' for a 
knee operation and for some problems involving women, according to 
an FBI affidavit filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
	His father said Tuesday that if his son sold U.S. government  
secrets he acted purely out of greed. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with an Australian television station, Claude  
Wispelaere said that if his son sold secrets, ``It's not because 
he's in need of money; it's because of greed. The more money you 
have, the more you want. He was well-paid in his job,'' the father 
told Channel 7 TV in Melbourne.

<HEADLINE> Recession Hurt Top Japan Automakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's five leading automakers saw their domestic  
auto production fall in April compared to a year earlier, sapped by 
sluggish demand because of the country's persistent recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the hardest hit was Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which said  
today its production had tumbled 20 percent to 60,527 vehicles. 
Nissan Motor Co.'s output also plummeted, falling 19.1 percent to 
86,580. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's No. 1 automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., fared better,  
seeing its production fall 5.8 percent to 234,612 vehicles. Honda 
Motor Co.'s output fell 7.5 percent to 88,478. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor Corp.'s output tumbled 14.4 percent to 53,635. It  
was the first drop in Mitsubishi's output in four months and the 
first drop in Mazda's in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the automakers also suffered from nose-diving exports.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's exports, for example, tumbled 14.8 percent to 42,737,  
while overseas production also fell 12.4 percent to 75,949. 
Mitsubishi's performance was even worse, with exports dropping 49.3 
percent to 19,447. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the few bright spots in the month's results came from  
Toyota, where exports gained 2.9 percent to 135,692 vehicles and 
overseas production soared 15.6 percent to 142,260. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas production for Mitsubishi also skyrocketed 44.2 percent  
to 62,943 vehicles.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Conn. Store Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- A liquor store exploded Wednesday night,  
killing one person, injuring 11 others and knocking out power to 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were trapped in the rubble of the collapsed two-story  
building. One was brought out alive four hours later. The second 
person was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people were injured, including a 5-year-old boy, said  
Kristine Mascoli, a hospital spokeswoman. Victims included people 
who were inside the downtown area store and others standing 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	One person underwent surgery for multiple injuries. The  
conditions of the other victims were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast blew out the front of the building, which houses  
Venancio's Wine &AMP; Liquor store on the first floor and apartments 
above it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went outside to look at it and the flames were 45 feet  
high,'' said Mark Regner, who owns a nearby used car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities said the explosion knocked out power to 1175  
customers in the area. The blast interrupted commuter train service 
between Danbury and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	It delayed about 500 people and six trains, said Dan Brucker, a  
Metro-North spokesman. Service was restored just before 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were investigating reports that a gas leak sparked  
the explosion, but could not yet confirm a cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Danbury is about 60 miles northeast of New York.

	Milosevic OKs 'Principles' of Peace  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic today accepted the ``principles'' of a Kosovo peace plan. 
But Milosevic insisted in talks with a Russian envoy that the 
details must be negotiated directly with the United Nations. That 
would appear to fall short of Western conditions for halting the 
bombing campaign -- unequivocal acceptance of the international 
plan. Soon after the envoy flew out of the Yugoslav capital 
tonight, NATO warplanes launched their strongest attack in two 
weeks against the Belgrade area.

	Clinton Defends Kosovo Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that NATO  
airstrikes were ``the best available way'' to retaliate against 
Serb massacres of ethnic Albanians. The State Department produced 
videotape and surveillance photographs it said verified the 
massacres. The State Department also reported at least 500 Serb 
soldiers had deserted in Kosovo, and said it was a sign that 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was ``feeling the heat'' of 
the air campaign.

	GOP Offers Gun Control Concessions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans offered fresh concessions  
on gun control tonight. A draft amendment circulated by the GOP 
calls for background checks on all purchasers at gun shows, 
including transactions exempted in a proposal that Republicans 
muscled through the Senate last week. The proposal would also 
establish a requirement for a mandatory background check for anyone 
seeking to reclaim their own weapon at a pawnshop. Clinton 
administration and Democrats said the proposal didn't go far enough 
to plug gaps that allow some criminals to obtain weapons.

	Quayle Speech Draws Fresh Criticism  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Seven years after his ``Murphy Brown''  
speech, GOP presidential hopeful Dan Quayle touched off a fresh 
round of criticism today with an anniversary address scolding legal 
and media ``elites.'' ``Unfortunately, this aristocracy has bit by 
bit undermined parental authority, weakened school discipline, and 
obstructed moral education,'' he said. The American Bar Association 
accused Quayle of ``scapegoating.'' Quayle also said the news and 
entertainment media were also to blame for a decline in moral 
values by conveying ``counterculture values.''

	First Lady May Form Sen. Committee  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's close friends and  
advisers expect her to form an exploratory campaign committee next 
month, taking a dramatic step closer to running for the Senate in 
New York. Two longtime associates, both speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said this week the first lady has suggested to them she 
will form the committee, which would allow her to raise and spend 
money while determining whether to seek the seat of retiring 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

	Starved Baby's Mom Convicted  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A young mother who blamed breast-feeding  
problems for the death of her emaciated baby son was convicted 
today of criminally negligent homicide. Tabitha Walrond, 21, faces 
up to four years in prison. She was acquitted of the more serious 
charge of manslaughter. Prosecutors said Walrond starved 
2-month-old Tyler in 1997 to spite his father, who left her shortly 
after she got pregnant. The defense said she was a doting mother 
who didn't realize that her surgically reduced breasts were failing 
to nourish her child.

	Study: Antibiotic Resistance Growing  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jet-setting Americans who eat chicken and meat  
overseas are bringing back resistance to certain antibiotics used 
to treat stomach upset and other bacterial illnesses, according to 
a study. The study is the first to link Americans' growing 
resistance to antibiotics primarily to foreign travel. Until now, 
scientists believed resistance was growing largely because doctors 
were overprescribing antibiotics.

	Pacers Take Second Game From 76ers  
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The 76ers staged another strong final-minute  
rally tonight, but all they finished with was another close loss, 
85-82 to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals. 
The 76ers now trail 2-0 headed to Philadelphia for Games 3 and 4. 
Allen Iverson suffered through a 7-for-28 shooting night for 
Philadelphia and finished with 25 points. Indiana's Rik Smits 
finally found his offense for the Pacers, scoring 25 points.

	Russian Envoy Makes No Breakthrough  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the latest effort to end the  
Kosovo crisis, Russia's special envoy made no apparent breakthrough 
in nearly eight hours of talks today with Yugoslavia's president. 
Even as the two men met in Belgrade, air raid sirens sounded over 
the capital. Diplomacy was in high gear elsewhere, with U.S., 
Finnish and Russian negotiators flying in and out of several 
European capitals and a G-8 meeting being held in Germany to try to 
resolve the nearly 2-month-old Kosovo conflict.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vigorously defending his Kosovo policy,  
President Clinton said today NATO airstrikes were ``the best 
available way'' to retaliate against Serb massacres of ethnic 
Albanians. The State Department produced videotape and surveillance 
photographs it said verified the massacres. The alternative to the 
NATO campaign, Clinton said, would have been ``sitting on my hands, 
letting those people be butchered.'' The State Department exhibited 
videotape taken with a home camera by an Albanian villager 
purporting to show that Serbs had intercepted a group of elderly 
men at Izbica in mid-April and massacred them.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Symptoms of eating disorders have increased  
fivefold among teen-age girls on Fiji since television came to the 
Pacific island nation, a study found. The year TV was widely 
introduced in Fiji in 1995, only 3 percent of girls reported they 
vomited to control their weight, according to the study by Harvard 
researcher Anne Becker. Three years later, 15 percent reported the 
behavior. Fiji has only one TV channel, which shows mostly 
American, Australian and British programs. Favorites include 
``Melrose Place,'' ``ER'' and ``Xena: Warrior Princess.''

	Internet Project Nixed in NASA Bill

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans today prevailed during debate on a  
$42 billion NASA funding bill in stripping an Internet 
earth-viewing project initiated by Vice President Al Gore. 
Democrats said the elimination of $32 million to continue Gore's 
Triana satellite project was an attempt to embarrass the party's 
2000 presidential front-runner. Gore last year initiated the idea 
of putting a satellite in orbit that would provide 24-hour views of

companies decided not to fight the Force -- they sent their 
employees to ``The Phantom Menace,'' which was on schedule to

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Tests Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety officials say tests show  
inflating air bags in some DaimlerChrysler minivans could seriously 
injure or kill short female passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials strongly disputed that the 11 tests  
performed on dummies representing short women indicated they could 
be seriously injured by the passenger-side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Company engineers said the air bags in the tests were catching  
between the dummy's head and neck in a cavity real people do not 
have, causing false high readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
said Tuesday they experimented with four types of dummy necks, 
working to fill the space between the head and neck with protective 
wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the air bags appeared to catch in the crack between the  
head and neck of dummies in some tests, six of the 11 tests 
indicated the air bags were generally exerting strong force on a 
variety of dummy neck types, government officials said. The forces 
registered on the neck during the six tests indicated a high 
probability of serious injury or death, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocacy groups urged the safety agency to force  
DaimlerChrysler to recall the more than 2 million minivans the 
company has built since 1994 and replace the air bags with less 
forceful ones. Most of those minivans were built before Chrysler 
Corp.'s acquisition last year by Germany's Daimler-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA officials have not started the formal investigative  
process required of the minivans, or any other vehicle, before they 
would request any recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president in charge of  
safety, said company engineers believe the air bags were getting 
caught between the dummy's head and neck in all six of the tests 
where the neck injury levels were high. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anybody to make a link between these tests and what's  
happening in the real world is totally ludicrous,'' Cischke said.

<HEADLINE> Florida Manager Returns Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Marlins manager John Boles, who underwent emergency  
back surgery Monday, shocked everyone when he walked into the 
ballpark 90 minutes before Florida's game against the Chicago Cubs 
on Wednesday night and announced he was fit to manage. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles' doctors, who repaired a herniated disc and removed a bone  
that had broken off in a two-hour operation, told him he should 
refrain from any physical activity for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	General Manager Dave Dombrowski had hoped Boles would be back by  
Thursday at the very earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidently, that didn't deter Boles from checking himself out of  
the Wednesday afternoon -- a day earlier than expected -- to take 
back the reins from interim manager Fredi Gonzalez, who was 0-2 in 
his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles received a warm ovation as he brought out the lineup card.  
His next appearance came after starting pitcher Jesus Sanchez 
allowed his second homer and fourth run in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles joined pitching coach Rich Dubee on the mound because  
Sanchez had injured his right hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Snyder Closer To Buying Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Daniel Snyder cleared a big hurdle Wednesday  
in his bid to own the Washington Redskins, all but ending a dispute 
involving one of the league's most prominent teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's finance committee voted unanimously to recommend that  
the team be sold to Snyder for a record $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation by the eight-member committee, meeting in New  
York and chaired by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, is 
crucial. The full ownership votes on the sale at a league meeting 
in Atlanta on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record price for a professional sports franchise  
was $530 million, paid by Al Lerner last year for the expansion 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale is approved, it would then take up to a week to  
close the deal and make Snyder, the 34-year-old head of Snyder 
Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md., the youngest majority owner 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of the 31 owners must approve the sale, but none has  
expressed the kind of reservations or opposition that last month 
derailed New York banker Howard Milstein's attempt to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, who had Snyder as a junior partner, withdrew his $800  
million offer after the finance committee split 3-3-1 on the bid 
and it became apparent he did not have 24 supporters among the full 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Milstein sued Redskins president John Kent Cooke and  
general manager Charley Casserly, claiming they conspired to form a 
bloc of owners to oppose his bid. The suit does not seek to stop 
the sale of the team to Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance committee discussed the sale for 2 1/2 hours Wednesday,  
with Snyder and partner Fred Drasner present for about 45 minutes 
to answer questions and address the group. Snyder left without 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's bid was more appealing to the committee because it  
contains more than $350 million in unborrowed cash, compared with 
$50 million for Milstein's bid. Snyder and members of his family 
are putting up more than $200 million, and minority partners 
Drasner and Mort Zuckerman are supplying about $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is being sold by the trustees for the estate of Jack  
Kent Cooke, who died in 1997 and ordered in his will that his 
assets be sold to fund a charitable foundation.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Need Backup Stadium Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals, who campaigned for a  
new stadium without bothering to formulate a backup plan, examined 
alternatives Wednesday in the aftermath of voter rejection of their 
dream arena. 
</P>
<P>
	One option that has been the subject of speculation is to leave  
Arizona, the state owner Bill Bidwill adopted in 1988 after giving 
up on getting a new stadium in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have emphasized their commitment to staying put,  
but Houston businessman Bob McNair saw an opportunity in the vote 
and offered to talk to Bidwill about relocating the Cardinals in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other possibilities include another try at getting a stadium  
with a broader funding base or with NFL seed money, or renovating 
Sun Devil Stadium, the aging college facility where the Cardinals 
have played since their arrival in the Phoenix area. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa voters turned out in unexpected numbers Tuesday to reject a  
$1.8 billion convention center and sports complex by a 3-to-2 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a blow to Bidwill, who did not return phone calls to his  
office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even McNair, who has an exclusive agreement with the Harris  
County Sports Authority in Houston to build a $310 million stadium 
to replace the Astrodome, took note of Bidwill's anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``They worked very hard, and it was very important for them.''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston lost the Oilers to Tennessee in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	After the NFL chose Los Angeles over Houston as an expansion  
site two months ago, McNair wrote to eight owners, including 
Bidwill, to see if they were interested in selling. Bidwill, whose 
family has owned the team since 1932, wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	But McNair said in an interview with Houston station KRIV-TV  
that he wanted to reopen the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's some way we could participate with them, either  
buying it or being partners with them and moving it to Houston, 
yes, we would have a definite interest in that,'' McNair said. 
``But it's important to us that we have Houstonians owning the 
Houston team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona House Speaker Jeff Groscost, who steered a package of  
bills through the Legislature to allow stadium districts to 
recapture half the sales taxes generated by new arenas, 
acknowledged the danger of the team moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be poor business sense for the Bidwills not to talk  
to him,'' Groscost said. ``To their credit, they have not tried in 
any sense to leverage or extort the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groscost believes there is time for one more effort to revive  
the idea in Phoenix's eastern suburbs before the law expires after 
the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the convention-center plan with a 67,000-seat arena as  
its centerpiece might have been too grandiose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters told us that our eyes were bigger than our  
stomachs,'' Groscost said. ``We need to rethink what amenities are 
necessary, and if any portion is superfluous or more icing on the 
cake than necessary, we need to reassess that and come back with a 
project that's lean and mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters should focus less on sales taxes and more on other  
fundraising ideas such as user fees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Super Bowl was played in Sun Devil Stadium, but the NFL  
said that would be the last for the area unless the Cardinals build 
a stadium. The league has not offered to help pay for an Arizona 
stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the voters have spoken on this particular proposal, and  
we respect their decision, the issues of fan comfort and a 
competitive stadium remain very real ones for the Arizona 
Cardinals,'' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Domestic Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over Democratic objections, a House committee  
approved a Republican-written plan today to cut billions of dollars 
from education, housing and other domestic programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the House Appropriations Committee vote approving the  
blueprint was a party-line 31-23, even some Republicans predicted 
that the proposed cuts were so deep that Congress would never 
approve some of them -- let alone get President Clinton to agree to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're headed for another debacle,'' said Rep. John  
Edward Porter, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted a replay of last fall's negotiations with Clinton  
in which the president got Congress to provide billions more in 
spending than it originally wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter chairs the Appropriations education, labor and health  
subcommittee, which under the plan would get $78.1 billion in 
fiscal 2000 -- $10.7 billion less than this year, the deepest of the 
proposed reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned GOP cuts honor spending limits imposed by Congress'  
1997 budget-balancing deal with Clinton, which did not envision the 
annual federal surpluses that have emerged. Most leaders of both 
parties have said they intend to honor those limits, even though 
many lawmakers say privately they believe they will eventually be 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Young,  
R-Fla., acknowledged that the planned cuts are ``a tough pill to 
swallow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His plans seem designed to assure passage of roughly half the 13  
annual spending bills Congress must approve. The rest -- which are 
larger and more controversial -- would have to be resolved later. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., called the proposed cuts ``ludicrous''  
and ``untenable'' and said they would cause budget gridlock in 
Congress until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Sen.  
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, also predicted that Congress will reject 
several spending bills and probably face an autumn budget showdown 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we get the bills passed? No, we can't get the bills  
passed'' without more money, Stevens told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Congress was nearing approval of $15 billion for the  
conflict over Kosovo, victims of deadly storms in Central America 
and at home, and cash-strapped U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was planning to debate the measure as early as today,  
a day after the House easily approved it by 269-158. Conservatives, 
including Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, were considering using a rule 
that would force proponents to garner votes from 60 of the 100 
senators, but passage seemed likely and Clinton's signature was all 
but certain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo spending measure passed the House with support from  
majorities of both parties. It came after House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., spoke early in support of the bill, in contrast to 
his silence last month when the House failed to endorse the 
campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to fight for special interests,'' Hastert  
told his colleagues, referring to complaints about some provisions. 
``It's a time for Congress to promote the national interest. And 
this bill serves, in my opinion, the national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill will be paid for out of this year's expected  
$111 billion federal surplus, which will come from Social Security. 
Because the GOP has pledged repeatedly to leave the pension 
program's surpluses alone, some conservatives soured on the 
package, citing projects they said should have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money for reindeer?'' said Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, referring  
to one provision. ``I mean, is Santa in trouble?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of the measure blamed the Senate -- and Stevens, who  
inserted the reindeer measure and several others that would help 
his state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate wanted to throw in everything but the kitchen sink,  
and I suppose if the kitchen sink had come from Alaska, it would be 
in there,'' said Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ``no'' votes came from foes of U.S. involvement in the  
Balkans and lawmakers upset with provisions helping mining and 
other Western interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the package -- $12 billion -- covers U.S. costs of NATO's  
bombardment of Yugoslavia, aid to refugees and to Balkan countries 
sheltering them, and extra money for weapons, training and other 
Pentagon accounts. Clinton wanted half that amount, but many 
Republicans said the extra money was needed to rebuild armed 
services the president has allowed to wither. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the wide-ranging measure had something for almost every  
lawmaker to dislike, it had broad appeal, partly because few 
legislators want to oppose money for troops during wartime. 
Underlining that, Congress added $1.8 billion to improve military 
pay and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains $1 billion for a recent spate of  
hard-hitting natural disasters, chiefly last autumn's Hurricane 
Mitch. An additional $900 million would replenish the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency's budget so it can pay for damage from 
this month's horrific tornadoes in Oklahoma and other natural 
disasters.

<HEADLINE> Woman Seeks To Outlaw Infidelity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman fed up with unfaithful spouses wants  
to make infidelity a crime in California, which has a no-fault 
divorce policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Adulterers in California could be forced to make a public  
apology and pay for therapy if voters approve the ballot proposal 
from Laura Onate-Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-married 52-year-old woman wrote the initiative because  
of the suffering she believes infidelity has caused people -- 
including herself. She hasn't told her husband about it, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have plans to tell him. But how am I going to tell him?  
He'll say, `You're crazy,''' Mrs. Onate-Palacios said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been married to her current husband for six years.  
</P>
<P>
	The presidential sex scandal had ``just a little bit'' to do  
with the proposal, said the mother of two. Infidelity has been an 
issue for her in the past, but she wouldn't elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Love Returns From Injury at Colonial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Now that Davis Love III has moved up to  
No. 2 in the world rankings, he makes a pretty good case why he 
should be ahead of David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last month I haven't missed a shot,'' Love said. ``So  
maybe I ought to be No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he was kidding Wednesday on the eve of the Colonial.  
But the reason he hasn't missed a shot is no joke -- Love hasn't 
been able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Back problems that first started creeping up on him in 1995,  
caused him to change his schedule in 1997 and to pull out of 
tournaments in 1998 seem to be getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Love withdrew from the MCI Classic the week after the Masters  
and didn't touch a club for three weeks. And when he picked them up 
last week to play 14 holes, he was in pain again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be OK,'' he said. ``I've played two days in a  
row, and I think I'm going to have to gradually work my way into 
it. Golf swing-wise, I feel fine. It's just that I get a little 
stiff if I play and walk too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for Love is that his back troubles came when he  
already had about 10 years under his belt on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this had happened earlier, it would have been harder,'' he  
said. ``But at this point in my career, I can manage my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has managed quite well.  
</P>
<P>
	Love is one of three players this year who has earned more than  
$1 million without winning. One reason is because he has been in 
contention just about every week. Love leads the tour with eight 
finishes in the top 10, and has had four close calls. 
</P>
<P>
	He was second in Hawaii in the Sony Open, second behind Ernie  
Els in Los Angeles, missed the playoff in Bay Hill by one stroke 
and then finished second in the Masters despite pulling off the 
most remarkable shot of the year -- a birdie on the par-3 16th by 
playing his chip 25 feet left of the hole and letting it come back 
down the slope. 
</P>
<P>
	If Duval had an amazing run through the Masters by winning  
twice, Love wasn't far behind. While being in contention every week 
was mentally exhausting to Duval -- one reason he isn't at Colonial 
Country Club this week -- it took a physical toll on Love. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to pace myself better and not play five  
weeks in a row,'' Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	Love decided against defending his title at the Chunichi Crowns  
in Japan, withdrew from the Compaq Classic in New Orleans and 
thought better about playing the Byron Nelson Classic, too. 
</P>
<P>
	If this were not the Mastercard Colonial, he might have taken  
this week off, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Love had to skip Colonial a year ago when his back bothered him,  
and he didn't want to miss it two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, it's easy to walk. Even though it plays to a  
par-70 at 7,010 yards, the greens are close to the next tees. On 
the TPC at Sugarloaf, where Love tied for seventh in the BellSouth 
Classic, it takes about eight miles to get from the first tee to 
the 18th green. 
</P>
<P>
	And Colonial is loaded with tradition, from the nickname of  
``Hogan's Alley'' to the Wall of Champions next to the first tee 
that includes some of the biggest names in golf -- Ben Hogan and Sam 
Snead, Jack Nicklaus and defending champion Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Colonial also is the oldest PGA Tour event that has been played  
on the same course, dating to Hogan's first victory in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a traditional golf course, a tournament with history and  
a great old club,'' Love said. ``It would be great to win this 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that's possible depends on his back.  
</P>
<P>
	Love laughed when asked if he were 100 percent, saying his back  
was closer to 75 percent. He is swinging a little easier, says he 
won't even think about trying to bomb any drives over the corner of 
some of the longest holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, he made seven birdies during his pro-am round on  
Wednesday, ``so it's probably good for me not to swing so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger concern is what lies ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	Love didn't exactly spring out of his chair when his 30-minute  
interview ended. And he wasn't about to go to the range to hit 
balls for another hour. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to skip next week, then play the next three tournaments  
including the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, when I get to the Open I'll be able to pound balls  
for a couple of hours,'' he said. ``I've been lucky in that my 
swing hasn't been too far off. As long as it feels good, I'll be 
OK. I think I'm dialed in right now.''

<HEADLINE>  Secretariat Named 35th Best Athlete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eddie Maple recalls being nervous that dark,  
cold, wet October day in 1973. He was about to ride Secretariat in 
the last start of Big Red's career. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I wasn't any more nervous than anybody else would have  
been in that situation,'' Maple, now retired, said Wednesday at a 
screening of ESPN's 35th greatest North American athlete of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tape, however, Maple recalls thinking before the Canadian  
International at Woodbine, ``If he doesn't win, they just might tar 
and feather me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-minute profile of the 1973 Triple Crown winner will be  
shown at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretariat was one of 11 Triple Crown winners, a horse that  
transcended his sport. Charismatic can join the Triple Crown elite 
by winning the Belmont Stakes on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody, however, feels a racehorse should be among the  
century's 50 greatest athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been getting mixed reactions on this,'' executive  
producer Mark Shapiro said. ``Things like, `Come on, how can you 
have a four-legged animal above Mickey Mantle, above Walter 
Payton?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes were selected by a 48-member panel, and some  
panelists said, ``You can't put an animal in there. You can't 
equate apples with oranges,'' Shapiro said. ``Others said, `Such a 
professional.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said voting was based on athletic ability alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines athlete as ``one who  
is trained or skilled in exercises, sports or games, requiring 
physical strength, agility or stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretariat's record was not spotless (16 wins in 21 starts),  
but he was exciting and at his best a perfect blend of speed, power 
and stamina. No horse ever has put together three races to compare 
with his Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might have taken to the air and flown,'' Heywood Hale  
Broun, a television commentator, says in the profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody else could run like him ... still can't,'' Maple said  
Wednesday. Maple rode Secretariat in that farewell race because 
regular jockey Ron Turcotte was under suspension for a riding 
infraction in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	That one ride made Maple part of the Secretariat legend.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't win the Belmont (which he did twice) without  
somebody mentioning in the newspaper that I was the last one to 
ride Secretariat,'' Maple said. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the top 34 ESPN selections have not been released.  
But those in the second 50 have been, and they include two horses -- 
Man o'War (No. 84) and Citation (No. 97).

<HEADLINE> Drug Cuts Sneezing, Wheezing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- There may be a cure for the common cold,  
researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	An experimental cold remedy called tremacamra cut sneezing,  
runny noses and congestion nearly in half. But whether the drug 
will work on the many viruses known to cause colds has yet to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	All 177 volunteers who participated in the study were given the  
same cold bug -- type 39 rhinovirus, said researchers led by Dr. 
Ronald Turner of the Medical University of South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhinoviruses commonly cause colds, but at least 100 subtypes of  
rhinoviruses exist; many colds are caused by other viruses such as 
cornaviruses and flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Tremacamra works by blocking rhinoviruses from attaching to one  
particular molecule on the outside of cells that the virus needs 
for a biological anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug was inhaled daily as a nasal spray or nasal powder for  
several days at about the time the people were infected. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not associated with the study, which was funded by  
tremacamra manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, said 
it should encourage further research. 
</P>
<P>
	But real-world effectiveness and long-term safety need to be  
established, said the expert, Dr. Kenneth McIntosh of Children's 
Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Buys Airline Catering Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The parent company of Swissair,  
SAirGroup, announced Wednesday it is purchasing the airline 
catering unit of U.S.-based Viad Corp. for $780 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SAirGroup said that Viad Corp.'s Dobbs group, headquartered in  
Memphis, would be combined with its own catering unit, Gate 
Gourmet, creating the world's largest airline caterer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gate Gourmet currently is second largest in the world, and Dobbs  
is third, SAirGroup said in a statement. Dobbs also is the largest 
train caterer in the United States, it said. It had sales of $891 
million last year and employs 11,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition marked a ``one-time chance'' for SAirGroup to  
expand its airport-related businesses, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined catering companies are expected to have annual  
sales of more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion), the Swiss 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The synergies offered by combining the two groups ... should  
generate significant cost savings over the next five years,'' said 
SAirGroup chief executive Philippe Bruggisser.

<HEADLINE>  Astronomers Spot Storm on Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cyclone four times the size of Texas raged  
across the northern polar region of the planet Mars last month, 
according to space telescope views of the red planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Space Telescope Science Institute announced today that the  
Hubble Space Telescope on April 27 spotted an immense Martian storm 
cloud, made up of water ice, that was 1,100 miles long and 900 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Bands of clouds spiraled in a counterclockwise motion around a  
200-mile wide eye in the center of the storm, taking on a shape 
that resembled hurricanes on Earth, astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm occurred during the summer in Mars' northern  
hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming evaporated the carbon 
dioxide ice sheet that caps the Martian north pole during part of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm  
spotted 20 years ago by the Viking Orbiter spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers used a wide field planetary camera on Hubble to  
photograph Mars during the planet's closest approach to Earth in 
nearly eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the  
storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm 
appeared to be in the process of breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
	Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm,  
and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Gold at 10-Year Low on Sales Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures touched 20-year lows Wednesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid fears countries around the world will 
continue to sell their holdings in search of better-returning 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures jumped a third session in a  
row, while grain and soybeans continued lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold remains a victim of Britain's recent decision to sell,  
beginning in July, more than half its reserves, a move that has 
lead to fears other central banks will hurriedly sell their gold as 
prices collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Government treasuries have become more reluctant to hold gold as  
a monetary reserve because of its storage expense and because bonds 
now have a far better return on investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ignored statements by the Bank of France's Governor  
Jean-Claude Trichet, who said his country, Italy, Germany and the 
U.S. Federal Reserve had no plans to sell reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund is considering selling some of  
its reserves to help fund debt relief for poor countries. Outgoing 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, after trading had ended, 
asked the Senate Appropriations Committee to approve the Clinton 
administration's request to allow the IMF to make the sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures also became victim to a rising U.S. dollar. Most  
commodities are priced in dollars, so a strong U.S. currency makes 
it more expensive for foreign jewelers and other physical users of 
gold to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for June delivery finished down 70 cents to $273.50 an  
ounce after falling earlier in the session to a 20-year low of 
$272.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures continued to gain on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York as Brazil, the world's largest grower, braces for 
cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters say temperatures will fall much below normal in  
major growing regions, although they are unlikely to produce a 
freeze. Sustained freezing temperatures could damage coffee trees, 
particularly younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculators are betting Brazil cannot have a third  
consecutive year of mild temperatures that have led to bumper 
harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee rose 6.10 cents to $1.23 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of  
Trade on favorable harvesting and planting weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures were pressured by mild, dry weather in  
Midwest growing regions, which should speed farmer fieldwork for 
what is expected to be bumper acreage. With the effects still being 
felt of recessions in Asia, Latin America and other countries, the 
prospect for another large harvest has sent prices reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also fell after China purchased 40,000 metric tons of  
soybeans from South American competitors to U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by reports farmers were seeing  
above-average yields during harvesting of the winter wheat crop, 
which accounts for much of total wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel; July corn fell 1 1/2  
cents to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 4 cents to $4.71 1/2 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Genes May Predict Leukemia Relapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Scientists are studying genetic fingerprinting to  
try to predict in advance which leukemia patients who go into 
remission eventually will relapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The work so far is experimental, but preliminary results are  
promising, said Dr. Jerald Radich of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center in Seattle, who explained the procedure at a 
biotechnology meeting here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea: ``If you (fight) the disease when there's less of it,  
the chance of nipping relapse in the bud is a lot higher,'' Radich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oncologists attempt to wipe out all leukemia cells with  
chemotherapy before declaring a patient in remission. But Radich 
said the method of determining remission is poor: They examine 
patients' bone marrow under a microscope, which can miss low levels 
of residual cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
	A DNA fingerprinting technique, known as polymerase chain  
reaction, or PCR, is much more sensitive at detecting hidden 
leukemia cells. PCR can detect 1 cancer cell out of about 100,000 
healthy ones. 
</P>
<P>
	A study from France last year used PCR to detect traces of  
cancer in 42 percent of 178 children in remission from acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. Within three years, 40 percent of those 
found to harbor residual cancer had relapsed, compared with just 8 
percent who had appeared cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	But a PCR test simply tells if any cells are present or not, and  
a positive test doesn't always mean relapse. So the question is how 
many renegade cells it takes to put someone at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Radich's lab has added a laser probe to PCR to try to measure  
that level and answer the question. It's a twist on how doctors 
treating virus-infected patients track how much virus is in their 
blood and adjust treatment accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	By tracking how brightly the laser light shines in reaction to  
certain enzymes during PCR, Radich attempts to plot a patient's 
starting level of residual cancer and then measure whether that 
level rises over time. He's testing the stored tissue samples of 
1,000 patients who either were cured or relapsed, to see how their 
initial residual cancer levels correlated with their outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The preliminary results are it works,'' said Radich. ``The  
idea is to look at these people and say, 'You're in good 
remission,''' or to suggest that people with increasing disease 
consider a bone marrow transplant before they actually relapse.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Aide Jailed for Elder Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A former nursing home aide has been  
sentenced to four to five years in prison for felony elder abuse 
charges, which included an allegation that she made an 83-year-old 
woman eat feces. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge Wednesday also gave Stacy Arruda, 26, of Derry, N.H., a  
two-year suspended sentence for patient abuse, as well as three 
years of probation, said Steve Bilafer, spokesman for the attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Arruda was found guilty of two counts of elder abuse  
and seven counts of patient abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses, mostly co-workers, testified Arruda assaulted five  
elderly residents, all over 80, while working at the Wilmington 
Woods Nursing Home. 
</P>
<P>
	There were seven incidents between October 1997 and February  
1998. In one incident, Arruda was seen kicking an 81-year-old 
resident, resulting in severe bruising. 
</P>
<P>
	A former co-worker, Hyacinth Bazile, testified she saw Arruda  
spit in the face of a 92-year-old woman because the patient, who 
was on a feeding tube, made a spitting noise. 
</P>
<P>
	She also pulled the hair of an 86-year-old patient to force her  
to sit up in bed, Bazile testified. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Arruda admitted to feeling frustrated when her  
patients attacked her, but said she was innocent of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	She was fired by Wilmington Woods in February 1998.

<HEADLINE> IAAF To Study Ben Johnson Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- World track's governing body set up a  
three-man panel Wednesday to study Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson's 
petition for his lifetime drug ban to be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation appointed a  
sub-commission to consider Johnson's application for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai, honorary treasurer Robert  
Stinson of Britain and Council member Helmut Digel of Germany were 
appointed to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian adjudicator ruled last month that the 37-year-old  
Johnson's application should be allowed to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal and 100-meter  
world record after testing positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul 
Games. After serving a two-year suspension, he was banned for life 
by the IAAF after a second positive test in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling of the adjudicator, Graeme Mew, was based on alleged  
procedural errors in the handling of Johnson's lifetime suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the panel will submit its  
recommendations on Johnson's case at the next council meeting, Aug. 
16-17 in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	On another issue, the IAAF removed council member Charles Mukora  
of Kenya from its three-man panel of technical delegates for the 
2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora has remained on the IAAF despite resigning as a member of  
the International Olympic Committee after being implicated in the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora was replaced on the technical panel by IAAF vice  
president Lamine Diack of Senegal. The other two delegates remained 
unchanged: China's Dapeng Lou and New Zealand's Arthur Eustace. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said Mukora was removed not because of his role in the  
Salt Lake scandal, but because of his links with alleged 
improprieties involving Sydney's Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora and the head of Uganda's national Olympic committee met  
with Australian Olympic chief John Coates the night before the 1993 
IOC vote on the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates pledged $35,000 in sports funding to each of the two  
countries, contingent on Sydney winning the bid. The next day, 
Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the funds earmarked for the Kenyan Olympic committee  
allegedly ended up in Mukora's personal trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was accused in his position as an IOC member of doing  
something wrong in relation to the Sydney bid for reasons of 
opportunity,'' Reineri said. ``For that reason, the IAAF felt it 
was not good to send him to Sydney as a technical delegate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said Mukora did not attend the Seville meeting, but has  
not resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us he is still a council member,'' Reineri said. ``He did  
nothing wrong in the IAAF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF announced a $66 million deal with Dentsu marketing  
company to sell television rights to IAAF events in Japan from 2000 
to 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF also confirmed Palermo, Sicily, as the venue for the  
World Half Marathon Championships next October and awarded the 2001 
World Race Walking Cup to Turin, Italy, and the 2003 event to 
Naumburg, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Columbine High Loses Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- For a moment, the scene appeared sadly  
familiar: Columbine High School students huddled together, crying 
and hugging fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
	But tears gave way to laughter at this occasion -- the Colorado  
girl's state soccer championship, a joyful contrast to the horror 
that tore the soul of Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Green Mountain Rams on Tuesday spoiled  
Columbine's bid to win its first girl's soccer crown, beating the 
Rebels 2-0. But the loss seemed almost incidental as thousands of 
fans found cause to cheer in the twilight of a lovely spring 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt so good to hear them sing `We are Columbine,''' said  
senior midfielder Meredith Russo. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand people filled the stands at the Englewood High  
School stadium to root for a team that dedicated its season to the 
12 classmates and teacher who were slain during the shooting attack 
a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fans was Patrick Ireland, a student who was shot in  
the attack April 20. Ireland gained nationwide attention after 
television cameras caught him escaping from the gunmen through a 
second-floor window. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people hugged Ireland during the half-time break, and  
he smiled and cheered along with his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and their families had rallied behind the team as they  
marched into the championship game. ``We are Columbine'' and ``Good 
Luck Rebels'' banners dotted the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	After the loss, the Rebels got a standing ovation from their  
fans -- and from the Green Mountain supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made me a little more sad because it is my last year  
here. I'm going to miss all these people and Columbine,'' said 
senior co-captain Angie Portincaso. Her advice to those she is 
leaving behind: ``Don't take anything for granted. You never know 
what can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Principal Frank DeAngelis, just returning to a normal high  
school event was a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still proud of the girls,'' he said. ``I'm hurting for  
them because they worked so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine coach Peter Horvath said he tried to keep the girls  
focused on the challenge of taking the state title, despite obvious 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have been more proud of them if we had won,'' he  
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Jordan hit a sixth-inning grand slam off a  
tiring Francisco Cordova to give the Atlanta Braves a 7-3 win over 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine (3-4) allowed three runs and five hits in seven  
innings for the Braves, who won their fourth in a row and swept the 
three-game series. The Pirates have lost six straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova (0-2), making his first start since going on the  
disabled list April 10 with inflammation of his right shoulder, 
limited the Braves to one hit -- a solo homer by Andruw Jones in the 
second -- through five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova got the first out in the sixth, but then Ozzie Guillen  
doubled and moved to third on a single by Bret Boone. After Chipper 
Jones walked, Jordan hit Cordova's first pitch over the fence in 
left-center for his 10th homer to make it 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Atlanta's first grand slam of the season and the third of  
Jordan's career, his last one coming on July 13, 1996 when he was 
with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up a single to Javy Lopez, Cordova was lifted. He  
allowed five runs, five hits and three walks in 5 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones added a two-run single for the Braves in the  
seventh off reliever Jeff Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh loaded the bases in the ninth off John Rocker, but  
Turner Ward struck out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates scored three runs in the fifth to take a 3-1 lead.  
Abraham Nunez, who broke out of a 1-for-17 slump with a pair of 
hits, and Cordova, a .108 career hitter, each had RBI singles. The 
other run scored on a RBI grounder by Freddy Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Atlanta's Otis Nixon, hitting only .181, did not start for  
the fourth consecutive game, replaced by Gerald Williams. He drew a 
walk as a pinch-hitter in the seventh, stole second and third, and 
scored on Chipper Jones' single. ... Glavine avoided his first 
career 0-4 start on April 28 against the Pirates when the Braves 
scored three runs in the ninth inning for a 5-4 victory. ... 
Atlanta is 19-0 when scoring five or more runs. ... Boone has hit 
in 20 of his last 21 games and reached base safely in 21 straight. 
... Pittsburgh OF Adrian Brown was sent down to Triple-A Nashville 
to make room on the roster for Cordova.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Former American Airlines chairman Robert Crandall

company. 
</P>
<P>
	Crandall, 63, retired last year as chief executive of AMR Corp.,

	Crandall's knowledge of American's computer reservations system  
is expected to be useful as Chancellor launches its system for 
tracking air time for radio commercials, Chancellor chairman Tom 
Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks said Chancellor wants Crandall's expertise as it develops  
strategies for the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Crandall's control, AMR developed its computer reservation

<HEADLINE> GOP Allows More Gun Control Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Churning through a juvenile-crime bill, Senate  
Democrats declared new victories when Republican leaders allowed 
votes on measures that would impose additional restrictions on gun 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans immediately attacked Sen. Frank Lautenberg's  
retooled gun-control amendment, which would close loopholes in 
firearms sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal very simply is to satisfy the American people,'' said  
Lautenberg, D-N.J. ``It's their belief that anybody who buys a gun 
ought not to be anonymous in that purchase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said the amendment opens the door  
for a new tax and does little to encourage more prosecutions. ``Is 
this just show?'' Sessions asked on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass killing at a Littleton, Colo., school loomed large over  
the proceedings as senators tried to deal with a host of 
gun-control amendments in a seventh day of debate on the crime 
measure Tuesday. At the end of the day, Senators voted 78-20, to 
require safety locks or secure containers to be sold with every 
handgun. The amendment also would provide liability protections for 
a gun owner who uses a safety lock and whose gun is stolen and used 
in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Littleton was the last straw. Democracy works,'' said Sen.  
Charles Schumer, the first-term Democrat from New York who had been 
the House's most vocal gun-control activist. ``The public mood has 
changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the vote, the new House speaker, Dennis Hastert,  
a foe of previous gun control legislation, entered the fray by 
suggesting in an interview that the minimum age for handgun 
purchases be raised from 18 to 21 for handguns and that background 
checks be required for all sales at gun shows -- a position the 
Senate first rejected and then approved in voting last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by the top Republican in the House, coupled with a  
recent series of votes in the GOP-controlled Senate, underscore how 
the political landscape has shifted in the month since two students 
at Columbine High School killed 12 students and a teacher before 
turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there needs to be uniformity in what they do at gun  
shows and what they do in a retail business,'' Hastert, R-Ill., 
said in an interview in his Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, he said, ``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard  
of adulthood, and there's probably a uniformity that fits there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans acknowledge that the April 20 shootings in Littleton  
have influenced the Senate debate, with some in the GOP lamenting 
that the issue reached the floor of the chamber while emotions 
still were running high. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably should have waited until we could have addressed  
this in a thoughtful matter as opposed to an emotional response to 
the Colorado tragedy,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he believes it is the right time for the bill to come to  
a vote, its sponsor, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, 
acknowledged Tuesday that he had misjudged the effect of the 
shootings on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought (the shootings) would get it passed a lot faster  
than it is,'' Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The wide-ranging, $5 billion bill, which would make it easier to  
prosecute violent juveniles and make it harder for kids to get 
guns, has been mired in partisan wrangling for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year bill includes $435 million a year for juvenile  
crime prevention; $450 million to help states and cities build 
detention centers and perform drug testing; $75 million for grants 
to states to upgrade juvenile felony criminal record-keeping and to 
make those records available nationwide; and $40 million for 
research into the effectiveness of juvenile delinquency prevention 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans last week reversed an amendment that would have made  
background checks at gun shows voluntary. Democrats, meanwhile, 
have been forced to pare down their list of dozens of amendments 
under a threat from Sen. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that 
he would pull the bill from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the shooting spree in Colorado and the 2000 elections,  
both parties want to avoid blame for the death of a bill designed 
to keep more guns out of children's' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill has been a public relations nightmare for  
Republicans, who have backed off previous opposition to tighter 
government control on guns, senior congressional aides acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert suggested tightening gun sale restrictions as part of  
what he described as an emerging bipartisan House response to 
Littleton. He said the specifics have yet to be vetted by House 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-area congressman voted against the Brady Law in  
1993, which instituted a three-day waiting period for handgun 
purchasers and established the system of instant background checks 
that supplanted it. He also voted against 1994 legislation to ban 
certain types of assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Hastert responded to a question about the age  
of possession for handguns, although an aide later said the speaker 
was referring to raising the age for purchases, not possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to reiterate my support for legislation that closes  
legal loopholes which allow people under the age of 21 to purchase 
handguns at gun shows,'' the Illinois Republican said in a written 
statement. ``I do not believe that people under the age of 21 
should be allowed to purchase handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for greater enforcement of existing laws, saying,  
``It does the country no good for the Congress to pass gun laws if 
the executive branch fails to enforce them.''

<HEADLINE> Nugent Retreats on Hunting Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Motor City madman isn't so mad anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Ted Nugent, who urged American hunters to boycott Ontario over  
the cancellation of the spring bear hunt, has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moratorium worked in that it helped get hunters right  
across Canada concerned about what governments are doing, and now 
I'm glad to support outdoor groups and lift the ban,'' the rocker 
told reporters on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent, an outspoken hunting and pro-gun crusader, was outraged  
when the Ontario government decided to ban the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent said he had called for a moratorium as a point of  
principle, wanting to stand up for Ontario hunters and anglers. 
</P>
<P>
	The province said the ban was needed because it was leaving bear  
cubs orphaned, but Nugent argued it had no scientific basis and was 
inspired by ``lunatic fringe'' animal rights groups.

<HEADLINE> Schools Want To Police Agents Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The list of NCAA rules and regulations  
fills more than 400 pages. The essence of one of the key bylaws is 
so simple, however, it could be written on the back of a football 
player's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't take money from agents.  
</P>
<P>
	Along with warnings about gambling, drugs and alcohol, the  
relatively straightforward agent rule is among those drilled into 
the minds of players from the day they arrive on campus until the 
day they leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's no prohibition against players talking to agents.  
And there seem to be dozens of ways to skirt the rules once the 
parties come in contact. 
</P>
<P>
	It means that anywhere there's a program with a few good  
athletes, almost surely there's a director for compliance trying to 
keep track of which agent, or which agent's runner, is contacting 
which player at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that's always been there, and it does not seem  
to go away,'' said Jamie McCloskey, associate athletic director for 
compliance at Florida. ``Each year, it seems to be growing. 
Unfortunately, it's not just an issue at Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is, however, the latest school to encounter problems,  
with a sworn complaint filed against one agent for allegedly paying 
players. Investigations are ongoing into activities of at least two 
other agents, including Tank Black, who is also targeted by the NFL 
Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is hardly alone. Alabama is just shaking off the effects  
of a probation stemming from an agent problem that cropped up six 
years ago. Since then, Florida State's football program has 
encountered problems. So has Connecticut's basketball team. 
Accusations are being investigated at LSU. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Frank Bauer, a former coach with a good reputation, says  
most agents are trustworthy, but the ones trying to break into the 
business are at a severe disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got people going out, starting firms representing  
athletes, who have no credentials and no clients,'' Bauer said. 
``So the question is, `How do you get that client?' When that 
starts up, sometimes they feel like they have to induce a client to 
go to their side. That's when you get a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only agent formally accused of wrongdoing at Florida was  
allegedly involved in something that no school could adequately 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sworn complaint filed by university police, agent Sean  
Alfortish was accused of funneling money to two football players 
through the players' roommate. Neither player was considered a 
major NFL prospect. The roommate likely never made it onto the 
school's radar until the alleged violation occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Enticements can range from beer money, to a couple hundred bucks  
to a thousands of dollars in advance on future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Like several other states, Florida has a relatively new law  
against unlicensed and illegal agent activity. In March, the NFLPA 
approved a bylaw that forced an agent to forfeit any fee he would 
receive if he is proven to have offered an illegal inducement to 
earn a player's business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an example of more attention being paid to the problem  
by people who want to clean this thing up,'' said Tom DePaso, staff 
counsel for the NFLPA. ``I don't know if the problem has grown 
worse in the last four or five years, but there's a lot more 
attention being paid to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Often, the agent never even has to show up on campus to make an  
impact. The inducement can be funneled through a runner, sometimes 
a student or friend of a player. 
</P>
<P>
	That simply increases the list of people schools try to monitor.  
Because it is such a vast group, some believe it will take more 
than a new law or two to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic issue is you have kids who are being exploited by  
the schools,'' said Black's attorney, Leonard Mungo. ``These 
players know what they're worth and they know the schools are 
taking advantage. Then you have 900 agents out there looking to 
sign 240 players who get drafted. Not every agent can afford to 
play by the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after Mungo was interviewed, the NFLPA filed a  
disciplinary complaint against Black. 
</P>
<P>
	The union alleged that Black provided improper cash payments in  
1997 and 1998 to college players before their eligibility was 
completed. The complaint also claimed Black acquired new autos in 
1998 for players before their college eligibility expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, in turn, plans to petition the U.S. Attorneys office to  
investigate the union's action. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey stands by as much more than an impartial observer. And  
he knows he's not the only one who is squirming as the list of 
accusations continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an issue at Florida and nowhere else, it would  
probably be a good thing for athletics as a whole,'' he said. ``But 
it's an issue that has potential to be a problem on many different 
campuses. And it's getting harder to control every day.''

	TWENTY YEARS LATER: Entrepreneur magazine, celebrating its 20th  
anniversary, notes through some interesting factoids just how much 
technology has affected business people's lives and made some of 
them very wealthy. The magazine reports that David Filo and Jerry 
Yang, founders of the Internet company Yahoo!, have a net worth of 
$3 billion each today. If both men had not dropped out of Stanford 
University's Ph.D. program, they might have gone on to earn a 
starting salary of $57,000 to $110,000 a year, Entrepreneur says. 
Another example: A two-bedroom house in Silicon Valley that sold 
for $75,000 in 1975 is going for $900,000 today. But high-tech 
isn't the only way to get rich -- in 1998, 12 years after she 
founded the American Girls catalog, Pleasant Rowland sold it to 
Mattel for $700 million.

	FINANCIAL OPTIMISM: Although Americans are generally optimistic  
about their financial future, more doubts seem to be creeping into 
their outlook, according to a survey of 1,000 people commissioned 
by Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co. The survey found that 92 
percent of respondents were upbeat about the future, up from 89 
percent in a survey a year ago. But 35 percent of the respondents 
said they're concerned that their household's primary wage earner 
could lose his or her job in the next three years, compared to 31 
percent with that concern last year. And fewer people said they're 
considering an extravagant purchase such as a car or boat in the 
next five years, perhaps because of uncertainty about the future. 
In the latest survey, 20 percent said they're planning a big 
splurge; that's down from 23 percent last year.

	AIR FARES: The gap between the air fare that most tourists pay  
and the fare that a typical business traveler pays continues to 
widen. American Express says that when it studied fares on 215 U.S. 
routes in March, it found that the average lowest discount fare, 
the kind usually paid by tourists was $133, while refundable 
tickets with three-day advance purchase requirements, those usually 
chosen by business travelers, averaged $476. The difference between 
the two fares came to $343, up from a $317 gap in March 1998. At 
that time discount fares averaged $130 and typical business fares 
averaged $447. American Express said the average cost of an airline 
ticket, which also reflects full-price, unrestricted fares, rose $8 
to $298 in March from $290 a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> ABC, WB Each Offering Six New Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The most dominant night in television for more  
than a decade has been Thursday and it has belonged to NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the network's rivals are sensing vulnerability.  
</P>
<P>
	Both ABC and the WB promised aggressive efforts to dethrone NBC  
as they released their fall schedules Tuesday, saying the secret to 
success may lie in going after younger viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS and Pax TV were to release their fall schedules today.  
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``ER'' are all at the top  
of the ratings, NBC's Thursday strength has faded somewhat this 
year -- especially among younger viewers, ABC entertainment 
president Jamie Tarses said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC will move last summer's popular replacement series, ``Whose  
Line Is it Anyway?'' to Thursday nights. It is also introducing a 
drama about a 25-year-old virgin and her friends from Kevin 
Williamson, the creative force behind ``Dawson's Creek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the WB is shifting its popular series, ``Charmed,''  
to Thursday nights in the fall. The WB will begin broadcasting on 
its sixth night -- Fridays -- in September and is adding a spinoff 
series from ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' among six new shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also has six new shows, its smallest lineup of newcomers in  
10 years, and is shifting ``Spin City'' to fill the Tuesday 
schedule hole created by the departure of ``Home Improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC made critical strides this season, but ratings continued to  
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has high hopes for ``Snoops,'' a drama about private  
investigators in Los Angeles starring Gina Gershon. It's the 
brainchild of David E. Kelley, creator of ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new show will air on Sundays, usually the most-watched night  
of television, just before another Kelley series, ``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of failure to develop shows on Saturday nights, ABC  
is turning that evening over to movies. The network is canceling 
the Olsen twins' show ``Two of a Kind'' and ``Brother's Keeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WB, the only network to see its ratings go up this year, is  
canceling ``Smart Guy,'' ``The Wayans Brothers'' and ``Rescue 77.'' 
The comedy ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' is to return in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of the network's half-hour situation comedies will be  
on Friday nights. The rest of the week the network's schedule will 
consist entirely of hour-long dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These shows aren't traditional fare,'' said Susanne Daniels,  
the WB entertainment president. ``They blur the lines between 
comedy and drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Boreanaz, who played Sarah Michelle Gellar's boyfriend in  
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' will have his own show, ``Angel.'' 
The freshman series, ``Felicity,'' will switch to Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new shows on the WB:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Jack &AMP; Jill,'' a romantic comedy about a toy inventor and  
fellow post-college friends living in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Safe Harbor,'' a family drama about a Florida sheriff and his  
four boys created by Brenda Hampton, the executive producer of the 
WB's most popular show, ``7th Heaven.'' It will follow ``7th 
Heaven'' on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Roswell,'' a science fiction drama about a teen-aged alien.  
</P>
<P>
	--''Popular,'' a drama focusing on two mismatched girls set in  
the fictional Jacqueline Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
	--''The Downtowners,'' an animated comedy about a 24-year-old man  
and his teen-age brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Snoops'' and ``Wasteland,'' the new ABC series will  
be: 
</P>
<P>
	--''Odd Man Out,'' a situation comedy about a 14-year-old boy  
living in a house with five women, by the co-writers of the movie 
``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Oh Grow Up,'' a situation comedy about three roommates.  
</P>
<P>
	--''Once and Again,'' a romantic drama about two divorced parents  
who meet for the first time but can't remember how to date. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Then Came You,'' a situation comedy about a 34-year-old  
divorcee falling in love with a man a decade younger.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Police Detonate Clarinet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- Police blew up a suspicious case at a  
middle school, later finding a clarinet inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The destruction of the case came about after police found a  
threatening note in a girls' bathroom at Hunt Middle School. 
Searching the school Tuesday, police said two bomb-sniffing dogs 
barked at a clarinet case in a music room. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age, with everything going on, if you're going  
to make an error, you err on the side of caution,'' School 
Superintendent Donna Jemilo said. 
</P>

	Police were investigating why the dogs apparently detected  
explosives in the case, Sgt. Scott Davidson said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Suit Filed in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police officers shouted racial epithets and  
celebrated with high-fives after fatally shooting a black woman who 
was unconscious in a car, her family's lawyers said in a federal 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights suit filed Tuesday by a legal team headed by  
celebrity attorney Johnnie Cochran named five officers and the city 
of Riverside as defendants and alleged ``racial animus'' as the 
motive for killing Tyisha Miller, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller was shot 12 times on Dec. 28 after she was found  
lying in her locked car with a gun in her lap. Police, who 
responded to a 911 call, say she suddenly reached for the weapon 
when an officer smashed the car's window and tried to grab the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxicology tests later showed Ms. Miller had a blood-alcohol  
level of .13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shooting of Tyisha Miller was unjustified,'' the lawsuit  
said. ``At no time did she present an imminent threat of harm to 
the defendant officers or to anyone else and she made no aggressive 
or provocative movement such that a reasonable officer under the 
circumstances would have believed that she was a threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city's lawyer had only a brief response.  
</P>
<P>
	``The city intends to defend the case vigorously and the outcome  
will be determined in the courts,'' said Skip Miller, an outside 
attorney representing Riverside and the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the police have denied the charges. An investigation  
by the Riverside district attorney concluded that police were 
justified in using deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit said at least 24 rounds were fired at Ms. Miller, and  
at least one officer emptied a magazine, reloaded and fired again. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Cochran claimed, the officers were rejoicing,  
``high-fiving each other in joy and glee.'' He said he based his 
allegations on information from a witness whom he declined to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and state attorney general are conducting separate  
investigations into possible civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for, among other claims,  
wrongful death, assault and battery, intentional infliction of 
emotional distress and violation of civil rights.

	Milosevic OKs Parts of Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic accepted elements of a Kosovo peace plan today, but 
insisted in talks with a Russian envoy that the details must be 
negotiated directly with the United Nations. That would appear to 
fall short of Western conditions for halting the eight-week bombing 
campaign -- unequivocal acceptance of the international plan. Soon 
after the envoy flew out of the Yugoslav capital late tonight, NATO 
warplanes launched their strongest attack in two weeks against the 
Belgrade area. Local media and witnesses said a hospital near a 
Belgrade military barracks was hit, killing at least three people.

	House Panel Seeks To Limit Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Armed Services Committee voted today  
to impose new spending restrictions on President Clinton's conduct 
of the military operation in Yugoslavia. Democrats denounced the 
action. The panel, working on a $288.8 billion defense spending 
bill, endorsed a provision stating that none of the funds ``may be 
used for the conduct of combat or peacekeeping operations'' in 
Yugoslavia. ``That's a heck of a message to send to that 
23-year-old climbing into the cockpit of an F-16 tonight,'' said 
Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss.

	GOP Offers Gun Control Concessions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans offered fresh concessions  
on gun control tonight, but Democrats swiftly said they didn't go 
far enough to plug gaps that allow some criminals to obtain 
weapons. A draft amendment circulated by the GOP calls for 
background checks on all purchasers at gun shows, including 
transactions exempted in a proposal that Republicans muscled 
through the Senate last week. The concessions marked the latest in 
a series of retreats by the GOP in the wake of last month's 
shooting spree at a Colorado high school and a renewed push by 
Democrats for more restrictions on firearms.

	Quayle Takes On Media, Legal 'Elites'

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Seven years after his ``Murphy Brown''  
speech, GOP presidential hopeful Dan Quayle touched off a fresh 
round of criticism today with an address scolding legal and media 
``elites.'' ``Unfortunately, this aristocracy has bit by bit 
undermined parental authority, weakened school discipline, and 
obstructed moral education,'' he said. Quayle and his wife, 
Marilyn, are lawyers. He criticized ``aristocrats'' who live in 
gated communities; he has a home in such a community, in the 
Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley.

	Starved Baby's Mom Convicted

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A young mother who blamed breast-feeding  
problems for the death of her emaciated baby son was convicted 
today of criminally negligent homicide. Tabitha Walrond, 21, faces 
up to four years in prison. She was acquitted of the more serious 
charge of manslaughter. Prosecutors said Walrond starved 
2-month-old Tyler in 1997 to spite his father, who left her shortly 
after she got pregnant. The defense said she was a doting mother 
who didn't realize that her surgically reduced breasts were failing 
to nourish her child.

	Arbitrator Rules Against Disney  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. breached its contract  
with former film boss Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1994 and owes him a 
potentially huge interest payment on top of his sizable bonus, an 
arbitrator ruled today. The case now moves to another phase in 
which a retired judge determines exactly how much money Disney 
should pay Katzenberg, who has contended he's due at least $250 
million in an incentive bonus. If Katzenberg's final bonus ends up 
being close to what he wants, the compounded interest could be 
worth tens of millions of dollars.

an enzyme that is believed to trigger cell death. The finding is a 
promising lead for drug researchers working to extend the lives of 
Huntington's sufferers. In the new study, scientists blocked a 
particular enzyme in mice that had been genetically engineered to 
contract the disease. These mice developed Huntington's symptoms 
about 10 percent later in life and lived about 20 percent longer.

<HEADLINE> Luyendyk, Schmidt Ready to Qualify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Having top-line equipment, an experienced  
team and enough time to prepare are new luxuries for Sam Schmidt, 
Arie Luyendyk's heir with Treadway Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, whose background was in sports cars, joined Treadway  
this season as a replacement for Luyendyk, a two-time Indianapolis 
500 winner who is retiring after the May 30 race, his only start 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, meanwhile, is enjoying every minute as second fiddle  
during Luyendyk's last ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're there, we know what the car is capable of and I think we  
have a pretty good idea of what we need to do to get the car ready 
to qualify,'' Schmidt said Tuesday. ``Now we're running with a full 
load, trying different fuel settings, stuff that most teams don't 
have time to get to, and I never had time to get to in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt and Luyendyk, driving G Force-Auroras, have been among  
the most consistent and fastest drivers since practice began last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifications to determine the 33-car lineup are set for  
Saturday and Sunday. The Treadway team is ready now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to qualify tomorrow, actually,'' Luyendyk  
said. ``Sam has been running really strong. ... At this moment, 
we're looking pretty good with time. If we don't have any 
mechanical problems, we're really OK on schedule. The team is well 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, the only driver to win at least one race in each of  
the first three seasons the Indy Racing League has been in 
operation, is preparing for his 15th start at Indianapolis. He 
already holds track records for speed in practice, qualifications 
and the race -- all set before the IRL adopted a new engine-chassis 
package that produced slower speeds -- and he's Indy's career money 
leader with more than $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt was the third-fastest rookie qualifier at Indianapolis  
with Blueprint Racing in 1997. He finished 34th in an expanded 
field of 35 starters after an engine problem on the pace lap. Last 
year, he started sixth, but wound up 26th after a multi-car crash 
on the 48th lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even before this year, Arie was one of the guys that was  
approachable. Arie was very helpful,'' Schmidt said. ``You ask him 
a question, you get a straight answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in a lot of team situations, and this one is as good  
or better than any other one, because it's like an open book. There 
are no secrets,'' he said. ``All the information we have is totally 
accessible (to Luyendyk's crew), as what they're doing with their 
car is open to us. So that really helps. You can accomplish a lot 
of things every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest drivers in practice, all with top laps under ideal  
weather conditions on Saturday, are Greg Ray at 225.887 mph, 
Luyendyk at 225.163, Scott Goodyear at 224.405 and Schmidt at 
224.394. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, when practice was delayed by rain, Goodyear was the  
quickest at 223.842, followed by Stephan Gregoire at 223.647, Kenny 
Brack at 223.447 and Ray at 223.214. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk did not practice on Tuesday. Schmidt, already preparing  
his race setup, drove 44 laps, with a top speed of 217.538. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us would be happy to qualify tomorrow,'' Schmidt said.  
``There was a lot of speculation that after the speeds on Saturday, 
gee, are we going to see 230? I think that's out of the question 
with this car package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pole position speed last year was a four-lap 223.503 mph  
average by Billy Boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going 224, 225, that's kind of all there is,'' Schmidt said of  
the likely pole speed this year. ``Really, the more days of 
practice is allowing people that are maybe 20th or 30th to come up 
in speed a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> No Progress in WTO Leader Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Efforts to appoint a new leader for the World  
Trade Organization are going nowhere fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after Italy's Renato Ruggiero stepped down as  
director-general of the trade body, the nations are no closer to 
selecting a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	And some fear that the 134 member nations are so deadlocked over  
two candidates that they will have to start anew to find someone, 
possibly delaying a decision for months, even into the fall when 
key trade talks are scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the worst possible solution,'' said Turkish trade  
ambassador Omer Ersun. ``It will make a mockery of our work of the 
last six months if a latecomer pops out at the last moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the director-general is in part a figurehead, the WTO  
chief also plays an important behind-the-scenes role in setting the 
trade agenda and seeking to solve some tough disputes. Ruggiero 
intervened in a nasty fight between the United States and European 
Union over trade in bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two candidates for the top job are former New Zealand  
Premier Mike Moore and Thai Deputy Premier Supachai Panitchpakdi, 
both of whom are considered highly qualified. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there are no formal proposals for a third candidate to  
break the deadlock, although names floating around the WTO's 
lakeside headquarters include former Uruguayan trade minister 
Enrique Iglesias, who heads the Inter-American Development Bank in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the stalemate, a planned meeting Wednesday of the  
WTO's decision-making council was scrapped. Council chairman Ali 
Mchumo of Tanzania set no new date. 
</P>
<P>
	After intense negotiations, Mchumo last month proposed that  
Moore get the job because he had the edge over Supachai. The 
suggestion was welcomed by the United States and most Latin 
American and some European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian nations, though, protested, saying Supachai had for months  
been the front-runner. They blocked Moore's appointment and 
demanded that Mchumo try to rally the nations around Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Mchumo has failed to narrow the gap. The WTO  
operates on the principle of consensus, and any move to decide the 
issue by a vote would meet heavy opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions by New Zealand for a power-sharing deal, with Moore  
as the chief and Supachai in the No. 2 spot have been rejected by 
Bangkok. Moore has let it be known he's not interested in being 
anyone's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side in the dispute has spelled out publicly its  
objections to the other candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai has fallen afoul of the United States -- at least  
according to Thai newspapers -- for making perceived anti-American 
comments at the height of Thailand's economic crisis last year.

fearing that the former trade unionist might give labor and 
environmental protection a higher priority in trade negotiations 
due to be launched at a November summit in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Pimlico Runner Doesn't Remember </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The lawyer for the man who ran onto the track  
at Pimlico on Preakness day said his client doesn't remember doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Chang Ferrell also doesn't remember confronting thundering  
thoroughbreds or taking a swing at a jockey, according to attorney 
Frederic Heyman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing he remembers is being in the holding cell at  
Pimlico,'' Heyman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyman refused to say if his 22-year-old client was drunk before  
he jumped onto the track near the final turn, as police said. He 
did say Ferrell has been diagnosed with psychological problems, 
including manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred three races before the Preakness on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell, who works at an aquarium store, was staying with his  
parents his father posted $2,500 bail to get him out of the Central 
Booking and Intake Center on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces assault and other charges.

<HEADLINE> Study: Antibiotic Resistance Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jet-setting Americans who eat chicken and meat overseas are  
bringing back resistance to certain antibiotics used to treat 
stomach upset and other bacterial illnesses, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, is the first to link Americans' growing resistance to 
antibiotics primarily to foreign travel. Until now, scientists 
believed resistance was growing largely because doctors were 
overprescribing antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance to the class of antibiotics called quinolones has  
been reported in people in Europe and Asia because of the 
widespread use of antibiotics in poultry and other livestock there, 
but the problem had not been well-documented in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also attributed the problem in part to the growing use  
of antibiotics in chickens in the United States. The Food and Drug 
Administration approved the practice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is definitely a public health problem with using  
quinolones in poultry, and we need to take a hard look at that,'' 
said the study's lead author, Kirk E. Smith, an epidemiologist with 
the Minnesota Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the study should prompt the FDA to adopt more  
stringent guidelines for the use of antibiotics in food animals in 
this country. But he said solving the problem ``is going to take a 
very well-coordinated international effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Washington-based Animal Health Institute,  
which represents producers of health products used in food animals, 
said antibiotics are used sparingly on domestic livestock -- at most 
3 percent of poultry -- and only when prescribed by a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, he said, it's possible people are being exposed to  
antibiotics through other means besides chicken while overseas, 
like water, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know is the relative level of risk from  
contaminated water, animal use, too many prescriptions. We need to 
have some connection,'' said spokesman John Keeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how researchers believe the problem goes from animals to  
humans: 
</P>
<P>
	Chickens and other livestock are given antibiotics in feed and  
drinking water to ward off infections and spur growth. A 
corkscrew-shaped type of bacteria that normally lives in the 
intestines of the animal becomes resistant to the antibiotics over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after animals go to meat-processing plants, some meat can  
remain contaminated with the resistant bacteria. Humans swallow the 
bacteria if the meat is undercooked or contaminates other foods 
during meal preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria bring on gastroenteritis -- that is, diarrhea,  
stomach cramps, fever and malaise. Doctors try to treat the illness 
with antibiotics, but the bacteria have already built up 
resistance, so it's tougher to get rid of. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest research examined 4,953 cases of bacterial infection  
among Minnesota residents between 1992 and 1998. The scientists 
found that the proportion of cases resistant to antibiotic 
treatment increased from 1.3 percent in 1992 to 10.2 percent in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients answered a standardized survey that included questions  
about antibiotic use, foods eaten, contact with animals and their 
travels. The scientists attributed 75 percent of the cases to 
foreign travel, especially to Mexico and especially in winter. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Henrik C. Wegener of the Danish  
Zoonosis Center said physicians and veterinarians should be careful 
not to overprescribe antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasing foreign travel and the internationalization of the  
food trade make the use of antibiotics in food production a public 
health issue of global dimensions,'' Wegener said.

<HEADLINE> Rehab Clinic To Pay $7.7M for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- A drug rehabilitation clinic agreed to  
pay $7.7 million to settle allegations it sent patients to the 
beach or the movies, then billed the government for group therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against National Recovery Institutes Group was  
triggered when therapist Joelee Caplan complained in a lawsuit that 
she was fired in 1996 for complaining to her supervisors about 
fraudulent billing. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon investigation into Caplan's allegations found records  
indicating National Recovery repeatedly double-billed the 
government or billed it for therapy when patients were sent to the 
beach or a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The government claimed the company bilked $1.6 million from  
Medicaid and more than $700,000 from the military insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, investigators found National Recovery charged $125  
for adult living skills therapy when the patient was playing water 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic closed in March 1998, and the company filed for  
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was reached Tuesday. Caplan will receive about  
$28,000 for blowing the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	National Recovery was one of about a dozen companies operated by  
health care mogul Sheldon Russakoff, whose companies face $50 
million in lawsuits from creditors, according to his lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Tom Selleck Battles Jedi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Selleck doesn't look worried.  
</P>
<P>
	Here he's about to face off against a cabal of intergalactic  
warriors and this macho man of actors would rather daydream about 
kicking back on his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed inconsequential to him that his latest movie, the  
romantic comedy ``The Love Letter,'' was opening on the same 
weekend as the hyper-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	The business side of show business bores the 54-year-old  
Selleck, who is so philosophical about his profession, he sounds 
more like Don Quixote than Thomas Magnum, the playboy private eye 
he portrayed for eight years on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to act, but I'm not fond of the business of acting,''  
he said in his trademark growl. ``Actors have this sense that there 
is a noble quest to their profession, that you're looking for some 
truth or beauty to what you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the hardest part is keeping the inevitable anxieties  
about ``how much will my movie gross?'' from tainting a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise you develop a cynicism about what you're doing,'' he  
said. ``You have to connect with the audience, and there are no 
excuses with them. They don't care if you haven't worked in a week, 
or if you're unhappy. ... That's not in the credits at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck has played affable rogues such as one-third of the  
freewheeling team of bachelors in ``Three Men and a Baby'' and the 
headstrong gay journalist in ``In and Out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his character in ``The Love Letter'' -- a lovelorn fireman  
named George Mathias -- is no charismatic leading man. He even lacks 
that famous push-broom mustache. 
</P>
<P>
	So what was the best part about playing the workaday Joe who  
falls for a woman who finds an anonymous love note? The antique 
fire engine George uses to take women out on dates, Selleck 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd spend a lot of time waiting for the next scene, and I had  
the chance to play around inside this thing,'' the 6-foot-4-inch 
actor said, grinning beneath his dark beard and leaning forward as 
if revealing a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	After discovering the fire engine's loudspeaker, he amused  
himself by making gag announcements to anyone within earshot -- 
which was practically the entire New England town where the film 
was shot. His favorite was demanding that everyone evacuate their 
homes and buildings for an impromptu game of volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``The Love Letter'' having a tiny opening in the formidable  
shadow of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' Selleck 
and others associated with the film were counting on attracting 
older audiences not interested in being Force-fed a space opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said he has no specific plans for what he'll do next,  
except for the offhand shrug followed by, ``I think I'd like to do 
a Western.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's eager for a hit with ``The Love Letter,'' which also stars  
Kate Capshaw. But he said previous success has given him the 
comfortable position of working for enjoyment rather than survival. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early days of ``Magnum P.I.,'' a Screen Actors Guild  
strike left him without a paycheck and he had to work odd jobs to 
pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to stop myself now and say, I need to do what my  
obligations are as a father, no matter how much I want these other 
parts, whatever they may be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Selleck has taken time off to spend with his family  
and tend to his Southern California ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have the financial resources to take time away from  
work and you don't, isn't that a little more indicting than if you 
literally have to work to put food on the table?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck also dips into political and social issues when taking  
time off, and there was a time earlier in the decade when 
supporters were pushing him to run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has championed conservative causes, including public  
support for the National Rifle Association, he declined comment on 
renewed calls for greater gun control in the aftermath of the 
school shootings in Littleton, Colo. He was simply tired of talking 
about it.

<HEADLINE> Oprah To Teach Business Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Actress. Talk show host. Bookseller  
extraordinaire. Empire builder. Now meet Professor Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Oprah Winfrey and longtime beau, Stedman Graham, will teach a  
course titled ``Dynamics of Leadership'' this fall at Northwestern 
University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has always been a dream of mine to teach,'' the 45-year-old  
Ms. Winfrey, who attended Tennessee State University but didn't 
earn her bachelor's degree until 1987, said in a statement 
Wednesday. ``We share the same beliefs in the importance of dynamic 
leadership in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham and Ms. Winfrey are drawing up a reading list and tests  
for the course and will take on about 100 second-year business 
students for three hours once a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Winfrey plans to preach the power of control over one's  
destiny, said Rich Honack, assistant dean at the business school. 
</P>
<P>
	``She certainly has been in control of her own destiny,'' he  
said. ``The feedback we're already getting from MBA students has 
been phenomenal because she is truly admired, especially by the 
women and minority students who see her as someone who has made 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a recent survey of investment attitudes by Ariel  
Mutual Funds and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Ms. Winfrey is the most 
likely person from whom black investors would take advice when 
asked to choose among five celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey received 39 percent vs. 14 percent for Colin Powell, 9  
percent for Michael Jordan, 8 percent for President Clinton and 6 
percent for Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
	White investors preferred Powell over Winfrey, 22 percent to 19  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham has taught a business course on sports marketing at the  
school for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Winfrey and Graham decided to team up for a course after a  
friend proposed the idea to the business school's dean. The school 
is working with the talk show host on security. The classroom 
itself will be accessible only to students enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Winfrey earned about $125 million, making her the  
country's fourth-highest-paid entertainer, according to Forbes 
magazine. Which raises the question: What do you pay her? 
</P>
<P>
	``She gets the standard rate for an adjunct professor,'' said  
Honack, refusing to be more specific. ``Any of us who teach, we get 
the same.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Backs NY Transportation Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress on Wednesday to  
approve $60 million for converting a New York post office into a 
massive transportation hub reminiscent of the city's grand but 
demolished Penn Station. 
</P>
<P>
	The president took part in a ceremony launching the  
redevelopment of the 1.4 million-square-foot James A. Farley Post 
Office into a new Pennsylvania Station terminal with access to 
Amtrak's high-speed train, commuter and subway rails, as well as 
airports, buses and taxis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful public spaces really help us build a community,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility sits above platforms for the existing Penn Station,  
which is one of the nation's busiest passenger terminals, pouring a 
half-million people into the heart of New York each day. The 
current basement-level station replaced the original, which was 
razed in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater,  
Gov. George Pataki, former Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who had pushed for the project 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent was Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who complained about the  
project's cost and questioned its financing. ``When I see the 
money, you'll see me there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he would ask Congress to appropriate $60  
million over three years to pay for the renovation. He asked 
lawmakers to approve it without party partisanship ``as a tribute 
to Senator Moynihan and because it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton later went to small fund-raiser at the home of  
Democratic supporter Jack Rosen. The event, with about 30 to 40 
guests giving at least $10,000 each, was expected to raise $345,000 
for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said while the new Penn Station cannot fully replace the  
majesty of the old one, its design is close enough to ``take the 
best elements of the past and create a remarkable station for the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have, as you see, the same stunning effect for  
everyone,'' Clinton told about 200 people gathered in the post 
office's basement beside an architect's model of the new facility. 
``We can honor one of the first great buildings of the 20th century 
and create the first great public building of the 21st century. In 
so doing, New York can once again provide a model for the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the leaders said they hoped the station would herald a  
renewed commitment to cities, and the grand public spaces that 
define urban character. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we have lost the grandeur that set New York apart,  
set America apart,'' Pataki said. ``We have a chance to recapture 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just a building,'' Slater said. ``This is a  
historic place ... a gateway to this mighty city and this mighty 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said as a young man, he would go to train stations to  
watch the people come and go, wondering about their destinations 
and realizing that the station itself actually served to unite 
people from various walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
	He also put in a good word for first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who is pondering a bid to replace the retiring Moynihan in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted Mrs. Clinton's announcement of grants ``to  
help meet urgent preservation needs across our nation.'' Mrs. 
Clinton embarked Wednesday on a trip to the Southwest for her 
second Save America's Treasures tour.

<HEADLINE> Drunk-Driving Suit Drops Irish Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The lawsuit claimed Dollar Rent-A-Car  
should have known a driver in a fatal accident was prone to drink 
because he was from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	But after getting deluged with irate calls, the attorney who  
filed it said Wednesday it was all a mistake and he actually 
considers himself an advocate for the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to express my deepest regret to the Irish who have been  
offended,'' John Stemberger said Wednesday in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``I recognize the mistake. I'm deleting 
references to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit had been filed in March on behalf of the family of  
Carmel Elizabeth Cunningham, of Ireland. Her boyfriend, Sean 
McGrath, 33, is charged with drunk-driving manslaughter and other 
charges related to the accident in the Plymouth Neon he had rented 
from Dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Dollar ``either knew or should have known about the unique  
cultural and ethnic customs existing in Ireland which involve the 
regular consumption of alcohol at `Pubs' as a major component to 
Irish social life,'' according to the original lawsuit filed in 
Orange County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Dollar ``either knew or should have known that Sean  
McGrath would have a high propensity to drink alcohol,'' the suit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A warrant has been issued for his arrest. He was not named in  
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the suit drew the ire of the Irish-American community.  
</P>
<P>
	``That enrages me,'' said Kathleen Reineke, past president of  
the local Irish American Club. ``That would be like saying all 
blacks steal. It falls under the same category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stemberger said he planned to refile the lawsuit with emphasis  
on the different driving conditions in Ireland, such as driving on 
the left side of the road instead of the right. He claimed he 
planned to amend the lawsuit even before the barrage of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dollar doesn't do nearly enough to teach drivers from  
Ireland and the United Kingdom about the road rules in the United 
States, including the blood-alcohol limits, open-container laws and 
the drinking age. 
</P>
<P>
	That sets up the Irish, among others, for a dangerous visit, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going after Dollar because they need to do something about  
it,'' Stemberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Irish-Americans to know because of Dollar's negligence,  
Ireland has lost one of its daughters,'' he said. ``I view myself 
as an advocate trying to protect the Irish, in this case.''

<HEADLINE> Conservative GOPs Eye Third Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Conservative Republicans may move to start  
a third party because they believe too many Republicans are 
abandoning the conservative planks of the party's platform, GOP 
presidential candidate Bob Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a conservative senator from New Hampshire, says he does  
not advocate a split. But in interviews with The Washington Times 
and New Hampshire newspapers this week he said frustrated 
conservatives are seriously considering forming a third party 
centered on gun rights, national defense, school prayer, low taxes 
and opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe you may well have seen the beginnings of a  
third-party movement in this country, which will spell the end of 
the Republican Party,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it happens, I'm not leaving my party -- my party is leaving  
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he had not ruled out a presidential run on the new  
party's ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether he would actively try to organize  
another party if a conservative fails to win the GOP presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Collins said  
Smith had legitimate concerns, but the party is unified on core 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us believe in smaller government, the enormous  
potential for the individual, and that the individual should be 
empowered to the maximum extent possible consistent with an orderly 
and lawful society,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said conservatives were the foundation of the party and its  
most loyal supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duprey, chairman of the state party, said he was adamantly  
opposed to a third party formed by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that Republicans will rally and unite behind  
whomever is our nominee,'' Duprey said.

<HEADLINE> Killy Sees Salt Lake Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jean-Claude Killy, the Olympic skiing  
champion now on the International Olympic Committee, says he is 
increasingly confident about Salt Lake's ability to stage ``not the 
best possible games, but the best games ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killy is deputy chairman of the 18-member IOC Coordination  
Commission that is giving advice and surveying Salt Lake's plans 
for the 2002 Winter Games. The meetings began Monday and end 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time in my life that we are asked so many  
questions and listened to,'' Killy said Tuesday. ``My level of 
confidence in the outcome has gone from very high to extremely 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killy was a triple gold medalist at the 1968 Games in Grenoble  
and was president of the organizing committee for Albertville's 
Games in 1992. He also has served on the coordination commissions 
for Lillehammer in 1994 and Nagano in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy said he's been impressed with Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee president Mitt Romney. ``I found him a very smart 
individual and willing to learn from the past,'' Killy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, in turn, called Killy's presence ``very powerful. He has  
been where I am now and he continues to give good advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is saying, `Oh, in Albertville, we found we didn't need to  
do this, we didn't need to do that, we paid too much for some 
accommodations. You don't have to worry about that. You'll make 
more money on the coin program if you do this,' '' Romney added. 
``Lots of ideas -- it's been refreshing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top priority for the SLOC is slicing expenses from a budget  
threatened by lukewarm sponsor interest since even before the IOC 
bribery scandal. Romney has been saying for two months he has 
identified $84 million in frills to trim from the $1.45 billion 
budget. But on Tuesday he said the tally is now up to $98 million 
and growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy declined to specify which cuts the IOC suggested, except  
for one: volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake may reconsider whether it needs all 18,000 volunteers  
now planned. The volunteers are not paid, but it costs an 
organizing committee $3,000 to $5,000 to feed, outfit, transport 
and train each volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the kind of thing we want to tell Salt Lake City now  
and not two years from now,'' Killy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is willing to discuss changes in how it is treated by  
organizers, but Killy said that won't result in much savings. The 
IOC pays for its own rooms and transportation, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not in the millions of dollars,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Romney last week said he would ask the IOC to renegotiate its  
contract to cut SLOC's costs in the same way Sydney's costs for 
2000 are being trimmed; to defer royalty payments on merchandise, 
sponsorships and tickets; and to let SLOC go after technology 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Shelley Thomas said Tuesday that Romney has only  
made general statements and will not discuss his requests in detail 
until an IOC meeting next month in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the IOC communications director, said  
the committee should not expect much in the way of money from the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the sugar daddy who has all this money hidden under  
a tree in Lausanne,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Servan-Schreiber acknowledged the IOC is reconsidering the  
technology sponsor categories because of dramatic changes in 
technology over the past two years. In the past, IOC has sold all 
technology sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
	The complexities of a changing technology field caused the SLOC  
to hire a German company to provide software that delivers the 
judge's scores to broadcasters, scoreboards and a database, said 
Dave Busser, managing director of information technologies for the 
SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee ran out of time to line up a sponsor and had to  
get moving on the software, so it hired Wige Mic for on-venue 
result systems. The committee is still negotiating with potential 
sponsors that will either amplify on Wige Mic's work or pay for it. 
Busser declined to say how much Wige Mic will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed the suggestion sponsors shied away because of the  
scandal. ``None of them said no because of the scandal,'' Busser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the IOC's marketing director said despite the bribery  
case, public support for Olympic athletes remained high -- although 
it ``clearly has been a black eye for the IOC's image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing chief Michael Payne claimed worldwide surveys  
conducted for the IOC found that failure to adopt reforms in the 
wake of the scandal ``would cause certain erosion'' in other areas 
of the Olympic community. But the surveys of 10,000 people in 10 
countries in February and March showed 76 percent had a positive 
attitude toward the games and 85 percent a positive attitude toward 
Olympic athletes.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Kills Son To Win Back Ex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- A father has been charged with murder,  
accused of reporting his 3-year-old son missing in a bid to win 
back his girlfriend, then taping a garbage bag over the boy's head 
and leaving him to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Kramer Jr. was charged Wednesday with second-degree  
murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Kenneth 
Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, 26, admitted taking the boy the night of May 10 and  
abandoning him in the woods, Houston County Sheriff Mike Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	A note left in the child's bedroom said that if Kramer and his  
former girlfriend were married by a certain date, Kenny would be 
returned, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny's body was found Tuesday near his grandparents' home, the  
upper part of his body wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and his 
mouth taped with duct tape. Kramer said the boy was crying when he 
left him, but he ran to his car and drove away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's disappearance ``kind of started out with this idea  
that (Kramer) was going to try and bring about this marriage, and 
it just got out of hand,'' County Attorney James Fabian said. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 11, Kramer allegedly went to a movie theater where his  
girlfriend worked. Holding Kenny in his arms, he stood in front of 
the box-office glass, pointing at Kenny as if he wanted her to see 
his son, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who was not the boy's mother, told police she  
believed Kramer was ``playing mind games'' with her because she had 
been like a mother to the child for two years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Buys Out British Pub Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Texas Pacific Group, a privately owned U.S. buyout  
firm, has invested more than $800 million in one of Britain's 
biggest pub operators, a company official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment in Punch Taverns Group Ltd. gives the firm a  
majority stake in a network of 1,470 tenant-run pubs. The deal is 
Texas Pacific's first venture in the European food and drinks 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch Taverns earned an operating profit for the year ending  
Sept. 30 of 71 million British pounds ($115 million), on sales of 
146 million pounds ($235 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Additional details of the investment were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific, whose founders managed money for the Bass family  
of Texas, opened its London office a year ago. The company has $2.5 
billion to invest, managing director Stephen Peel said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of several American buyout firms that have opened shop  
in London to take advantage of the mounting number of corporate 
consolidations in Europe. Other U.S. players include Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts and Co.; Clayton, Dubilier and Rice Ltd., and Soros 
Private Equity Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific's previous deals in Europe include investments of  
$106 million in Guinness Peat Aviation PLC, an Ireland-based 
airline leasing company, and $30 million stake in Landis and Gyr 
Communications, a Swiss pay telephone manufacturer. It also did two 
deals with Britain's Virgin Group, investing in a train company and 
the MGM cinema chain.

<HEADLINE> McPherson Play Tells Three Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's hard enough clearly telling one story on  
stage but Irish playwright Conor McPherson sets himself up for 
triple duty with ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' now at tiny Primary 
Stages off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Three tales snake through the latest McPherson work to reach New  
York, following ``St. Nicholas,'' seen last season at the same 
theater, and ``The Weir,'' currently playing on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	But McPherson is a consummate storyteller, able to pack a lot in  
this short -- less than 90 minutes -- look at the lives of three men 
in a bleak resort town on the Irish coast. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, McPherson starts with a good central yarn, in  
this case, the robbery of the local bookie joint -- but there is 
more. His riffs on brotherhood, betrayal and good fortune are not 
immediately apparent as the playwright introduces his three 
characters, who sit around on stage when they are not talking 
directly to the audience. Initially, their monologues don't seem 
interrelated. 
</P>
<P>
	First up is Joe, a naive, earnest 17-year-old who idolizes  
Damien, a more worldly student who takes Joe on a memorable and 
eye-opening adventure. Then there is Ray, a university philosophy 
teacher who has been dating Joe's sister, among other women. 
Finally, there is Frank, Joe's older brother who works in their 
father's fish-and-chip shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank broods about his father's mounting debts, an amount that  
is strangling the family. He decides to help. The robbery and its 
aftermath is described from various perspectives, a fascinating 
three-way look at the same event. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson weaves these versions together skillfully, even  
surprisingly, with an ending that would do O. Henry proud. 
</P>
<P>
	The production, straightforwardly directed by Harris Yulin, is  
not yet up to the quality of the writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the boyish T.R. Knight as the youthful Joe seems  
comfortable in his role. Dressed in a short-sleeve shirt, a sweater 
and tie, the lad conveys a disarming seriousness that immediately 
gains him audience support. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew McVety's swaggering Ray has the most comic monologue, a  
confrontation with a well-known philosopher that literally clears a 
lecture hall. Yet he and Thomas Lyons, whose Frank sets the plot in 
motion, don't quite inhabit the characters as forcefully as they 
should. A few more performances could rectify their tentativeness. 
</P>
<P>
	But that shouldn't stop you from listening in on these  
beautifully written monologues. ``This Lime Tree Bower'' -- the 
title comes from a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge -- gives a boost 
to the fine art of storytelling.

<HEADLINE> Panel Sets Social Security Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key House committee will discuss proposals  
to shore up Social Security despite a recent assessment by 
Republican leaders that congressional action is unlikely this year, 
its chairman said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are areas where there can be an ultimate  
reconciliation,'' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill 
Archer, R-Texas, after a meeting with President Clinton. Archer's 
panel oversees the nation's retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	At their White House meeting, Archer and Clinton discussed  
similarities between a Social Security rescue plan the president 
proposed in his State of the Union speech and a competing plan 
Archer unveiled in April. But neither offered to give any ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not attempt to try to negotiate any sort of  
compromise,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Archer and Clinton talked about how they could help  
other lawmakers overcome reluctance to negotiate changes in the 
popular program, which has been a lightning rod for political 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we have developed a working relationship that if  
we both worked our sides we would have an opportunity'' for 
compromise, Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, Democrats and Republicans have done little  
other than to try to pin the blame on each other for a lack of 
progress on Social Security, and several weeks ago, Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, said he did not think anything can be 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said that at the  
meeting with Archer the president brought up ``the need to have 
processes like hearings and consultations that allowed Democrats 
and Republicans to participate, express views and suggestions and 
give an opportunity for bipartisan consensus to form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear, however, if Archer's offer to hold hearings in  
June, after Congress returns from its traditional Memorial Day 
break, will provide such a forum. The Ways and Means chairman said 
he will limit discussion to proposals that meet a test of providing 
75 years of financial health for Social Security. Clinton's plan, 
by the administration's own estimate, would assure only about 60 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is in some way added to so that it will meet that  
standard, it will be subject to the hearing and I think the 
president understands that,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton's and Archer's plans would invest some of Social  
Security's cash reserves in the stock market in an effort to 
increase their worth enough to help close a financing shortfall 
expected after baby boomers retire and begin to collect benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton would have the government handle the  
investments while Archer would set up a new system of accounts that 
individual Americans would control. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has also proposed a new system of personal retirement  
accounts for low- and middle-income Americans. But his accounts 
would be in addition to Social Security, while Archer's would be 
counted as part of people's Social Security benefits in the future.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Worries about a possible rise in U.S. interest  
rates sent Japanese stock prices sharply lower Wednesday for the 
fifth consecutive trading day. The U.S. dollar climbed to a 
seven-month high against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 250.44 points,  
or 1.53 percent, closing at 16,128.18. The average now has fallen a 
total of 819.18 points in five days, including Tuesday's 
42.40-point drop, or 0.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.70 yen at late afternoon, up 0.84 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
123.20 yen overnight. In Wednesday's trading, the dollar ranged 
between 123.25 yen and 124.03 yen, its highest intraday level in 
Tokyo since Nov. 30, 1998, when it traded at 124.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks remained in negative territory  
throughout Wednesday's trading after the U.S. Federal Reserve's 
Open Market Committee decided Tuesday to leave interest rates 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee did, however, put financial markets on notice that  
it is poised to raise interest rates if inflation concerns in the 
U.S. economy continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more  
attractive to investors, but lighten returns on equities and 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market has been in a correction phase in recent  
sessions since the Nikkei index surged to its highest closing level 
since October 1997 on May 6, some traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market levels have been running ahead of economic  
fundamentals, and if the fundamentals aren't keeping up, share 
values are going to fall to get in line with them,'' said Yasuo 
Ueki, chief executive officer of POCO Financial Business 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also remained under pressure as many investors stayed  
cautious ahead of more Japanese corporate earnings announcements in 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 601  
million shares, up from Tuesday's turnover of 541 million shares. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 937 to 278, with 98 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 23.54 points, or 1.78 percent, to 1,300.61. 
The TOPIX gained 1.72 points, or 0.13 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar advanced on buying from  
overseas players following the Fed committee's decision to assume a 
tightening bias. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese trust banks were among other dollar-buying players.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also god support from a widening of the interest-rate  
differential between Japan and the United States, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, bond prices dropped Tuesday amid fear of a future  
rise in interest rates, driving the yield on the benchmark 30-year 
U.S. Treasury bond up to 5.91 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.325 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.280 percent, driving its price down to 101.55 yen from 101.96 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 131.60 yen, up from  
131.30 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Says NATO Strategy Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder  
repeated his opposition Wednesday to the use of NATO ground forces, 
saying the alliance's current strategy was beginning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, who is spearheading European efforts to find a  
diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis, said he supported the 
19-nation alliance's strategy of waiting until the air war is over 
before sending a force into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am against any change in NATO strategy because I believe it  
is beginning to take effect,'' the chancellor told reporters at 
NATO headquarters after meeting with the alliance's top civilian 
and military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always understood NATO's strategy to be a dual  
strategy,'' he said. ``One element is the military campaign ... to 
save people in Kosovo from being killed, from being expelled. The 
second element of our strategy has always been the search for a 
political settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook insisted  
Wednesday that NATO is united in its opposition to committing 
ground troops to Kosovo as an invasion force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav army, however, appears to be expecting a NATO  
ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports in recent weeks have described Yugoslav army troops  
digging in areas along the borders with Albania and Macedonia in 
apparent preparation for a land invasion by NATO troops. The Serbs 
are still fighting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in these areas, 
too, be they seem to be getting ready to defend major approaches 
from an onslaught by the allies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have good evidence that in the area, especially towards  
Albania, that positions have been made to revettments, tanks are 
being dug in to be prepared for an attack from the side of 
Albania,'' said Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO military spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists, however, it will use ground troops only after Serb  
forces withdraw. Nonetheless, it does have plans for such an 
invasion on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	As the chancellor arrived at NATO headquarters, the alliance  
announced a lull in the air campaign caused by poor weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO planes flew 425 sorties on the 56th day of the operation,  
but only 58 of them involved airstrikes. Those operations were 
successful in destroying six Galeb aircraft on the ground north of 
Prizren, NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon responded Wednesday to reports  
that NATO was avoiding bombing central Belgrade after the mistaken 
attack on the Chinese Embassy on May 7, saying the alliance had not 
adopted a policy of withholding attacks on the center of the 
Yugoslav capital. He did say there have been no attacks there since 
the embassy bombing, but attributed this to weather and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder came to NATO at a moment when diplomatic efforts are  
picking up steam. Envoys from seven top industrialized powers and 
Russia, known as the G-8, met in Germany on Wednesday to work on 
the draft of a U.N. resolution that would set out terms for ending 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers from the G-8 -- made up of the United States,  
Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Germany, Japan and Russia -- 
outlined those terms two weeks ago, including a well-armed 
international force to secure the return of refugees to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution will have to satisfy Russia and China on the U.N.  
Security Council. To appease Russia, the foreign ministers did not 
specify that NATO would control the force, saying only that it had 
to be an ``effective security presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has demanded an end to the fighting in Kosovo, a withdrawal  
of all Serb troops and police, safe return of the refugees, an 
international military force with NATO as its core, and a beginning 
to serious political talks.

<HEADLINE> Judge Fines Lawyer in Cendant Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge has fined a lawyer $1,000  
for improperly disclosing confidential aspects of bidding by law 
firms that sought to lead one of two class-action lawsuits against 
Cendant Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The action Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William H. Walls  
came a day after he formally approved a $340 million settlement 
reached in January in that lawsuit, which was brought by holders of 
a special class of Cendant securities known as Prides. 
</P>
<P>
	Holders of Prides had the obligation of buying Cendant common  
stock at a future date. And when Cendant stock plummeted in April 
1998, following the disclosure of a widespread accounting fraud, it 
would have left the Prides' holders obligated to pay more than 
twice the market value for common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The other lawsuit, which is pending before Walls, was brought by  
holders of Cendant common stock and claims they lost billions on 
the collapse of the stock in the company that is the franchiser of 
Ramada and Howard Johnson hotels, Century 21 real estate and Avis 
car rentals brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Walls had threatened to issue a contempt citation against lawyer  
Howard Sirota, who represents some Prides shareholders, after 
reading a New York Times report in which Sirota questioned the 
payout to the lead firm, Kirby McInerney &AMP; Squire of New York. 
Instead, Walls chose a lesser punishment, which Sirota said he 
would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirota's firm, Sirota &AMP; Sirota of New York, failed in its effort  
to become lead counsel, a potentially lucrative post in 
class-action lawsuits. It is now seeking a share of Kirby's fees, 
arguing that by pushing for the competitive bidding, its efforts 
benefited shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday, Sirota asserted that he divulged no  
confidential information when he called a reporter for the Times 
and informed her of a court filing complaining that Kirby's request 
for fees exceeded its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	An article appeared Friday, which Sirota said was based on his  
legal brief. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said Kirby is seeking 2,916,147 Cendant rights as  
its fee. Sirota argued that would be worth $34 million, or about 10 
percent of the settlement, which Sirota said exceeds its bid, the 
article said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The class is entitled to know that Kirby is seeking more than  
his bid,'' Sirota told Walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Walls said Sirota could have checked with the court first before  
divulging bid information. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement would compensate Prides shareholders -- and Kirby  
-- with a new security, called Cendant Rights. Cendant took an 
after-tax charge of $220 million, or 26 cents a share, in the 
fourth quarter of 1998 to pay for the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant was formed in December 1997 from the merger of  
Parsippany-based franchiser HFS Inc. and Stamford, Conn.-based CUC 
International Inc., which runs shopping and other membership clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, Cendant announced it had found major accounting  
fraud at the former CUC unit, and restated its earnings for the 
past three years. The fraud, which added about $500 million in 
bogus revenues, led to the dismissals and resignations of several 
CUC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant had been based in Parsippany, but moved its base to New  
York in January.

<HEADLINE> Placebo Helps Some Depressed People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To their surprise, scientists have detected a  
change in brain activity that apparently helped some people gain 
remission from depression after taking inactive ``placebo'' pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, the detected change was exactly the opposite of what  
researchers found in people helped by Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	If scientists can figure out how the placebo treatment works, it  
might give clues for developing new therapies, said Dr. Andrew F. 
Leuchter of the University of California, Los Angeles, 
Neuropsychiatric Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke in an interview before presenting the study Wednesday  
at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have long known that many depressed people can get  
relief, at least for a while, by taking inert pills that they 
believe might be real medication. In fact, new medications are 
tested head-to-head against placebos to make sure the real drugs 
actually work better. As in Leuchter's study, participants agree 
beforehand that they might get a placebo and that they won't find 
out until the study is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Leuchter's study was intended to monitor the brains of people  
taking Prozac to see if changes in activity would predict who would 
get better on the drug. He and colleagues included people taking 
placebos just for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 26 people studied, half were given Prozac and the other  
half a placebo. After eight weeks, remission appeared in just under 
half the placebo group and just over half the Prozac group. 
</P>
<P>
	By placing electrodes on the scalp, Leuchter and colleagues  
found that people who improved on Prozac showed a decrease in 
activity in the front of the brain. That appeared within 48 hours 
of the start of therapy, well before any lifting of depression was 
apparent. Other antidepressants have the same effect on brain 
activity, Leuchter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, people who responded to the placebo treatment  
showed an increase in activity in the front of the brain. That 
showed up more gradually, after a week or more of treatment. But it 
disappeared at the eight-week point in the study, when patients 
were about to be told whether they had been taking Prozac or a 
bogus drug, Leuchter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it can only last that long, or maybe the effect ended when  
a patient knew he or she was about to discover the truth, Leuchter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the patients who responded to the placebo found out they'd  
been taking an inactive drug, many continued their remission from 
depression for several weeks, Leuchter said. Then, most said they 
were feeling depressed again and asked to get Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why opposite brain responses would each lead to a  
lifting of depression, Leuchter said. ``There's probably more than 
one pathway to clinical improvement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert M. Post, chief of the biological psychiatry branch of  
the National Institute of Mental Health, said brain activity 
measurements are general results that don't reveal the details of 
what's happening in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Post also said that depressed people can show either  
overactivity or underactivity in the frontal lobes of the brain. 
Each group might respond better to a different treatment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bad News Makes Airline Stocks Dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Airline stocks tumbled Wednesday on news that  
per seat revenue on domestic flights fell 3 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was steeper than the 1 percent to 1.5 percent some  
analysts expected, and signaled that second-quarter revenues may 
not meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines shares took the biggest hit, falling 7.3  
percent, or $5.87 1/2, to close at $74.68 3/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Continental Airlines' stock lost $3.06 1/4, or nearly 7 
percent, to close at $42.50, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Airlines and US Airways each lost 5 percent. Delta closed  
down $3.18 3/4, at $61.50, while US Airways fell $2.75, to $52.12 1/2, 
both on the NYSE. Northwest Airlines closed down 87 1/2 cents, at 
$33.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Tuesday by the Air Transport Association said  
industry revenue increased 0.4 percent in April on a rise in 
traffic for the month, but there was a decline in the average 
ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines and investors focused on the per-seat figure.  
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers were surprising and disappointing to a lot of  
observers, but not so surprising to us,'' said Don Carty, chairman 
and CEO of AMR Corp., American Airlines' parent. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had made some deep price discounts in late March  
and April, even though planes were still flying very full, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the March period, there was a lot more aggressive  
discounting than a lot of people realized,'' said Carty. He added 
that the airline industry is going to have to look more closely at 
whether it will continue to offer continual sales to try and fill 
every seat, or if higher prices may ultimately be better for 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines shares fell 3 percent, or $2.12 1/2, to close at  
$69.18 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	One airline stock that managed to gain ground was America West  
Holdings Corp., the parent of America West Airlines. Shares in the 
company rose 25 cents to close at $20.62 1/2 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Slow Huntington's in Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have found a way to delay the onset of Huntington's  
disease and slow its progress in mice by targeting an enzyme that 
is believed to trigger cell death. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding, published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, is a promising lead for drug researchers working to extend 
the lives of Huntington's sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is important and exciting. This is the first  
demostration of a drug that can slow the progress of HD in an 
animal model,'' said Dr. Christopher Ross, a Johns Hopkins Medical 
School professor and a scientific adviser to the Huntington's 
Disease Society of America. ``It says this goal of slowing progress 
probably can be accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington's has been linked to enzymes called caspases, which  
cause brain cells to die slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, scientists from Harvard University's Brigham  
and Women's Hospital blocked a particular caspase in mice that had 
been genetically engineered to contract the disease. These mice 
developed Huntington's symptoms about 10 percent later in life and 
lived about 20 percent longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Caspase-1 apparently plays a role in the cell death that marks  
Huntington's, which usually kills sufferers within 15 to 20 years. 
How the enzyme works is unclear, but scientists think that it 
slices up the so-called huntingtin gene, and that the fragments 
then kill the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard researchers slowed that process by breeding mice  
with a mutant protein that counteracts caspase-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The mice showed Huntington's symptoms -- walking trouble, weight  
loss and seizures -- after 84 days, on average, compared with 77 
days in the other mice. The mice with the caspase blocker lived an 
average of 121 days, compared with 101 days for the other mice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one drug can do this, hopefully, in the future, you can  
find others,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Robert M. 
Friedlander. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington's, which killed folk singer Woody Guthrie, afflicts  
30,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	What is exciting, Friedlander said, is that the same mechanism  
at work in this study may be applied to research on brain injuries 
and illnesses such as Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Caspase inhibition may turn out to be the magic bullet against  
neurodegenerative disesase,'' University of Munich biochemist 
Christian Haass said in an accompanying editorial.

<HEADLINE> Selleck, Rosie Spar Over Gun Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So much for a peaceful discussion about gun  
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosie O'Donnell and Tom Selleck got into a verbal tussle over  
the issue on her show Wednesday. The actor has filmed a commercial 
for the National Rifle Association, while O'Donnell has been a 
frequent critic of the NRA since the Columbine High School 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said he believed gun control legislation wouldn't have  
done anything to prevent the tragedy, and that it was wrong to 
legislate against guns during a period of national mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	When O'Donnell complained about NRA opposition to efforts to ban  
assault weapons, Selleck said he couldn't speak for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say `I will not take responsibility for anything the  
NRA represents' if you're doing an ad for the NRA. You can't say 
that. Do you think you can?'' O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said it was ``an act of moral vanity'' for O'Donnell to  
assume that someone who disagrees with her cares any less about gun 
control. He said he felt attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come on your show to have a debate,'' he said. ``I  
came on your show to plug a movie. That's what I'm doing here. If 
you think it's proper to have a debate about the NRA, I'm trying to 
be fair with you. This is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exasperated Selleck looked out on the silent audience.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly entertaining,'' he said. ``Look at the  
audience, laughing and having a great old time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious subject,'' O'Donnell shot back. ``I don't think  
it's something to laugh about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding the debate hadn't gone well, O'Donnell apologized to  
Selleck, saying she wasn't making a personal attack. Selleck, 
looking down at the floor, didn't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your show,'' he said, ``and you can talk about it after I  
leave.''

<HEADLINE>  Old Red Wings or Just Old? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One moment they looked like the old Red Wings, but the moment  
after that, they just looked old. Another dynasty-in-the-making 
ends with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey is played too fast to see a team crumble over the span of  
a single game. But go back and look at freeze frames from 
Colorado's 5-2 series-clinching win Tuesday night in Detroit and 
it's tough to see how Hockeytown's future can be nearly as bright 
as its immediate past. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two years running, the Red Wings ended the season by  
drinking from the Stanley Cup. The two seasons before that, they 
could take some comfort in knowing they were beaten by the eventual 
champions -- the Avalanche in the Western Conference finals in 1996, 
and the New Jersey Devils in the Stanley Cup finals in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche vs. Red Wings is widely considered the toughest  
rivalry in sports, so there is no shame in losing. On the other 
hand, Detroit raised expectations by adding four big names to the 
roster just ahead of the trading deadline, then sweeping Anaheim to 
open the playoffs. And that may have been why the crash-and-burn 
nature of the second-round loss -- the Red Wings dropped four 
straight after winning the first two -- left everybody in the locker 
room wondering what's next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see the Cup going someplace else this year,''  
Detroit's Brendan Shanahan said. ``That's going to be the hardest 
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Red Wings fans might have to get used to it.  
</P>
<P>
	Their last night in contention for a third straight Cup got off  
to a terrible start, then turned, in the span of just 29 seconds, 
into something promising. Late in the second period, Detroit scored 
two quick goals to turn a 4-0 lead into 4-2 and slow Colorado's 
momentum from an avalanche to a crawl. And then, with 6 1/2 minutes 
left in the game, the night turned sour for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Peter Forsberg picked up the puck near center ice and  
broke toward Chris Osgood in the Detroit net. The only Red Wing 
with any chance of catching him was center Igor Larionov, who was 
already a teen-age prospect in the old Soviet hockey machine when 
Forsberg was born. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second, the age difference -- 13 years -- was apparent.  
Larionov clutched, grabbed and poked Forsberg, but lost contact 
with him soon enough. A second later, Forsberg deked Osgood on the 
backhand side, pulled the puck back to his forehand and deposited 
both the puck and himself into the net. It was Forsberg's second 
goal of the night and there was a certain symmetry to his being the 
hero, because he was the goat of the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole series, in fact, was punctuated by mood swings.  
Detroit won two on Colorado's ice. Forsberg got himself tossed from 
Game 1 for a vicious check on Shanahan from behind, leaving his 
shorthanded teammates to get beat in overtime. The Red Wings won 
Game 2 in regulation when Bill Ranford, their backup netminder, 
posted a shutout and played the way everybody expected Colorado's 
Patrick Roy would. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as if on cue, the two switched roles. Roy began playing  
like the best playoff goalie ever. Ranford answered questions about 
why he was filling in for the injured Osgood by playing like a 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado won two in Detroit and a third at home. In the deciding  
game Tuesday night, Roy was unyielding early and then, after the 
two Detroit scores got the crowd at Joe Louis back to its throaty 
best, solid enough to quiet the joint down. In a nice touch, the 
crowd got back on its feet for the final minute to pay tribute to 
the team and the coach, Scotty Bowman, for a great run before 
heading for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they'll return next fall to find a team nearly this  
competitive is anyone's guess. General manager Ken Holland made 
some bold moves to get the Red Wings back into a tough race at the 
end of March by trading for Ranford, Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson 
and Wendel Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The team responded by winning nine of the final 12 and crushing  
Anaheim in Round 1, but the years caught up with them all of a 
sudden. Chelios and Clark had one goal between them, Ranford went 
2-2 in the net and Samuelsson ended the playoffs in civilian 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, who's won a record-tying eight Stanley Cups as a coach,  
is talking retirement. Nick Lidstrom, Detroit's best defenseman, is 
talking about returning to Sweden to raise his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody learns from a champion,'' Colorado  
defenseman Aaron Miller said. ``I think these guys definitely give 
you a blueprint on how to win. They did it two years in a row. They 
can only beat you so many times before you look up and say, `What's 
going on here?' That's what we did.''

game Tuesday night, Roy was unyielding early and then, after the 
two Detroit scores got the crowd at Joe Louis back to its throaty 
best, solid enough to quiet the joint down. In a nice touch, the 
crowd got back on its feet for the final minute to pay tribute to 
the team and the coach, Scotty Bowman, for a great run before 
heading for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they'll return next fall to find a team nearly this  
competitive is anyone's guess. General manager Ken Holland made 
some bold moves to get the Red Wings back into a tough race at the 
end of March by trading for Ranford, Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson 
and Wendel Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The team responded by winning nine of the final 12 and crushing  
Anaheim in Round 1, but the years caught up with them all of a 
sudden. Chelios and Clark had one goal between them, Ranford went 
2-2 in the net and Samuelsson ended the playoffs in civilian 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, who's won a record-tying eight Stanley Cups as a coach,  
is talking retirement. Nick Lidstrom, Detroit's best defenseman, is 
talking about returning to Sweden to raise his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody learns from a champion,'' Colorado  
defenseman Aaron Miller said. ``I think these guys definitely give 
you a blueprint on how to win. They did it two years in a row. They 
can only beat you so many times before you look up and say, `What's 
going on here?' That's what we did.''

<HEADLINE> Retirement Paradise in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AJIJIC, Mexico (AP) -- The Casa del Waffle carries USA Today. Dr  
Pepper is available at a local grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	The English-language library has 23,000 books, and a  
representative of the Chicago-based Beltone hearing aid company 
flies down once a month to make his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the shores of Lake Chapala, a wonderland of sunny  
skies, mild temperatures, lush mountains -- and thousands of retired 
Americans and Canadians, possibly the largest community of North 
American expatriates in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Florida was heaven,'' said Skip Waggoner, 58, of  
Sebring, Fla., who retired to Ajijic four years ago. ``But when I 
found this, I fell in love with the place. This is definitely 
paradise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official language of this paradise is English. With more  
than 10,000 full-time residents from the United States and Canada -- 
and thousands more who come for a few months every winter -- the 
Chapala area often doesn't seem that different from their home 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	People can watch American television over satellite dishes.  
Grocery stores stock Manwich sloppy Joe mix, Stove Top stuffing, 
even Taco Bell taco seasoning. English-language newspapers -- 
including the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and 
the Globe and Mail of Toronto -- are available at most newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ``at-home'' touches draw more and more retirees every  
year. Although no one keeps statistics, residents say the influx 
has grown considerably in the last few years, and with millions of 
baby boomers in the United States approaching retirement age, the 
trend is expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the handful of towns that line the retiree corridor along the  
northwestern corner of Lake Chapala, the most popular is Ajijic, 
pronounced ah-hee-HEEK. 
</P>
<P>
	With cobblestone streets that date back to the 16th century,  
Ajijic combines the charms of old Mexico and small-town America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a point when you want out of the pressure pot, out  
of the rat race,'' said Wayne Lamb, a 62-year-old who heads 
American Legion Post 9 in Ajijic. ``This is it. It's the best of 
both worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expatriates keep busy playing golf and bridge, putting on plays  
and musicals, painting and making crafts to sell in the dozens of 
art galleries around town, and participating in activities and 
charity programs organized by the Lake Chapala Society, a nonprofit 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The society runs an orphanage, offers scholarships to send local  
children to good schools and has a humane society. Such activities 
help encourage warm relations between the expatriates and the 
Mexican residents of the area -- as do the dollars that have 
protected the local economy from peso devaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the expatriates, the Lake Chapala Society offers an  
English-language library and a video collection, special group 
rates on Aetna medical and car insurance, visits by consular 
representatives, Spanish classes, free blood pressure checks and an 
outgoing U.S. mail service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't miss going to the States at all,'' said Vierl Bunnell,  
the society's 65-year-old president who has been in Chapala for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	For many residents, the area's location is ideal. Guadalajara,  
Mexico's second-largest city, is a 30-minute drive away, and the 
its airport -- with direct flights to several U.S. and Canadian 
cities -- is even closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier for our children to come visit,'' said Don  
Chaloner, a native of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaloner, 72, and his wife first lived in the area as snowbirds  
eight years ago. They tried moving to Europe after retiring five 
years ago, but the beauty of Lake Chapala lured them back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have retired in Ireland, Spain or France,'' he said.  
``But we finally decided to come back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate costs have risen steadily in the last few years and  
are now similar to those in the United States and Canada. Prices 
range from $59,000 for a three-bedroom house near the town square 
to $685,000 for a five-bedroom lakefront mansion with pool, Jacuzzi 
and four-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall cost of living remains low. Many residents have  
full-time maids and gardeners, who generally are paid $1 an hour -- 
well above Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 a day. A good meal at a 
restaurant runs $5 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather is sunny and mild all year long, and there is very  
little humidity, so there is no need for heating or 
air-conditioning, which also holds down costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Edwards, a 59-year-old lawyer from Anchorage, Alaska, said  
the lower cost of living allowed him and his wife to retire five 
years earlier than planned. This fall, the couple will be moving to 
Ajijic permanently to run a bed-and-breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only complaint most people have is that they didn't come  
here sooner,'' said Waggoner, the Florida retiree.

<HEADLINE> Pulses May Ease Schizophrenic Voices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schizophrenia patients whose medication  
couldn't stop the imaginary voices in their heads gained some 
relief after researchers repeatedly sent a magnetic field into a 
small area of their brains. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of 12 patients studied said their hallucinations  
became much less severe after the treatment, which feels like 
``having a woodpecker knock on your head'' once a second for up to 
16 minutes, said researcher Dr. Ralph Hoffman. The voices stopped 
completely in three of these patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect lasted for up to a few days for most participants,  
and one man reported that it lasted seven weeks after being treated 
daily for four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman stressed that the study is only preliminary and can't  
prove that the treatment would be useful. ``We need to do much more 
research on this,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, deputy medical director of the Yale Psychiatric  
Institute, is scheduled to present the work Thursday at the annual 
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all people with schizophrenia hear voices, and of those who  
do, Hoffman estimated that maybe 25 percent can't control them with 
medications even when other disease symptoms abate. So the work 
could pay off for ``a small but very ill group of patients,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment is called transcranial magnetic stimulation, or  
TMS. While past research indicates it might be helpful in lifting 
depression, it hasn't been studied much in schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	In TMS, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and  
current is turned on and off to create a pulsing magnetic field 
that reaches into a small area of the brain. The goal is to make 
brain cells underneath the coil fire messages to adjoining cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is much different from electroconvulsive therapy,  
called ECT, which applies pulses of electricity rather than a 
magnetic field to the brain. Unlike TMS, ECT creates a brief 
seizure and is performed under general anesthesia. ECT is used most 
often for treating severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In TMS, the magnetic pulses are thought to calm the affected  
part of the brain if they're given as slowly as once per second, 
Hoffman said. He and colleagues targeted an area involved in 
understanding speech, above and behind the left ear, on the theory 
that hallucinated voices come from overactivity there. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment can make scalp muscles muscle contract, leading to  
the woodpecker feeling, he said, but patients could tolerate it. 
Headache was the most common side effect, and there was no sign 
that the treatment affected the ability to understand speech, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make sure the study results didn't reflect just the  
psychological boost of getting a treatment, researchers gave sham 
and real treatments to each study participant and studied the 
difference in how patients responded. They also tested different 
durations for each treatment, starting with four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients rated the severity of the voices -- a term combining  
frequency, loudness and the resulting distress -- on the day after 
each treatment. The real treatment did far better than the sham one 
when both were given for 16 minutes, but not when they were 
administered for briefer periods. 
</P>
<P>
	On a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the severity patients  
had before the study began, the real 16-minute treatments led to an 
average drop of 3.8 points. Sham treatments made no significant 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark S. George, a TMS expert at the Medical University of  
South Carolina in Charleston, agreed that the results are 
preliminary and must be confirmed by further work. But he called 
them exciting, saying, ``You have to sit up and take notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman and colleagues have begun another study to see if giving  
more doses of the 16-minute treatment will improve results.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sgt. Indicted in Terror Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Army sergeant was indicted Wednesday on  
federal charges that he trained members of Osama bin Laden's 
terrorist organization and Islamic militants who were implicated in 
the World Trade Center bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mohamed, 46, a native of Egypt who left the Army in 1989,  
was added to a broad conspiracy case that includes bin Laden, the 
suspected architect of last summer's bombings of the U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed has been jailed in New York since he was arrested Sept.  
11 on a sealed complaint in federal court in Manhattan. A message 
left Wednesday with Mohamed's lawyer, James Roth, was not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed, a former Egyptian military officer, moved to the United  
States in 1985 and became a permanent resident. He was honorably 
discharged from the Army in 1989 after serving three years at the 
Special Forces base in Fort Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the U.S. military, Mohamed taught soldiers in the  
special forces about Muslim culture. Prosecutors say he later lent 
his military expertise to terrorists intent on destroying the 
United States to retaliate for its support of Israel and 
involvement in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Mohamed trained members of bin Laden's al  
Qaeda terrorist organization and helped move bin Laden from 
Pakistan to Sudan in 1991. He also allegedly discussed as early as 
1993 with other members of al Qaeda how to attack the U.S. embassy 
in Nairobi and other Israeli, British and French targets in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed also allegedly provided training to a group of Islamic  
militants who were later implicated in the 1993 World Trade Center 
bombing and in a plot to blow up New York City landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records say that while Mohamed was in the Army, he gave  
tapes and books on military techniques and weapons to a group of 
young men who wanted to help Afghan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the materials were later recovered from the apartment of  
El Sayyid Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted of conspiracy in 
the killing of Jewish Defense League founder Rabbi Meir Kahane in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kahane killing was once believed to be an isolated attack,  
but investigators now see it as the start of a U.S. terrorism 
campaign by Islamic fundamentalists.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Worried About Utah Drink Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Forget the corruption scandal. The big  
Olympic issue in Salt Lake City now is where to get a drink. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that the Utah capital's Mormon restrictions on alcohol  
might run smack into foreign cultures where beer and wine are 
normal table items, the International Olympic Committee asked Salt 
Lake organizers Wednesday to try to pull the cork and let the booze 
flow at the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's coordination commission, holding four days of meetings  
with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, asked SLOC to request 
``with great respect'' that Utah authorities allow unfettered 
alcohol sales in the main press center, slated to take over the 
mammoth Salt Palace convention center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Frenchman, I know that a Frenchman kept from his wine  
might get cranky,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, SLOC's senior vice president for communications,  
said the committee would ``make every effort'' to win an exemption 
from liquor laws for the Salt Palace for the two weeks of the 
games. Such exemptions can be granted for convention facilities but 
are limited to one a year. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no plans to request similar exemptions for other  
Olympic sites, SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah officials have said repeatedly they would not relax the  
laws for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left at the offices of Gov. Mike Leavitt and  
House Speaker Martin Stephens were not immediately returned, and a 
call to Senate President Lane Beattie was not answered. Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Department director Kenneth Wynn was away from his 
office and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first visit by IOC leaders to Salt Lake since the  
bribery scandal nearing its end, both sides said contentious issues 
were few and that no SLOC plans had been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zero surprises,'' Servan-Schreiber said. He compared the  
sessions to ``making wedding plans but magnified 10 million 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said SLOC presented reports on sports, environmental  
impact, telecommunications, media operations, marketing and other 
areas. The meetings wrap up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the two sides discussed sight lines at the Delta Center  
for figure skating but that no further action was taken. Officials 
are concerned that some seats at the city's biggest indoor arena 
won't have good views of the ice, and skaters complained during the 
world championships there in February that they had trouble seeing 
the fans, which interrupted their rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas also said SLOC hoped to have its list of Olympic events  
finished by June, with competition schedules done by December. Salt 
Lake organizers have proposed several new events, including 
skeleton -- a luge-like race where sledders go down the track 
headfirst -- and women's bobsled. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came to issues, Servan-Schreiber said, ``liquor for  
the bar'' grabbed the IOC's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Mormon teaching forbids the use of alcohol. Beer is sold in  
grocery stores, but the law in Utah, where Mormons dominate the 
population and politics, restricts other alcohol sales to state-run 
outlets, establishments serving food or ``social clubs,'' where a 
customer must be sponsored by a club member before imbibing. Often 
the ``sponsorship'' is no more than a nod from the guy on the next 
barstool, but it's a barrier not seen in most of the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC bans alcohol from its own sponsorship program, although  
national and local Olympic committees can sign with brewers and 
vintners. Otherwise, Olympic leaders accept alcohol's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Olympic venues in the past have served beer and wine, and  
the press center -- probably the highest concentration of foreign 
visitors to the games aside from the athletes' village, where wine 
is usually available with meals -- always has a least one place 
where thirsty reporters can belly up, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In their bids, Salt Lake organizers took pains to show how easy  
it was to buy a drink here. Tom Welch, the motivator behind the bid 
and now disgraced for his role in the bribery scandal, used to tell 
Olympic leaders, ``If you can't get a drink in Salt Lake City, you 
can't be very thirsty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state officials have promised that they would not change  
laws just because the Olympic circus was coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Mormon church late last year spoke out against  
pleas from the tourism and hospitality industries to change the 
laws, and local anti-alcohol groups have protested Anheuser Busch's 
sponsorship as the first step toward ``beer-soaked Winter Games in 
Salt Lake City.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Grants Local Phone Cos. Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission agreed  
Tuesday to give medium-sized local phone companies, such as 
Cincinnati Bell, ALLTEL Corp. and CenturyTel Inc., regulatory 
relief that their industry had sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency decided to eliminate rules that required the  
companies to file applications to the commission before building, 
acquiring or extending phone lines; directed companies to obtain 
prior FCC permission before offering new services; and forced 
companies that resell another company's long-distance service under 
their brand name do so through a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also streamlined accounting and reporting requirements  
for the companies and reduced the amount of information they would 
have to file in the event two medium-sized companies plan to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Medium-sized companies are defined as those serving less than 2  
percent of the nation's phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Telephone and Telecommunications Alliance, which  
represents the midsize companies, had asked the FCC for regulatory 
relief. It was not completely satisfied with the result. 
</P>
<P>
	ITTA's executive director, David Zesiger, said his companies  
``welcome the relief granted, but ... it appears the commission 
missed the opportunity for more substantial relief.''

<HEADLINE> Agent:Trie Repaid Clinton Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An office manager for Democratic  
fund-raiser Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie told investigators that Trie 
reimbursed six people for donations they made to President 
Clinton's legal defense fund, an FBI agent testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Roberta Parker said the manager, Maria ``Dia'' Mapili,  
told investigators that six Arkansans were involved. Their names 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, 49, a central figure in the controversy over  
foreign-linked campaign donations to Democrats, is accused of 
impeding a Senate investigation into political fund raising. He 
could face up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>

	The DNC has returned $640,000 that Trie raised. Clinton's legal

<HEADLINE> Bird To Testify in Pub Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird will testify in the case of a pub  
manager charged with battery after evicting a female patron he 
thought was bothering the Indiana Pacers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Etchison, the former manager of the Legal Beagle Pub,  
faces trial June 3. His lawyer said Tuesday he plans to question 
Bird at a May 26 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Marty Solomon, said Bird may offer videotaped  
testimony to prevent the need for him to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon said both sides are trying to be flexible with Bird's  
schedule because they do not want to interfere with the Pacers' 
playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana leads the second-round series with Philadelphia 1-0,  
with Game 2 tonight at Market Square Arena. Game 5 is the night of 
the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Etchison faces a maximum sentence of one year in  
jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 4, Bird was having a beer with an unidentified assistant  
coach in the pub near Market Square Arena when he was approached by 
Kay Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird gave the 43-year-old woman an autograph. When she  
approached him later at the bar, he politely talked with her, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers president Donnie Walsh had given Williams and her  
chronically ill daughter two tickets to the NBA All-Star game last 
year in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said that while she talked with Bird, Etchison asked  
her to leave the coach alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Bird told Etchison she was not bothering him, but  
the pub manager grabbed her wrist and her arms and pushed her 
toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Bird tried to get Etchison to stop by ``yelling at  
Gordon, saying, 'Gordon, it's OK, it's OK.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams received hospital treatment for soreness and bruises.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this season, Bird said he had been having a conversation  
with Williams, ``and the next thing I know, somebody asked her to 
leave, and he grabbed her arm or something.''

<HEADLINE> Museum Guide Fired for Sex Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A volunteer tour guide at the Los Angeles  
County Museum of Art was fired for delivering what officials say 
was a sexually frank lecture to a group of fifth-grade girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Riseley says she was merely following an approved  
script in describing ``Back Seat Dodge '38,'' a sculpture by Edward 
Kienholz that depicts a drunken couple embracing in the back seat 
of a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Riseley conducted the museum tour in March for the 10 girls from  
an elementary school in the central California town of Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
	They stopped at the sculpture, an actual 1938 Dodge with beer  
bottles and sculptures of a faceless man and woman embracing 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Riseley said she told the group the piece was an expression of  
the artist's first sexual encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can see their own reflections in all the mirrors and they  
understand what I feel he was trying to express: That you only get 
one first sexual experience, so think before you act,'' she said 
she told the group. ``Make it meaningful, make it special, make it 
beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Bressler, head of the council that fired Riseley, said  
the lecture was inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not our place to teach religion or sex education,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riseley is fighting the termination and demanding an apology.

<HEADLINE> Burger King To Offer Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Would you like Internet access with that  
burger and fries? 
</P>
<P>
	Fast food giant Burger King is opening a new franchise in  
Hartford with a high-tech twist. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the Whoppers, the downtown store will offer customers  
the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Internet surfing stations will be featured in the new Burger  
King, with the possibility of adding up to 20 terminals. The 
60-seat restaurant will be the company's first Internet store. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers purchasing Burger King combo meals will be allowed 15  
minutes of ``filtered'' Internet surfing. There will be no adult 
content allowed, and no sending and receiving of e-mail, said Joel 
M. Rieger, vice president of Surveillance Technologies Group, a 
subsidiary of Privid Eye Systems Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 
which is installing the Hartford restaurant's high-tech 
surveillance systems and Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Also planned is a Webcam where Internet surfers can call up  
Hartford's Burger King Web site and see a live transmission of 
action in the restaurant. That is is expected to be up by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Hartford getting national attention,'' said Ruth  
Schaefer, a co-owner of the Corning Building where the restaurant 
is housed, and the one largely responsible for wooing Burger King 
back to downtown Hartford. ``This is wonderful for Hartford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burger King says it has no plans to add Internet access to any  
of its 10,300 other restaurants, said Charles Nicolas, spokesman 
for the Miami-based corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll evaluate it as it moves forward,'' he says. ``We look to  
our customers to determine if they have a need or use for it, or 
they don't.''

<HEADLINE> Gates Defends Telecom Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- A billion dollars here, $5 billion there.  
</P>
<P>
	Why is Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest computer software  
maker, throwing so much money into telecommunications? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer, says chairman Bill Gates, is simple. With growing  
demand by businesses and individual consumers for high-speed 
computer links, ``it's important for us to have those companies 
make the investment, build that new equipment,'' Gates said 
Wednesday in a news conference during Microsoft's third annual CEO 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Jeff Raikes, Microsoft vice president for sales and  
support, denied any grander schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question comes up, `Are you in some way interested in  
becoming a telecommunications company?' and the answer is no,'' 
Raikes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our core competence is building software and so we're not  
controlling any communications companies,'' Gates said. ``We are 
just a software company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal announced earlier this month, Microsoft is  
investing $5 billion in AT&AMP;T Corp., which in turn is relying on 
Microsoft products to offer interactive television with phone 
service and other Internet features over cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Microsoft invested $1 billion in Comcast of  
Philadelphia, which now has 4.4 million cable subscribers and 
revenues exceeding $5.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been able to take things like the investment we made  
in Comcast and in a passive way encourage them to make some of 
these investments and get that infrastructure in place -- and then 
we'll build software that takes advantage of it,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a speech to open the two-day conference of more than  
100 chief executives from the world's 1,000 biggest corporations, 
Gates said corporate success would hinge increasingly on how well 
information is organized electronically and made available to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech echoed themes from Gates' book, ``Business @ the  
Speed of Thought: Using a Digital Nervous System.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond merely having a corporate Web site, computers and e-mail,  
``it's how you take those technologies and use them inside the 
company ... that's going to differentiate'' the most effective 
businesses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who joined Gates at the news conference agreed that  
businesses must keep pace with technology to thrive and perhaps 
even survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the speed with which hardware and software become  
obsolescent, ``I think that the cost of waiting is worse,'' said 
Larry Bossidy, chairman of AlliedSignal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for small businesses, ``I don't think the transition ... is  
going to slow down,'' said Michael Dell, chairman of Dell Computer 
Corp. ``It's only going to accelerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love this to be simplified and easier for the homemaker  
and not just for the corporate world,'' added Martha Stewart, 
chairwoman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Making e-mail part of a corporate culture and replacing paper  
forms with electronic outlines are only the first steps toward 
making full use of today's technology, Gates said in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even what's available right now is vastly underutilized  
throughout the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting-edge corporations are moving to wireless communications,  
combining voice, pictures and data and outfitting employees with 
``digital dashboards,'' customized on-screen layouts a worker can 
access from any computer, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the executives said they were especially impressed by  
a messaging system that lists phone messages as well as e-mail, 
each retrievable by voice or text. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital dashboard -- ``your office on any screen,'' Gates  
called it -- can be modified both by the employee and by executives 
who might decide everyone should have a given feature, be it last 
month's sales figures or a corporate phone list. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates demonstrated his own digital dashboard which includes a  
toolbar featuring buttons for commands he created himself, a panel 
of moving stock quotes, a listing of top news stories on selected 
issues, access to weather maps and real-time photos of his frequent 
travel routes and e-mail ranked by priority, subject and author. 
</P>
<P>
	He also displayed some of the latest gear, including improved  
handheld devices that convert handwriting on an electronic pad into 
print on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to be a mainstream scenario very soon,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Prospect To Stay in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Michigan quarterback and New York Yankees  
prospect Drew Henson will be spending his summer in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees decided to keep Henson with the team's Class A Tampa  
affiliate in the Florida State League instead of sending him to 
Class A Greensboro in the Carolina League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can give him a little more attention here and he will  
certainly be challenged by the league,'' New York vice president of 
player development and scouting Mark Newman said. ``He's a guy that 
responds well to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida State League is among the circuits considered as the  
highest level of Class A baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson joined Tampa last Thursday after spending two weeks with  
New York's extended spring training program. He will return to 
Michigan when the Wolverines begin summer practice for the upcoming 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson, a third baseman, had a .316 batting average with two  
RBIs over six games at the Class A level the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 third-round draft pick made his professional debut last  
year, hitting .316 with one homer and two RBIs in ten games with 
Tampa of the rookie Gulf Coast League.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An army officer arrested for protests against  
what he calls Mexico's antiquated and undemocratic military justice 
system has made a second suicide attempt in a military prison, 
local media reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Hildegardo Bacilio Gomez, arrested on charges of  
sedition after leading soldiers in a protest march through Mexico 
City in December, tried to cut his wrists at an army prison in the 
Pacific coast city of Mazatlan, his lawyers told local media. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Bacilio Gomez -- an army doctor who originally ran  
afoul of the military court system on charges of insubordination -- 
took an overdose of tranquilizers and was rushed to a military 
hospital, where he recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissident officers in this and other cases have frequently  
complained of harassment and abuse at military prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacilio Gomez heads a group he calls The Patriotic Command to  
Make People Aware, which protests injustices and corruption 
allegedly committed within the Mexican military, along with abuses 
of power and mistreatment of servicemen on trial. 
</P>

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Torrential rains in a northeastern  
state claimed three lives Wednesday, bringing the number of deaths 
over the last three days due to heavy rain to 14, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four houses collapsed when the earth below them gave way killing  
three people in Candeias, in Bahia state 750 miles (1200 kms) 
northeast of Rio de Janeiro, the city's secretary of administration 
Ivan Palma said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a muddy hillside collapsed on a lumber yard, burying  
buildings and cars, killing six people and injuring another 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Palma said the rains appeared to be abating.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- After years of trials and appeals, a former  
federal police commander on Wednesday was sentenced to 49 1/2 years 
in prison for a 1990 murder that helped prompt creation of Mexico's 
federal human rights commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal attorney general's office said a judge in Mexico  
City imposed the sentence for murder, torture and abuse of 
authority on Mario Alberto Gonzalez Trevino, who once headed the 
federal judicial police detachment in the drug-plagued Pacific 
coast state of Sinaloa. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Norma Corona was kidnapped and shot to death in the  
Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan in May 1990. As head of the 
Sinaloa human rights commission, she had successfuly lobbying for a 
law mandating 10 years in prison for police who used torture. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators said her slaying apparently was due to her  
allegations that federal judicial police were involved in slaying a 
Sinaloa lawyer and three Venezuelan men whom she had represented. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal over her killing -- and handling of the case -- were  
among the factors that led Mexico to create a National Human Rights 
Commission. 
</P>

<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican prosecutors didn't want him  
released, nor did their U.S. counterparts. But Adan Amezcua walked 
out of a prison Wednesday almost one year after his arrest in a 
case that has embarrassed Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a judge ordered the release of Adan Amezcua -- the  
brother of alleged metamphetamine traffickers Jose de Jesus and 
Luis Amezcua -- after finding that prosecutors had failed to present 
sufficient evidence to back up money-laundering charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican prosecutors say the brothers belonged to a drug ring  
that sent amphetamines to the United States. None of them have ever 
been charged with drug-trafficking, but prosecutors have tried to 
pin other charges on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose de Jesus and Luis Amezcua have had all Mexican charges  
against them dismissed and are now being held on extradition orders 
to the United States, where they face grand jury charges that 
include manufacturing metamphetamine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Schools Lack Language Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAXTON, Ill. (AP) -- Kyle Merkle and Chris Nelson's cheery  
``Bonjour, Madame'' doesn't get much of a response in French class. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the teens have to push a button to hear their  
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their school was unable to hire a French instructor this  
year, Merkle and Nelson are taking the class by correspondence -- 
listening to audio tapes and filling out workbooks that get mailed 
off to be graded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have a teacher to say, `When this, then this' or  
explain how to conjugate a verb,'' Merkle said. Added a laughing 
Nelson: ``The rewind button is probably broken on that tape 
recorder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools across the country are having trouble as the number of  
qualified foreign language teachers isn't keeping up with student 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get desperate calls every year from administrators,'' said  
Ed Scebold, executive director of the American Council on the 
Teaching of Foreign Languages. ``A qualified foreign language 
teacher can probably walk next door and get hired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent U.S. Department of Education survey found almost 25  
percent of school districts had difficulty hiring a foreign 
language teacher compared with just 3 percent for an English 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem isn't confined to foreign languages. The Education  
Department estimates 2.2 million new teachers will be needed in the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the shortage is that the number of college  
students who want to teach has remained stable while a large number 
of working teachers are reaching retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois is bracing for a major teacher shortage -- most likely  
in high-level math and science classes, special education and 
languages, said Tom Hernandez, spokesman for the state Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage is most prominent in rural or smaller high schools.  
They often pay less than city or suburban schools, and often don't 
have enough classes to support two foreign language teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened this year at Watseka High School, 75 miles  
south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Mark Doan already had one full-time Spanish teacher.  
But to meet demand, he needed another teacher who could teach 
Spanish half the day and another subject -- like math or English -- 
the other half. 
</P>
<P>
	It proved so difficult a task that the sole Spanish teacher  
added an early-morning class; 50 to 60 students were turned away, 
told to take Spanish next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're competing with bigger schools that pay better. You can't  
blame people for opting for larger pay,'' Doan said. ``But it gets 
frustrating. You have some tense moments because you don't know 
what you're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools have learned to adapt. In elementary schools in  
Iowa and Nebraska, a teacher who doesn't speak a foreign language 
is teamed with a native speaker. Both teach the class. 
</P>
<P>
	For schools that can't find -- or afford -- a foreign language  
teacher, technology offers other options. ``Distance learning'' 
allows a teacher located in one place to interact via satellite, 
audio tape or Internet with students in another. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have no choice but to go to technology in some of these  
instances and then try to provide the assistance to the teacher who 
is using it,'' Scebold said. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes the experiment with technology doesn't work.  
</P>
<P>
	At Paxton-Buckley-Loda High School, Principal Jim Flaherty said  
four of the 15 students who started taking French II in the fall 
dropped the class. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in French for next fall has dropped, while 30 more  
students have signed up for Spanish. French is being phased out, 
though students in the eastern Illinois district who wish to 
continue can use the audio tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson won't be one of them. The junior said the tapes were  
scratchy, sometimes boring, and unhelpful when it came to actually 
learning how to speak French or getting any feedback. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty mourns the shortages -- and the lost teaching  
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age,'' he said, ``kids need to be exposed to  
other languages and cultures.''

<HEADLINE> Papers Promote Diversity in Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Newspapers have long been criticized by minority readers for not  
understanding their concerns or venturing into their communities. 
This week, journalists from around the country are discussing ways 
to change that. 
</P>
<P>
	At The Philadelphia Daily News, a demographer spoke with  
reporters about the changing face of the city. At the Minneapolis 
Star Tribune, minority leaders came in to discuss the fairness of 
coverage. Other newspapers are combing through their pages to 
analyze how they can produce more diverse reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of ``The National Time-Out for Diversity and  
Accuracy,'' a project jointly sponsored by the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors and the Associated Press Managing Editors 
association. APME is an organization of editors at AP member 
newspapers that, among other activities, critiques the AP report. 
</P>
<P>
	David Yarnold, the APME diversity chair and executive editor of  
the San Jose Mercury News in California, said turning the question 
into one of accuracy, rather than simply lecturing journalists on 
morality, is an important way to connect with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It both appeals to the nature of journalists because everybody  
values accuracy highly and it gets past the defenses that 
journalists set up about political correctness and corporate 
mandates,'' he said. Yarnold said at least 140 newspapers are 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	ASNE President N. Christian Anderson, the CEO and publisher of  
The Orange County Register in California, said another issue is 
diversity of newsroom staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to cause people to stop, step back, and think  
about the implications of what a diverse newsroom means to our 
ability to better reflect the communities that we serve in our 
coverage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ASNE has been striving since 1978 to have newsroom staffs  
reflect the ethnic makeup of their communities, and the country as 
a whole, something Anderson says is still far from reality. ``We 
have a very long way to go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Project organizers will get responses from newspapers on what  
they are doing to diversify coverage, then check back to see what 
progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Baldwin, opinion editor of the Iowa City Press-Citizen,  
said it is important to remember that ``we write our stories and 
publish our newspapers not for us, but for readers, and this is 
what readers are saying about the job we are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Stamm, assistant city editor at The Detroit News, said it  
is a matter of journalists ``breaking out of old habits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have Rolodexes ... and we all call up the same old  
usual suspects,'' he said. ``There must be places in our coverage 
area that we simply aren't used to going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Texas, the entire staff has  
been involved in diversity workshops for the past year, said 
Associate Editor Bob Ray Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make sure that our paper represented our  
communities. We wanted to make sure that our staff did,'' he said, 
adding that the difference has been noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pick up any section of our newspaper and you realize that  
this is a community of diverse people,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Associated Press bureaus around the country are also involved in  
the project. In Helena, Mont., AP staff discussed ways to better 
represent the state's Indian community. In Raleigh, N.C., reporters 
focused on working with member newspapers to diversify coverage of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're active in big cities and rural areas, and it's essential  
that our coverage reflect all the aspects of these communities,'' 
said AP Managing Editor Jonathan Wolman. 
</P>
<P>
	APME president Pam Johnson, the vice president of news and  
executive editor at The Arizona Republic, said diversity is 
fundamental to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the good of newspapers, this is important for all  
of us to discuss,'' she said. ``Our credibility is on the line.''

<HEADLINE> KLM Profit Drops 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines posted a  
24 percent profit drop in the latest year, blaming Asia's financial 
crisis and increased competition on its lucrative European and 
North Atlantic routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the results were somewhat below expectations, and  
KLM shares opened 5.4 percent lower early today on the Amsterdam 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Net profit fell to 456 million guilders, or $221 million, from  
603 million guilders a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were virtually steady at 13.33 billion guilders, down from  
13.36 billion guilders a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM said results were hurt by the financial crisis in Asia,  
increased competition, especially on the European and north 
Atlantic routes, and a pilot strike at U.S. partner Northwest 
Airlines last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of uncertainties in the world economy, KLM did not give  
an outlook for fiscal 2000.

<HEADLINE> Discovery To Be Launched May 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA completed repairs to space  
shuttle Discovery's hail-damaged fuel tank on Wednesday and aimed 
for a launch next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle managers set May 27 as the new launch date for the  
transport of 1 1/2 tons of gear to the new international space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA had said Discovery probably would not lift off until the  
Memorial Day weekend, but the weather forecast has improved, 
allowing for the new date. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was returned to the hangar last weekend following a  
hailstorm that punched 648 holes into the foam insulation covering 
the tank. The larger holes were sanded or patched to prevent ice 
from forming when the tank is filled with super-cold fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers feared ice in the cavities could break off during  
liftoff and damage the shuttle.

<HEADLINE> NBA Fines Malone, O'Neal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz and Shaquille  
O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers were fined by the NBA Wednesday 
for their actions in the opening games of the conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was fined $10,000 for elbowing Portland's Brian Grant  
with 3:27 left in the second quarter of their game Tuesday night. 
The Jazz won the game 93-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant and Malone, both of whom talked tough about physical play  
before the series, had two altercations in the first half. Grant 
appeared to trip Malone as he went for a breakaway layup, and 
minutes later, Malone elbowed Grant in the face while going for 
another basket. They exchanged words after the second incident. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was fined $7,500 for failing to leave the court in a  
timely fashion and verbally abusing officials after the Lakers lost 
to the San Antonio Spurs 87-81 on Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mostly lower  
Wednesday, dragged down by jitters over a possible rise in U.S. 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the largest market in Asia, concerns over the rate  
rise pulled the key index down 1.5 percent, setting a trend for 
most markets in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 250.44 points,  
closing at 16,128.18. The average now has fallen a total of 819.18 
points in five days, including Tuesday's 42.40-point drop, or 0.26 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee met Tuesday and decided  
to leave interest rates unchanged, but said it was inclined to 
adopt a tighter monetary policy to curb inflationary pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more  
attractive to investors, but lighten returns on equities and 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar bought 123.70 yen at late  
afternoon, up 0.84 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above 
its late New York level of 123.20 yen overnight. In Wednesday's 
trading, the dollar ranged between 123.25 yen and 124.03 yen, its 
highest intraday level in Tokyo since Nov. 30, 1998, when it traded 
at 124.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, concerns over local and U.S. interest rates pulled  
Hong Kong blue chip share prices down 1.8 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 223.96 points to close at  
12,403.14, its lowest close since April 15. On Tuesday, the index 
gained 38.50 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong interest rates have generally moved in line with U.S.  
rates because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares also closed lower on rate hike fears, dealers  
said. The Straits Times Index closed down 6.32 points, or 0.3 
percent, at 1,911.50 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly higher. The Stock  
Exchange of Thailand, or SET, Index edged up 1.95 points, or 0.4 
percent, to 483.50. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed sharply higher, propelled by  
buying in basic industry and telecommunications blue chips. The JSX 
Composite Index closed up 2.7 percent, or 15.718 points, at 593.604 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower as investors  
cashed in on recent gains. The Composite Index fell 0.6 percent, or 
4.56 points, to 775.73. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks ended sharply lower as investors  
cashed in on recent gains, spurred by concerns over a possible rise 
in U.S. interest rates. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange 
Index closed 77.48 points, or 3.1 percent, lower at 2,390.82. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher for the second consecutive day  
as a rebound continued after last week's sharp declines and 
investors shrugged off the U.S. interest rate news. The Korea 
Composite Stock Price Index rose 5.69 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
734.98. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices ended lower, with nearly all  
industry groupings sagging on the U.S. interest rate news. The All 
Ordinaries Index closed at 2,981.2, down 18.4 points, or 0.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices ended slightly higher as investors moved  
out of commodity-related stocks and into technology issues. The key 
Weighted Price Index closed up 29.09 points, or 0.4 percent, at 
7,614.60. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers  
attributing the fall to weakness in the share price of market 
leaders Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. and Fletcher Challenge 
Ltd.'s Energy division. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 
19.91 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,170.69.

<HEADLINE> Secretary To Be Tried for Fraud </HEADLINE>

	ALFRED, Maine (AP) -- A former church secretary who bilked more

her husband being a spy is competent to stand trial, a judge has

 *After a century, S.C. heads for stock market with pension money    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After more than a century of caution,  
South Carolina's pension funds are headed to the stock market with 
a plan to invest more than $900 million in an index fund before 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Next fiscal year, starting July 1, that will double to $1.8  
billion under the plan approved by the state Budget and Control 
Board on May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1895, after the state was swindled by investments in canal  
and rail project stocks, South Carolina had a constitutional 
provision prohibiting equity investments. Voters changed that three 
years ago to allow stock market investments by the plan that covers 
more than 200,000 teachers, state employees and local government 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The almost $918 million first investment represents about 5  
percent of the South Carolina Retirement System's $18 billion. It 
will be put in a portfolio that tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
Index, according to the plan drawn up by the Retirement System's 
investment advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina eventually wants to invest about 40 percent of  
its retirement fund.

<HEADLINE> Study: Antibiotic Resistance Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jet-setting Americans who eat chicken and meat overseas are  
bringing back resistance to certain antibiotics used to treat 
stomach upset and other bacterial illnesses, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, is the first to link Americans' growing resistance to 
antibiotics primarily to foreign travel. Until now, scientists 
believed resistance was growing largely because doctors were 
overprescribing antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Resistance to the class of antibiotics called quinolones has  
been reported in people in Europe and Asia because of the 
widespread use of antibiotics in poultry and other livestock there, 
but the problem had not been well-documented in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also attributed the problem in part to the growing use  
of antibiotics in chickens in the United States. The Food and Drug 
Administration approved the practice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is definitely a public health problem with using  
quinolones in poultry, and we need to take a hard look at that,'' 
said the study's lead author, Kirk E. Smith, an epidemiologist with 
the Minnesota Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the study should prompt the FDA to adopt more  
stringent guidelines for the use of antibiotics in food animals in 
this country. But he said solving the problem ``is going to take a 
very well-coordinated international effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Washington-based Animal Health Institute,  
which represents producers of health products used in food animals, 
said antibiotics are used sparingly on domestic livestock -- at most 
3 percent of poultry -- and only when prescribed by a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, he said, it's possible people are being exposed to  
antibiotics through other means besides chicken while overseas, 
like water, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know is the relative level of risk from  
contaminated water, animal use, too many prescriptions. We need to 
have some connection,'' said spokesman John Keeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how researchers believe the problem goes from animals to  
humans: 
</P>
<P>
	Chickens and other livestock are given antibiotics in feed and  
drinking water to ward off infections and spur growth. A 
corkscrew-shaped type of bacteria that normally lives in the 
intestines of the animal becomes resistant to the antibiotics over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after animals go to meat-processing plants, some meat can  
remain contaminated with the resistant bacteria. Humans swallow the 
bacteria if the meat is undercooked or contaminates other foods 
during meal preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria bring on gastroenteritis -- that is, diarrhea,  
stomach cramps, fever and malaise. Doctors try to treat the illness 
with antibiotics, but the bacteria have already built up 
resistance, so it's tougher to get rid of. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest research examined 4,953 cases of bacterial infection  
among Minnesota residents between 1992 and 1998. The scientists 
found that the proportion of cases resistant to antibiotic 
treatment increased from 1.3 percent in 1992 to 10.2 percent in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients answered a standardized survey that included questions  
about antibiotic use, foods eaten, contact with animals and their 
travels. The scientists attributed 75 percent of the cases to 
foreign travel, especially to Mexico and especially in winter. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Henrik C. Wegener of the Danish  
Zoonosis Center said physicians and veterinarians should be careful 
not to overprescribe antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasing foreign travel and the internationalization of the  
food trade make the use of antibiotics in food production a public 
health issue of global dimensions,'' Wegener said.

	U.S. Reports Serb Soldiers Deserting  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 500 Serb soldiers have deserted in  
Kosovo, returning to their homes where some of their families are 
demonstrating against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the 
State Department said today. James P. Rubin, a department 
spokesman, cited the desertions as among ``increasing signs that 
Belgrade is feeling the heat'' of NATO airstrikes. Rubin said some 
of the soldiers may have wanted to join their protesting families 
to protect them in the event of government retribution. He said the 
demonstrations were to protest the toll the bombing was taking on 
Yugoslavia.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Daniel Snyder cleared a big hurdle today in  
his bid to own the Washington Redskins, all but ending a dispute 
involving one of the league's most prominent teams. The NFL's 
finance committee voted unanimously to recommend that the team be 
sold to Snyder for a record $800 million. The full ownership votes 
on the sale at a league meeting in Atlanta on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Schools Want To Police Agents Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Don't take money from agents.  
</P>
<P>
	It's one of the most basic rules for an athlete on a college  
campus, one drilled into the minds of players as frequently as the 
nonstop warnings about gambling, drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's nothing stopping players from talking to agents.  
And there seem to be dozens of ways to skirt the rules once the 
parties come in contact. 
</P>
<P>
	It means that anywhere there's an athletic program with a few  
good athletes, almost surely there's a director for compliance 
trying to keep track of which agent, or which agent's runner, is 
contacting which player at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	``As salaries escalate in pro sports, it seems there are more  
sports agents today than there were five or 10 years ago,'' said 
Jamie McCloskey, associate athletic director for compliance at 
Florida. ``That means there are more individuals we need to police. 
Unfortunately, some are more ethical than others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is the latest school to encounter problems, with a sworn  
complaint filed against one agent for allegedly paying players. 
Investigations are ongoing into activities of at least two other 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is hardly alone. Alabama is just shaking off the effects  
of a probation stemming from an agent problem that cropped up six 
years ago. Since then, Florida State's football program has 
encountered problems. So has Connecticut's basketball team. 
Accusations are being investigated at LSU. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime agent Frank Bauer has a reputation for doing things the  
right way. He says most agents are trustworthy, but the ones trying 
to break into the business are at a severe disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got people going out, starting firms representing  
athletes, who have no credentials and no clients,'' Bauer said. 
``So the question is, How do you get that client? When that starts 
up, sometimes they feel like they have to induce a client to go to 
their side. That's when you get a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only agent formally accused of wrongdoing at Florida was  
allegedly involved in something that no school could adequately 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sworn complaint filed by university police, agent Sean  
Alfortish is accused of funneling money to two football players 
through the players' roommate. Neither player was considered a 
major NFL prospect. The roommate likely never made it onto the 
school's radar until the alleged violation occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Enticements can range from beer money, to a couple hundred bucks  
to a several-thousand-dollar advance on future earnings. Some 
agents also dispense advice that directly attacks the integrity of 
the game: don't risk an injury that would jeopardize your pro 
career; get your coach to ``showcase'' you; ask to switch to the 
position NFL scouts want you to play in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Like several other states, Florida has a law against unlicensed  
and illegal agent activity. In March, the NFL Players Association 
approved a bylaw that forced an agent to forfeit any fee he would 
receive if he is proven to have offered an illegal inducement to 
earn a player's business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an example of more attention being paid to the problem  
by people who want to clean this thing up,'' said Tom DePaso, staff 
counsel for the NFLPA. ``I don't know if the problem has grown 
worse in the last four or five years, but there's a lot more 
attention being paid to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Often, the agent never even has to show up on campus to make an  
impact. The inducement can be funneled through a runner, sometimes 
a student or friend of a player. 
</P>
<P>
	That simply increases the list of people schools try to monitor.  
Because it is such a vast group, some believe it will take more 
than a new law or two to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic issue is you have kids who are being exploited by  
the schools,'' said Leonard Mungo, an attorney for agent Tank 
Black, who is being investigated, but has not been charged, by 
Florida and the NFLPA. 
</P>
<P>
	``These players know what they're worth and they know the  
schools are taking advantage,'' Mungo said. ``Then, you have 900 
agents out there looking to sign 240 players who get drafted. Not 
every agent can afford to play by the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey knows that. And he knows he's not the only one who is  
squirming as the list of new agents, and new accusations, continues 
to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an issue at Florida and nowhere else, it would  
probably be a good thing for athletics as a whole,'' he said. ``But 
it's an issue that has potential to be a problem on many different 
campuses. And it's getting harder to control every day.''

<HEADLINE> Young Bruins Setting Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Getting eliminated in the second round left the  
Boston Bruins short of their playoff goal. Getting that far, 
though, was a sign of how far they've come in just two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Burns took over as coach of a team that had the NHL's worst  
record in 1996-97 and led it to the first round, where it lost to 
Washington last season. 
</P>
<P>
	And this season, he brought the Bruins into the second round,  
where they were knocked out Tuesday night with a 3-2 loss in 
Buffalo that gave the Sabres the series, four games to two. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're on the right course,'' Burns said Wednesday. ``The ship  
was going the wrong way. Now it's going the right way. Now we need 
to make sure the right sailors are on board and we're tying the 
right knots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, still led by Ray Bourque, is solid. Goalie Byron  
Dafoe had an outstanding season. Joe Thornton, who struggled as a 
rookie after being taken with the first pick of the 1997 draft, 
blossomed this season, although 1998 NHL rookie of the year Sergei 
Samsonov faltered in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins could use an extra scorer or two and some more  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can grow together as a team,'' said 24-year-old wing Anson  
Carter, who had a career-high 24 goals. ``It will be that much more 
rewarding when we reach the pinnacle because everyone comes from 
the same beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bourque may not be around to get there.  
</P>
<P>
	At 38, he just completed his 20th season and is a candidate for  
his sixth Norris Trophy as the NHL's best defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he still hasn't won a Stanley Cup. He said Wednesday he  
will play out the final year of his contract next season before 
deciding whether to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my best years are behind me. I know that I didn't have  
my best series against Buffalo,'' he said. ``I'll be around next 
year and you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston struggled into the second half of the season and was  
22-24-9 on Feb. 18. But it was 17-6-4 in its remaining 27 games and 
beat Carolina, four games to two, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final six weeks, we did everything to get us into the  
first round and we fought to get through the first round,'' Burns 
said, ``but then we couldn't get through the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins won the opener of the Buffalo series. But the Sabres  
won three straight before Boston stayed alive with a 5-3 win Sunday 
in which Dominik Hasek allowed four goals in two periods. The NHL's 
best goalie was in form in the Sabres' clinching win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they're better. They played with more  
desire,'' said Dafoe, who led the league with 10 shutouts and was 
third in goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Harry Sinden questioned the team's effort and  
criticized Jason Allison, his top regular-season scorer, and Dmitri 
Khristich, who led the team in goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Khristich was a total, total disappointment,'' Sinden said  
after the final game. ``I don't think Allison was the player he was 
last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with Allison, Carter, Samsonov and Thornton, the Bruins have  
the potential to become more of an offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us have to get better each year,'' said the 19-year-old  
Thornton, who did that this season when he was Boston's fifth 
leading scorer and added three goals in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 27th straight season, the Bruins failed to win the  
Stanley Cup. But they're much closer than they were two years ago 
when they were the league's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys don't have experience going through rounds and  
winning rounds,'' Bourque said, but ``it was a successful season 
because a lot of guys battled and took on bigger roles and we'll 
need that in years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Border Blurrs Between US and Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Each morning, Pedro LaFarga leaves his tidy  
Southern California suburb, crosses the world's busiest border, 
drives through the squalid fringe of Mexico's sixth-largest city 
and arrives for work at a factory as modern as any in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably as binational and bicultural as you get,'' said  
LaFarga, 32, a dual national who lives in Chula Vista, Calif., and 
works at an electronics assembly plant a half-hour away in Tijuana, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also increasingly common.  
</P>
<P>
	Social scientists call them transnationals or, in Spanish,  
transfronterizos. They are the millions of Mexicans and Americans 
who traverse the border so frequently and casually that they have 
cross-pollinated the cultures into a region with its own identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing interdependence -- highlighted by Mexican President  
Ernesto Zedillo's visit today to businesses in San Diego -- is a 
phenomenon that started 150 years ago. But it received a powerful 
boost from the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, said Oscar 
J. Martinez, a history professor at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of goods and services traded between the two countries  
has more than doubled to $173.7 billion since 1993. Mexico ranks as 
the United States' third-largest trading partner, behind Canada and 
Japan, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place else in the world that has as many people  
participating in a transnational society,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 94 million people legally crossed the border into  
California in 1998, up from 91 million a year earlier, the U.S. 
Customs Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	They come to shop, work, visit relatives, attend business  
meetings or just to go to the movies. And they come despite the 
well-publicized U.S. effort to stanch the flow of illegal 
immigrants and drug smugglers by tightening its border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost feel like I'm in Mexico here,'' Silvia Castillo, a  
high school teacher from the Mexican state of Nayarit, said at a 
Kmart in San Ysidro, Calif. ``Everyone speaks Spanish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of this trend is everywhere in the four U.S. states --  
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas -- and six Mexican states 
along the 2,000-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
	Billboards in Spanish urge residents of the northeastern Mexican  
city of Monterrey to shop at malls in Texas. Signs in English along 
the highway of Mexico's Baja peninsula hawk beachfront getaways. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio and television stations on both sides of the border  
include the wait time at checkpoints in their traffic reports. 
Spanish-language pop music is increasingly heard in the United 
States, and American pop music, as always, permeates the airwaves 
to the south. The San Diego Padres sold 40,000 tickets in Tijuana 
during the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Tijuana residents are expected to cross the border  
this week just to see ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace,'' said Kevin Cottrell, who studies relations between the 
two countries as associate director of San Diego Dialogue, a public 
policy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixing extends to high culture. Howard Cohen, president of  
an American furniture manufacturer with a plant in Mexico, said he 
often sees acquaintances at the San Diego Symphony one night and at 
a Tijuana art exhibit the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, some 58,000 vehicles enter San Diego County through  
the San Ysidro and nearby Otay Mesa checkpoints. Northbound traffic 
snarls in the morning, southbound in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely there are more controls at the border, for the  
drugs and migrants, but I've never had any problems,'' said Jesus 
Limon, an accountant from Tijuana who crosses two or three times a 
month, mostly to shop. ``I feel very comfortable here.''

<HEADLINE> NY School Rejects Early Start Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROSS RIVER, N.Y. (AP) -- Taxpayers voted down a proposition that  
would have allowed high schoolers to get 40 extra minutes of sleep 
each morning. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2,142 to 1,898, voters in the Katonah-Lewisboro school  
district in northern Westchester refused Tuesday to spend $1.33 
million for new buses that would have enabled the high school to 
delay its starting time from 7:15 a.m. to 7:55 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Some sleep experts said forcing adolescents to get up at about  
5:30 a.m. ignores their natural body rhythms and hurts their 
performance. Several school districts around the country have moved 
away from early start times. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents also objected to having their children wait for  
buses in the cold and dark on winter school days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just common sense,'' said Sharon Ballen, also of Katonah.  
``Children shouldn't be standing with flashlights at bus stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, when state aid was cut back and some buses were sold  
off, students have been crawling out of bed at 5:30 a.m. to wait 
for buses that serve first the high school, then elementary and 
middle schools. At John Jay School some students have to eat lunch 
shortly after 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents noted that the schools are already high-achieving.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're sitting in calculus or advanced-placement bio at 7:15  
in the morning,'' said Superintendent Karen McCarthy. ``At 9:30 
they're eating spaghetti or pizza, God help us.''

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Spot Storm on Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cyclone four times the size of Texas raged  
across the northern polar region of the planet Mars last month, 
according to space telescope views of the red planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Space Telescope Science Institute announced today that the  
Hubble Space Telescope on April 27 spotted an immense Martian storm 
cloud, made up of water ice, that was 1,100 miles long and 900 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Bands of clouds spiraled in a counterclockwise motion around a  
200-mile wide eye in the center of the storm, taking on a shape 
that resembled hurricanes on Earth, astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm occurred during the summer in Mars' northern  
hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming evaporated the carbon 
dioxide ice sheet that caps the Martian north pole during part of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm  
spotted 20 years ago by the Viking Orbiter spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers used a wide field planetary camera on Hubble to  
photograph Mars during the planet's closest approach to Earth in 
nearly eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the  
storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm 
appeared to be in the process of breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
	Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm,  
and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Microsoft Browser Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a turnaround, almost 60 percent of  
companies in a survey released Wednesday say they now use 
Microsoft's Internet browser, an important trend that could be a 
Pyrrhic victory for the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp.'s aggressive push to persuade consumers to use  
its Internet software rather than one made by rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. is at the core of the government's antitrust 
trial, scheduled to resume June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey in October from the same research company -- cited as  
evidence in the trial -- indicated that 60 percent of companies used 
Netscape's software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden told the judge that the earlier  
survey ``completely undermines the government's case.'' Lawyers 
also cited the earlier results two other times as they challenged 
government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new survey from Zona Research Inc. of 308 corporate  
technology professionals showed that 59 percent identified 
Microsoft's browser as the one they ``personally use the most at 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results put Microsoft in the awkward position of playing  
down a survey that trumpets the company's own success. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan argued that the results show  
only which browser the professionals used personally, not 
necessarily which browser was used by all employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survey also said more than two-thirds of the companies  
encourage or require all employees to use specific Internet 
software, and that of those, 62 percent encourage or require the 
use of Microsoft's browser over Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply offering choice, and the best product  
winning,'' Cullinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the results support the government's allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It reconfirms the underlying facts of the case, and the  
problems and the tactics shown,'' said Ed Black, president of the 
Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group 
that has been critical of Microsoft. ``Microsoft has always made 
the point, you have to have real damage (to Netscape). Here's 
obviously real damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape early on targeted companies as its prime market for  
browser sales. Companies' software managers recognized Netscape as 
an Internet pioneer, and a 1996 Zona survey found more than 70 
percent of companies used Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet Explorer generally has been more popular  
among consumers at home, especially since the company began 
bundling its browser within Windows, the operating system used to 
run most of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which released a new version of its browser in March,  
also enjoys unusual popularity for its browser among home consumers 
because America Online distributes Microsoft's Web software to all 
its more than 18 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL recently purchased Netscape, but is contractually obligated  
to continue distributing Microsoft's browser until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Zona said its survey was taken of 308 randomly selected  
technology professionals who have software purchasing 
responsibilities, and whose companies have at least 20 employees 
and $1 million in revenues.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Tickets a Job Perk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Star Wars'' is finally here.  
</P>
<P>
	After months of relentless hype, fans stood in theater lines  
across the country on Wednesday as the latest installment of the 
space saga opened across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Theaters scheduled round-the-clock showings and some companies  
decided not to fight the Force -- they sent their employees to ``The 
Phantom Menace,'' which was on schedule to shatter Hollywood 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be  
fun to send our whole company,'' said Steven J. Lund, president and 
CEO of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and  
one guest each for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' 
which opened at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday after years of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	No official box office figures were available for the early  
showings, but movie analysts expected the movie to easily top $100 
million by the end of the five-day opening frame on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-day opening window, ``Menace'' was expected to beat  
the opening record of $90.2 million set by ``Lost World: Jurassic 
Park'' in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Menace'' also will be competing against its ancestors. The  
original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all time. Counting its 
various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in tickets 
domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 million, No. 
7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes Back'' has made 
$290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't get ``Star Wars'' tickets as a company  
perk, there were long lines outside the nation's theaters, dozens 
of which scheduled around-the-clock showings to accommodate crowds. 
</P>

	Brad Fyfe, wearing the brown robe of a Jedi master, was shaking  
and nearly unable to speak after emerging from a 3:30 a.m. 
screening Wednesday at Hollywood's Mann's Chinese Theater, where 
the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to see it again today,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The mainly male, 20-something audience that packed the theater  
for the 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. shows raved about George Lucas' 
$115 million prequel to the famed ``Star Wars'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so awesome. I think I'm going to hit double digits, and  
see it at least 10 times,'' said Larry Crouse, 24, who also wore a 
Jedi costume. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waite Park in central Minnesota, Mike Kunkel stood in line  
for more than 12 hours to get his ticket to the midnight showing. 
The 19-year-old Kunkel said he and his friend planned to see the 
movie repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding like a Jedi master, he summed up his philosophy this  
way: ``The first time to see it. The second time to notice things. 
And the third time to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans' raves were a far cry from most of the nation's movie  
critics, who have overwhelmingly panned the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were fears of mass labor shortages due to ``Star  
Wars,'' companies with big Force fans -- particularly computer and 
electronics firms -- reported no serious problems, due in part to 
lots of understanding from management. 
</P>
<P>
	At River Park Computer Group, a consulting company in San Jose,  
all five so-called ``home and small office gurus'' said they would 
be pulling a Silicon Valley Skywalker Walk-Out during the next day 
or two, said owner Frank Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared for no one to be here,'' he said. ``I'm going  
myself.''

<HEADLINE> New LPGA Tourney Missing Some Stars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Before the first LPGA tournament in Texas  
in 13 years even begins, organizers already are saying ``Wait until 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field for the Philips Invitational Honoring Harvey Penick  
includes just six of the tour's top 20 money winners -- and none of 
the current major champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish we could have them all, but we'll still have a great  
tournament,'' said tournament director John Albertson. ``I think 
our event can be really special next year. I expect you'll see 95 
percent of the top 20 players here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the Philips' problem is timing. The U.S. Open starts  
June 3 and many players want two weeks off to gear up for that 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those staying away from the 72-hole, $800,000 event that  
starts Thursday are leading money winner Karrie Webb and Annika 
Sorenstam, who is third in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Meg Mallon, the second-leading money winner, said she's using  
this event as a final tune-up for the U.S. Open. She'll spend next 
week with her instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a less-than-stellar field in Austin, Mallon notes  
there are still elite players such as Beth Daniel, Laura Davies and 
Juli Inkster, who is fourth on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of talent out here,'' Mallon said. ``It's up to  
us, the ones who are here, to get the word out what a really great 
place this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mallon said she understands the she and Inkster are the  
favorites for the first full-field LPGA tournament in Texas since 
the Mazda Hall of Fame Championship in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting position to be in,'' said Mallon, who won  
last weekend's final Sara Lee Classic, boosting her 1999 winnings 
to $401,008. ``It's been nice to be out to such a fast start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mallon will have to learn the tour's latest course during the  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday morning, Mallon said she had played only 10  
holes at the Onion Creek Club, the club that hosted the first 
Legends of Golf tournament and helped give birth to the men's 
Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, she thought the layout made it a shot-maker's course.  
That opinion has changed after rain early this week made the 
fairways softer and longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the rain helped a lot,'' Mallon said. ``It's always  
interesting to come to a golf course for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is a tribute to former Austin resident Penick,  
one of golf's all-time great instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	As pro at Austin Country Club, his pupils included two-time  
Masters champion Ben Crenshaw; U.S. Open winner Tom Kite; Kathy 
Whitworth, winner of 88 tournaments; Mickey Wright and Betsy Rawls. 
Penick died in 1995.

<HEADLINE>  UN Views Results of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Half-finished Yugo cars hang from  
a huge assembly line under gaping holes in the roof. Sheet metal 
dangles from the walls, flapping in the breeze. The nearby foundry 
is a blackened skeleton of twisted metal and ruined machinery, grim 
evidence of the destructive might of NATO air power. 
</P>
<P>
	Little wonder that Yugoslav officials were anxious for a U.N.  
inspection team to visit the wreckage of the 140-year-old Zastava 
plant, once the pride of Yugoslav industry and maker of cars that 
even the United States once imported. 
</P>
<P>
	Now local officials say the plant has been blasted out of  
business -- and its 36,000 employees put out of work -- by NATO 
airstrikes, devastating the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to God it stops soon,'' Mayor Veroljub Stevanovic said  
of the bombing campaign, now in its eighth week. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory in Kragujevac, 62 miles south of Belgrade, was among  
the first stops Wednesday for the U.N. team. Its members are 
supposed to assess the scale of the humanitarian crisis gripping 
Yugoslavia and what might be needed when the fighting stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The group later was to visit the war-ravaged Serbian province of  
Kosovo, where NATO says Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 
refusal to stop the violent and brutal expulsion of ethnic 
Albanians is what prompted allied bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``economic and social catastrophe'' was the somber assessment  
by U.N. team leader Sergio Viera de Mello after viewing the 
destruction at the Zastava plant, which made cars, trucks, parts, 
farm machinery and light weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated, angry locals standing outside the plant didn't  
hesitate to lob some verbal strikes toward the foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do they want?'' asked Goran Dulic, 26. ``They are  
cuddling us with one hand and beating us with the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zastava officials said the plant was hit by 20 missiles over a  
period of two days in early April. Drajan Srejovic, Zastava's vice 
president, said the damage amounted to about $1 million. A heating 
plant that served the town was also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was killed in the attack, but plant officials said 124  
people were injured, 24 seriously. NATO said it struck Zastava to 
destroy an ammunition plant within the factory. The Zastava 
``special purpose'' plant used to be the state arsenal and the main 
producer of infantry weapons and artillery pieces in former 
Communist-run Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	That made little difference to local residents.  
</P>
<P>
	``What has the Yugo to do with Kosovo?'' one local journalist  
asked aloud, referring to the little car that often was the butt of 
jokes in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	De Mello sought to remind his hosts that the key to ending their  
woes lay in resolving the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it must remain clear what the central problem is,'' he  
said. ``Once that solution is found, the rest will follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier meeting with Kragujevac's mayor, de Mello said the  
team was looking at what would be needed to rehabilitate 
agricultural and basic services before winter ``so as to reduce the 
suffering as a result of these conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy mayor in charge of health and social policy for  
children and refugees, Vesna Pajevic, said the bombing ``has had a 
horrendous impact'' on the city's children. ``All of a sudden 
they're experiencing in reality all the things they saw only in 
films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of psychologists have been organized to work with the  
children, who ``are asking 1,000 things we cannot answer,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone had hung a small poster on the door of the city hall  
showing a skull in a U.N. helmet, with a caption that read: ``This 
photo shows that the U.N. is no better than NATO.'' A member of the 
U.N. team took it with him.

<HEADLINE> NFLPA Files Complaint Against Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NFL Players Association filed a  
disciplinary complaint Wednesday against agent William ``Tank'' 
Black, who, in turn, plans to petition the U.S. Attorney's office 
to investigate the union's action. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA, through its agent disciplinary committee, alleged  
that Black provided improper cash payments in 1997 and 1998 to 
college players before their eligibility was completed. The 
complaint also claimed Black acquired new autos in 1998 for players 
before their college eligibility expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my biggest priorities as NFLPA president,'' said Miami  
Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong, ``has been to crack down on 
agents who violate the rules and damage the players' best 
interests. We are anxious to see what Mr. Black has to say about 
these charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black must answer the complaint within 30 days, under NFLPA  
regulations. He took a step toward doing so by threatening a 
lawsuit, along with his planned petition to the U.S. Attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely and categorically deny the allegations raised by  
the NFLPA,'' said Leonard Mungo, Black's lawyer, ``and look forward 
to responding to each and every one. It remains our intention to 
file a lawsuit in federal district court'' asking the court to take 
jurisdiction over the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic case of the fox watching the hen house,''  
Mungo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mungo questioned the involvement of the University of Florida,  
which along with the players association and the Southeastern 
Conference are investigating allegations that Black illegally 
recruited college players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also petition the U.S. Attorney's office to  
investigate the impropriety of a private agency such as the NFLPA 
using the police powers of the state (of Florida) to violate a 
citizen's constitutional and civil rights. In our opinion, the 
NFLPA has acted unlawfully by exploiting and abusing the police 
powers of a state agency -- the University of Florida -- and the 
state attorney's office to violate Mr. Black's due process and 
other civil rights under the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based agent Ray Anderson accused Black in January of  
offering LSU assistant coach Mike Haywood $10,000 to secure 
defensive lineman Anthony McFarland as a client. Black has denied 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida campus police are investigating possible violations of  
state recruiting laws involving Jevon Kearse, Reggie McGrew, Johnny 
Rutledge and Mike Peterson. Kearse and McGrew were first-round 
picks, while Peterson and Rutledge were second-round selections. 
</P>
<P>
	All recently left Black, which Mungo said cost Black at least  
$650,000 -- money the lawyer said he would try to recover once the 
investigations are complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our board passed a resolution in March which states that any  
agent who has offered improper inducements to a player is not 
entitled to collect a fee for negotiating that player's NFL 
contract,'' union general counsel Richard Berthelsen said.

<HEADLINE> Roy, Forsberg Help Avs Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- For two years, Colorado languished in the shadow  
of the Detroit Red Wings, watching enviously as they supplanted the 
Avalanche as Stanley Cup champions and then won back-to-back 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no three-peat for the Red Wings, however, as the  
Avalanche finally vanquished their bitter rivals in six games in 
the Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	After spotting Detroit a 2-0 series lead, the Avalanche won four  
in a row. Now, they face the team with the best regular-season 
record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado will meet the Dallas Stars in Game 1 of the conference  
finals on Saturday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long couple of years for us,'' Avalanche  
defenseman Adam Foote said, ``but that's over for us against that 
team now. It's just very, very sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Forsberg scored two goals as the Avalanche beat Detroit  
5-2 Tuesday night to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Forsberg clearly justified his new $30 million  
contract with his all-around play in the last four games, it was 
goalie Patrick Roy who was the catalyst for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, whose 12th career playoff shutout led Colorado to a 3-0  
victory in Game 5 in Denver on Sunday, made 35 saves Tuesday night, 
many of them brilliant when the game was close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an awesome feeling, coming back from 0-2,'' Forsberg  
said. ``Everybody's been stepping up, from the last guy to the 
first guy. And Patrick's been great in net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs coach Bob Hartley agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick is Patrick,'' Hartley said. ``He was outstanding. I'm  
not surprised with the way he played. I grew up around Montreal and 
I saw him win with the Canadiens (Stanley Cup titles in 1986 and 
1993). I saw him win a Stanley Cup with the Avalanche (1996). He's 
rock solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Colorado lost the first two games of the series at home  
and appeared on the verge of being swept, Roy stopped 146 of 153 
shots as Colorado won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win four straight against Detroit -- I didn't think it was  
possible, to be honest,'' Roy said. ``But we had no choice. We put 
ourselves in a really bad position, losing those two games in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great comeback for us, being down 2-0. We took it one  
game at a time and played some great hockey. We won three games in 
Detroit, and it's not every team that can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blessed with talented skaters and puck-handlers, the Avalanche  
faltered early in the series with Detroit when they tried to get 
fancy, making too many passes or attempting the highlight-video 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played simple hockey,'' Roy said. ``That's how we won this  
series. It was a good series, and great for us to beat that team. 
They were the Stanley Cup champions, and we beat them. It feels 
good, but now we've got another series against another very tough 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley called the Stars ``a great hockey club. They are the  
regular-season champions and they're going to be a great challenge 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the bad blood that has defined Colorado-Detroit meetings  
since 1996, the Red Wings were gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose four straight like we did, you can't say the other  
team was lucky,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it as we underachieved,'' Red Wings captain  
Steve Yzerman said. ``Or you can look at it as we got beat by a 
great team. I choose to look at it as Colorado played fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made great adjustments from the first two games to the  
last four. Their top players played very well at both ends of the 
rink. Joe Sakic was excellent on penalty killing, on faceoffs, and 
he did all the little things well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got production from all four lines, their defense is good  
and their goaltender was very solid. They did all the things 
through the last four games that are necessary, not just to beat 
good teams, but to win the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While only 2-4 at home during the postseason this year, the Avs  
can take comfort in the fact they're 6-0 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Stars' 51-19-12 regular-season record, Colorado  
compiled a 2-1-1 record against them. Dallas defeated St. Louis in 
six games to advance to the next round.

<HEADLINE> Ferraro Benefit Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fund-raiser featuring President Clinton that  
was organized to pay off Geraldine Ferraro's campaign debt was 
canceled due to dismal ticket sales 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ferraro said sales were poor because her supporters had  
already contributed the maximum allowed under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has nothing to do with the president -- he's a sweetie for  
offering to do this,'' Ms. Ferraro said Tuesday. ``I don't think 
it's him. I don't think it's me. I don't think it's Sen. Schumer,'' 
who was also scheduled to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit had been scheduled for Wednesday evening in New  
York. Organizers had hoped to have 400 people attend at $1,000 a 
head, but only about 100 people had bought tickets, according to 
Patricia Evert, the event producer who was putting the dinner 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ferraro still has about $1 million in unpaid bills from her  
unsuccessful bid to become a 1998 Democratic candidate for U.S. 
Senate. She lost in the primary to Charles Schumer, who went on to 
defeat Republican Alfonse D'Amato and capture the seat.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic OKs 'Principles' of Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic accepted elements of a Kosovo peace plan Wednesday, but 
insisted in talks with a Russian envoy that the details must be 
negotiated directly with the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	That would appear to fall short of Western conditions for  
halting the eight-week bombing campaign -- unequivocal acceptance of 
the international plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the envoy flew out of the Yugoslav capital late  
Wednesday night, NATO warplanes launched their strongest attack in 
two weeks against the Belgrade area. Local media and witnesses said 
a hospital near a Belgrade military barracks was hit, killing at 
least three people. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run news agency Tanjug said an operating room in the  
hospital was demolished and that rescuers were evacuating infants 
and pregnant women from the maternity ward. Witnesses said the 
hospital's neurological building was directly hit and an intensive 
care unit was leveled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulances raced to the area to ferry victims to other hospitals  
from the two units, which were reduced to empty, smoking shells, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish ambassador's residence, located near the hospital,  
was also damaged when the blast from an explosion around 200 yards 
away blew out a few windows and a door, a Swedish Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	State-controlled media said airstrikes elsewhere in Serbia  
earlier in the day killed six people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin gave no indication of a  
breakthrough after nearly eight hours of talks with Milosevic, 
telling Russian reporters afterwards that it was ``most important 
to return Yugoslavia to the negotiating table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said any peace deal must be based on a plan put forward two  
weeks ago by the Group of Eight nations, which comprise the world's 
top industrialized countries and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting, Chernomyrdin urged NATO and Belgrade to halt  
the bombing and the military operations in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief statement from Milosevic's office said ``the solution  
could be found only politically and within the U.N. and with direct 
participation of Yugoslavia, starting from the G-8 principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those demands include a total withdrawal of Serb forces from  
Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has so far rejected demands that the security force be  
armed. And the G-8 itself is divided over the plan's call for an 
``international security presence'' to police any agreement. The 
United States says that means an armed military force with NATO at 
its core. The Russians have not accepted that definition. It also 
does not define the size of a Serb withdrawal from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin was next to meet U.S. Deputy Secretary of State  
Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari in Moscow on 
Thursday to brief them on the Belgrade meeting. The three met 
Tuesday and earlier Wednesday in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the State Department said it was waiting to hear  
Chernomyrdin's report before reacting. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO demands for peace are similar to those of the G-8:  
withdrawal of Milosevic's 40,000-strong Serb forces, the return of 
nearly 800,000 ethnic Albanians who have been driven out by 
``ethnic cleansing'' or fled, and the deployment of a well-armed 
international peacekeeping force with NATO at its core. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, envoys from the G-8 group gathered in Bonn to try to  
draw up a U.N. resolution codifying their peace plan. After 12 
hours of talks, delegates said they were still divided on some 
details -- particularly the makeup of an international force. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that Milosevic and the Belgrade authorities  
understand NATO's resolve,'' White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said in Washington. ``I think you are seeing almost any 
place you look now signs of problems for Milosevic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said there was increasing opposition to  
Milosevic's handling of the Kosovo crisis, saying as many as 500 
Serb soldiers have deserted in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In reports of new dissent, an independent newspaper, Glas  
Javnosti, said protest rallies in the southern city of Krusevac 
occurred for the second straight day Tuesday by families of men 
drafted to serve in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by the army garrison command in Krusevac condemned  
organizers of the protests as ``traitors'' and accused them of 
``undermining the defense of the country and collaboration with the 
enemy.'' Local sources said six were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters are barred from traveling outside Belgrade without  
government permission, and the reports could not be independently 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said the protests took  
place, adding on Austrian radio that people do ``not want to die 
blindly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials have spoken of growing dissent in Yugoslavia over  
Milosevic's handling of the Kosovo crisis, but his government 
insists the country is fully united behind him in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade says it has started withdrawing troops from Kosovo, but  
NATO officials say there is no evidence of a significant pullout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enemy is now trying to find among us supporters of  
capitulation and traitors,'' the Krusevac command's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO strikes on Belgrade late Wednesday also targeted the  
suburbs of Rakovica and Batajnica, where a key military airport is 
located. Also reportedly hit were industrial zones in Baric, about 
12 miles southeast of Belgrade and Sabac, 30 miles west, the 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong detonation was heard in the plush Belgrade district of  
Dedinje, the area where Milosevic lives and works, when NATO 
missiles hit an army barracks there, Serbian media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Strikes earlier in the day caused huge damage as well as deaths,  
Yugoslav media reported. Four people died in an attack on an office 
building in Gnjilane, a Kosovo town 25 miles southeast of the 
capital, Pristina, Tanjug, the state-controlled news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two prisoners were killed and two inmates and a guard were  
injured when NATO jets attacked a jail in Istok, northwestern 
Kosovo, the Serb Media Center reported in the provincial capital, 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media also said alliance planes bombed an abandoned  
hotel in Pec, in the western part of the province, injuring four 
employees at an adjacent brewery. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reported attacks, 25 missiles slammed into Raska in  
the fiercest attack yet on the southern Serbian city. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO campaign began March 24, 13 months after Milosevic's  
forces clamped down on Kosovo, killing at least 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 100 men in black leather jackets hurled stones and eggs at  
the headquarters of the main opposition Democratic Party, which has 
been castigated for opposing Milosevic's repression of ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo. Protesters dispersed when police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, in a hint of seeking peace, Yugoslav Foreign  
Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic said Belgrade is ready ``to cut 
a deal'' as long as the country's ``territorial integrity'' is 
preserved -- meaning no independence for Kosovo, a province of 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Macedonia, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited  
Stenkovec, the largest ethnic Albanian refugee camp, where he was 
cheered by refugees and expressed hopes for peace soon in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The second train of refugees in two days arrived at the  
Macedonian border. U.N. aid officials said nearly 2,500 people 
arrived over the previous 24 hours following a several day lull.

	BARRINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- A couple beset by complaints after they  
bought an extra house near their son's high school just so he could 
have a place to park are letting a support group for single mothers 
use the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Chilakamarri Yeshwant, an oncologist, and his wife,  
Akhileswari, an internist, bought a $157,000 bungalow near 
Barrington High School so their son, Srinu, could park his new 
truck in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	The family lives in a larger home in South Barrington. With the  
parking place at the bungalow, Srinu can sleep later because he 
doesn't have to fight for a spot in the school lot. 
</P>
<P>
	But neighbors said they resented how the house was nothing but a  
parking lot for the boy and five of his friends. Town officials 
began investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset by the negative publicity, the Yeshwants agreed to lease  
the house for free to a not-for-profit agency called Women in Need 
Growing Stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors seemed to approve of the plan. And Susie Duboe-Bryant,  
president of the women's group, said Srinu -- but not his friends -- 
can still park in the driveway.

<HEADLINE> TV Blamed in Fiji Teens Eating Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Symptoms of eating disorders have increased  
fivefold among teen-age girls on Fiji since television came to the 
Pacific island nation, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The year TV was widely introduced in Fiji in 1995, only 3  
percent of girls reported they vomited to control their weight, 
according to the study by Harvard researcher Anne Becker. Three 
years later, 15 percent reported the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look to television characters as role models,'' said  
Becker, who presented her findings Wednesday at the American 
Psychiatric Association annual meeting in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's an everyday concept to Americans, reshaping the  
body is a new concept to Fijians,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Becker cautioned that the study does not establish a  
definitive link between television and eating disorders, she said 
the increases were dramatic in a culture that traditionally has 
focused on the importance of eating well and looking robust. 
</P>
<P>
	Other warning signs were high in the follow-up study in 1998,  
with 74 percent of the Fijian girls reporting feeling ``too big or 
fat'' at least sometimes and 62 percent reporting dieting in the 
past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, Fijians call noticeable weight loss ``going  
thin,'' and see it as an alarming sign of illness or lack of 
resources, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiji has only one TV channel, which shows mostly American,  
Australian and British programs. Favorites include ``Melrose 
Place,'' ``ER'' and ``Xena: Warrior Princess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One girl in the study said the teen-agers on television are  
``slim and very tall'' and that, ``We want our bodies to become 
like that ... so we try to lose a lot of weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the study, a total of 129 girls ages 15 to 19 were  
interviewed, said Becker, head of research at the Harvard Eating 
Disorders Center and assistant professor of medical anthropology at 
Harvard Medical School. Researchers surveyed 64 girls in 1995 and 
65 in 1998 and did not track individuals over the three-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift by young people away from an acceptance of heaviness  
comes as Fijians and other South Pacific peoples battle problems 
brought on by a high-fat, high-volume diet, like pig meat and 
calorie-dense root foods like yams, cassava and taro. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker also found that 84 percent of village women in the  
study's sample were overweight or obese, and New Zealand's National 
Heart Foundation has said more than 70 percent of Pacific Islanders 
suffer from health problems related to bad diet, including heart 
disease, obesity and the highest diabetes incident rate in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Television, however, is just one part of the cultural change  
taking place on the once-isolated island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is part and parcel of this rapid change and  
exposure to global values and media images,'' she said. ``In a 
community such as Fiji, adolescents are particularly vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to emulate a lifestyle: Western-style clothes,  
haircuts and slim bodies,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lil Nguyen at Stanford University said the findings don't  
surprise her. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very possibly a correlation between how the media  
portrays women and how it affects the value girls place on their 
bodies,'' said Nguyen, who works with young women who have eating 
disorders. She had not seen the Harvard study.

<HEADLINE> Washington State Players Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Washington State starting running back  
Kevin Brown and two teammates were charged Wednesday with 
residential burglary and theft by the Whitman County prosecutor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, Jason M. White and Ramin J. White, who are not related,  
will be arraigned on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were arrested early Sunday morning for investigation  
of burglary and theft at a student's apartment. They are free on 
their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested after witnesses said they saw them enter  
an apartment through an unlocked back door and leave with a laptop 
computer and other electronics gear, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said $1,900 worth of electronics equipment was recovered,  
including 72 compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Price and athletic director Rick Dickson have  
declined to comment on the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 20, of West Covina, Calif., was the Cougars' top  
offensive threat last season, rushing for 1,046 yards, a sophomore 
team record. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramin White, 19, will be a freshman and Jason White, 20, will be  
a sophomore this coming season. Ramin White is a Cougars running 
back and Jason White is a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The players each face six to 12 months in jail if convicted of  
the felony counts.

<HEADLINE> 'Ally McBeal' Spinoff Created </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Could there be an Ally Lite?  
</P>
<P>
	David E. Kelley, creator of the hit Fox series ``Ally McBeal,''  
said Tuesday that he began pushing for a half-hour spinoff after 
experimenting with the editing of the original. 
</P>
<P>
	The new series would feature the same characters, cast and  
theme: an unconventional Boston law firm filled with attorneys who 
break into song in the unisex bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But the spinoff would consist of unused and repeat footage shot  
for the hour-long series, as well as new scenes, all edited into 
half-hour stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it's going to happen,'' Kelley said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the original series intermixes drama with zaniness, the  
freestanding spinoff would have a distinctively comic bent, with 
its stories set in the firm and after hours. There would be no 
court scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which unveils its fall prime-time schedule Thursday,  
declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Dean Resigns Over Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The dean of Harvard Divinity School was  
forced to step down after pornography was found on his 
university-owned computer, Harvard sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university asked Ronald F. Thiemann to resign last fall for  
``conduct unbecoming'' after President Neil L. Rudenstine learned 
of the situation, The Boston Globe reported Wednesday. Two 
university sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed 
the report to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The material was not child pornography or in any other way  
illegal, one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lutheran minister, Thiemann, 52, is married with two adult  
children. He was dean at the divinity school for nearly 13 years 
and specializes in religion in American public life and modern 
Protestant thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The matter came to light last fall after Thiemann requested help  
from Harvard technicians in transferring computer files at his 
university-owned dean's residence. The technicians found thousands 
of pornographic sites, and told their supervisors, the sources 
said. The information eventually reached Rudenstine's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Thiemann nor his lawyer, Harvard Law School Professor  
Charles Ogletree, returned calls for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogletree told the Globe that the former dean would not respond  
to ``anonymous allegations'' and would issue a statement later in 
the week. Ogletree also suggested he was concerned about an 
employer pursuing the private life of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiemann is on a one-year sabbatical. He moved out of the dean's  
residence but is still being paid his Harvard salary. No 
tenure-revocation proceedings were initiated. After the year's 
leave, he is eligible to return to the university as a professor. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood at the Divinity School was bleak Wednesday and the  
topic was the subject of meetings between administrators and 
faculty members, students and staff. Many in the divinity school 
had believed Thiemann resigned because he was battling depression. 
</P>
<P>
	A Harvard source said the meetings discussed the newspaper  
report and the ``natural concerns that would arise and how then to 
move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The episode ``raises questions about the right to privacy and  
questions about punishing people because they have interests in 
sexual images,'' said Sarah Wunsch, an attorney with the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Harvard owned Thiemann's residence does not  
necessarily mean it can fire him for things he does there, she 
said.

<HEADLINE> New Gun Control Concessions Offered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans offered fresh concessions  
on gun control Wednesday night, but the Clinton administration and 
Democrats swiftly said they didn't go far enough to plug gaps that 
allow some criminals to obtain weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft amendment circulated by the GOP calls for background  
checks on all purchasers at gun shows, including transactions 
exempted in a proposal that Republicans muscled through the Senate 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the proposal would establish a requirement for a  
mandatory background check for anyone seeking to reclaim their own 
weapon at a pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
	The concessions marked the latest in a series of retreats by the  
GOP in the wake of last month's shooting spree at a Colorado high 
school and a renewed push by Democrats for more restrictions on 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials prepared a long list of additional  
issues the proposal didn't address, and one Democrat said 
Republicans were merely attempting to ``fill another leaky boat.... 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get it,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said of  
Republicans. ``The public gets it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said party  
leaders hoped that passage of the proposal would persuade enough 
wavering Republicans to help kill a stronger set of provisions 
advanced by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the maneuvering has occurred on legislation to crack down  
on juvenile crime, a measure that was brought to the floor to allow 
lawmakers to stage a debate over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	A week of almost ceaseless political combat over the issue was  
briefly interrupted during the day when lawmakers approved creating 
a national Commission on Character Development to study the impact 
of cultural influences on good citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel -- to include one student and one parent among 36  
members -- would have two years to present Congress with 
recommendations for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polling has shown strong support for more gun  
restrictions in the wake of last month's shootings in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	While making the latest in a series of retreats, Republicans  
indicated they were drawing the line. GOP aides said the latest 
amendment had been drafted in a meeting with top Senate Republicans 
earlier Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also have revived their proposal from a week ago to  
try and attract GOP support. 
</P>
<P>
	Their latest version removes some of the government record  
keeping and other red tape proposed in connection with gun show 
purchases. But it also would give the government three days to 
conduct a background check -- rather than 24 hours proposed by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also want to wait 90 days before expunging background  
check records in cases where the purchases are approved. The GOP 
wants immediate destruction of all records. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republicans forced defeat of a Democratic call for  
mandatory background checks for all gun show purchasers, and 
approved their own alternative, approved by the National Rifle 
Association, calling for optional checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 24 hours, the GOP backpedaled under pressure, and  
approved a substitute that they said would make background checks 
mandatory at shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said that measure contained a loophole and would  
continue to permit unlicensed dealers to sell weapons without 
conducting a background check on the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they said it would permit individuals to sell their  
guns at pawnshops and reclaim them without undergoing a check. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said the proposal would allow  
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to impose a new fee on 
gun purchasers. He also said the three-day period for a background 
check could halt otherwise qualified sales if the show closed 
before the check was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The national commission was part of an amendment introduced by  
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. The proposal underscored an effort by 
Republicans to turn attention toward cultural influences on young 
people, particularly in the wake of the shootings in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission would be charged with studying ``the impact of  
current cultural influences ... on the process of developing and 
instilling the key aspects of character, which include 
trust-worthiness, honesty. integrity, an ability to keep promises, 
loyalty, respect, responsibility, fairness, a caring nature and 
good citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel would include members of the clergy as well as  
representatives of law enforcement, the information industry and 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate struggle, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, argued at  
length against a proposal by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., to give 
school officials greater leeway in disciplining students with 
disabilities who bring guns to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin refused to agree to limit debate, at one point telling  
inquiring Republicans he needed to continue speaking ``Because I am 
so poor at getting across my point, it seems.''

<HEADLINE> German Economy Outlook Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The Finance Ministry on Wednesday noted  
signs that Germany's long-sluggish economy could be on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter gross domestic product may show a slight rise from  
the previous quarter, the ministry said in a summary of its May 
monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimistic report also noted that price development remained  
stable, attributing an unusual 0.4 percent rise in consumer prices 
in April to a new environmental tax that drove up the cost of gas 
and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has been battling record-high  
unemployment -- 10.7 in April -- and slow economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Hans Eichel has called for government spending  
cuts and reiterated projections of 1.5 percent growth this year, 
revised downward from 2 percent at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	While a single month's developments were not enough to diagnose  
a sure improvement, the ministry said several factors pointed to 
increased economic momentum and the possibility for increased GDP 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted: an improved business climate in western  
Germany's manufacturing sector in March; slight improvements in 
exports in the first quarter after setbacks in the previous two 
quarters; and continued growth in retail sales for the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the ministry noted that more steps are needed to improve  
the situation in the labor market beyond seasonal changes.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Hammonds Hits Three Home Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Cincinnati outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds broke out  
of a season-long slump with his first career three-homer game 
Wednesday against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds, hitting .132 with no homers and three RBIs entering  
the game, hit a solo homer in the first and added two-run shots in 
the fourth and sixth. His third homer gave the Reds an 18-9 lead. 
Hammonds has five multihomer games. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to become the 12th player to hit four homers in a  
game, Hammonds reached on an error in the seventh inning and walked 
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth three-homer game in the majors this season and  
the second in two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgar Martinez had three home runs for Seattle on Tuesday night  
against Minnesota. Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, Houston's Jeff 
Bagwell, and Larry Walker of Colorado also have homered three times 
in a game this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds' third homer was the sixth of the game for Cincinnati  
on Wednesday. Sean Casey added two home runs and Brad Johnson hit 
his fourth of the season.

	Having already committed $100 billion to acquisitions for its  
new cable-telephone strategy, the company is still shopping around 
for investments, the company said Wednesday at its annual 
shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive C. Michael Armstrong also stressed  
that AT&AMP;T needs a smooth transition at Tele-Communications Inc. and 
MediaOne Group, the two cable TV companies already being acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest challenge for us is to execute against the  
potential of all these acquisitions,'' he said, referring to the 
company's ambitious plan to use cable TV wires for both phone and 
Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T president John Zeglis added that the company likely will  
make more investments in foreign companies, as it has in Canada and 
Japan, to expand its global network. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it has begun testing a new wireless  
service in Dallas using a pizza box-sized receiver for local and 
long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The past year has seen AT&AMP;T acquire TCI, the nation's second  
biggest cable company, and strike a deal to buy No. 4 MediaOne 
after winning a bidding war last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all pending agreements, AT&AMP;T would surpass Time Warner  
as the nation's top cable operator, with 16 million subscribers and 
systems capable of reaching more than 25 million homes with cable 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T plans to offer packages of TV, phone and Internet  
service over those cable lines, it is also working on deals to sell 
its phone service to Time Warner and Comcast cable customers. 
</P>
<P>
	If those agreements are finalized, AT&AMP;T phone service may one  
day be available in more than 60 million homes, or about 60 percent 
of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Accused Nazi May Lose Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today renewed its court  
battle to strip U.S. citizenship from John Demjanjuk, an alleged 
Nazi death camp guard who escaped a death penalty in Israel when 
evidence arose that he was a victim of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations,  
which was criticized by a U.S. appellate court for ``reckless'' 
withholding of evidence that might have cleared Demjanjuk in the 
earlier case, filed a new complaint in U.S. District Court in 
Cleveland, where the 79-year-old retired auto worker lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The new complaint alleges that Demjanjuk was a guard at the  
Sobibor extermination camp and at the Majdanek and Flossenburg 
concentration camps during World War II and served in the Nazi 
SS-run ``Trawniki'' unit that participated in a campaign to 
annihilate the Jews of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The government dropped its previous claim that Demjanjuk was a  
guard known as ``Ivan the Terrible,'' who operated a gas chamber at 
the Treblinka extermination camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the proceedings against him, which began 22 years  
ago, Demjanjuk has denied serving as a guard in any concentration 
or death camp. He claimed he was a farmer in Poland and then a 
Soviet Red Army soldier who spent most of the war in a German 
prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But both the Israeli Supreme Court and a U.S. federal judge  
assigned to review the earlier proceedings cast doubt on 
Demjanjuk's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli Supreme Court found Demjanjuk's alibi  
``unreasonable'' and flatly concluded, ``It is a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. of Nashville, Tenn.,  
who was appointed by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to 
examine the government's conduct in the case, stated, ``Mr. 
Demjanjuk's alibi was so incredible as to legitimately raise the 
suspicions of his prosecutors that he lied about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, responding today on his  
behalf, said that, although the Justice Department earlier accused 
Demjanjuk ``of being the most heinous war criminal of World War 
II,'' that case ``proved that the Department of Justice defrauded 
the American courts, deceived the American people and destroyed Mr. 
Demjanjuk's good name. Hopefully, it will not take another 22 years 
to clear his name once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February of last year, a federal trial court threw out the  
earlier order stripping Demjanjuk of his U.S. citizenship but 
specifically permitted the government to file a new complaint if it 
believed that evidence warranted it. 
</P>
<P>
	In that new complaint today, the government alleged he was an  
armed guard at Sobibor, which was established by the Nazis solely 
to murder Jewish civilians. It said Jewish prisoners arrived by 
train and armed guards ordered them to strip naked and then herded 
them into gas chambers. Exhaust from a diesel engine was then 
pumped into the Sobibor gas chambers, where more than 200,000 men, 
women and children were murdered, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new complaint also alleged Demjanjuk began working for the  
Nazis in 1942 at the Trawniki training camp, an SS-run base in 
Nazi-occupied Poland that prepared Eastern European recruits to 
assist German soldiers in implementing Adolf Hitler's genocidal 
race policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk and other Trawniki men participated in ``Operation  
Reinhard,'' a Nazi program that rounded up 1.7 million Jews in 
Poland and murdered them in mass shootings or in death camps with 
poison gas, the government alleged. Ten of thousands of other Jews 
were confined to slave labor camps where many starved, died of 
exhaustion or were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Demjanjuk was an armed guard at Majdanek  
concentration camp in the occupied Polish city of Lublin. This camp 
functioned as both a death and a labor camp, and between 200,000 
and 360,000 prisoners died or were murdered there. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk also served as an SS guard at Flossenburg  
concentration camp, where 30,000 prisoners died, the government 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Refiling the case is ``the right and courageous thing to do,''  
said Neal Sher, who headed the investigations office from 1983 to 
1994. ``Every judge to look at this case in United States and 
Israel had no doubt about documents being fully authentic in 
establishing his service at Sobibor and the other camps and that 
his abilis were fabricated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he entered the United States in 1952 and became a  
naturalized citizen in 1958, Demjanjuk concealed his work on behalf 
of the Nazis by claiming he spent the war working on a farm in 
Sobibor, Poland, and as a laborer in Germany, the government 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, a federal court in Cleveland revoked his citizenship  
after finding that he was ``Ivan the Terrible'' and a guard at 
Trawniki. The court never ruled on the government's contention that 
he was a guard at Sobibor. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk was ordered deported, but instead was extradited to  
Israel in 1986, where he was tried and convicted of being ``Ivan 
the Terrible'' by an Israeli trial court and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the Israeli Supreme Court reversed the conviction after  
prosecutors discovered evidence from the Soviet Union suggested 
that another man could have been Ivan the Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Israeli Supreme Court found that Demjanjuk had been  
a guard at Sobibor, Trawniki, Majdanek and Flossenburg, it released 
him on grounds that he had been extradited to stand trial on the 
Ivan the Terrible charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk subsequently returned to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs GOP Spending Cuts Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans struggled Wednesday over whether  
to deliver billions in spending cuts promised in Congress' 1997 
budget deal with President Clinton as a House committee approved a 
GOP blueprint for doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Divided along party lines, the House Appropriations Committee  
adopted a Republican plan for cutting billions from legislation 
covering national parks, schools and other domestic programs for 
fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1. The vote was 31-23. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved the plan amid complaints by Democrats and  
some Republicans that the cuts were too deep and would produce 
legislation that even the GOP-controlled Congress would reject. 
That would lead to a repeat of last autumn's budget negotiations 
with the White House in which billions of dollars in extra spending 
was approved, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spending will be pushed through the roof,'' said Rep. John  
Edward Porter, R-Ill. ``It will be the president in the driver's 
seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on labor,  
health and education, whose programs would be cut by $10.7 billion 
-- the deepest reduction of all. He was the only committee member to 
abstain from voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said congressional leaders should meet with Clinton and  
seek a compromise on providing more money for the spending bills 
than the balanced-budget agreement allows. Other Republicans 
privately have expressed support for that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	But conservatives are uniting against abandoning the budget pact  
because any extra spending would have to come from the federal 
surplus, which this year comes completely from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans this year have promised to leave Social Security  
funds for the pension program, and conservatives in particular have 
made that a rallying cry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we're not going to spend Social Security  
surplus money'' for more domestic spending, said Rep. Nick Smith, 
R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives planned a news conference for Thursday to call for  
living within the budget agreement's spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee vote was on a plan for dividing $538 billion among  
the 13 annual spending bills the panel writes that keep government 
agencies functioning. Half the money would go to the Pentagon and 
the rest to the 12 other bills, which would get a combined $25 
billion less -- a 9 percent cut -- than they are receiving this year. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said that went too far.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure if it's the sequel or the prequel, but it's the  
same old Republican cuts ... and it's just not going to be 
acceptable,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska, is proposing similar plans and has predicted 
Congress will reject several spending bills because of excessively 
deep cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday when he would unveil his plan for dividing up  
the spending, he said, ``As soon as I get more money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate planned a Thursday debate on a $15 billion  
measure financing the conflict with Yugoslavia, aid to U.S. farmers 
and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's likely passage would send the bill to Clinton for  
his expected signature.

<HEADLINE> Accused Mom Denies Starving Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tabitha Walrond's voice was just above a whisper  
as she recalled the preparations she made before her son Tyler's 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamaze classes, parenting magazines, no smoking or drinking --  
Ms. Walrond even went to night school to get her high school 
diploma. When a fever kept her from nursing just after Tyler was 
born, she said she used a breast pump to ensure her milk would keep 
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The image Ms. Walrond, 21, presented as she testified Tuesday at  
her manslaughter trial was starkly different from the one 
prosecutors offered. They say Ms. Walrond starved 2-month-old Tyler 
to death out of spite for her ex-boyfriend, who got another woman 
pregnant after he left her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond's lawyer, Susan V. Tipograph, says her client had  
trouble nursing because of breast-reduction surgery and didn't 
realize her newborn was losing weight before he died in August 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to Tyler Walrond was a tragedy and not a  
crime,'' Ms. Tipograph said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross examination, prosecutor Robert Holdman showed Ms.  
Walrond autopsy photographs of her son's emaciated body -- his tiny 
ribs sticking out, baggy skin hanging off his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did he look thin to you?'' the prosecutor asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``He looked the same to me,'' Ms. Walrond replied. ``I didn't  
notice. I really didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ms. Walrond's failure to act when Tyler dropped  
from his birth weight of nearly eight pounds to about five pounds 
amounted to reckless and negligent homicide. She's charged with 
second-degree manslaughter and could be sentenced to 5 to 15 years 
in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were scheduled for today.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond said she chose breastfeeding because her family and  
doctors all told her ``breast is best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said no doctor examined the newborn after he left the  
hospital because Medicaid was slow to issue him a card, and her 
health clinic would not examine the baby until the bureaucratic 
problem was resolved.

<HEADLINE> Stars-Avs Bring Strengths to Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Stars have met every challenge  
on their home ice through two rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
The Colorado Avalanche have made themselves at home on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Something will have to give Saturday night when the Western  
Conference finals begin in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche are perfect in six road games, the last three  
coming in front of the ruthless fans at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena. 
The Stars are 5-0 in the postseason on the sometimes slushy, uneven 
ice in Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel comfortable at home,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock  
said. ``We seem to have a confidence level right now that even when 
we're down in games we can still come back. Hopefully we can 
continue it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche spoiled the Dallas-Detroit showdown many Stars  
fans wanted by winning four straight against the two-time defending 
champion Red Wings. Colorado's roll began after two home losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are coming off a six-game series against St. Louis.  
Dallas won two at home, lost two in St. Louis, then won one at each 
venue to advance to the conference finals for the second straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's tempting to say whoever wins this series will win the Cup,  
considering the last three champions have come from the West and 
the Stars and Avalanche have the best records of the four remaining 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is the No. 1 seed in the West and Colorado second. In the  
East, Toronto is the fourth seed and Buffalo seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche were one of the few teams that won the  
regular-season series against the Stars, going 2-1-1. Colorado won 
the most recent meeting 2-1, but that was the regular season finale 
after both teams' playoff spots were set. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' only victory was on Dec. 26, when Colorado was  
struggling. Since then, the Avalanche have become a deeper and 
stronger team with the addition of Theo Fleury, a return to health 
by Valeri Kamensky and the postseason blossoming of rookies Chris 
Drury and Milan Hejduk. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said Colorado's success on the road stems from its  
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	By being able to send out line after line of scorers, the  
Avalanche can play conservatively and wait for scoring chance 
instead of the typical road strategy of going all out to score 
early and mute the home fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you know you've got enough top-end people who can score  
at any time, then you feel like you don't have to put on a show, 
that the other team is eventually going to crack,'' Hitchcock said. 
``If you're the home team, sometimes it can frustrate you. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that happened to Detroit in Game 6. They were really  
prone to the big error and Colorado really took advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' strength is in a versatile mix of forwards who are  
committed to playing solid defense and eventually wearing down 
their foes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars do have some top players in Mike Modano, Brett Hull  
and Joe Nieuwendyk, but they can't match the Avalanche player for 
player. So Hitchcock doesn't even want them to try. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go with the attitude of shutting down this guy or that guy  
is unrealistic,'' he said, ``because they have too many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Detroit-Colorado series ended, Hitchcock said either  
team would be favored over Dallas because both had been playing so 
well since making big trades at the deadline. On Wednesday, his 
players weren't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that we're an underdog,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``A  
lot of people are very impressed with the way Colorado played 
Detroit and the way Patrick Roy is playing. But we've lost only two 
games in the playoffs, both in overtime. So you can't say that 
we're not playing pretty well, too.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Denied Three-Peat Dynasty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The three-peat is gone. Instead, the Red Wings  
start over, taking consolation from the very team that ended their 
chance for another Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at Colorado,'' Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman said.  
``They had to retool a little bit, make some adjustments to their 
team, and they're back playing extremely well and contending again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect us to regroup and be a contender again next year. Our  
goal is to win again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Roy, the winningest goaltender in NHL playoff history,  
baffled the Red Wings during their second-round series. After the 
Red Wings won the first two games, Roy closed the door. As the 
series wore on, he seemed to fill every inch of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was so dominant that when Detroit defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom  
scored at 17:24 of the second period in the sixth and deciding game 
Tuesday night, it ended a scoreless streak of 98 minutes, 7 seconds 
dating to the third period of Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a case of being outplayed,'' Detroit defenseman  
Larry Murphy said. ``Basically, a team had more control of the 
puck, scored and took advantage of their opportunities. It was all 
over then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a suspicion the Red Wings are showing the first signs  
of age. Murphy and center Igor Larionov are 38 years old. Chris 
Chelios is 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, there are young legs. Martin Lapointe is only 25. Tomas  
Holmstron and Kirk Maltby -- whose overtime goal won Game 1 in 
Denver -- are both 26. Darren McCarty and Vyacheslav Kozlov are 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good nucleus of players,'' coach Scotty Bowman said.  
``Teams are getting better, we know that. But, at the same time, 
the team needs a few adjustments, but not a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of young players on the team. It's not an  
all-veteran team. It's a mixture. There's enough players in that 
room that have won, and I think the fire's still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spark that ignites that fire is Bowman, and there is some  
question if he'll return. After 31 seasons, during which he won 
eight Stanley Cups -- with three different teams -- Bowman has hinted 
he might retire. If he does, a front office job awaits. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the 5-2 loss to Colorado, however, the  
65-year-old coach spoke as if he might stay behind the bench 
another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll sit down with the people in Detroit and find out what  
they want,'' Bowman said. ``I've got a hidden goal that I'd like to 
coach in the year 2000. But that's not important right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be an emotional decision. I'll sit down with the Red  
Wings. I came here for a year or two, and it's been six. If it can 
be longer, it will be longer. If it can't, it can't and I'll go out 
with my head high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also is concern that Lidstrom, a Norris Trophy finalist  
for the second straight year, might return to Sweden. Lidstrom is 
29 and one of the finest defenseman in the league. His loss would 
leave a void on an otherwise aging defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players think the addition of Chelios and Ulf Samuelsson at  
the trading deadline might convince Lidstrom to stay. With someone 
like Chelios on his wing, Lidstrom no longer feels the pressure to 
be Detroit's dominant defender. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those acquisitions definitely helped our team,'' Yzerman said.  
``Not for just this season, but for the next few seasons as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lidstrom said he and his wife, Annika, will make a decision this  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the earliest the Red Wings have been dialing for tee  
times in four years. Since 1996, they have played in the Western 
Conference finals four times, played in the Cup finals three times, 
winning the title in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wonderful and all that to win in previous years,''  
Yzerman said. ``But you play for right now, and you're playing for 
this year. So it doesn't really do any good to sit back and feel 
good about previous years because that's over and done with now.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Settles Teletubbies Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Youngsters or their parents looking for  
Teletubbies dolls won't find lookalike Bubbly Chubbies on the 
shelves of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart has settled a lawsuit brought by the creators and  
marketers of Teletubbies, who accused the giant retailer of 
copyright infringement by selling the Bubbly Chubbies. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit called the Bubbly Chubbies ``obvious, studied  
knockoffs of the famous Teletubbies characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	England-based Ragdoll Productions Ltd. and its North American  
licensing agent itsy bitsy Entertainment Co. filed the suit in 
March in U.S. District Court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart agreed in the settlement to pull all Bubbly Chubbies  
items off shelves, destroy its remaining inventory and provide itsy 
bitsy Entertainment and Ragdoll Productions with information on the 
manufacturing and distribution of such items. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount-store giant said Wednesday that it paid no monetary  
damages in the settlement. The lawsuit continues against the 
alleged manufacturer of the Bubbly Chubbies and another 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern in filing this suit was not about money, but in  
protecting the integrity of the Teletubbies trademarks which we 
have associated with products that insure the highest of safety and 
creative play standards possible,'' said Kenn Viselman, president 
of itsy bitsy Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart said in a brief statement that it will ``remove the  
limited quantity of Bubbly Chubbies from our stores that remained 
from a one-time purchase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teletubbies characters, Tinky Winky, Laa-Laa, Po, and Dipsy  
have been featured on BBC since 1997, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series now airs or will soon air in about 120 countries and  
in 21 languages and dialects. Since last April, it has been 
broadcast on 323 Public Broadcasting System stations, reaching 97 
percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Ragdoll Productions was founded in 1984 by children's television  
program producer Anne Wood. The New York-based itsy bitsy 
Entertainment Co. was founded in 1995 by Viselman.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Buried With Military Honors </HEADLINE>

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- An Army helicopter pilot killed while  
training for NATO action against Yugoslavia was buried today with 
full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bill Gives Reparations to Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department may soon be spending up  
to $4.3 million for reparations to ethnic Japanese -- most of them 
from Latin America -- who were placed in internment camps during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is part of $15 billion spending bill passed by the  
House Tuesday and scheduled for a vote Thursday in the Senate. 
President Clinton has already indicated he would sign the bill, 
which also would pay for the bombing in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Money for the reparations would come from other accounts in the  
Justice Department after the attorney general approved transferring 
the funds, a department official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 ethnic Japanese were rounded up from 13 Latin  
American countries during World War II and forcibly brought to the 
United States. The U.S. government had hoped to exchange the group 
for U.S. prisoners of war held by Japan. The exchange program never 
developed and the Japanese Latin Americans were instead housed in 
camps with thousands of Japanese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government never provided an official explanation for  
the internments. 
</P>
<P>
	While interned Japanese Americans ultimately received an apology  
and $20,000 each from the U.S. government, Latin American detainees 
were deemed ineligible for reparations because they were not U.S. 
citizens at the time they were held. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal class action lawsuit was filed in 1996 seeking equal  
treatment for the Latin American internees. 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement in the case was reached last summer, with the  
government agreeing to pay $5,000 to each, but many were unhappy 
with the disparity in payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill passed by the House, the Justice Department would  
allocate: 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.58 million for up to 79 eligible Japanese American cases at  
$20,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.98 million for 395 eligible Japanese Latin American cases at  
$5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	--$665,000 for 133 additional Japanese Latin American cases  
expected to qualify, at $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Small of the Campaign for Justice, which represents the  
group of Japanese Latin Americans who sued in 1996, applauded the 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great. We're pretty happy -- to have worked so hard, and  
only see 145 people get paid was devastating,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> ATF Increases Number of Gun Traces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLING WATERS, W.Va. (AP) -- The call came in to the nondescript  
building in the rolling hills of West Virginia in late afternoon -- 
an urgent request for help tracing the guns used in the Littleton, 
Colo., high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	As night fell, two workers began calling manufacturers and  
poring over paper records and microfilm rolls in a laborious 
process propelled by a serial number. Computers were no help. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, they could report some results: Two of the four  
guns wielded by two students to kill 12 fellow students and one 
teacher before committing suicide had once been sold at Denver area 
stores. Then the trail went cold. It was up to police in the field 
to track those guns the rest of the way to the shooters -- and to 
find sources for the other two guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The process -- repeated 200,000 times a year -- is an example of  
how the nation's gun laws actually work in practice, both in their 
power and their limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the difficulties, federal agents at the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, spurred by the Clinton 
administration, have dramatically increased the number of traces 
done on guns confiscated at crime scenes. The nearly sevenfold 
increase, up from just 30,000 a decade ago, is part of an effort to 
solve crimes and to find patterns of illegal trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	But agents must walk a political tightrope, taking care not to  
trample gun owners' rights under strict limits set by Congress, 
including a blanket prohibition against any computerized master 
list of gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is at the heart of the current gun debate in Congress,  
as lawmakers try to balance the goals of keeping firearms from 
criminals and other illegal users while keeping them accessible to 
law-abiding people. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, fighting some proposals for  
further restrictions on guns, says it supports efforts to crack 
down on illegal traffickers but questions why that hasn't led to 
more federal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If enhanced gun-tracing efforts allow them to target  
traffickers, we support that,'' said James Baker, the NRA's chief 
lobbyist. ``But you'd figure if they were doing more 
investigations, it should result in more prosecutions, not less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration says ATF increasingly shares its  
tracing data with local police who pursue more prosecutions under 
state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	What agents can trace is limited. They start with a gun's make  
and serial number, moving forward from the manufacturer to a 
wholesaler and distributor to the first retail sale by a federally 
licensed gun dealer. All sales by licensed dealers must be 
recorded, and those records must be provided to ATF if it asks. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, however, any sales by individuals or by collectors  
at gun shows, for example, are considered private and exempt from 
recording requirements. That is where ATF's Littleton trail ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of high-technology also limits the tracing. Licensed  
dealers' records are usually handwritten, sent to ATF in dusty 
boxes when a dealer goes out of business. Workers sitting in front 
of screens search fuzzy microfilmed copies for a serial number that 
might be duplicated 10 times by different manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The center manages to trace a gun to its first retail sale about  
52 percent of the time, according to the agent in charge, Forest 
Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time it does, agents enter the information into a database  
that is the backbone of the center's second function -- to help 
police look for patterns of suspicious gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Using such tracing data from 27 cities, for example, ATF  
discovered earlier this year that one-third to one-half of the guns 
juveniles used in crimes were bought from licensed dealers by 
someone acting as a ``straw'' intermediary, such as a girlfriend or 
trafficker. Only 35 percent had been stolen, puncturing a 
long-standing belief. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF agents increasingly work with police in cities such as New  
York, Dallas, Washington, Boston and Los Angeles to seek such 
patterns to solve specific crimes or look for bad dealers, said 
Scott Pickett, the center's deputy chief. 
</P>
<P>
	In one recent case, a gun at a Baltimore murder scene was traced  
to a sale in Ohio. The man who had bought the gun, whose name was 
in the dealer's records, was living in the Baltimore home of the 
main murder suspect. Police had no physical evidence tying the 
suspect to the murder scene until they traced the gun to his 
tenant. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, hundreds of guns seized in drug and other  
crimes were traced to a dealer who had just opened a store, said 
Rich Young, an ATF agent who used to work in Baltimore and now 
trains other agents. Detectives examining his books realized many 
sales hadn't been recorded. He was convicted of illegal 
trafficking, was sent to jail for a year and lost his license. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, police focused on trying to reduce violent crime by  
fighting drug trafficking, Pickett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they realize, ``If you trace every gun (used in a crime), in  
six months you'll start seeing crime drop,'' Pickett said. ``That's 
the core of what we do here.''

<HEADLINE> Fake Hughes Book for Sale on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clifford Irving's notorious ``autobiography'' of  
Howard Hughes -- the book that landed its author in prison instead 
of on the best-seller list -- is on sale for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is available only through an online seller owned in  
part by the author. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a child I always loved,'' the 68-year-old Irving  
said Wednesday of the 1970s-era hoax, based on fabricated 
interviews with the reclusive billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early '70s, Irving was one of the country's most  
talked-about writers. He had convinced publisher McGraw Hill that 
he had compiled an autobiography from secret meetings with Hughes. 
He received $765,000 for the proposed book. 
</P>
<P>
	But before publication, the scam was discovered. Irving served  
14 months in federal prison for fraud, and Time magazine named him 
Con Man of the Year. He has since come out with several books, 
mostly novels, but virtually all are out of print and he has no 
deals pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clifford Irving's Autobiography of Howard Hughes'' is being  
sold through the Web site terrificbooks.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt there was something unfinished in my life  
when it came to that book,'' Irving said from his home in Santa Fe, 
N.M. ``There are some wonderful things in it. It's highly 
entertaining. I'm not ashamed of the book, but I do feel a certain 
amount of shame for all the lies I told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author is complaining that he himself has been conned. He  
was to be seen Wednesday night in a taped interview with ``60 
Minutes'' newsman Mike Wallace, to whom Irving lied on air in 1972 
about the Hughes meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Irving said he was never told the interview would be part of  
the CBS special ``60 Minutes Classics: The Con Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disgusted,'' he said. ``They said the interview was meant  
to be a `60 Minutes Classic' on a regular `60 Minutes II' program. 
The word `con man' was never used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being fair to him,'' said ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Kevin  
Tedesco. ``We approached him to do a story about updating his great 
hoax from the '70s. And he saw it as a chance to say that he has 
now published his hoax.''

<HEADLINE> Lab-Designed Corn May Harm Insects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have discovered a disturbing unintended consequence  
of genetic engineering: Pollen from a widely planted, 
laboratory-designed strain of corn can kill monarch butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	Monarch caterpillars eating milkweed leaves dusted with pollen  
from the altered corn plants ate less, grew more slowly and died 
more quickly. After four days, 44 percent of them had died vs. none 
of the caterpillars that didn't feed on the pollen. 
</P>
<P>
	Monarchs are not an endangered species. But environmentalists  
fear that if the genetically engineered corn is killing the 
orange-and-black butterflies, it may be killing other insects and 
doing other unseen damage to the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain is called Bt corn and is manufactured by agricultural  
giants Novartis AG, Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. and Monsanto 
Co. The corn is genetically engineered to produce a natural 
pesticide that kills the corn-destroying European corn borer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and hit the  
market in 1996. It accounted for more than 25 percent of the 80 
million acres of corn planted in the United States in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bt corn has been touted by the industry as a way to fight a  
major pest without using chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Cornell University entomologist John Losey  
and published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disturbing,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, whose  
Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends is pushing for a 
moratorium on genetically engineered crops until their environment 
effects can be more thoroughly studied. ``It's a smoking gun. This 
now is a red flag everyone is going to have to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losey, however, said that while he thinks the crop's harm to  
other insects deserves more research, studies have shown that the 
corn does not harm humans or other mammals. He added: ``I still 
think the proven benefits of Bt corn outweigh the potential 
risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto spokesman Randy Krotz said the finding is not very  
important. Many monarch butterflies would not be exposed to the 
toxic pollen, he said, since most milkweed does not grow near corn 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	And Val Giddings, vice president for the Biotechnology Industry  
Organization, said: ``Whatever the threat to monarch butterflies 
that is posed by Bt corn pollen, we know it's less than the threat 
of drifting pesticide sprays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials said they were not surprised by the finding,  
because the larvae of monarch butterflies are similar to the corn 
borer. They also called the study sloppy because the researchers 
didn't precisely measure the amount of pollen ladled onto the 
milkweed leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, biotech laboratories have been altering the  
genetics of vegetables to make them taste better or resistant to 
pests, raising fears among environmentalists of ``Frankenstein 
foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time scientists found possible unintended  
consequences of genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	A Swiss study last year showed an indirect effect of Bt corn on  
the food chain: Insects called lacewings died more quickly if they 
fed on corn borers reared on Bt corn. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Chicago study published in September found that  
a weed altered by scientists to resist an herbicide developed a far 
greater ability to pollinate other plants and pass on its traits. 
The findings raised fears that genetic engineering could lead to 
the rise of ``superweeds'' impervious to weedkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scotland, a toxicologist who added insect-resistant genes and  
proteins to potatoes and fed them to rats reported that the animals 
suffered damaged immune systems, growth problems and shrunken 
brains. But his findings were sharply disputed by other scientists.

<HEADLINE> Report: Harvard Divinity Dean Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard Divinity School's dean was  
forced to resign after pornography was found on his computer, The 
Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University asked for Ronald F. Thiemann's resignation  
last fall for ``conduct unbecoming a dean'' after the matter was 
brought to the attention of President Neil L. Rudenstine, the 
newspaper reported, citing unidentified Harvard sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``They agreed that it would be in the best interests of the  
divinity school for the dean to resign,'' Harvard spokesman Joe 
Wrinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The explicit material was allegedly found last fall after  
Thiemann requested more disk space on a school-owned computer at 
the office in his Harvard-owned residence, according to the Globe's 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiemann allegedly asked the computer department to transfer the  
images to the new disk drive, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiemann wouldn't comment, the Globe said.  
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Charles Ogletree, declined to respond to the  
allegations but said a number of factors led to the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The measure of a man like Ron Thiemann cannot be determined in  
response to allegations such as these but in the context of the 
admiration and respect he has gained from colleagues at the 
university, in the theological community and the secular 
community,'' Ogletree said. 
</P>
<P>
	The material was not child pornography or in any other way  
illegal, sources told the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiemann was dean of the divinity school for almost 13 years.  
His colleagues credited him with many accomplishments, including 
creation of the school's Center for the Study of Values in Public 
Life. The center is designed to discuss values in fields such as 
law, journalism, business and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiemann remains a tenured faculty member and has taken a year's  
sabbatical from that post. Wrinn said the university has not tried 
to revoke his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his resignation, Thiemann did not disclose  
reasons for his departure but told faculty members he was trying to 
cope with depression, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that he'd been ordered or strongly advised by his  
doctor to go on leave, to resign from the deanship and return as a 
teacher,'' said William Hutchinson, a Harvard professor.

<HEADLINE> Accused Nazi May Lose Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today renewed its court  
battle to strip U.S. citizenship from John Demjanjuk, an alleged 
Nazi death camp guard who escaped a death penalty in Israel when 
evidence arose that he was a victim of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations,  
which was criticized by a U.S. appellate court for ``reckless'' 
withholding of evidence that might have cleared Demjanjuk in the 
earlier case, filed a new complaint in U.S. District Court in 
Cleveland, where the 79-year-old retired auto worker lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The new complaint alleges that Demjanjuk was a guard at the  
Sobibor extermination camp and at the Majdanek and Flossenburg 
concentration camps during World War II and served in the Nazi 
SS-run ``Trawniki'' unit that participated in a campaign to 
annihilate the Jews of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The government dropped its previous claim that Demjanjuk was a  
guard known as ``Ivan the Terrible,'' who operated a gas chamber at 
the Treblinka extermination camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the proceedings against him, which began 22 years  
ago, Demjanjuk has denied serving as a guard in any concentration 
or death camp. He claimed he was a farmer in Poland and then a 
Soviet Red Army soldier who spent most of the war in a German 
prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But both the Israeli Supreme Court and a U.S. federal judge  
assigned to review the earlier proceedings cast doubt on 
Demjanjuk's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli Supreme Court found Demjanjuk's alibi  
``unreasonable'' and flatly concluded, ``It is a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. of Nashville, Tenn.,  
who was appointed by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to 
examine the government's conduct in the case, stated, ``Mr. 
Demjanjuk's alibi was so incredible as to legitimately raise the 
suspicions of his prosecutors that he lied about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic, responding today on his  
behalf, said that, although the Justice Department earlier accused 
Demjanjuk ``of being the most heinous war criminal of World War 
II,'' that case ``proved that the Department of Justice defrauded 
the American courts, deceived the American people and destroyed Mr. 
Demjanjuk's good name. Hopefully, it will not take another 22 years 
to clear his name once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February of last year, a federal trial court threw out the  
earlier order stripping Demjanjuk of his U.S. citizenship but 
specifically permitted the government to file a new complaint if it 
believed that evidence warranted it. 
</P>
<P>
	In that new complaint today, the government alleged he was an  
armed guard at Sobibor, which was established by the Nazis solely 
to murder Jewish civilians. It said Jewish prisoners arrived by 
train and armed guards ordered them to strip naked and then herded 
them into gas chambers. Exhaust from a diesel engine was then 
pumped into the Sobibor gas chambers, where more than 200,000 men, 
women and children were murdered, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new complaint also alleged Demjanjuk began working for the  
Nazis in 1942 at the Trawniki training camp, an SS-run base in 
Nazi-occupied Poland that prepared Eastern European recruits to 
assist German soldiers in implementing Adolf Hitler's genocidal 
race policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk and other Trawniki men participated in ``Operation  
Reinhard,'' a Nazi program that rounded up 1.7 million Jews in 
Poland and murdered them in mass shootings or in death camps with 
poison gas, the government alleged. Ten of thousands of other Jews 
were confined to slave labor camps where many starved, died of 
exhaustion or were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Demjanjuk was an armed guard at Majdanek  
concentration camp in the occupied Polish city of Lublin. This camp 
functioned as both a death and a labor camp, and between 200,000 
and 360,000 prisoners died or were murdered there. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk also served as an SS guard at Flossenburg  
concentration camp, where 30,000 prisoners died, the government 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Refiling the case is ``the right and courageous thing to do,''  
said Neal Sher, who headed the investigations office from 1983 to 
1994. ``Every judge to look at this case in United States and 
Israel had no doubt about documents being fully authentic in 
establishing his service at Sobibor and the other camps and that 
his abilis were fabricated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he entered the United States in 1952 and became a  
naturalized citizen in 1958, Demjanjuk concealed his work on behalf 
of the Nazis by claiming he spent the war working on a farm in 
Sobibor, Poland, and as a laborer in Germany, the government 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, a federal court in Cleveland revoked his citizenship  
after finding that he was ``Ivan the Terrible'' and a guard at 
Trawniki. The court never ruled on the government's contention that 
he was a guard at Sobibor. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk was ordered deported, but instead was extradited to  
Israel in 1986, where he was tried and convicted of being ``Ivan 
the Terrible'' by an Israeli trial court and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the Israeli Supreme Court reversed the conviction after  
prosecutors discovered evidence from the Soviet Union suggested 
that another man could have been Ivan the Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Israeli Supreme Court found that Demjanjuk had been  
a guard at Sobibor, Trawniki, Majdanek and Flossenburg, it released 
him on grounds that he had been extradited to stand trial on the 
Ivan the Terrible charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk subsequently returned to the United States.

<HEADLINE> NATO Not Speaking Softly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nowhere among government documents is the  
Powell doctrine listed. It isn't a doctrine, insists retired Army 
Gen. Colin Powell, it's only ``common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national security adviser to President Reagan and chairman  
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Bush calls his 
``doctrine'' an update to the advice of a third former Republican 
president -- Theodore Roosevelt's ``speak softly and carry a big 
stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of Kosovo policy say the Powell doctrine's basic tenets  
-- first set clear political goals and then use overwhelming force 
to achieve victory -- are being ignored in the nearly two-month-old 
Balkans conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a political moderate, suggests NATO has  
inverted Roosevelt's mantra. 
</P>
<P>
	``It spoke sharply and carried a stick which is one of the most  
counterproductive foreign policies of this century,'' Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than ending civil violence in the Serbian province of  
Kosovo, Leach contends NATO's mixture of belligerent rhetoric and 
air-power-only might has spawned a ``hot war'' with Yugoslavia and 
two new cold wars, with Russia and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell may deny his doctrine exists on paper, but he has no  
trouble describing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you have ... clear political objectives, then let your  
military people come forward and give you a plan that will achieve 
those objectives in as quick and decisive a way as possible,'' he 
told a National Press Club audience on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell cited two examples during his watch as Joint Chiefs  
chairman: Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989 to capture Panamanian 
dictator Manuel Noriega and the 1991 Gulf War to drive Iraqi 
invaders from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Powell does not think the current conflict  
meets the terms of the Powell doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	The political goals are not clear-cut and the political means of  
achieving them are ``far more difficult,'' depending on a consensus 
among 19 NATO democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Powell said he wouldn't personally have taken the  
military ground forces option off the table, as NATO appears to 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo is a textbook lesson in how not to use military  
force,'' said Richard Haas, a top National Security Council 
official in the Bush administration. ``You have at times 
unrealizable goals: the protection of the people of Kosovo, and the 
force you're willing to apply is, simply, inadequate to the task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haas is now a Brookings Institution analyst.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Powell doctrine is the accepted critique among the  
military over what went wrong in Vietnam and what went right in the 
Persian Gulf,'' said John Hillen, an analyst for the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillen said there is also ``a caricature of the true Powell  
doctrine, which is that the military only does the fun wars, the 
big wars and the wars where victory is assured, it's quick, and at 
a relatively small cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That view is held by some administration supporters, who suggest  
the Powell doctrine, if followed too strictly, would sharply limit 
the use of military force. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the air war will succeed,  
if just given enough time. 
</P>
<P>
	Back from a three-day visit to the region and to NATO  
headquarters in Brussels, Lautenberg said Tuesday that he can 
understand why public opinion polls show rising support for moving 
toward a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's taking longer than anyone expected,'' Lautenberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he said the air campaign is slowly succeeding. ``I came away  
with a better understanding of what the process is. I have more 
patience than when I left on this trip,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``We do our  
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a military goal to meet. We're doing our best to meet  
that goal with as little collateral damage (damage to civilians) as 
possible. But, I stressed ... this is conflict and casualties are 
impossible to avoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell himself conceded the possibility that the airpower-alone  
strategy ``may work'' in the end. He suggested there's no point in 
being too doctrinaire about doctrines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing in the Powell doctrine says no casualties. And you  
should have some idea of how you would like to see it end, but 
nothing in the Powell doctrine says you've got to have a precise 
exit strategy,'' said the retired four-star general, who is now 
leading a volunteer private-sector effort to help disadvantaged 
youth.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With John Pizzarelli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Pizzarelli grew up in New Jersey with his  
father, jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli, who always played music 
around the house. The only time his father's guitar was in its case 
was when he took it along on a gig. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first instrument Pizzarelli learned to play was tenor  
banjo. His banjo-playing uncles were his teachers. He also played 
trumpet in his high school band. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was 20, his father suggested that he listen to  
recordings by the Nat ``King'' Cole Trio. Cole sang and played jazz 
piano. Pizzarelli loved ``Paper Moon,'' ``Straighten Up and Fly 
Right'' and ``Route 66.'' He started singing in Cole's laid-back 
manner. He recorded ``Dear Mr. Cole,'' his best-selling CD, in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzarelli, 38, has five CDs in recent release, including the  
soundtrack for ``The Out-of-Towners,'' starring Steve Martin and 
Goldie Hawn. In the movie, the John Pizzarelli Trio plays ``That 
Old Black Magic'' at New York's Tavern on the Green restaurant. 
Pizzarelli's younger brother, Martin, who plays bass, and drummer 
Ray Kennedy, are the other members of the trio. 
</P>
<P>
	The guitarist-singer can also be heard on ``John Pizzarelli  
Meets the Beatles,'' his new CD released by RCA, and ``Contrasts,'' 
on Arbors Records, with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	1. What kind of places do you most often appear?  
</P>
<P>
	Pizzarelli: Mostly nightclubs and pops concerts. We've performed  
with the Boston Pops, Atlanta Symphony, San Diego Symphony, 
Indianapolis Symphony. We do college concerts and arts festival 
places like the Wheeler Opera House in Aspen, Colo. We cover the 
gamut. We've gone to Japan more than once and all around Europe. 
This summer we'll play at the Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy for 
several nights in different venues. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Did you always want to play jazz?  
</P>
<P>
	Pizzarelli: I sang in rock bands in high school. I thought I was  
going to be Billy Joel. I started singing Nat Cole's music in the 
early 1980s. His trio inspired me. Working with my dad, playing 
jazz, and hearing Nat, that had all the elements of what I wanted 
to do as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Why did you record a CD of Beatles songs?  
</P>
<P>
	Pizzarelli: We did one Beatles song, 'Honey Pie,' out of 12  
songs on 'Our Love Is Here To Stay,' our last previous album, and a 
lot of people mentioned it particularly. I thought, 'Maybe we'll 
record 11 or 12 and do them in my style. Maybe it'll bring Beatles 
fans as well as jazz fans to the same place.' The idea was not to 
scare anyone away. It worked out as well as I wanted it to, 
actually. I sing on all but one. We do 'Eleanor Rigby' as an 
instrumental. I've had at least one instrumental on each album. 
</P>
<P>
	4. You've recorded with a big band. Do you ever perform live  
with a big band? 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzarelli: We go to places where we bring the rhythm section  
and pick up a band. That works. One of the best was in Osaka, 
Japan. They didn't speak much English. I communicated to them by 
naming musicians I liked. I'd say to the tenor player, 'Zoot Sims.' 
He'd smile and nod his head. He knew what I was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Most jazz players don't become famous. How important is fame  
to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzarelli: Jazz never goes out of style. It is treating me  
well. There's no reason to do anything else. I perform enough, 
around the world, to make a living. I like what we do. I really do. 
I think if I were playing rock 'n' roll, it wouldn't be genuine to 
me. I don't have the knowledge. I know what I'm doing now because 
of my dad. I feel like we're authentic and part of a line. I can 
trust myself playing the way I play. Fame would be great but I 
think we're doing pretty well. Eventually, I figure, everybody is 
going to get to hear us.

<HEADLINE> First Lady May Form Sen. Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's close friends and  
advisers expect her to form an exploratory campaign committee next 
month, taking a dramatic step closer to running for the Senate in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Two longtime associates, both speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said this week the first lady has told them she intends 
to form the committee, which would allow her to raise and spend 
money while determining whether to seek the seat of retiring 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior adviser intimately familiar with Mrs. Clinton's  
decision-making process said Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton has not 
directed her political or legal teams to form the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Final word on the matter is not expected before she and  
President Clinton return from a brief Florida vacation May 30, the 
adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton plans to use that time to discuss the race with the  
president and their daughter, Chelsea, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser said while it was not likely, it still was possible  
Mrs. Clinton could decide this month not to seek the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	She is more likely to return from vacation and remain mum on her  
intentions, continuing to explore the race and moving ever closer 
to a full-fledged campaign, the three sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	If she takes this route, political and legal considerations  
would force Mrs. Clinton to form an exploratory committee almost 
immediately, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	All three sources said Mrs. Clinton's staff and advisers now  
believe she is more likely than not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's supporters long have suspected she would form an  
exploratory committee. The matter took on greater importance after 
she began to be criticized for traveling to New York at taxpayers' 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Forming a committee would allow Mrs. Clinton to raise money to  
help finance the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Arranging for the first lady to travel is expensive, though the  
full costs never are disclosed. Mrs. Clinton goes with a Secret 
Service entourage and a handful of aides, staying at pricey hotels 
and flying aboard government planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the exploratory committee, taxpayers would cover most  
of her costs. Under federal policy, campaigns do not pay the full 
cost of flying government planes or providing Secret Service 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Mrs. Clinton rules out the bid in June, she is not  
expected formally to enter the race for weeks or months. Friends 
and advisers, however, say it would be difficult to turn away from 
the race once she forms an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	She determined weeks ago that a Senate seat would be a good  
platform for her advocacy of children and women's issues and a 
steppingstone for a potential long-term goal -- seeking the 
presidency. Associates also say Mrs. Clinton knows she could lose 
the race, and is increasingly willing to take that risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Her most likely GOP rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,  
would be a formidable candidate. Aides to GOP Gov. George Pataki 
say he plans to make a major political announcement next week, 
stirring rumors that he might seek the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the potential hurdles to the race are the logistics of  
running for the Senate in New York while being first lady, one of 
the associates said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second associate, a longtime ally who would prefer that she  
not seek the seat, said Mrs. Clinton has told friends the 
opportunity may be too good to pass up.

<HEADLINE> Retirees' Taxes May Not Drop Much </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Most people assume that their cost of living --  
including their taxes -- will be lower during their retirement 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's certainly the case for most people, but taxes may not  
drop as much as you might think, says a tax expert from the College 
for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, retirees may lose some of the major deductions they had  
before retirement. Second, and perhaps more important, they are 
taxed on income they are not used to receiving,'' says Michael 
Cates, a professional tax preparer and an academic assistant at the 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some financial planners estimate that up to 85 percent of  
their retired clients remain in the same tax bracket they were in 
before they retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As people approach and enter retirement, they often lose some of  
the tax deductions that helped reduce the amount of taxable income 
they generated, according to Cates. For example, your home mortgage 
is typically paid off by retirement, eliminating the deduction for 
home mortgage interest, though the deduction for property taxes may 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cates says he's seen suggestions in print that retirees may want  
to continue the interest deduction on a paid-off home by taking out 
a home-equity loan, but he thinks that's generally not a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, you're putting your home at risk if you can't pay  
back the loan, and second, why spend a dollar in interest costs 
just to save 28 cents (or whatever your tax bracket) in taxes. The 
only rationale he can see for such borrowing is if you can make 
more money by investing the loan elsewhere -- but that entails risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A more likely scenario for helping to offset the loss of the  
mortgage interest for the primary residence is the purchase of a 
vacation home, a motor home or even a boat. Interest on these 
second homes (most anything that has sleeping, cooking and bathroom 
facilities is viewed as a residence) is usually deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major deduction that disappears for most retirees is the  
personal exemption for dependents, who (except for those boomerang 
children) have left home. 
</P>
<P>
	Deductions for unreimbursed employee business expenses that  
exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) also disappear at 
retirement. On the other hand, deductions for medical expenses may 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical expenses, including insurance premiums, that exceed 7 1/2  
percent of your AGI are deductible. Cates notes that premiums for 
long-term care insurance policies are now deductible up to a 
certain limit, depending on your age (In 1999, $2,120 in premiums 
can be deducted, for example, for those ages 61-70). 
</P>
<P>
	However, the major tax deduction pre-retirees often forget that  
they will lose when they retire is their contributions to 
tax-deferred retirement plans, Cates says. 
</P>
<P>
	These contributions might amount to as much as 10 percent to 15  
percent of their employment income, especially as they approach 
retirement. Thus, ``although their retirement income might be lower 
than before retirement, a greater percentage of the income will be 
exposed to taxes,'' Cates notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the loss of income-tax deductions, retirees sometimes  
overlook the fact that distributions from their retirement plans, 
whether pensions paid for by employers or withdrawals from accounts 
the retirees funded, are taxable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these accounts were tax-advantaged going in, so they  
are fully taxable coming out,'' Cates says. 
</P>
<P>
	The real shock can come when you turn 70 1/2, especially if you and  
your spouse hit that age about the same time. At that point, you 
must start making minimum withdrawals from your retirement accounts 
(unless you are still working) and individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	If those accounts have grown in size over the years due to wise  
investing, and if you've been getting by since retirement without 
having to dip too heavily into those accounts, you may find 
yourself required to make minimum withdrawals that will trigger a 
bigger tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
	These required distributions also boost the chances of another  
tax bite retirees often overlook -- the taxation of Social Security 
benefits. Married couples filing jointly can have half their Social 
Security benefits subject to tax if their ``provisional income'' 
exceeds $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisional income includes 50 percent of Social Security  
benefits, tax-exempt income and regular income. If their 
provisional income exceeds $44,000, then up to 85 percent of their 
Social Security benefits are subject to tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are strategies that can mitigate the tax bite in  
retirement, such as carefully choosing beneficiaries for IRAs, 
selecting the best distribution options or using charitable giving 
strategies,'' Cates says. ``Taxpayers should discuss options with 
their financial planner, preferably before they retire.''

<HEADLINE>  Torre Managing Yankees Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Now this was a sight all of baseball enjoyed: Joe  
Torre back in uniform, back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly two months after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer,  
Torre returned Tuesday as manager of the New York Yankees and was 
greeted by a two-minute standing ovation from the rival fans at 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox were not quite so hospitable, winning 6-3 to  
move a half-game past the Yankees for the AL East lead. Still, 
Torre was happy he was healthy enough to be in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt very good, no fatigue,'' Torre said after the 3 1/2-hour  
game. ``I wish the result was better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees lost for the sixth time in seven games. Yet there  
was a sense Torre's presence would bring calm to the World Series 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the leader of our team and has been for a long time,''  
shortstop Derek Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Torre, who looked like he'd lost a little weight: ``With me  
being back, some of the players hinted, we won't be distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Don Zimmer, who managed the Yankees since Torre  
underwent surgery in St. Louis on March 18, returned to his more 
familiar role, sitting at his friend's side in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer talked about leaving baseball because of a bad knee once  
Torre returned. But Zimmer said he's looking to ``stick around for 
the rest of the season as long as the knee isn't bothering me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, said he made his decision Monday night, then took a  
flight with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to Boston on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's healthy and he's back and he's well,'' Steinbrenner said.  
``It's a special day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who guided the Yankees to two World Series titles in  
three years, said he called Zimmer in the morning to tell him the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said, `Are you ready to do the job you were hired to  
do?' '' Torre said. ``He said, `You bet I am.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``A great big hug and a tip of the hat from me,'' Torre said.  
``It was just more than he should have had heaped on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours before the game, Yankees general manager Brian  
Cashman walked up to Zimmer, shook his hand and whispered, ``Thank 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been ready to do this about a week,'' Torre said before  
the game. ``I think I'm all the way back. I don't anticipate 
missing any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urged by Zimmer to take the lineup card to home plate, instead  
of batting coach Chris Chambliss, Torre got a warm reception from 
the sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans began standing as soon as Torre stepped from the  
dugout, and continued clapping. The scoreboard flashed, ``Welcome 
Back, Joe Torre,'' and he tipped his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a 3-6 homestand, the Yankees fell to 21-16 as Pedro  
Martinez outpitched David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been chomping a little bit lately,'' Torre said. ``It's  
tough when we struggled here. I was feeling a little helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Torre did not make the one mistake he feared -- he was  
concerned he might accidentally move his hands and signal some 
unintended play. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre had been with the Yankees for some of their home and road  
games, though he had not felt ready to return on a full-time basis 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a doubt. I had to come back here to see,''  
Torre said. ``I want to busy my mind with something other than when 
the next test is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre will continue to undergo tests and said he expects further  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very fortunate,'' Torre said. ``Future? I'd like to  
keep doing this next year and the year after that. I'm going to 
take it a little bit at a time.''

	Their Office of Special Investigations was created in September  
1979 by Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti to enforce 1978 
legislation that barred Nazi persecutors from entering the United 
States and made them deportable if they were already here. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the office's fourth and current director, Eli M.  
Rosenbaum, 10 attorneys, eight historians, five paralegals, three 
secretaries and one translator are working on cases filed against 
17 individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	These cases are in various stages, from initial efforts to  
revoke citizenship because a Nazi past was concealed when the 
defendant entered the country and became a U.S. citizen, to 
deportation proceedings, to appeals through the Board of 
Immigration Appeals and the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 others are under active investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, 61 Nazi persecutors have been stripped of U.S.  
citizenship and 49 of them have been ousted from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The office also maintains a ``watchlist'' for U.S. immigration  
officers to use at air, land and seaports to deny entry to Nazi 
persecutors. That list contains more than 100,000 names, including 
those of about two dozen Japanese soldiers accused of war crimes 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on the watchlist is former U.N. Secretary General  
and Austrian chief of state Kurt Waldheim, whose activities in 
support of the Nazis were detailed in a special 1987 report by the 
office. It also issued a special report in 1992 confirming the 
death in South America of Dr. Josef Mengele, the dentist who 
conducted gruesome medical experiments on prisoners at the 
Auschwitz death camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The office's historians, many of whom hold doctorates, all speak  
German and at least one other foreign language, such as Polish, 
Russian, Lithuanian or another Slavic language. 
</P>
<P>
	They work with captured Nazi documents in the U.S. Archives and  
in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland. Nearly all the Nazi SS 
documents were captured and are available to them at the Berlin 
Document Center in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Once suspects are identified, the office seeks witnesses to  
their crimes by advertising in Jewish publications or among 
Holocaust survivor groups.

<HEADLINE> Old Red Wings or Just Old? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One moment they looked like the old Red Wings, but the moment  
after that, they just looked old. Another dynasty-in-the-making 
ends with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey is played too fast to see a team crumble over the span of  
a single game. But go back and look at freeze frames from 
Colorado's 5-2 series-clinching win Tuesday night in Detroit and 
it's tough to see how Hockeytown's future can be nearly as bright 
as its immediate past. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two years running, the Red Wings ended the season by  
drinking from the Stanley Cup. The two seasons before that, they 
could take some comfort in knowing they were beaten by the eventual 
champions -- the Avalanche in the Western Conference finals in 1996, 
and the New Jersey Devils in the Stanley Cup finals in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche vs. Red Wings is widely considered the toughest  
rivalry in sports, so there is no shame in losing. On the other 
hand, Detroit raised expectations by adding four big names to the 
roster just ahead of the trading deadline, then sweeping Anaheim to 
open the playoffs. And that may have been why the crash-and-burn 
nature of the second-round loss -- the Red Wings dropped four 
straight after winning the first two -- left everybody in the locker 
room wondering what's next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see the Cup going someplace else this year,''  
Detroit's Brendan Shanahan said. ``That's going to be the hardest 
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Red Wings fans might have to get used to it.  
</P>
<P>
	Their last night in contention for a third straight Cup got off  
to a terrible start, then turned, in the span of just 29 seconds, 
into something promising. Late in the second period, Detroit scored 
two quick goals to turn a 4-0 lead into 4-2 and slow Colorado's 
momentum from an avalanche to a crawl. And then, with 6 1/2 minutes 
left in the game, the night turned sour for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Peter Forsberg picked up the puck near center ice and  
broke toward Chris Osgood in the Detroit net. The only Red Wing 
with any chance of catching him was center Igor Larionov, who was 
already a teen-age prospect in the old Soviet hockey machine when 
Forsberg was born. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second, the age difference -- 13 years -- was apparent.  
Larionov clutched, grabbed and poked Forsberg, but lost contact 
with him soon enough. A second later, Forsberg deked Osgood on the 
backhand side, pulled the puck back to his forehand and deposited 
both the puck and himself into the net. It was Forsberg's second 
goal of the night and there was a certain symmetry to his being the 
hero, because he was the goat of the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole series, in fact, was punctuated by mood swings.  
Detroit won two on Colorado's ice. Forsberg got himself tossed from 
Game 1 for a vicious check on Shanahan from behind, leaving his 
shorthanded teammates to get beat in overtime. The Red Wings won 
Game 2 in regulation when Bill Ranford, their backup netminder, 
posted a shutout and played the way everybody expected Colorado's 
Patrick Roy would. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as if on cue, the two switched roles. Roy began playing  
like the best playoff goalie ever. Ranford answered questions about 
why he was filling in for the injured Osgood by playing like a 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado won two in Detroit and a third at home. In the deciding  
game Tuesday night, Roy was unyielding early and then, after the 
two Detroit scores got the crowd at Joe Louis back to its throaty 
best, solid enough to quiet the joint down. In a nice touch, the 
crowd got back on its feet for the final minute to pay tribute to 
the team and the coach, Scotty Bowman, for a great run before 
heading for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they'll return next fall to find a team nearly this  
competitive is anyone's guess. General manager Ken Holland made 
some bold moves to get the Red Wings back into a tough race at the 
end of March by trading for Ranford, Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson 
and Wendel Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The team responded by winning nine of the final 12 and crushing  
Anaheim in Round 1, but the years caught up with them all of a 
sudden. Chelios and Clark had one goal between them, Ranford went 
2-2 in the net and Samuelsson ended the playoffs in civilian 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, who's won a record-tying eight Stanley Cups as a coach,  
is talking retirement. Nick Lidstrom, Detroit's best defenseman, is 
talking about returning to Sweden to raise his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody learns from a champion,'' Colorado  
defenseman Aaron Miller said. ``I think these guys definitely give 
you a blueprint on how to win. They did it two years in a row. They 
can only beat you so many times before you look up and say, `What's 
going on here?' That's what we did.''

<HEADLINE> Cleopatra Goes to the Small Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Leonor Varela, the screen's newest Cleopatra, has  
a cold, but that's little surprise given the schedule she's been 
keeping on the set of television's latest blockbuster miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave birth on Saturday. I was swimming in a pool on Friday.  
I had an affair in a boat with Caesar going across the Nile on 
Thursday,'' says Varela, star of the four-hour, $28 million 
``Cleopatra'' airing Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 24 (``I'm telling you my age only because I'm polite''), the  
Chilean-born Varela is stepping into some fairly iconic sandals to 
play the exiled Egyptian queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleopatra's life has inspired plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, as  
well as a famous -- some would say infamous -- Elizabeth 
Taylor-Richard Burton movie, a 1963 Academy Award nominee for best 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Varela's co-stars in this latest offering include Billy Zane,  
Timothy Dalton and Rupert Graves as the various emperors and 
warriors in her midst. There also are 1,000 extras, 600 horses and 
the one ton of copper used to make the jewelry and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	If this ``Cleopatra'' were a feature film, it might cost as much  
as $150 million, says its British director, Franc Roddam 
(``Quadrophenia''), who filmed interior scenes at London's 
Shepperton Studios after six weeks on location in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Roddam directed TV's top-rated ``Moby Dick'' for the  
producer of ``Cleopatra,'' Robert Halmi Sr. By comparison, Roddam 
says, the current project is ``like doing two feature films 
back-to-back. It's a great workout for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, something big and magnificent happens,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are battles, assassinations, murders, strangulations,''  
he adds. ``There's no downtime on this picture, so what that does 
is add an incredibly rich texture to the piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that texture falls to Varela and Zane, the latter  
playing Marc Antony, the military hero who succumbs to Cleopatra's 
charms. Together, they must establish the chemistry to be 
convincing as two of the classical world's most heroic lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Varela appeared opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in ``The Man in the  
Iron Mask,'' a part that took her only a week to film compared with 
12 weeks on ``Cleopatra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleopatra, she says, is ``one of the greatest parts any woman  
could be given,'' and she isn't daunted) by her celluloid 
antecedent, Elizabeth Taylor, or the 1963 movie that was said to 
have cost more than $40 million, making it the most expensive of 
its time. 
</P>
<P>
	For this version, the square-cut look of Taylor's hair is  
replaced by Varela's own thick natural locks, topped more often 
than not by a regal headdress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have this image of Liz Taylor getting out of bed and being  
so overly made up,'' says Varela. By contrast, ``this is just so 
real. I have the sensation of a real human being that has her 
facets, her beliefs, her faith, her wounds, her difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zane, in turn, talks of ``stepping out of holiday mode'' as he  
returns to the set for his first day's filming since Christmas 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry, too much time off,'' he says, smiling to the crew  
following a bungled take. ``What movie are we making here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, still clad in flowing period garb, the 33-year-old  
Chicagoan best-known as the baddie from ``Titanic'' gives his own 
take on an affair of, well, titanic dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here is this woman, this last bastion,'' Zane says, ``this  
great, very wise, very strong female energy, keeping the candle lit 
in this windstorm of machismo and gangster tactics.'' 
</P>

	BIGGEST SMILE: ``Candid Camera'' has inaugurated an annual award  
for five people whose brilliant smiles most delighted the program's 
producers and viewers. Winners of the 1999 Smile Awards include 
James Scruggs of Seaside, Calif., whose infectious grin charmed 
viewers throughout a segment in which host Peter Funt insisted upon 
returning to him ``spare parts'' left over from work done on 
Scruggs' just-repaired vehicle. And 3-year-old Malcolm Jack of 
Phoenix, who delighted viewers by dancing in a supermarket aisle in 
time to music playing over the store's public address system. 
``Candid Camera'' airs Friday at 8:30 p.m. EDT on CBS.

<HEADLINE> Former Blue Jays Manager Gets Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tim Johnson, fired in spring training by the  
Toronto Blue Jays, was hired to manage in the Mexican league. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, fired in part for telling lies about serving in the  
Marines in Vietnam, took over the Mexico City Red Devils in the 
Triple-A-rated Mexican Baseball League before Wednesday's game 
against the Aguascalientes Railmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love baseball and as soon as they invited me to come to the  
Red Devils, I didn't hesitate to accept,'' Johnson told the 
newspaper Reforma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Devils, with a 31-23 record, are in second place in the  
league's central zone, eight games behind the Mexico City Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in Mexico City on Tuesday and was in the stands as  
the Red Devils beat Aguascalientes 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 49, led Toronto to an 88-74 record last year, but  
admitted in November that he had told people he served in Vietnam 
while he actually had been in the Marine reserves in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to conflicts with some players and coaches and the team  
fired him on March 17, during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had coached the Hermosillo team in the Mexican winter  
baseball league for six years, winning the championship in 1990 and 
1992.

<HEADLINE> Luyendyk Waits To Qualify for 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis 500 qualifications can't come  
soon enough for the Treadway Racing team of Arie Luyendyk and Sam 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, a two-time Indy winner who is retiring after the May  
30 race, and Schmidt, his heir as lead driver with one of the top 
teams in the Indy Racing League, have their cars just where they 
want them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're there, we know what the car is capable of and I think we  
have a pretty good idea of what we need to do to get the car ready 
to qualify,'' Schmidt said. ``Now we're running with a full load, 
trying different fuel settings, stuff that most teams don't have 
time to get to, and I never had time to get to in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart and Greg Ray also appear plenty ready. After  
posting two of the best speeds in his primary and backup cars 
earlier in the week, Ray took a third Team Menard car out on 
Wednesday and turned an even faster lap at 226.085 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart went even quicker later in the day with a 226.683. Other  
fast laps were by Luyendyk at 225.096, Kenny Brack at 224.411, 
Stephan Gregoire at 224.193, Robby Unser at 224.042 and rookie 
Robby McGehee at 224.025. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt took it easy, with a top lap at 223.120.  
</P>
<P>
	Qualifications begin on Saturday. While Luyendyk and Schmidt  
have been among the most consistent and fastest drivers since 
practice began last weekend, the remaining track time is helping 
other teams who didn't have the early speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the short amount of time we had, it was very  
productive,'' said Stewart, who missed the opening day because of a 
NASCAR race and will have to leave early Saturday to race in The 
Winston at Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to get my confidence back and see how the car  
is,'' said rookie Mike Borkowski, who crashed Monday and was back 
on the track in a rebuilt car that still had some problems. ``They 
put me out there with a huge understeer. ... We only have one car, 
so we can't afford to take chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His top lap Wednesday was under 216.  
</P>
<P>
	Gregoire, meanwhile, improved his best speed in practice on  
Tuesday to more than 223 mph, a leap of more than 4 mph, and went 
even faster on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for our guys. They've been working hard changing  
parts every day,'' Gregoire said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few others didn't have as good fortune.  
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Dave Steele crashed in the first turn and was treated at  
Methodist Hospital for a mild concussion and back strain and then 
released. Tyce Carlson and Mark Dismore also hit the wall in 
separate crashes but were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifications to determine the 33-car lineup are set for  
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to qualify tomorrow, actually,'' Luyendyk  
said. ``Sam has been running really strong. ... At this moment, 
we're looking pretty good with time. If we don't have any 
mechanical problems, we're really OK on schedule. The team is well 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, the only driver to win at least one race in each of  
the first three seasons the Indy Racing League has been in 
operation, is preparing for his 15th start at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He already holds track records for speed in practice,  
qualifications and the race -- all set before the IRL adopted a new 
engine-chassis package that produced slower speeds -- and he's 
Indy's career money leader with more than $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt was the third-fastest rookie qualifier at Indianapolis  
with Blueprint Racing in 1997. He finished 34th in an expanded 
field of 35 starters after an engine problem on the pace lap. Last 
year, he started sixth, but wound up 26th after a multicar crash on 
the 48th lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even before this year, Arie was one of the guys that was  
approachable. Arie was very helpful,'' Schmidt said. ``You ask him 
a question, you get a straight answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in a lot of team situations, and this one is as good  
or better than any other one because it's like an open book. There 
are no secrets,'' he said. ``All the information we have is totally 
accessible (to Luyendyk's crew), as what they're doing with their 
car is open to us. So that really helps. You can accomplish a lot 
of things every day.''

<HEADLINE> Grants Boost Historical Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Silent films, labs used in the Manhattan  
Project and remnants of the Apollo space program are among the 
national treasures that will be preserved through $30 million in 
federal grants announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton warned of risks to the nation's  
collective memory if historic and culturally significant sites and 
artifacts continue to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Those treasures, she said, represent ``the creativity and  
ingenuity that have always fueled progress in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 62 sites and artifacts receiving grants are in 24 states,  
the District of Columbia and the Midway Islands. The selections 
were based on recommendations by a panel of five preservation 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sketch a breathtaking portrait of America's diverse  
culture and rich history,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a briefing in the 
White House East Room. ``A country that loses its history loses its 
collective memory. We cannot allow that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Film Preservation Foundation in San Francisco will  
get $1 million to save silent films, which Mrs. Clinton referred to 
as the ``precursors to the latest `Star Wars' prequel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other ``Save America's Treasures'' grants include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$700,000 to restore buildings related to the Manhattan Project,  
the secret research that unleashed the atomic bomb during World War 
II. The complex at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico 
will be open to the public for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.4 million to conserve more than 2,500 Apollo-era artifacts  
collected by the National Air and Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.1 million to complete restoration of the Washington  
Monument, which needs more work than initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
	--$3 million to restore the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key  
to write ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--$620,000 to restore Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where  
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. 
</P>
<P>
	--$1.5 million to conserve 13th century cliff dwellings at what  
is now the Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Grants range in amount from $50,000 to $3 million and will also  
be used to preserve art collections, Indian heritage, historic 
documents and exemplary architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is to visit Mesa Verde on Saturday as part of a  
four-day tour of national treasures in the Southwest. The grant 
announcement was the kickoff for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal grants will require a match from state, local or  
private sources. Mrs. Clinton said private leaders already have 
raised more than $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has requested $30 million in fiscal 2000 for  
additional grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., whose district will receive $900,000 to  
preserve Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater retreat, promised to use 
his seat on the House Appropriations Committee to get more money. 
At the briefing, he also alluded to speculation about whether Mrs. 
Clinton will run for the Senate seat in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a great admirer of Senator Clinton, um, first lady  
Clinton,'' Murtha said to laughter.

<HEADLINE> CBS Shuffles Fall TV Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Top-rated CBS will add three new comedies and  
three new dramas in the fall, and shuffle its schedule by moving 
``Cosby,'' ``Chicago Hope'' and ``60 Minutes II'' to new nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is canceling ``Promised Land'' and ``L.A. Docs.''  
Its long-running comedy, ``The Nanny,'' is retiring this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cosby'' will move from Monday to Wednesday nights in  
September, and ``60 Minutes II'' will switch from Wednesdays to 
Tuesdays. CBS will run a movie on Wednesday nights in the fall, 
instead of Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of CBS's new shows are legal dramas with women as central  
characters. ``Family Law'' stars Kathleen Quinlan in a show about 
lawyers who form a new firm after one woman's husband leaves her 
and takes their practice with him. Amy Brenneman stars in ``Judging 
Amy,'' about a single mother who leaves New York City to become a 
judge in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Its other new shows are: ``Now &AMP; Again,'' a drama about an  
insurance salesman whose body is rebuilt by the government after he 
dies; ``Ladies Man,'' a comedy about a furniture maker who lives 
with a family of women; ``Work With Me,'' a comedy about two 
married lawyers who work at home; and ``Love or Money,'' an 
ensemble comedy about residents in a New York apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other networks, CBS is sensing some vulnerability in NBC's  
Thursday night schedule, the most dominant night in television for 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has retooled ``Chicago Hope'' by asking creator David E.  
Kelley to become more involved in it again, and will move the drama 
to Thursday nights at 9 p.m. ET. Both ABC and the WB, which 
released its schedules on Tuesday, also promised aggressive efforts 
to go after NBC on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``ER'' are all at the top  
of the ratings, NBC's Thursday strength has faded somewhat this 
year -- especially among younger viewers, ABC entertainment 
president Jamie Tarses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody's going to chip away a little at them,''  
said CBS President Leslie Moonves. ``There's no reason to believe 
they're not going to decline even further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC will move last summer's popular replacement series, ``Whose  
Line Is it Anyway?'' to Thursday nights. It is also introducing a 
drama about a 25-year-old virgin and her friends from Kevin 
Williamson, the creative force behind ``Dawson's Creek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the WB is shifting its popular series, ``Charmed,''  
to Thursday nights in the fall. The WB will begin broadcasting on 
its sixth night -- Fridays -- in September and is adding a spinoff 
series from ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' among six new shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also has six new shows, its smallest lineup of newcomers in  
10 years, and is shifting ``Spin City'' to fill the Tuesday 
schedule hole created by the departure of ``Home Improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC made critical strides this season, but ratings continued to  
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	The network has high hopes for ``Snoops,'' a drama about private  
investigators in Los Angeles starring Gina Gershon. It's the 
brainchild of Kelley, creator of ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new show will air on Sundays, usually the most-watched night  
of television, just before another Kelley series, ``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WB, the only network to see its ratings go up this year, is  
canceling ``Smart Guy,'' ``The Wayans Brothers'' and ``Rescue 77.'' 
The comedy ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' is to return in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of the network's half-hour situation comedies will be  
on Friday nights. The rest of the week the network's schedule will 
consist entirely of hour-long dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These shows aren't traditional fare,'' said Susanne Daniels,  
the WB entertainment president. ``They blur the lines between 
comedy and drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Boreanaz, who played Sarah Michelle Gellar's boyfriend in  
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' will have his own show, ``Angel.'' 
The freshman series, ``Felicity,'' will switch to Sundays.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visiting Victims' Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's trip today to Littleton,  
Colo., on the one-month anniversary of the massacre at Columbine 
High School retraces sadly familiar terrain for the president, who 
traveled one year ago to Oregon and another high school ravaged by 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Oregon incident, two students were killed and 22 injured  
during a rampage by a 15-year-old suspect also accused of killing 
his parents the day before and leaving their home rigged with 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	But something about Columbine -- where 12 students and a teacher  
were killed and 23 others were injured before students Eric Harris 
and Dylan Klebold turned their arsenal on themselves -- made it the 
last straw for a violence-weary nation, Clinton said Wednesday as 
he prepared to meet with victims' families and survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aftermath of that shooting, I think, has had an even more  
profound impact on the country than all the school shootings last 
year did. And you can see it by what is happening in the Congress 
now,'' Clinton said, referring to gun control measures working 
their way through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is finally a feeling that it's time for  
everybody to stop making excuses, it's time for everybody to stop 
trying to place blame and instead to basically say, 'I would like 
to assume whatever my share of responsibility is for giving a safe 
childhood back to our children.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke about the trip at a Democratic National Committee  
fund-raising event in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his wife, Hillary, were meeting with victims'  
relatives at Littleton's World Roman Catholic Church, which is 
about three miles from Columbine and the place where counselors 
worked with survivors after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	After those private meetings, which press secretary Joe Lockhart  
called ``a more personal session rather than a sort of policy 
session,'' the Clintons travel to Dakota Ridge High School to 
address Columbine students, rescuers and community leaders, before 
returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Lockhart said, wants to ``articulate how the  
country shares the grief of the Littleton students and the 
Littleton community, and highlight the remarkable resilience of 
these students and of this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Lapp said his 16-year-old son, Joshua, who escaped from  
the Columbine library, will attend the meeting. But he is not sure 
if the visit will help Joshua recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that's going to help kids like my son is a lot  
of counseling,'' Randy Lapp said. ``That's the only way he can deal 
with this.' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Mauser, whose son Daniel was killed, said he was looking  
forward to meeting with Clinton. Mauser has criticized the National 
Rifle Association, and formed a gun-control group called Sane 
Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we'll talk about my son,'' Mauser said. He also  
plans to give the president some written questions, which he 
declined to specify. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Saltzman, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Public  
Schools District, said the president's visit ``is a wonderful 
opportunity for students to see a visible sign of the caring there 
is throughout the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping it will help the healing process,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tom Selleck Battles Jedi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Selleck doesn't look worried.  
</P>
<P>
	Here he's about to face off against a cabal of intergalactic  
warriors and this macho man of actors would rather daydream about 
kicking back on his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed inconsequential to him that his latest movie, the  
romantic comedy ``The Love Letter,'' was opening on the same 
weekend as the hyper-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	The business side of show business bores the 54-year-old  
Selleck, who is so philosophical about his profession, he sounds 
more like Don Quixote than Thomas Magnum, the playboy private eye 
he portrayed for eight years on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to act, but I'm not fond of the business of acting,''  
he said in his trademark growl. ``Actors have this sense that there 
is a noble quest to their profession, that you're looking for some 
truth or beauty to what you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the hardest part is keeping the inevitable anxieties  
about ``how much will my movie gross?'' from tainting a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise you develop a cynicism about what you're doing,'' he  
said. ``You have to connect with the audience, and there are no 
excuses with them. They don't care if you haven't worked in a week, 
or if you're unhappy. ... That's not in the credits at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck has played affable rogues such as one-third of the  
freewheeling team of bachelors in ``Three Men and a Baby'' and the 
headstrong gay journalist in ``In and Out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his character in ``The Love Letter'' -- a lovelorn fireman  
named George Mathias -- is no charismatic leading man. He even lacks 
that famous push-broom mustache. 
</P>
<P>
	So what was the best part about playing the workaday Joe who  
falls for a woman who finds an anonymous love note? The antique 
fire engine George uses to take women out on dates, Selleck 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd spend a lot of time waiting for the next scene, and I had  
the chance to play around inside this thing,'' the 6-foot-4-inch 
actor said, grinning beneath his dark beard and leaning forward as 
if revealing a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	After discovering the fire engine's loudspeaker, he amused  
himself by making gag announcements to anyone within earshot -- 
which was practically the entire New England town where the film 
was shot. His favorite was demanding that everyone evacuate their 
homes and buildings for an impromptu game of volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``The Love Letter'' having a tiny opening in the formidable  
shadow of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' Selleck 
and others associated with the film were counting on attracting 
older audiences not interested in being Force-fed a space opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said he has no specific plans for what he'll do next,  
except for the offhand shrug followed by, ``I think I'd like to do 
a Western.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's eager for a hit with ``The Love Letter,'' which also stars  
Kate Capshaw. But he said previous success has given him the 
comfortable position of working for enjoyment rather than survival. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early days of ``Magnum P.I.,'' a Screen Actors Guild  
strike left him without a paycheck and he had to work odd jobs to 
pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to stop myself now and say, I need to do what my  
obligations are as a father, no matter how much I want these other 
parts, whatever they may be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Selleck has taken time off to spend with his family  
and tend to his Southern California ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have the financial resources to take time away from  
work and you don't, isn't that a little more indicting than if you 
literally have to work to put food on the table?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck also dips into political and social issues when taking  
time off, and there was a time earlier in the decade when 
supporters were pushing him to run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has championed conservative causes, including public  
support for the National Rifle Association, he declined comment on 
renewed calls for greater gun control in the aftermath of the 
school shootings in Littleton, Colo. He was simply tired of talking 
about it.

<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament OKs New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Sergei Stepashin was easily approved as Russia's  
new prime minister today after he warned lawmakers that Russia 
needed immediate and courageous policies to rescue its battered 
economy and avoid social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, voted 297-55 to  
confirm Stepashin following the dismissal last week of his popular 
predecessor, Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	It took the usually hostile Duma just three hours to debate and  
approve the confirmation of a man who is a top loyalist of 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, who headed the nation's police and internal security  
forces as interior minister, appeared relieved when the result 
flashed up on a big electronic screen in the Duma. He thanked 
legislators and said he hoped that months of bruising political 
confrontation were over. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably means one thing: We're all united by pain for  
our motherland and our people and the wish to see our country 
finally become normal, civilized, rich, prosperous and decent,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval came after the Communist-dominated Duma failed last  
week to launch impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin. Lawmakers 
clearly did not want another confrontation with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the major factions voiced objections to Stepashin's  
confirmation during brief hearings before the vote. Even some of 
the Communists said they would support the new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected a lot of difficult and angry questions today, but  
there were none,'' Stepashin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duma Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said after the vote that  
Stepashin would be under Yeltsin's thumb. ``If Stepashin disobeys, 
he and his team will be immediately dismissed,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin congratulated Stepashin on his confirmation and said he  
was pleased with the Duma vote, according to a presidential 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition lawmakers said they backed Stepashin because they  
feared Yeltsin would turn to a more radical candidate if his first 
choice were rejected. Many lawmakers, tired of months of political 
confrontation, said they hoped Stepashin would be in office for at 
least the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin's immediate task is to name a Cabinet, which will have  
to be approved by Yeltsin. The Communists warned they would oppose 
the naming of liberal reformers to the Cabinet, but the Duma cannot 
block any ministerial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address to lawmakers before the vote, Stepashin promised  
to tackle Russia's huge economic and social problems. He said 
Russia needs bold and effective policies to reverse years of 
economic decline, but he spelled out few details. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for half-measures and compromises any  
longer,'' he told the Duma. ``Time demands courageous and 
thoroughly verified steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, who has no experience in economic administration,  
said his predecessor had stabilized the economy, but policies that 
could solve Russia's problems had not been adopted. He also pledged 
his strong loyalty to Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The previous government of Primakov did not allow the country  
to plunge into the abyss, yet we have failed so far to drastically 
change the situation either in economics or in the social sphere,'' 
Stepashin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, already struggling with years of economic collapse, is  
still reeling after it was hit in August by the global crisis in 
developing markets. The Russian government was forced to devalue 
the ruble and defaulted on some loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin told lawmakers that he had no intention of resorting  
to unconstitutional policies or means. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not General Pinochet, my name is Stepashin,'' he said in  
a reference to the former Chilean ruler whose policies were 
attacked by human rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Yeltsin's health was again thrown into question  
Tuesday when diplomats said he was sick with bronchitis. The 
Kremlin denied it. Yeltsin was at work at the Kremlin today, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has a history of health problems, including several  
heart attacks, that have prompted sustained worries about his 
fitness to govern.

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Leafs Brewing Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite being separated by just 107 miles,  
Buffalo and Toronto have little hockey history between them. That 
figures to change in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Maple Leafs played five games this season after  
realignment sent the Leafs to the Eastern Conference. The Sabres 
won three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams could play as many as seven more games as they chase a  
berth in the Stanley Cup finals. That's a lot of traffic on the 
Peace Bridge, the span that links the two regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference best-of-7 final starts in Toronto on  
Sunday. The media already have named it the ``QEW Series'' after 
Queen Elizabeth Way, the highway between Toronto and the 
Buffalo-Niagara Falls area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be pretty intense,'' Leafs president Ken Dryden said.  
``We want rivalries, and rivalries get spawned in playoff series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo and Toronto have enough in common to nurture a rivalry.  
Both have plenty of ice and snow. Both are stocked with hockey 
fans. And the two cities are only a 90-minute drive apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for everybody outside the dressing room, for the  
fans, for Buffalo, for Toronto,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, 
whose playoff record is 18-7, including last year's trip to the 
conference final. ``You talk about building rivalries, all of a 
sudden we've got one that's an hour and a half away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-clad Leafs fans made their way to Buffalo's Marine Midland  
Arena in such large numbers that the Sabres sometimes wondered 
which city they were playing in. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had as many fans in our building as we had,'' said  
Buffalo center Brian Holzinger. ``And we had a lot of fans up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leafs fans have wormed their way onto the Buffalo roster. Sabres  
captain Michael Peca and defenseman Jason Woolley grew up rooting 
for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	After Buffalo disposed of Boston in the sixth game of the  
conference semifinal Tuesday night, Woolley, a Toronto native, said 
his biggest worry going into the Toronto series was how to handle 
all the ticket requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca, who grew up in a Toronto suburb, said he and Woolley joked  
about the Leafs fans pouring out of bars and honking their horns on 
Yonge Street after Toronto eliminated Pittsburgh on Monday night. 
``That used to be us,'' Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are fast and have solid goaltenders. Buffalo's  
Dominik Hasek ranks third in the playoffs with a 1.77 goals-against 
average and leads with a save percentage of .942. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto's Curtis Joseph sits one place behind Hasek in the  
rankings with equally impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the two best goaltenders in the conference going at  
it right now,'' said Ruff, whose Sabres had a tough enough time 
with Boston's Byron Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have one more thing in common -- frustration. The  
Sabres haven't advanced to the Stanley Cup finals since 1975. The 
Flyers won the Cup that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs haven't made it to the championship round since they  
won the Cup in a series with Montreal in 1967. Toronto lost to 
Vancouver in the 1994 Western Conference final.

<HEADLINE> Researcher: Depression Is Treatable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once depression has settled in for a couple  
years it's considered difficult to treat. But a study reported 
today provides new hope for people with long-standing cases of the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining a special psychotherapy with an antidepressant,  
researchers achieved a ``mind-boggling'' level of success against 
chronic depression, said Dr. Martin B. Keller of the Brown 
University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was paid for by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The company  
makes Serzone, the antidepressant used in the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 85 percent of patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy  
showed a good response or even remission, said Keller, an author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	He reported initial results of the study, which is continuing,  
at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. He 
also spoke Tuesday at a news conference and in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert C. Schulberg, a psychologist at the University of  
Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was familiar with the results, 
called them impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does point to a direction to be pursued,'' he said in a  
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The study began with 681 people who had depression for at least  
two years. Half the participants had been ill for more than 20 
years, and most had never had an adequate attempt at treatment, 
Keller said. Their average age was the early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:  
Serzone only, psychotherapy only, or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychotherapy, called the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis  
System of Psychotherapy, was developed especially for chronic 
depression but is not widely used. Patients focus on specific 
troublesome situations, learn how to solve their problems in 
relating to other people and take responsibility for the 
consequences of their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants assigned to the psychotherapy got 16 to 20 sessions  
over the 12-week treatment period. Those assigned to Serzone, also 
called nefazodone, took it twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 12 weeks, about 25 percent of patients dropped out of  
each of the three treatment groups, which is a low loss for such 
studies. Of those who remained in the study 12 weeks, 55 percent 
who'd taken Serzone alone and 52 percent of those who'd gotten 
psychotherapy alone showed a response on a standard scale measuring 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who received the combined treatment showed an 85 percent  
response rate. 
</P>
<P>
	A response meant a remission or a big enough improvement on the  
scale to be considered satisfactory. In this latter group, ``by no 
means are they all better,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three treatment groups, about half the responders showed  
a remission. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said it would be reasonable to study whether a drug other  
than Serzone would work as well in combination with the 
psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulberg, the psychologist, said that to get results like those  
in the study, mental health providers would have to learn to do the 
special psychotherapy or otherwise make it available, monitor 
patient progress closely and alter the medication dose or course of 
psychotherapy accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Forbes' NH Campaign Manager Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Conservative activist Peter Robbio resigned  
as New Hampshire campaign manager for Steve Forbes after being 
arrested for pulling a gun on three men in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbio was arrested April 16 at a Manchester bar, Manchester  
Police Lt. Mark Putney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He resigned from Forbes' campaign staff the next day, saying he  
didn't have time to run another campaign, said Bill Dal Col, 
Forbes' national campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running the New Hampshire presidential primary is more than a  
full-time job,'' Robbio said. ``For personal reasons, I just don't 
have that time. ... I told them it would be best for the campaign 
if I stepped down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putney said Robbio bumped into another patron without  
apologizing; the two then got into an argument, and Robbio 
brandished a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home Wednesday night, Robbio said he would not  
comment on his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has asked Graham Shafer, former political director of the  
Tennessee Republican Party, to take Robbio's place. Schafer spends 
summers in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Tyco Buying Raychem for $2.87 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Tyco International Ltd. said Wednesday  
it will buy Raychem Corp. for about $2.87 billion in cash and 
stock, in a bid to strengthen its position as a leading electronics 
supplier to the telecommunications and automotive industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Raychem, a designer, manufacturer and distributor of electronic  
components which had 1998 revenue of $1.8 billion, would merge with 
a subsidiary of Bermuda-based Tyco, which expects to have more than 
$22 billion in revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco International is a diversified manufacturing and service  
company with operations in more than 80 countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a leader in making fire protection systems and providing  
electronic security services. It also makes and services electrical 
and electronic components and underwater telecommunications systems 
and makes flow control valves, disposable medical products and 
plastics and adhesives. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the  
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seemed to like the combination. Raychem stock shot up  
more than 16 percent, or $5.12 1/2, to close at $36.25 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, while Tyco shares closed up more than 4 percent, or 
$4.12 1/2, at $93.50 also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Raychem shareholders would get about $37 a share for their stock  
under terms of the deal. That includes about $1.4 billion in cash 
and 16.1 million newly issued Tyco shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard A. Kashnow, chairman and chief executive of Raychem,  
said the deal will ``result in an expanded set of offerings for our 
customers'' and enable both companies to grow faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica SA  
said Wednesday that it has sold its underwater-cable unit, Temasa, 
to a unit of Tyco International for about $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Temasa specializes in installing and maintaining fiber-optic  
cables on the ocean floor. The Tyco unit, Tyco Submarine Systems 
Ltd., specializes in servicing underwater cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's former telecommunications monopoly said the deal  
strengthens its links with Tyco. Last week, the companies signed a 
$900 million project to link South America, Central America and the 
U.S. through a network of underwater cables.

<HEADLINE> Trie's Manager Testifies at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The manager of Yah Lin ``Charlie''  
Trie's local office told investigators that the Democratic 
fund-raiser reimbursed six Arkansas residents for making 
contributions to President Clinton's legal defense fund, an FBI 
agent testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys accused prosecutors of trying to ``infect this  
jury'' with testimony regarding separate charges against Trie made 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. instructed the jury to  
disregard FBI agent Roberta Parker's testimony that she had been 
told Trie funneled money to the defense fund and the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie is on trial for obstruction of justice.  
</P>
<P>
	Parker investigated Trie for a Washington grand jury that later  
charged him with making and arranging illegal political 
contributions to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker also testified that Maria ``Dia'' Mapili told authorities  
she spoke with Trie on numerous occasions regarding publicity about 
his fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mapili testified Tuesday that Trie told her as early as  
January 1997 to destroy related documents stored at his Little Rock 
home. She said the documents related to past business deals as well 
as invitations to the White House and to political events and 
contributions to the DNC. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mapili, the prosecution's chief witness, appeared to  
bolster the defense with her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	As prosecutors said she would, Mrs. Mapili testified that Trie  
ordered her get rid of documents sought in a Senate investigation 
into political fund-raising in the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read part of the subpoena to him. He told me to get rid of  
the documents,'' she testified. ``I throw out some documents. At 
some point I stopped. I was nervous and scared. I hid some 
documents in a credenza and under his bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, under defense questioning, Mrs. Mapili said the  
conversation may have occurred months before or after she received 
a subpoena to provide documents to the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a central figure in the controversy over foreign-linked  
campaign donations to Democrats, could face up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of impeding the Senate 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	He would face even stiffer penalties if convicted in Washington  
of charges that he made and arranged illegal contributions from 
foreigners to the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie is accused of making illegal contributions to buy access to  
Clinton and other top officials for himself and the likes of 
Chinese arms dealer Wang Jun. Wang is an adviser to the Chinese 
government whose company, Poly Technologies, has been implicated in 
the smuggling of arms into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC has returned $640,000 that Trie raised. Clinton's legal  
defense fund has returned another $460,000.

<HEADLINE> New-Look AT&AMP;T Hosts Shareholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., having already committed $100 billion  
to acquisitions for its new cable-telephone strategy, is still 
shopping around for investments, the company said Wednesday at its 
annual shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive C. Michael Armstrong also stressed  
that AT&AMP;T needs a smooth transition at Tele-Communications Inc. and 
MediaOne Group, the two cable TV companies already being acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest challenge for us is to execute against the  
potential of all these acquisitions,'' he said, referring to the 
company's ambitious plan to use cable TV wires for phone and 
Internet service too. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T president John Zeglis added that the company will likely  
make more investments in foreign companies, as it has in Canada and 
Japan, to expand its global network. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said Wednesday it has begun testing a new  
wireless service in Dallas using a pizza box-sized receiver for 
local and long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The past year has seen AT&AMP;T acquire TCI, the nation's second  
biggest cable company, and strike a deal to buy No. 4 MediaOne 
after winning a bidding war last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all pending agreements, AT&AMP;T would surpass Time Warner  
as the nation's top cable operator, with 16 million subscribers and 
systems capable of reaching more than 25 million homes with cable 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T plans to offer packages of TV, phone and Internet  
service over those cable lines, it is also working on deals to sell 
its phone service to Time Warner and Comcast cable customers. 
</P>
<P>
	If those agreements are finalized, AT&AMP;T phone service may one  
day be available in more than 60 million homes, or about 60 percent 
of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Criticizes American Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle, who cited a TV sitcom character in  
his 1992 critique of the American culture, has created himself a 
new family-values villain for his 2000 presidential campaign: ``the 
legal aristocracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president coined that phrase to describe liberal  
lawyers, legal advocacy groups and federal judges in an address 
today to mark the seventh anniversary of his Murphy Brown speech. 
Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, are lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take courage to challenge this self-anointed group,''  
Quayle said in a speech prepared for delivery today to the 
Commonwealth Club of California. 
</P>
<P>
	In an address to the same group during the 1992 campaign, Quayle  
discussed the importance of family values in a culture of violence, 
drugs and sex. He used as an example TV sitcom character Murphy 
Brown, an unwed mother, and was ridiculed for attacking a fictional 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years later, Quayle picks up where he left off.  
</P>
<P>
	``Which is the greatest challenge facing America today? Jobs or  
values?'' Quayle asked. ``Values matter most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ventured into the prickly debate over gun control, saying,  
``Quick-fix artists are now in a frenzy over guns'' after the 
Colorado school shootings. Quayle supports instant background 
checks for the purchase of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``But let's be honest and recognize that the overriding issue  
isn't really gun control, it's self-control. A child who loves God, 
honors his parents, and respects his neighbors will not kill 
anyone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The way to stop school shootings, Quayle said, is to change the  
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I want to focus on a sector of our society that has been  
largely exempt from the discussion and must be part of our effort 
to reverse the cultural decline: the legal system, and, 
specifically, the legal aristocracy,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The authority of parents is undermined by an international  
treaty on children's rights, policies of the American Bar 
Association and an administration that led children to believe they 
can sue their parents, Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based ABA declined to comment before reviewing the  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The authority of school officials to keep classrooms safer is  
undermined by lawsuits that challenge their efforts at every step, 
Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, let's remind ourselves that all students need a moral  
education, but the legal aristocracy has obstructed their ability 
to receive it,'' Quayle said, referring to restrictions on school 
prayer. ``The separation of church and state has come to mean all 
state, no church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised, if elected, to nominate federal judges who  
``appreciate the indispensable role of religion and morality in our 
society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, GOP rival Gary Bauer says the Bush-Quayle  
administration nominated some of the judges who are now part of 
what he calls the ``judicial elites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The next president of the United States must change this  
course,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Columbine High School shootings,  
presidential candidates in both parties are talking about the 
decline of American values. Quayle believes the abuse he took in 
1992 gives him an upper hand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In laying out his case against the legal system, he cited cases  
and the courts that acted on them, and singled out the Legal 
Services Corporation and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he would appoint a watchdog at the Justice  
Department to find legal test cases ``to win back authority for 
parents and schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In fulfilling its cultural agenda, the legal aristocracy has  
not worked alone. It was aided by a willing and compliant news 
media and an entertainment community that transmits counterculture 
values,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They live in gated communities and send their children to  
expensive private schools,'' he said. ``This is their world. But 
it's not the real world.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Down on Good Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade on favorable harvesting and planting 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures were pressured by mild, dry weather in  
Midwest growing regions, which should speed farmer fieldwork for 
what is expected to be bumper acreage. With the world still reeling 
from the effects of a global economic crisis, the prospect for 
another large harvest has sent prices reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also fell after China purchased 40,000 metric tons of  
soybeans from South American competitors 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by reports farmers were seeing  
above-average yields during harvesting of the winter wheat crop, 
which accounts for much of total wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.21 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 4 cents to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .48 cent to 62.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .55 cent to 73.92 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 1.83 cents to 56.07 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .40

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises to 7-Mo. High Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose Wednesday to a seven-month high  
against the Japanese yen as the Federal Reserve's new bias toward 
raising interest rates made U.S. investments more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also gained versus the euro in the aftermath of  
Tuesday's meeting by Fed officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bankers didn't raise the Fed's key lending rates,  
but revealed a heightened concern they may need to slow the economy 
to prevent an inflationary spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro drew some support Wednesday from news of various  
diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting in Yugoslavia. U.S., 
Finnish and Russian negotiators flew in and out of several European 
capitals and G-8, the group representing the world's seven largest 
industrialized nations and Russia, was meeting in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 124.21 yen in late New York trading, up from  
Tuesday's late quote of 123.20 yen and the highest level since the 
exchange rate plunged below 130 yen in early October. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0657, falling from $1.0680 in  
Tuesday's late trading in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5040  
Swiss Francs, up from 1.4989; and 1.4673 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4654. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.6173 from late Tuesday's $1.6207.  
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8352 German marks, up from 1.8312; 6.1538 French francs, up from 
6.1425; and 1,818.18 Italian lire, up from 1,811.59.

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just after midnight, in a theater close, close  
by, the Wookie wannabes, the Darth fakers and the rainstorm 
troopers turned out in droves today for the first peek at the 
``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Force was here again, fresh ``Star Wars' material  
for the first time in 16 years. Was ``Star Wars: Episode One -- The 
Phantom Menace'' worth the wait? 
</P>
<P>
	``The best of the bunch,'' declared 16-year-old Phillip DeBono,  
born six years after the film that started it all. ``It's as good 
as Darth Vader is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm was shared by the rest of the sold-out crowd that  
saw this morning's debut screening of the $115 million film. 
``Excellent!'' and ``Fantastic!'' they told rain-soaked fans still 
waiting outside New York's Ziegfeld Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was the same at theaters, cineplexes and malls across  
the country, from Charleston, W.Va., to Des Moines, Iowa, to Los 
Angeles. Some companies were bracing for a ``Phantom'' sickout; one 
employment agency has estimated that 2.2 million people will skip 
work today to see the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Deans, 26, a paralegal from Brooklyn, said he would still  
be able to make it to work this morning after a 6:30 a.m. 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years to see this,'' he said. ``It brings  
back the child in all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowd, which filled all 1,162 seats at $9.50 a pop,  
partied on the street for hours before the first show at the 
Manhattan theater. It was an eclectic bunch -- Obi Wan Kenobis of 
all shapes and sizes, a wide assortment of Princess Leia hairdos, 
scalpers asking $100 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will go on ... and on ... and on. ``The Phantom  
Menace'' was playing around the clock at five New York City 
theaters. Midnight showings were offered in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, and a midnight show in Indianapolis was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Upbeat reviews from fans were in a different stratosphere from  
critics' pans. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Keith Arbeeny, who wore a storm trooper's helmet: ``It  
took you almost to another world. It was mind-boggling, like 
nothing I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News: ``It's all  
sound and fury and special effects, signifying nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Robert Farrell, who paid $100 to a scalper: ``It was  
worth every penny. The special effects are out of this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Todd McCarthy in Variety: ``It is neither captivating  
nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Aaron Savage, dressed as character Darth Maul: ``The  
movie was great -- really, really great. It was a real fan's 
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You get the point: the movie is critic-proof.  
</P>
<P>
	No one is asking if ``The Phantom Menace'' will make money; the  
question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach 
the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-day opening window, ``Menace'' was expected to beat  
the opening record of $90.2 million set by ``Lost World: Jurassic 
Park'' in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by George Lucas, ``The Phantom  
Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a 
generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid 
named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were 
lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an 
aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Censures, Fines Datek Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first investor-protection action  
against a company in the burgeoning Internet brokerage business, 
federal regulators have censured and fined Datek Online Brokerage 
Services Corp. for allegedly using its customers' money to pay some 
of its expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	While the alleged actions didn't cause any customers to lose  
money, the Securities and Exchange Commission maintained they 
violated the customer-protection provisions of the federal 
securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek and its former chief financial officer agreed in a  
settlement to the censure and fines, totaling $60,000, the SEC 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek, based in Iselin, N.J., is one of the nation's biggest  
online brokerages, processing more than 500,000 trades a day. With 
online customers now accounting for about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades, the mushrooming industry is expected to be pulling in 
some 10 million amateur investors by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action could be followed by similar moves against  
other online brokerages. The market watchdog agency has been 
conducting an extensive review of Internet trading firms 
nationwide. In addition to looking for violations of securities 
laws, the auditors have been examining how well firms execute 
orders and warn customers of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt challenged the  
online brokerage industry to provide better warnings to its 
customers about the risks that come with investing on the Internet 
and to tone down advertisements that appear to promise quick 
riches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customer-protection rules apply to everybody,'' including  
online brokerage firms, said Henry Klehm, senior associate director 
of the SEC's Northeast regional office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Datek case was the agency's first action enforcing  
customer-protection rules against an online trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that Datek violated customer-protection  
provisions of the federal securities laws by failing several times 
to keep a required minimum balance in a bank account containing 
customers' money, and by withdrawing cash from the account to pay 
its own financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokerages are required to keep excess funds in the customers'  
account to ensure they will not use customers' money for their own 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators also charged that Datek kept inaccurate books and  
records and filed a false report of its financial situation last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek and its former chief financial officer, Moishe Zelcer,  
neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement, under 
which: 
</P>
<P>
	--Datek and Zelcer agreed to be censured, to pay civil fines of  
$50,000 and $10,000, respectively, and to refrain from future 
violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	--Datek agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its  
internal policies, procedures and controls and to recommend changes 
that may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Zelcer agreed to be suspended from the brokerage industry for  
90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek, in a statement, said it ``responded quickly to address  
the concerns'' raised by the SEC. The firm noted, for example, that 
it replaced Zelcer last July. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, following investors' complaints about computer  
system crashes at online firms that caused big trading delays, New 
York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office began its own 
inquiry into the Internet trading industry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bancorp To Buy Western Bancorp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- U.S. Bancorp plans to acquire Western  
Bancorp, which has 31 branches in southern California, for slightly 
less than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Western, based in Newport Beach, Calif., has branches in Los  
Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, owns Santa Monica Bank and 
Southern California Bank, and has $2.5 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Western Bancorp shareholders will  
receive in a tax-free exchange 1.2915 shares of U.S. Bancorp common 
stock for each share of Western Bancorp common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition, which must be approved by regulators and  
Western Bancorp shareholders, is expected to close in the fourth 
quarter of 1999, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	David I. Rainer, who currently serves as president and chief  
executive officer of Santa Monica Bank, will serve as president of 
the southern California market for U.S. Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, with $76 billion in assets, is  
the 13th largest bank holding company in the nation and operates 
about 1,000 banking offices in 17 Midwestern and Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp currently operates 88 branches in northern  
California as well as corporate trust and leasing offices in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. The company's California presence also 
includes six offices of its U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray brokerage 
subsidiary and U.S. Bancorp Libra, an investment bank headquartered 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp's previously announced acquisition of Bank of  
Commerce, with 10 branches in San Diego and Orange counties and 
$638 million in assets, is currently pending regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of U.S. Bancorp fell $1.81 1/4 to $32.56 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Western rose $1.31 1/4 to 
$40.31 1/4 in trading on the Nasdaq stock market.

<HEADLINE>  Lazio Wins Cup Winners Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- Lazio won the last Cup Winners Cup on  
Wednesday, defeating Mallorca of Spain 2-1 and giving the 
big-spending Italian team its first major trophy in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Nedved scored the winning goal in the 81st minute, a  
20-yard volley past goalkeeper Carlos Roa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio spent about $110 million in the offseason for high-priced  
acquisitions and about $200 million in the last half-dozen seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is second in Italy's Serie A and could take the title  
when it finishes this weekend. The Rome team lost last season's 
UEFA Cup final 3-0 to Italian rival Inter Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are overjoyed,'' Lazio captain Alessandro Nesta said. ``Now  
we are looking forward to a continuation of celebrations next 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cup Winners Cup is being disbanded and incorporated in the  
expanded UEFA Cup next season. Italy's Fiorentina won the first Cup 
Winners title in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio opened the scoring when Christian Vieri scored in the  
seventh minute. Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia tied it four minutes later, 
sending a short shot past goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the stage for Nedved, who had been benched the last two  
games because of poor play. He scored the winner seconds after 
recovering from a blow to the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Cragnotti, the industrialist who owns Lazio, called it  
``a night of great joy for all of us. We downed a very difficult 
opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mallorca, second in Spain's top league, was playing its first  
European final after being promoted just two seasons ago to the top 
Spanish league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fought as hard as we could and more,'' Dani said. ``But  
when they score with seven or eight minutes to go, it hardly gives 
you time to react.''

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just after midnight, in a theater close, close  
by, the Wookie wannabes, the Darth fakers and the rainstorm 
troopers turned out in droves today for the first peek at the 
``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Force was here again, fresh ``Star Wars' material  
for the first time in 16 years. Was ``Star Wars: Episode One -- The 
Phantom Menace'' worth the wait? 
</P>
<P>
	``The best of the bunch,'' declared 16-year-old Phillip DeBono,  
born six years after the film that started it all. ``It's as good 
as Darth Vader is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm was shared by the rest of the sold-out crowd that  
saw this morning's debut screening of the $115 million film. 
``Excellent!'' and ``Fantastic!'' they told rain-soaked fans still 
waiting outside New York's Ziegfeld Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was the same at theaters, cineplexes and malls across  
the country, from Charleston, W.Va., to Des Moines, Iowa, to Los 
Angeles. Some companies were bracing for a ``Phantom'' sickout; one 
employment agency has estimated that 2.2 million people will skip 
work today to see the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Deans, 26, a paralegal from Brooklyn, said he would still  
be able to make it to work this morning after a 6:30 a.m. 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years to see this,'' he said. ``It brings  
back the child in all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowd, which filled all 1,162 seats at $9.50 a pop,  
partied on the street for hours before the first show at the 
Manhattan theater. It was an eclectic bunch -- Obi Wan Kenobis of 
all shapes and sizes, a wide assortment of Princess Leia hairdos, 
scalpers asking $100 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will go on ... and on ... and on. ``The Phantom  
Menace'' was playing around the clock at five New York City 
theaters. Midnight showings were offered in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, and a midnight show in Indianapolis was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Upbeat reviews from fans were in a different stratosphere from  
critics' pans. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Keith Arbeeny, who wore a storm trooper's helmet: ``It  
took you almost to another world. It was mind-boggling, like 
nothing I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News: ``It's all  
sound and fury and special effects, signifying nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Robert Farrell, who paid $100 to a scalper: ``It was  
worth every penny. The special effects are out of this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Todd McCarthy in Variety: ``It is neither captivating  
nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Aaron Savage, dressed as character Darth Maul: ``The  
movie was great -- really, really great. It was a real fan's 
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You get the point: the movie is critic-proof.  
</P>
<P>
	No one is asking if ``The Phantom Menace'' will make money; the  
question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach 
the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-day opening window, ``Menace'' was expected to beat  
the opening record of $90.2 million set by ``Lost World: Jurassic 
Park'' in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by George Lucas, ``The Phantom  
Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a 
generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid 
named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were 
lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an 
aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> Watson Makes Last Stand in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Tom Watson walked up the 18th fairway  
last year as the oldest champion in the 52-year history of the 
Colonial. Unless another plaid jacket is waiting for him this time, 
he'll walk away from the PGA Tour for good. 
</P>
<P>
	He turns 50 in September, and the Senior Tour beckons. The way  
Watson has been playing lately, he has his hand cupped to his ear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can make the statement now that I'm going to take most of  
the rest of year off and prepare for the Senior Tour,'' Watson 
said. ``At this point, this will be the last tournament I'll play 
on the regular PGA Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will still play the U.S. Open next month. He plans to be in  
Scotland in July, when the British Open returns to Carnoustie for 
the first time since Watson won his first claret jug in 1975. He 
would like one more shot at the PGA Championship, the one major 
that has kept him from the career Grand Slam, but would need a 
special exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	He could always change his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he would continue to play against guys nearly  
half his age if he were to win this week in the Mastercard Colonial 
or at least put a scare into somebody on Sunday, he flashed that 
famous gap between his front teeth and replied, ``Of course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no reason to believe that will happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Watson hasn't scared anyone this year. His best finish was a tie  
for 16th in the Sony Open. He has missed his last three cuts and 
has a scoring average of 73.22 
</P>
<P>
	His iron play, the hallmark of a Hall of Fame career that  
includes eight major championships, is in the worst shape since he 
can remember. His putting isn't getting any better, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had won a couple of tournaments already or was in the top  
20 money winners, boy, it would be difficult to go out on the 
Senior Tour,'' he said. ``But it's easy to talk about it right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson is part of a tantalizing threesome expected to inject  
some life into the Senior Tour. Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins, with 
whom he spent the better part of three decades doing battle on the 
PGA Tour, will turn 50 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows the competition won't be nearly as stiff as what he  
faces this week against the likes of Davis Love III, Steve 
Elkington, Fred Couples, Justin Leonard or Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he looks forward to seeing new courses and beating old  
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make no bones about it, winning on the PGA Tour is the  
ultimate challenge,'' he said. ``Winning anywhere is a challenge, 
but you obviously want to win against the strongest fields you can 
play against because it means you've beaten the best. But I still 
love to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson hasn't been able to do that lately. All that's left is a  
ceremonial stroll up the 18th fairway -- usually on a Friday -- 
knowing that it may be the last time he plays Bay Hill or the Byron 
Nelson or Colonial. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson felt sentimental last week at Las Colinas, especially  
since Nelson has been his longtime mentor. He needed a birdie on 
the 18th hole Friday to make the cut, but instead three-putted from 
the fringe for a 41 on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Byron's tournament and I hope to be back there, but I'm  
not sure I will be,'' he said. ``Walking up the last hole was 
somewhat sentimental to me, as it has been in most of the 
tournaments I've played in this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 23rd trip around Colonial Country Club will look slightly  
different. The course has 34 new trees, most of them 25 feet high. 
The biggest change Watson expects is how firm and fast Colonial 
could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it played the easiest I've seen it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Watson finished at 15-under 265 for a two-stroke victory over  
Jim Furyk. It was all made possible by one of the most remarkable 
shots of his career, perhaps a notch below his chip-in at Pebble 
Beach to win the 1982 U.S. Open or his 2-iron into the 18th green 
at Royal Birkdale to secure the 1983 British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	With an off-balance stance from the fairway bunker on No. 9,  
Watson hit an 8-iron through wind and over water to 10 feet and 
made the birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	When Watson thinks about that bunker shot and finally winning in  
``Hogan's Alley,'' he realizes that he happened to be playing 
pretty well that week. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senior Tour only four months away, that's not the case  
right now.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Curb Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service would get more money  
to fight illicit drugs and Internet child pornography under a bill 
approved by a House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would authorize more than $2.4 billion in 2000  
and 2001 for the operations of Customs and two other trade 
agencies, with the emphasis on more people and better equipment to 
detect drug trafficking. The funding level for the two years is 
$400 million above what the administration requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside $311 million over two years for 1,745  
new Customs officers along the borders and at major drug and 
money-laundering locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs' Child Pornography/Child Sexual Exploitation Program  
would see its budget increased from $2.4 million to $10 million, 
allowing it to increase its staff by 50 from the current 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost is needed, said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chief  
sponsor of the anti-pornography money, because the Internet ``is 
quickly becoming the No. 1 choice of pedophiles as a means of 
preying upon children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old Customs program, which led to 228 arrests last  
year, concentrates on international Internet sex predators and 
traffic in child pornography. It turns over to the FBI domestic 
cases that it uncovers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited  
Children, there are 10,000 Web sites maintained by pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means trade subcommittee approved the bill by  
a 9-6 vote Tuesday, with Democrats voting against it because they 
objected to provisions that would change the overtime and night 
differential rules for Customs officers. The National Treasury 
Employees Union also strongly opposes the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor issues were also a major issue last year when a similar  
bill passed the House by a large margin but was never taken up by 
the Senate. This year the Republican leadership took out 
controversial provisions altering collective bargaining and duty 
rotation policies, but kept in the overtime changes, saying they 
are needed to bring Customs employees in line with other federal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	NTEU President Robert Tobias said it was ``counterproductive to  
penalize the very people'' who were being asked to take on the job 
of keeping drugs off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., criticized the Democrats on the  
panel for voting against the legislation because of the labor 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting our children and their families from the scourges  
of drugs and child pornography should not be a decision based on 
union strong-arming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1833.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Kills Son To Win Back Ex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- A father was charged Wednesday with  
reporting his 3-year-old son missing in an attempt to win back his 
girlfriend, then taping a garbage bag over the boy's head and 
abandoning him in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Kramer Jr. was charged Wednesday with second-degree  
murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Kenneth 
``Kenny'' Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, 26, admitted taking the boy the night of May 10 and  
abandoning him in the woods, Houston County Sheriff Mike Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	A note left in the child's bedroom said that if Kramer and his  
former girlfriend were married by a certain date, Kenny would be 
returned, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny's body was found Tuesday near his grandparents' home, the  
upper part of his body wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and his 
mouth taped with duct tape. Kramer said the boy was crying when he 
left him, but he ran to his car and drove away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's disappearance ``kind of started out with this idea  
that (Kramer) was going to try and bring about this marriage, and 
it just got out of hand,'' County Attorney James Fabian said. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 11, Kramer allegedly went to a movie theater where his  
girlfriend worked. Holding Kenny in his arms, he stood in front of 
the box-office glass, pointing at Kenny as if he wanted her to see 
his son, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who was not the boy's mother, told police she  
believed Kramer was ``playing mind games'' with her because she had 
been like a mother to the child for two years.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Cops Cheered Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- White police officers made no racial epithets  
and did not celebrate with ``high fives'' after fatally shooting a 
black woman, a lawyer for the men said Wednesday in response to a 
civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside officers were ``hugging each other and  
commiserating with each other because they hadn't been killed,'' 
attorney Bill Hadden said. ``To say they high-fived is absolutely 
false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claims of racism made in the lawsuit are false and designed to  
win a damage award for the family of the slain woman, Tyisha 
Miller, Hadden said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights suit filed in federal court on Tuesday by a  
legal team headed by lawyer Johnnie Cochran named five officers and 
the city of Riverside -- 60 mile east of Los Angeles -- as defendants 
and alleged race was the motive for killing Ms. Miller, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller was shot 12 times on Dec. 28 after she was found  
lying in a semiconscious state in her locked car with a gun on her 
lap. Police, who responded to a 911 call, say she suddenly reached 
for the weapon when an officer smashed the car's window. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of citizens have joined protest marches led by the  
Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Jackson has called Ms. 
Miller's shooting the act of ``a firing squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riverside County District Attorney Grover Trask announced this  
month that he will not prosecute the officers, although he 
criticized their handling of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Slow Huntington's in Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have found a way to delay the onset of Huntington's  
disease and slow its progress in mice by targeting an enzyme that 
is believed to trigger cell death. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding, published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, is a promising lead for drug researchers working to extend 
the lives of Huntington's sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is important and exciting. This is the first  
demonstration of a drug that can slow the progress of HD in an 
animal model,'' said Dr. Christopher Ross, a Johns Hopkins Medical 
School professor and a scientific adviser to the Huntington's 
Disease Society of America. ``It says this goal of slowing progress 
probably can be accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington's has been linked to enzymes called caspases, which  
cause brain cells to die slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, scientists from Harvard University's Brigham  
and Women's Hospital blocked a particular caspase in mice that had 
been genetically engineered to contract the disease. These mice 
developed Huntington's symptoms about 10 percent later in life and 
lived about 20 percent longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Caspase-1 apparently plays a role in the cell death that marks  
Huntington's, which usually kills sufferers within 15 to 20 years. 
How the enzyme works is unclear, but scientists think that it 
slices up the so-called huntingtin gene, and that the fragments 
then kill the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard researchers slowed that process by breeding mice  
with a mutant protein that counteracts caspase-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The mice showed Huntington's symptoms -- walking trouble, weight  
loss and seizures -- after 84 days, on average, compared with 77 
days in the other mice. The mice with the caspase blocker lived an 
average of 121 days, compared with 101 days for the other mice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one drug can do this, hopefully, in the future, you can  
find others,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Robert M. 
Friedlander. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington's, which killed folk singer Woody Guthrie, afflicts  
30,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	What is exciting, Friedlander said, is that the same mechanism  
at work in this study may be applied to research on brain injuries 
and illnesses such as Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Caspase inhibition may turn out to be the magic bullet against  
neurodegenerative disease,'' University of Munich biochemist 
Christian Haass said in an accompanying editorial.

	SHAMBUKO, Eritrea (AP) -- When she laid her gun down after the  
war for independence eight years ago, Tsegay Roma Menasse rejoiced 
at the chance to settle down, build a home and raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ethiopian bombs destroyed Tsegay's house, and she and her  
two young children now live in a tent alongside thousands of other 
Eritreans displaced by another war in the Horn of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	As it entered its second year this month, the border conflict  
between Ethiopia and Eritrea is at an impasse. Like so many of her 
neighbors, Tsegay despairs of ever finding peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never expected this war to last so long,'' she said at one  
of two camps housing 20,000 Eritreans near the western front. 
``Maybe my own children will grow up to fight also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government figures estimate 250,000 Eritreans and 300,000  
Ethiopians have been displaced from their homes along the 620-mile 
ill-defined border since war erupted May 6, 1998. It isn't the 
first time the region has been riven by violence: Eritrean rebels 
fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia before finally winning 
independence in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia has kept reporters away from its northern border  
region, and there have been few reports on the condition of 
residents there. 
</P>
<P>
	In Eritrea, the displaced have fled the border to escape  
artillery fire. But many still fear Ethiopian bombers, which have 
killed or wounded about 70 civilians since the war began. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia and Eritrea blame each other for persecuting the  
other's citizens. Eritrea said this week that Ethiopia is 
preventing 10,000 Eritreans, whose property and assets have been 
confiscated, from leaving Ethiopia. Ethiopia has denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, the United Nations, Rwanda and the  
Organization of African Unity have tried to end the war. The U.N. 
Security Council and several Western nations have repeatedly urged 
a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	An OAU proposal that would have both sides withdraw from  
contested areas and submit to verification is touted as the best 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia claims Eritrea is refusing to commit to withdrawing  
troops from occupied areas. Eritrea says Ethiopia keeps adding 
names to the list of places they have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt, Libya and Sudan, all vying for influence in the Horn,  
have recently taken the lead in mediation efforts. Ethiopian Prime 
Minister Meles Zenawi met Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak after visiting Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki met with the same two leaders  
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are sharp differences between them ... even the final  
shape of any possible solution or settlement has not been defined 
yet,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said after the 
Ethiopian's meeting with Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudan, which had been on bad terms with both countries, is fast  
mending relations, reportedly to outmaneuver Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrea and Ethiopia have their own geopolitical designs in the  
region, reportedly backing different warlords in nearby Somalia in 
a bid to win influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ethiopian jets continue to bomb Eritrea, prompting  
fear, anger and despair among the people most affected by the war. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Eritrea, some of the displaced like Tsegaye live in  
camps where they have set up a makeshift market. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing more bombing, 7,000 other farmers and herders have sent  
up tents in forested areas away from the border where they are 
subject to malaria-bearing mosquitoes as well as isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Letense Asrat and her family lost everything in an Ethiopian air  
raid on their once-bustling market town of Shambuko, six miles from 
the Ethiopian border in western Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they sit brewing tea or homemade beer to sell to soldiers  
passing along Shambuko's broad, dusty boulevard, where broken shop 
doors swing on their hinges or lie among rubble and broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 20,000 neighbors all fled, but Asrat said she could not  
bear to be dependent on others. 
</P>
<P>
	``People told me to wait to return because they think Shambuko  
will be bombed again,'' she said. ``Of course I am afraid, but I 
have no choice.''

<HEADLINE> Starved Baby's Mom Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A young mother who blamed breast-feeding  
problems for the death of her emaciated baby son was convicted 
Wednesday of criminally negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabitha Walrond, 21, faces up to four years in prison at  
sentencing. She was acquitted of the more serious charge of 
manslaughter, which could have brought her a 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	She dabbed away tears as the verdicts were read.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Walrond starved 2-month-old Tyler in 1997  
to spite his father, who left her shortly after she got pregnant -- 
or, at the very least, ignored signs that the baby was starving. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said she was a doting mother who didn't realize that  
her surgically reduced breasts were failing to nourish her child. 
Defense attorney Susan V. Tipograph said Tyler may have suffered 
from an adrenal gland disorder -- not malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	But autopsy photographs showed her son was emaciated, having  
dropped from his birth weight of nearly 8 pounds to about 5 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond testified on Tuesday that she never noticed Tyler's  
drastic weight loss. She said she took natural-childbirth classes, 
went to night school to finish high school before Tyler was born 
and chose to breast-feed because doctors and family told her 
``breast is best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All those actions, Ms. Tipograph said, demonstrated motherly  
love. She said Ms. Walrond brought Tyler to a clinic for a checkup 
but was turned away because she did not have a Medicaid card for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond sobbed on the witness stand as she described how she  
found Tyler looking lifeless and foaming at the mouth and rushed 
him to the hospital in a taxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Faster, faster! ... Something's wrong with my baby!'''  
she testified. ``He left me, he died in the cab. I felt him 
leave.''

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Private School Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents could contribute up to $2,000 a year  
to IRA-like accounts and withdraw the money tax-free for private 
school expenses under legislation approved Wednesday by the Senate 
Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, vetoed by President Clinton last year, cleared the  
panel after majority Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to 
substitute a version of Clinton's $25 billion school construction 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the GOP believes federal help is  
better spent on giving parents freedom to choose the best schools 
than on construction projects that don't address the quality of 
classroom education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many working Americans, taxpayers, are trapped in these  
failing schools,'' Gramm said. ``They are more capable than we are 
of deciding what is best for their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, expected to reach the Senate floor in June or  
July, would broaden the uses allowed for education IRAs. Current 
law lets people use such money only for higher education. The 
proposal would expand that to allow withdrawals for kindergarten 
through 12th grade expenses in public, private, parochial or home 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual contribution cap would be raised from $500 to $2,000,  
and withdrawals would be tax-exempt for such expenses as tuition, 
books, supplies and required uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a responsibility to help Americans with these high  
costs,'' said Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton argued last year that the cost of the accounts -- about  
$2.6 billion of the bill's overall 10-year price tag of $7.6 
billion -- is money better spent to repair or replace crumbling 
public schools. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., indicated the president 
would veto the bill again this year because it mainly helps ``a 
certain upper-income class of kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association, a major Democratic ally,  
cited Treasury Department statistics in contending that 70 percent 
of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 20 percent of families -- 
and only 7 percent of American families have children in private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Education Secretary Richard  
Riley said in a joint letter to senators that the accounts would 
generate little savings, increase tax complexity and ``reward 
families, particularly those with significant means, for what they 
may do in any case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the legislation's main sponsors, Republican Sen. Paul  
Coverdell of Georgia and Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey, told reporters the accounts would help 14 million 
middle-class families save an estimated $12 billion of their own 
money for both public and private education costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to gain more Democratic support, Roth included in the  
bill a provision sponsored by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., that would 
relax revenue bond rules for schools and add schools to the 
projects that can be paid for with tax-exempt private activity 
bonds. That would let each state issue school construction bonds 
each year worth $10 for each resident or $5 million, whichever is 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill includes a second Graham measure to allow tax-free  
distributions from state-sponsored and private prepaid college 
tuition plans. It also would extend an expiring tax break for 
employers who pay for college level education expenses for their 
workers and eliminate the 60-month limit on tax deductibility of 
student loan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Chuck Robb, D-Va., tried to  
delete the education IRA provisions and replace them with Clinton's 
proposal to bolster existing revenue bond programs, which would 
raise $25 billion in 2000 and 2001 to renovate or build schools. A 
third of the money would go to the poorest inner-city school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to help those who are most in need of  
assistance,'' Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
	But voting largely along party lines, the Finance Committee  
defeated their amendment, 12-8, and then approved the original 
bill, with three committee Democrats in support. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the bill would  
move independently from the Republicans' as-yet-unknown plan to cut 
taxes by $778 billion over 10 years using projected budget 
surpluses. The education measure is paid for by closing certain 
business tax loopholes and similar revenue raisers.

<HEADLINE> Reporter's AIDS Test Is Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A blood test has found that a former  
reporter who was fired for writing fictitious columns about her 
health does not have AIDS as she once claimed, the 
Messenger-Inquirer reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Stacy was fired by the Owensboro newspaper May 10 after she  
admitted that five columns she wrote detailing her battle against 
terminal brain cancer were fabrications. At the time of her 
dismissal, she said she lied in the columns to avoid revealing she 
had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the columns was distributed in Kentucky by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	But three days after losing her job and becoming the subject of  
an apology to readers by Messenger-Inquirer Publisher Ed Riney, 
Stacy said the story of her having AIDS was also a lie. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the test were made available to the  
Messenger-Inquirer with Stacy's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will bring closure to a lot of this,'' Stacy said  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Counting on New Xterra SUV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The stylish new Xterra economy sport utility  
vehicle that goes on sale Tuesday will fill a niche as the most 
affordable of the ``true'' SUVs built on a truck frame, company 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. said the Xterra will be the driving force  
behind a projected 15 percent increase in its North American sales, 
as well as a jump in profits from the continent. The SUV starts at 
$17,349. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will bring some fresh people into the Nissan  
showroom,'' said Jed Connelly, vice president of Nissan North 
America and general manager of its Nissan brand said in an 
interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The name Xterra (pronounced ehks-TEH'-ruh) is intended to link  
images of Generation X and rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very stylish,'' said Nissan North America marketing  
manager Jack D. Wilkerson. ``We are able to get a hip or a cool 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cost, as well as design, is a big a part of its coolness, Nissan  
execs say. The base sticker price announced Wednesday places the 
2000-model Xterra well below the $25,000 or so of other truck-based 
SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The price should help lure buyers who otherwise would have  
bought cars or used SUVs, said Mark Perry, another marketing 
executive with Nissan North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Some compact SUVs do sell for less. But they use cars' unibody  
design, rather than the sturdier body-on-frame design used for 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Wesley Brown said the Xterra's ``rugged, muscular'' look  
and moderate price should make it a hot seller for Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like they're getting on track,'' said Brown, of  
Nextrend in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealer and public interest has led Nissan to raise its  
first-year U.S. sales estimate from 48,000 to the 60,000 to 65,000 
range. Production at its Smyrna, Tenn. assembly plant is expected 
to reach a full-capacity 70,000 to 75,000. Canadian sales account 
for the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has a large inventory of Xterras in stock already,  
Connelly said. He said the company moved up the introduction date 
from early June to catch Memorial Day weekend traffic and avoid 
possible disruption from a threatened Teamsters union strike 
against car haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Value also marked the prices for the other 2000-model prices  
Nissan announced Wednesday. The Japan-built Maxima car will start 
at $21,049, $450 less than the 1999 model. Antilock brakes and 
other now-standard features make comparably equipped 2000 Maximas 
$2,000 less than '99s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frontier Crew Cab four-door compact pickup will list for  
$17,290, and the two-door Frontier Desert Runner will start at 
$15,740. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, Nissan is trying to fight its way out of deep  
financial problems made worse by Japan's continuing recession and 
North American sales that until recently lagged other Japanese 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan got a big boost in March when French automaker Renault SA  
agreed to invest $5.4 billion in exchange for a 36.8 percent 
controlling stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, sales and earnings both are moving up, chief  
spokeswoman Debra Sanchez Fair said. On Friday, she said it will 
report a ``small profit'' of about $40 million for the 12 months 
that ended March 31. Nissan North America lost $500 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of Nissan-brand vehicles rose 23.4 percent in April  
and are up 5.6 percent since the start of 1999. The division 
expects to sell 630,000 in North America in its 1999 fiscal year, 
15 percent more than in 1998, Connelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	When sales of Nissan's Infiniti's luxury division are added in,  
Nissan sales should reach 700,000 vehicles, he said.

<HEADLINE> Xerox, Microsoft To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Xerox Corp. is forming an alliance with software giant Microsoft  
Corp. that will enable Xerox to better link its products with 
computer networks running Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance was announced on Tuesday by Xerox Chief Executive  
Officer G. Richard Thoman and Microsoft President Steve Ballmer at 
Xerox's Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Xerox will adopt  
Microsoft's Windows NT Embedded operating systems on its Document 
Centre machines which lead the company's digital product line. 
</P>
<P>
	Document Centre products accounted for about 10 percent of  
Xerox's total sales last year, generating $1.8 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox officials said the agreement would allow the company to  
develop cheaper machines that can meet the increasing need to fax, 
copy, print and scan documents into a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Microsoft licenses Xerox's WebForager software.  
</P>
<P>
	The alliance isn't the first between the two companies.  
Microsoft and Xerox teamed up in 1993 to develop software for ``the 
paperless office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also announced on Tuesday was a deal with Compaq Computer Corp.  
to use Xerox scanning technology with its Work Expediter software, 
which manages work-flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will start to see the new Windows NT features on  
Document Centre machines this fall and Compaq machines in June.

<P>
	MONTE SIRINO, Italy (AP) -- Jose Jaime Gonzalez of Colombia won  
the fifth stage of the Tour of Italy cycling race on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Laurent Jalabert moved into the overall lead by  
finishing third in the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, winning his second stage of the race in three years,

<HEADLINE> Loehmann's Files for Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Discount clothing retailer Loehmann's Inc.  
announced Tuesday that it has filed a petition to reorganize under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 11, Loehmann's will continue to operate under  
court protection from creditors while seeking to work out a 
reorganization plan. The petition was filed in federal Bankruptcy 
Court in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert N. Friedman, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Loehmann's, said the decision to file for Chapter 11, ``while 
difficult, represents the most viable option for restructuring our 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past 18 months, we have implemented several strategic  
initiatives including a more diversified merchandise mix, an 
aggressive marketing campaign and improved operating 
efficiencies,'' Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we believe these strategies were the appropriate course  
of action, they have yet to mature and generate the expected 
financial returns. The Chapter 11 filing will provide additional 
time to build on these efforts and to take the steps necessary to 
ensure a strong future for Loehmann's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced that Eliot Green has been named  
interim chief financial officer. Green is a financial consultant 
who has extensive corporate restructuring experience. In addition, 
Norman S. Matthews and Richard E. Kroon have resigned from their 
positions on the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Loehmann's sells women's and men's designer and brand-name  
clothing, accessories and shoes at discounts of 30 to 65 percent. 
The Bronx, N.Y.-based company operates 69 stores in 22 states and 
had fiscal 1999 sales of $432 million.

	As farmers and ranchers prepare for this year's first cutting of  
hay, shortages in previous summers are distant memories. Plentiful 
rainfall this spring should ensure enough alfalfa and other hay 
crops in most parts of the state, said Wade Moser, executive vice 
president of the North Dakota Stockmen's Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more (producers) can get piled up, the more insurance  
they've got if things do dry out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened in 1997, prompting the federal government to open  
up Conservation Reserve Program land to haying, and last summer, 
when a shortage of hay and pasture in north-central North Dakota 
prompted Gov. Ed Schafer to open no-mow areas along certain 
highways to haying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Divide County, where producers typically struggle to find  
high-quality hay and pasture, heavy rainfall this spring has been a 
blessing, said Aaron Jacobson, who ranches near Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was terrible -- we didn't get any rain until the end  
of June and the hay crop was almost nonexistent. There were a fair 
amount of cows sold just because there was no pasture,'' Jacobson 
said. This year, ``the pastures up here will be tremendous unless 
we really burn up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of the state that have received too much rain, many  
ranchers are relying on hay left over from last year to get them by 
until flooded fields dry out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our alfalfa is all under water,'' said Rose Bailey, who farms  
with her husband, Vernon, near Denbigh in McHenry County. ``And we 
haven't been able to get to the pastures for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>

	MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Department of Agriculture plans to hire  
an army of inspectors to locate even the smallest trace of citrus 
canker, the deadly plant disease now rampant in Miami-Dade and 
Broward counties. 
</P>
<P>
	This means hiring as many as 1,100 people to help carry out the  
order of scouring citrus groves and homeowners' yards in search of 
the scourge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do this, Dade will no longer have any citrus  
trees,'' said Terry McElroy, spokesman for Agriculture Commissioner 
Bob Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers are anxious for the new inspectors to begin working.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't eradicate this canker, our children and our  
children's children are going to have a very difficult time ever 
growing citrus in Florida,'' said Miami-Dade lime grower Craig 
Wheeling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Legislature allocated $17.7 million to fighting  
citrus canker. The federal government matched that sum, allowing 
the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to 
increase its work force from 340 field inspectors to 1,500, plus 
support staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The intensive program is aimed at stopping the spread of the  
disease, which threatens the state's $8.5 billion citrus industry 
and the nearly 5 million backyard citrus trees in both counties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami-Dade County, the extra inspectors will evaluate the  
condition of thousands of acres of limes, carambola (star fruit), 
avocados and other tropical fruit.

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just after midnight, in a theater close, close  
by, the Wookiee wannabes, the Darth fakers and the rainstorm 
troopers turned out in droves today for the first peek at the 
``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Force was here again, fresh ``Star Wars' material  
for the first time in 16 years. Was ``Star Wars: Episode One -- The 
Phantom Menace'' worth the wait? 
</P>
<P>
	``The best of the bunch,'' declared 16-year-old Phillip DeBono,  
born six years after the film that started it all. ``It's as good 
as Darth Vader is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm was shared by the rest of the sold-out crowd that  
saw this morning's debut screening of the $115 million film. 
``Excellent!'' and ``Fantastic!'' they told rain-soaked fans still 
waiting outside New York's Ziegfeld Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was the same at theaters, cineplexes and malls across  
the country, from Charleston, W.Va., to Des Moines, Iowa, to Los 
Angeles. Some companies were bracing for a ``Phantom'' sickout; one 
employment agency has estimated that 2.2 million people will skip 
work today to see the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Deans, 26, a paralegal from Brooklyn, said he would still  
be able to make it to work this morning after a 6:30 a.m. 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years to see this,'' he said. ``It brings  
back the child in all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowd, which filled all 1,162 seats at $9.50 a pop,  
partied on the street for hours before the first show at the 
Manhattan theater. It was an eclectic bunch -- Obi Wan Kenobis of 
all shapes and sizes, a wide assortment of Princess Leia hairdos, 
scalpers asking $100 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will go on ... and on ... and on. ``The Phantom  
Menace'' was playing around the clock at five New York City 
theaters. Midnight showings were offered in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, and a midnight show in Indianapolis was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Upbeat reviews from fans were in a different stratosphere from  
critics' pans. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Keith Arbeeny, who wore a storm trooper's helmet: ``It  
took you almost to another world. It was mind-boggling, like 
nothing I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News: ``It's all  
sound and fury and special effects, signifying nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Robert Farrell, who paid $100 to a scalper: ``It was  
worth every penny. The special effects are out of this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Todd McCarthy in Variety: ``It is neither captivating  
nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Aaron Savage, dressed as character Darth Maul: ``The  
movie was great -- really, really great. It was a real fan's 
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You get the point: the movie is critic-proof.  
</P>
<P>
	No one is asking if ``The Phantom Menace'' will make money; the  
question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach 
the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-day opening window, ``Menace'' was expected to beat  
the opening record of $90.2 million set by ``Lost World: Jurassic 
Park'' in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by George Lucas, ``The Phantom  
Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a 
generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid 
named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were 
lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an 
aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Grapple With Germ Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- It sounds like science fiction: Microscopic oil  
droplets protect patients from germs and viruses by fusing with the 
dangerous bugs and causing them essentially to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Michigan scientists, hunting ways to protect  
soldiers from biological warfare, say they have created just such a 
drug. It can eradicate deadly anthrax within an hour of contact, 
and promises to be so non-toxic to humans that one day it might be 
possible to decontaminate germ-laden food. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Baker, creator of these drug droplets so tiny they  
have been dubbed ``nano-bombs,'' added some to a sample of cholera 
viewed through a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, ``All that's left here is debris. The  
remarkable thing is this happens almost immediately,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	While still highly experimental, Baker told a biotechnology  
meeting here Wednesday he envisions one day using the nano-bombs 
not just to treat infection, but as protection. They might work as 
an HIV-blocking vaginal cream. Or spray them in your nostrils 
during flu season and you might not get sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker mixed them to the consistency of skim milk and put them in  
a standard paint sprayer as a way to decontaminate the environment 
after, say, an anthrax threat. 
</P>
<P>
	If you add peppermint, he said, ``it actually tastes pretty  
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's creation is part of a Star Trek-like field of science  
called ``nanotechnology,'' creating drugs and other products so 
minute that researchers have to build them one molecule at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Such discoveries have so intrigued the Clinton administration  
that it just listed nanotechnology as a research priority for the 
next budget, said Gregory Milman, director of the National 
Institutes of Health's Office for Innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining nanodrugs on the wish list are computer chips capable of  
storing trillions of bits of information on a pin-head and 
miniature sensors that could detect hidden ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, researchers said they are designing nanochips to  
quickly read a patient's genes to help pinpoint medical treatment, 
and ``nanoswitches'' to turn off defective genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how small is nanotechnology? A nanometer is a mere  
one-billionth of a meter. Bacteria and viruses are many times 
smaller than a human hair, and Baker's nano-bombs are hundreds of 
times smaller than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Size is key because it makes the oil droplets ``likely to fuse  
with bacteria while leaving our own cells alone,'' said Baker, 
whose Defense Department-funded research also is important to 
doctors hunting ways to fight the growing problem of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The droplets bind to the membrane coating germs or viruses and  
disrupts that coating ``so much that the organism literally 
explodes,'' explained Baker. He said he successfully has killed a 
host of bacteria and viruses -- even HIV, anthrax and smallpox -- in 
test-tube studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal tests showed success, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Spraying the wounds of mice dying of anthrax reduced mortality  
by 85 percent. Nano-bombs decontaminated environmental anthrax 
faster than bleach, one of just a few chemicals strong enough to 
kill the spores on contact. 
</P>
<P>
	That is important considering growing fear over use of this  
deadly infection by bioterrorists. The nation had 5,000 anthrax 
threats last year, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	When people are thought to be exposed, they may be washed down  
with bleach or given antibiotics in an attempt to stave off 
infection, but doctors -- and the Defense Department, worried about 
biowarfare -- want better protection. 
</P>
<P>
	When Baker tried to infect mice with a severe flu strain, those  
whose noses first had been swabbed with the nano-bombs did not get 
sick. Unprotected mice died. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would not nano-bombs hurt our cells, too? Most human cells  
have a different coating that seems to keep them from fusing with 
the droplets, Baker said. So far, animals have not shown any sign 
of harm. But he will have to prove safety in lengthy clinical 
trials before Americans could use such a drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's first goal is to use nano-bombs as an environmental  
decontamination agent because that takes less testing than the Food 
and Drug Administration requires for a medication. 
</P>
<P>
	But his first human drug study, to be conducted at NIH, is  
planned: using nano-bombs as a vaginal cream to try to protect 
women from the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Residents Brace for Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Homeowners and high school students  
filled thousands of sandbags and hauled furniture from 
flood-threatened homes as an eastern Iowa river rose to record 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 families were evacuated Tuesday night and Wednesday in  
this town of 1,069 people north of Cedar Rapids, while others 
maintained a nervous watch as the Wapsipinicon River lapped at 
their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depending on how high the river gets, my kitchen may be under  
water,'' said Lori Kuchera, who waited anxiously for the river to 
crest. ``You live by a river, it's inevitable. You just have to 
roll with the punches -- or ride with the tide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty counties reported flood damage from a storm that swept  
the state Sunday, swelling rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The river in Central City was measured at 19.7 feet at 3 p.m.  
Wednesday, well above its record high of 19.3 feet, said Bill 
Nichols, meteorologist in the Davenport office of the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday, the river breached a sandbag dike 5 feet high  
and a half-mile long, sloshing into the heart of tiny Troy Mills 
where it chased some 12 families from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The breach washed away the work of hundreds of volunteers from  
Cedar Rapids, Independence and other communities, as well as high 
school students from Coggon North Linn High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, I'll tell you, you talk about heartbreak, those people  
just worked their tails off all day long,'' said Harold Annis, who 
had 3 feet of water in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 sandbags had been filled as of noon Wednesday and  
the town of Marion sent in another 18,000 to keep the river at bay. 
All day, scores of pickup trucks roamed the town loaded with 
sandbags and teen-agers looking for homes and riverbanks that 
needed shoring up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to keep doing this until they tell me to stop,''  
said Chris Oldfather, a ninth-grader who had put in 12 hours of 
sandbagging and was back at it at 8 a.m. Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Psychic Line Named for Paula Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Paula Jones has lent her name to a  
psychic hotline while she ponders a career as a country singer. She 
might want to stick to Patsy Cline. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman whose lawsuit triggered events that nearly toppled a  
president isn't enticing many to fork out money to dial their 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were a horse race, we'd be off to a slow start,'' said  
David Felger, president of the Zodiac Group Inc., the company that 
runs the Paula Jones Celebrity Psychic Network. 
</P>
<P>
	She signed a contract in February for a 90-day trial as a  
spokeswoman for the hot line. If the calls start coming -- at $3.49 
a minute -- Jones could extend her contract for five years, said 
Felger, who refused to say how much Jones is being paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was made famous for accusing President Clinton of luring  
her to an Arkansas hotel suite in 1991. A sexual harassment lawsuit 
Clinton settled for $850,000 unveiled his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky and led to his impeachment trial.

<HEADLINE> Stadium Project Nixed in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a  
$1.8 billion convention center and sports complex that would have 
featured a new stadium for the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters rejected the gigantic Rio Salado Crossing project, which  
would have meant a sales tax increase for residents of Mesa, where 
the complex would have been built. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, voters in suburban Scottsdale approved forming a  
stadium district, which could lead to a new 20,000-seat arena for 
the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	With a surprisingly high turnout of 30 percent, twice what had  
been expected, Mesa voters rejected the sales tax proposal 60 
percent to 40 percent. Another measure simply authorizing the 
project was rejected by Mesa voters 59 percent to 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other small suburban communities also voted for the  
proposal, with voters in Queen Creek narrowly rejecting the 
project, while Gilbert voters approved it by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters were asked to authorize a quarter-cent sales tax and  
extend an existing quarter-cent sales tax beyond its 2006 
expiration date to help pay the public's $507 million share of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I cry, I can get away without talking,'' longtime Cardinals  
owner Bill Bidwill told a cheering pro-Rio Salado crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked ``those people who went out and worked for this  
wonderful public-private partnership that could have gone forward 
but is temporarily stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona House Speaker Jeff Grosscost suggested Rio Salado isn't  
dead. He proposed a ``re-framed effort'' that would lessen the 
emphasis on sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of rolling up our sleeves and putting in a  
little more work,'' he said, not mentioning any specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have played at Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State  
University since they moved to Arizona from St. Louis 11 years ago. 
The Cardinals are the only franchise in the four major professional 
sports that plays on a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bidwill, the owner's son and the team's vice president  
and general counsel, refused to suggest the Cardinals would 
consider moving to another city. Asked if the Cardinals would 
support Grosscost's idea, he said, ``The answer is probably yes but 
I didn't understand what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said he didn't think Bidwill would  
move the team out of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves Arizona. He loves this valley,'' Tobin said. ``Our  
job is to get our product in such a way that people embrace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rio Salado would have been built along the dry bed of the Salt  
River on Mesa's northern edge and would have included one of the 
largest convention centers in the country, far larger than the one 
in nearby Phoenix. It called for hotels, shops, restaurants, three 
golf courses, offices, homes, apartments, parks, a small lake and 
hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	At its heart was a 67,000-seat stadium that could expand to  
78,400 for big events, such as the Super Bowl or Fiesta Bowl. The 
stadium was to have a retractable roof and a natural grass field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not surprised,'' said Manny Cortez, chairman of  
Taxpayers Against Rio Salado. ``I always felt like if we'd have a 
large turnout, we would win. It's not just the Cardinals stadium, 
it's just the fact people are getting tired of taxes. I've always 
said we're being nickeled and dimed to death. It's time to say 
enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, the major contributor to a pro-Rio Salado  
campaign that outspent opponents at least 70-to-1, pledged $75 
million to the project. They also promised $75 million to the 
private development and to pay $2 million per year in rent for 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the Cardinals were to get the right to sell the  
stadium's name, as well as parking revenue on game day, concession 
revenue, advertising signs, luxury suite revenue and up to half the 
revenue from parking for all other events. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote in Scottsdale was only on forming a district to pursue  
the proposed $624 million renovation of Los Arcos Mall, a dying 
shopping center in south Scottsdale. A yes vote would mean a second 
vote this fall on a finance plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes say they can't make money at America West Arena in  
downtown Phoenix, where they have limited revenue capability and 
more than 4,000 seats have an obstructed view of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Rio Salado and Los Arcos projects are the result of an  
Arizona law that lasted two years before it was repealed recently 
by the legislature. Under that law, if two or more cities form a 
stadium district for a project, half of the sales taxes generated 
by that project would be funneled back to it.

<HEADLINE> Gates Defends Telecom Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is investing billions of  
dollars in telecommunications companies solely to enhance software 
sales and marketing, chairman Bill Gates said Wednesday. Because of 
growing demand for high-speed computer links, ``it's important for 
us to have those companies make the investment, build that new 
equipment,'' Gates said in a news conference during Microsoft's 
third annual CEO summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our core competence is building software and so we're not  
controlling any communications companies,'' Gates said. ``We are 
just a software company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal announced earlier this month, Microsoft is  
investing $5 billion in AT&AMP;T Corp., which in turn is relying on 
Microsoft products to offer interactive television with phone 
service and other Internet features over cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Microsoft invested $1 billion in Comcast of  
Philadelphia, which now has 4.4 million cable subscribers and 
revenues exceeding $5.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been able to take things like the investment we made  
in Comcast and in a passive way encourage them to make some of 
these investments and get that infrastructure in place -- and then 
we'll build software that takes advantage of it,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his keynote address earlier, Gates said corporate success  
would hinge increasingly on how well information is organized 
electronically and made available to employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a two-day conference of more than 100 chief executives  
from the world's 1,000 biggest corporations, Gates said it was no 
longer enough to have a corporate Web site, computers and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's how you take those technologies and use them inside the  
company ... that's going to differentiate'' the most effective 
businesses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who joined Gates at the news conference agreed that  
businesses fail to keep pace with technology at their peril. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risk of investing in hardware and software that soon  
becomes obsolescent, ``I think that the cost of waiting is worse,'' 
said Larry Bossidy, chairman of AlliedSignal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for small business operators, ``I don't think the  
transition ... is going to slow down,'' said Michael Dell, chairman 
of Dell Computer Corp. ``It's only going to accelerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love this to be simplified and easier for the homemaker  
and not just for the corporate world,'' added Martha Stewart, 
chairwoman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Making e-mail part of a corporate culture and replacing paper  
forms with electronic outlines are only first steps toward making 
full use of today's technology, Gates said in his speech, which 
echoed themes he raises in his book ``Business @ the Speed of 
Thought: Using a Digital Nervous System.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even what's available right now is vastly underutilized  
throughout the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting-edge corporations are converting their offices for  
wireless communications combining voice, pictures and data and 
outfitting employees with ``digital dashboards,'' customized 
on-screen layouts a worker can access from any computer, Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the executives said they were especially impressed by  
a messaging system listing phone messages as well as e-mail, with 
each retrievable by voice or text. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital dashboard -- ``your office on any screen,'' Gates  
called it -- can be modified both by the employee and by executives

<HEADLINE> Torre Managing Yankees Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Now this was a sight all of baseball enjoyed: Joe  
Torre back in uniform, back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly two months after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer,  
Torre returned Tuesday as manager of the New York Yankees and was 
greeted by a two-minute standing ovation from the rival fans at 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox were not quite so hospitable, winning 6-3 to  
move a half-game past the Yankees for the AL East lead. Still, 
Torre was happy he was healthy enough to be in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt very good, no fatigue,'' Torre said after the 3 1/2-hour  
game. ``I wish the result was better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees lost for the sixth time in seven games. Yet there  
was a sense Torre's presence would bring calm to the World Series 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the leader of our team and has been for a long time,''  
shortstop Derek Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Torre, who looked like he'd lost a little weight: ``With me  
being back, some of the players hinted, we won't be distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Don Zimmer, who managed the Yankees since Torre  
underwent surgery in St. Louis on March 18, returned to his more 
familiar role, sitting at his friend's side in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer talked about leaving baseball because of a bad knee once  
Torre returned. But Zimmer said he's looking to ``stick around for 
the rest of the season as long as the knee isn't bothering me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, said he made his decision Monday night, then took a  
flight with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to Boston on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's healthy and he's back and he's well,'' Steinbrenner said.  
``It's a special day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who guided the Yankees to two World Series titles in  
three years, said he called Zimmer in the morning to tell him the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said, `Are you ready to do the job you were hired to  
do?' '' Torre said. ``He said, `You bet I am.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``A great big hug and a tip of the hat from me,'' Torre said.  
``It was just more than he should have had heaped on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours before the game, Yankees general manager Brian  
Cashman walked up to Zimmer, shook his hand and whispered, ``Thank 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been ready to do this about a week,'' Torre said before  
the game. ``I think I'm all the way back. I don't anticipate 
missing any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urged by Zimmer to take the lineup card to home plate, instead  
of batting coach Chris Chambliss, Torre got a warm reception from 
the sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans began standing as soon as Torre stepped from the  
dugout, and continued clapping. The scoreboard flashed, ``Welcome 
Back, Joe Torre,'' and he tipped his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a 3-6 homestand, the Yankees fell to 21-16 as Pedro  
Martinez outpitched David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been chomping a little bit lately,'' Torre said. ``It's  
tough when we struggled here. I was feeling a little helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Torre did not make the one mistake he feared -- he was  
concerned he might accidentally move his hands and signal some 
unintended play. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre had been with the Yankees for some of their home and road  
games, though he had not felt ready to return on a full-time basis 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a doubt. I had to come back here to see,''  
Torre said. ``I want to busy my mind with something other than when 
the next test is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre will continue to undergo tests and said he expects further  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very fortunate,'' Torre said. ``Future? I'd like to  
keep doing this next year and the year after that. I'm going to 
take it a little bit at a time.''

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Makes Midnight Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just after midnight, in a theater close, close  
by, the Wookiee wannabes, the Darth fakers and the rainstorm 
troopers turned out in droves today for the first peek at the 
``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Force was here again, fresh ``Star Wars' material  
for the first time in 16 years. Was ``Star Wars: Episode One -- The 
Phantom Menace'' worth the wait? 
</P>
<P>
	``The best of the bunch,'' declared 16-year-old Phillip DeBono,  
born six years after the film that started it all. ``It's as good 
as Darth Vader is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm was shared by the rest of the sold-out crowd that  
saw this morning's debut screening of the $115 million film. 
``Excellent!'' and ``Fantastic!'' they told rain-soaked fans still 
waiting outside New York's Ziegfeld Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was the same at theaters, cineplexes and malls across  
the country, from Charleston, W.Va., to Des Moines, Iowa, to Los 
Angeles. Some companies were bracing for a ``Phantom'' sickout; one 
employment agency has estimated that 2.2 million people will skip 
work today to see the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Deans, 26, a paralegal from Brooklyn, said he would still  
be able to make it to work this morning after a 6:30 a.m. 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years to see this,'' he said. ``It brings  
back the child in all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowd, which filled all 1,162 seats at $9.50 a pop,  
partied on the street for hours before the first show at the 
Manhattan theater. It was an eclectic bunch -- Obi Wan Kenobis of 
all shapes and sizes, a wide assortment of Princess Leia hairdos, 
scalpers asking $100 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will go on ... and on ... and on. ``The Phantom  
Menace'' was playing around the clock at five New York City 
theaters. Midnight showings were offered in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, and a midnight show in Indianapolis was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Upbeat reviews from fans were in a different stratosphere from  
critics' pans. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Keith Arbeeny, who wore a storm trooper's helmet: ``It  
took you almost to another world. It was mind-boggling, like 
nothing I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News: ``It's all  
sound and fury and special effects, signifying nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Robert Farrell, who paid $100 to a scalper: ``It was  
worth every penny. The special effects are out of this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Todd McCarthy in Variety: ``It is neither captivating  
nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewer Aaron Savage, dressed as character Darth Maul: ``The  
movie was great -- really, really great. It was a real fan's 
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You get the point: the movie is critic-proof.  
</P>
<P>
	No one is asking if ``The Phantom Menace'' will make money; the  
question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach 
the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-day opening window, ``Menace'' was expected to beat  
the opening record of $90.2 million set by ``Lost World: Jurassic 
Park'' in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by George Lucas, ``The Phantom  
Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a 
generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid 
named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were 
lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an 
aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''

<HEADLINE> Lehman Group Reportedly Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's financial watchdog agency has begun  
inspecting three Japanese units of the Lehman Brothers group of the 
United States, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lehman Brothers spokesman said that the inspection began  
Wednesday; he refused to elaborate. The Financial Supervisory 
Agency would neither confirm nor deny the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was first reported Thursday by the Nihon Keizai,  
Japan's top financial newspaper. The paper said the action was 
focused on derivatives transactions designed to defer client losses 
on securities holdings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lehman Brothers spokesman, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said that the company believed the agency action is part 
of a routine audit and that it is fully cooperating with 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's latest inspection involved the Tokyo branches of  
Lehman Brothers Japan Inc., Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management 
KK and Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection is only the second the agency has carried out of  
foreign financial institutions operating in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the watchdog agency began investigating the Japanese  
operations of the Credit Suisse First Boston group for alleged 
improprieties in derivatives dealings. The agency is in the final 
stages of that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	If any illegalities are found, possible penalties include  
suspension of operations, the Nihon Keizai said.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Keeps Going Despite Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With barely a ripple of support in the early  
Republican polls, Lamar Alexander insists that he can vault from 
the field when the real 2000 competition begins and the question 
isn't famous names but who's ready to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	He is, the former Tennessee governor, secretary of education,  
and two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination 
says; and the favorites, Texas Gov. George Bush and Elizabeth Dole, 
have yet to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm patient about it,'' Alexander said in an interview with  
The Associated Press, referring to his persistent, dogged quest -- 
begun in 1995, with no noticeable pause since. 
</P>
<P>
	In the preseason polls, his name ranks near the bottom of the  
list of 11 GOP prospects, declared and undeclared. His campaign was 
in the red, according to his March 31 report to the Federal 
Election Commission. Alexander said his fund raising is going fine 
now, while declining to give numbers. He said that the question 
isn't who has the most money but who has enough to run effectively 
in the first contests of 2000, and that he will. 
</P>
<P>
	He took in $784,773 in the first three months of the year, but  
raised more than that at one kickoff dinner this month in 
Nashville, Alexander said. It was the first in a series of 26 money 
events in May and June. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither that, nor poll ratings of 5 percent and lower, nor  
Bush's early lead and $7.6 million raised by March 31, wrings an 
admission of frustration or weariness from Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry, I just get up and go,'' Alexander said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure I get tired, but I enjoy what I'm doing. I'm doing it for  
a purpose. ... So that keeps me going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he certainly keeps going. ``My day is basically working on  
what I have to say, what I believe, recruiting chairmen in Iowa and 
raising money.'' And then doing it again the next day. Running for 
president at this point, he said, means driving two hours to 
Ottumwa, Iowa, to see a dozen people, sometimes with a flat tire to 
delay the trip back to the Des Moines hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of it, Alexander said he's much more comfortable seeking  
the presidency now than the first time. ``I mean, running for 
president of the United States is not like stepping up from 
alderman to mayor or mayor to governor; it's like taking on a new 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An old one for him now, but new, and a severe test, he said,  
awaiting Bush and Dole, the leaders in the Republican presidential 
preference polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said their ranking is understandable. ``There's not a  
Republican under 45 who's voted for president who hasn't voted for 
a Bush or a Dole so you expect in a preliminary year for 
well-respected names like that to be high up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are almost completely untested candidates in the  
national arena,'' he added. ``There'll come a time when it all 
settles back down to earth and the question will be not who has the 
most famous last name or who has the most money, but who's ready to 
be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question also will be who can win. Alexander's first run  
didn't pass that test. He quit early, after a succession of primary 
defeats. His best 1996 showings were third place finishes in Iowa 
and New Hampshire. The latter haunts him. ``The race in '96 was 
over when Bob Dole beat me by 3,800 votes in New Hampshire,'' he 
recounted. Pat Buchanan won that primary. By Alexander's reckoning, 
if he'd finished second, Dole would have dropped out, the race 
would have been between him and Buchanan, ``and I would have won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Dole beat Alexander by 7,609 votes, according to the  
final, official figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory is as shaky as the numbers, but it goes to his  
current campaign game plan, which concentrates on organizing for 
the first caucuses in Iowa and the first primary in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	And on making an expectations case against Bush, saying that as  
the front-runner, he should be presumed to be a big winner in every 
contest, including an Iowa straw poll in August, which the 
Alexander people there think they've already got locked. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander knows that he's got to win early this time, with the  
decisive, big state primaries set for March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fast race,'' Alexander said, ``a hundred yard  
dash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or will be next winter. For him, the marathon came first.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya, Trinidad Nearing Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A Sept. 18 fight between unbeaten welterweight  
champions Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad might happen after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival promoters Bob Arum and Don King exchanged new proposals  
for the 147-pound showdown, and Arum was encouraged enough to move 
back until Friday a deadline for Trinidad to sign for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to me that we're getting close,'' Arum said. ``It's  
not there yet, but it is moving sufficiently that we may get an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum had given Trinidad, who is promoted by King, until 8 p.m.  
EDT Wednesday to accept a $10 million offer for the fight. But, 
after getting a counteroffer from King for $11 million, Arum 
extended the deadline until the same time on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said he was sending King a new offer which makes some  
concessions on the points King raised in his counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the only issue is money,'' Arum said. ``We've made  
a compromise. Hopefully it will get done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz said the promoter wants a deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has said all along he wants the fight to be made for Sept.  
18,'' Fritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya would make from $12 million to $15 million for the  
fight, which would be televised on pay-per-view. He suggested last 
week that Trinidad didn't really want to fight him and was using 
the money dispute to get out of the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is too much money for him, but we're giving it to him,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``If I were Trinidad I would sign that contract 
because he's never going to get another offer like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father, Felix Trinidad Sr., said Tuesday in Puerto  
Rico that his son would not fight for less than $12 million. 
Trinidad said of the original $10 million offer, King would pocket 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want an excuse to not have to fight and so they are  
trying to make me the guilty party,'' the father said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks over the fight have overshadowed title defenses by both  
fighters, including a Saturday night WBC welterweight title defense 
by De La Hoya against Oba Carr in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're keeping Oscar out of all of this,'' Arum said. ``We want  
him to stay focused for Carr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad fights a week after De La Hoya, defending his IBF  
147-pound title against Hugo Pineda. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters are big punchers in their prime and both are  
looking to move up to 154 pounds, making the Sept. 18 date perhaps 
the last time they could meet at the welterweight limit. Trinidad 
is 34-0 with 29 knockouts while De La Hoya is 30-0 with 24 
knockouts.

<HEADLINE>  Entire Dutch Cabinet Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The entire Dutch Cabinet resigned  
Wednesday after the ruling coalition split over whether to give 
citizens the right to vote in referendums. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Wim Kok didn't say if he would form a new  
Cabinet, but he hinted that new parliamentary elections probably 
would be necessary to resolve the crisis, saying: ``The voters must 
have their say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kok, Queen Beatrix and party leaders were expected to meet over  
the next few days on what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of the situation, the ministers ... decided to jointly  
resign,'' Kok said in a letter to the queen. Later, in a brief and 
somber nationally televised address to Parliament, he called the 
collapse ``a bitter pill and a terrible loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis comes at an awkward time for the Netherlands, which  
is a member of NATO and has committed forces to the alliance's air 
campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Netherlands is maybe not formally at war, but practically  
speaking is at war, and many will ask: Is this the right moment for 
a Cabinet crisis? I would answer no,'' said Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, 
leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal, the leading opposition 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the government -- formed just last July after  
parliamentary elections were held a year ago -- began before dawn, 
when Parliament's upper chamber voted down a bill to let the Dutch 
public vote in ballot measures. The bill was a longtime goal of the 
Democrats 66 party, the junior member of the three-party ruling 
coalition, which also includes the larger and more influential 
Labor and Liberal parties. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have permitted citizens to decide certain economic and  
social issues through a referendum, such as whether to join the 
European Union's common currency. Issues of taxation and the 
military would be exempt from public votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats 66 resigned its three Cabinet posts in protest after  
the bill failed. The Cabinet met during the day in an effort to 
thwart a collapse, but the talks were fruitless, and ministers of 
the right-leaning Liberal Party and Kok's left-of-center Labor 
Party also quit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberal and Labor parties have a large-enough majority to  
continue ruling as a two-party government. But the centrist 
Democrats 66 party has often soothed tense relations between its 
two larger partners in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	After debating all night and into the early morning, only 49  
lawmakers in the 75-member upper chamber voted for the bill. It 
needed 50 votes -- a two-thirds majority -- to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberal, Labor and Democrats 66 parties had agreed when the  
current government was formed to take up the issue of referendum 
voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But early Wednesday, Hans Wiegel, a senior member of the Liberal  
Party, voted against the measure. He argued the measure was flawed 
because it would give the public too much power over government 
policy, particularly in issues involving European and international 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	All other Liberal Party members of the upper chamber voted in  
favor of the bill, despite earlier warnings that they would block 
it. Such a drama was unusual in the largely figurehead upper 
chamber, where a vote hasn't caused a government to fall since 
1907. 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the  
Netherlands, where no single party has been able to get enough 
seats in Parliament to take outright control.

when Parliament's upper chamber voted down a bill to let the Dutch 
public vote in ballot measures. The bill was a longtime goal of the 
Democrats 66 party, the junior member of the three-party ruling 
coalition, which also includes the larger and more influential 
Labor and Liberal parties. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have permitted citizens to decide certain economic and  
social issues through a referendum, such as whether to join the 
European Union's common currency. Issues of taxation and the 
military would be exempt from public votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats 66 resigned its three Cabinet posts in protest after  
the bill failed. The Cabinet met during the day in an effort to 
thwart a collapse, but the talks were fruitless, and ministers of 
the right-leaning Liberal Party and Kok's left-of-center Labor 
Party also quit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberal and Labor parties have a large-enough majority to  
continue ruling as a two-party government. But the centrist 
Democrats 66 party has often soothed tense relations between its 
two larger partners in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	After debating all night and into the early morning, only 49  
lawmakers in the 75-member upper chamber voted for the bill. It 
needed 50 votes -- a two-thirds majority -- to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberal, Labor and Democrats 66 parties had agreed when the  
current government was formed to take up the issue of referendum 
voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But early Wednesday, Hans Wiegel, a senior member of the Liberal  
Party, voted against the measure. He argued the measure was flawed 
because it would give the public too much power over government 
policy, particularly in issues involving European and international 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	All other Liberal Party members of the upper chamber voted in  
favor of the bill, despite earlier warnings that they would block 
it. Such a drama was unusual in the largely figurehead upper 
chamber, where a vote hasn't caused a government to fall since 
1907. 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the  
Netherlands, where no single party has been able to get enough 
seats in Parliament to take outright control.

<HEADLINE> Royals Coach Hurt Ridding Bicycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tom Burgmeier, bullpen coach for the  
Kansas City Royals, fractured his wrist and knee Wednesday when he 
was struck by a car while riding his bicycle to Kauffman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals said Burgmeier, 55, was struck when a car made a  
right turn in front of him. Both he and the bike became airborne 
over the top of the vehicle. He was treated for a laceration to the 
right knee and he will undergo surgery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The club said he was in stable condition with two fractures of  
the right wrist and a fracture of the left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year major league veteran with five clubs, Burgmeier was  
79-55 with 102 saves and a 3.23 career ERA. He was a member of the 
1980 American League All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Jirschele, the Royals minor league coordinator of  
instruction and infield, took Burgmeier's place as bullpen coach 
for Wednesday night's game.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raiser Will Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruling that reinstated  
charges against a Democratic fund-raiser accused of hiding illegal 
contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign will aid prosecutors in 
several other campaign-finance cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  
on Tuesday reversed a lower court ruling that had thrown out five 
false-statements charges against Maria Hsia, who steered thousands 
of dollars from a Buddhist temple to the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also affirmed the lower court's ruling that  
Hsia must stand trial on another charge of conspiracy involving 
$65,000 in illegal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said she was ``surprised and  
disappointed'' in the decision and that an appeal was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said, ``We're very  
pleased'' with the ruling. He added, ``This means we can press 
ahead on this case and on other cases'' in which other fund-raisers 
or donors are accused of making false statements to campaign 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cases involve Thai businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak,  
former Little Rock, Ark., restaurateur Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie and 
Franklin L. Haney, a longtime political supporter of Vice President 
Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, was accused of  
disguising contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign and other 
politicians between 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges allege she solicited the donations and then  
orchestrated false filings to the Federal Election Commission. 
Prosecutors said the filings amount to false statements to the 
government because the contributors named were not the true source 
of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia, who has close ties to Gore, pleaded innocent. Her lawyers  
argued in court papers that she never made any claim about the 
names listed with the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	After Trie, Hsia was the second figure charged by a special  
Justice Department campaign fund-raising task force investigating 
alleged abuses in the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court rejected U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's  
findings last September that the government's case against Hsia was 
illogical and that prosecutors did not show how Hsia ``knowingly 
caused'' false filings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not entirely clear what defects the district court found  
in the government's theory of causation,'' Judge Stephen F. 
Williams wrote for the appeals court. ``The false statements here 
are the political committees' reports identifying certain listed 
names as sources of specific contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected Friedman's finding that Hsia's conduct  
was largely shielded by the First Amendment protection for 
political expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a President Reagan appointee, was joined in the ruling  
by Judges Judith W. Rogers and David Tatel, both President Clinton 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie had filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Hsia  
against the government's appeal. However, the appeals court 
rejected his arguments that the Federal Election Commission 
reporting forms were ``fundamentally ambiguous'' and that they did 
not request identification of the actual source of contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thus reject all arguments that the statements alleged in  
the indictment were 'literally true,''' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsia currently is on trial in Los Angeles on separate tax  
evasion charges.

<HEADLINE> Retirees' Taxes May Not Drop Much </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Most people assume that their cost of living --  
including their taxes -- will be lower during their retirement 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's certainly the case for most people, but taxes may not  
drop as much as you might think, says a tax expert from the College 
for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, retirees may lose some of the major deductions they had  
before retirement. Second, and perhaps more important, they are 
taxed on income they are not used to receiving,'' says Michael 
Cates, a professional tax preparer and an academic assistant at the 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some financial planners estimate that up to 85 percent of  
their retired clients remain in the same tax bracket they were in 
before they retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As people approach and enter retirement, they often lose some of  
the tax deductions that helped reduce the amount of taxable income 
they generated, according to Cates. For example, your home mortgage 
is typically paid off by retirement, eliminating the deduction for 
home mortgage interest, though the deduction for property taxes may 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cates says he's seen suggestions in print that retirees may want  
to continue the interest deduction on a paid-off home by taking out 
a home-equity loan, but he thinks that's generally not a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, you're putting your home at risk if you can't pay  
back the loan, and second, why spend a dollar in interest costs 
just to save 28 cents (or whatever your tax bracket) in taxes. The 
only rationale he can see for such borrowing is if you can make 
more money by investing the loan elsewhere -- but that entails risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A more likely scenario for helping to offset the loss of the  
mortgage interest for the primary residence is the purchase of a 
vacation home, a motor home or even a boat. Interest on these 
second homes (most anything that has sleeping, cooking and bathroom 
facilities is viewed as a residence) is usually deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major deduction that disappears for most retirees is the  
personal exemption for dependents, who (except for those boomerang 
children) have left home. 
</P>
<P>
	Deductions for unreimbursed employee business expenses that  
exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) also disappear at 
retirement. On the other hand, deductions for medical expenses may 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical expenses, including insurance premiums, that exceed 7 1/2  
percent of your AGI are deductible. Cates notes that premiums for 
long-term care insurance policies are now deductible up to a 
certain limit, depending on your age (In 1999, $2,120 in premiums 
can be deducted, for example, for those ages 61-70). 
</P>
<P>
	However, the major tax deduction pre-retirees often forget that  
they will lose when they retire is their contributions to 
tax-deferred retirement plans, Cates says. 
</P>
<P>
	These contributions might amount to as much as 10 percent to 15  
percent of their employment income, especially as they approach 
retirement. Thus, ``although their retirement income might be lower 
than before retirement, a greater percentage of the income will be 
exposed to taxes,'' Cates notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the loss of income-tax deductions, retirees sometimes  
overlook the fact that distributions from their retirement plans, 
whether pensions paid for by employers or withdrawals from accounts 
the retirees funded, are taxable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these accounts were tax-advantaged going in, so they  
are fully taxable coming out,'' Cates says. 
</P>
<P>
	The real shock can come when you turn 70 1/2, especially if you and  
your spouse hit that age about the same time. At that point, you 
must start making minimum withdrawals from your retirement accounts 
(unless you are still working) and individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	If those accounts have grown in size over the years due to wise  
investing, and if you've been getting by since retirement without 
having to dip too heavily into those accounts, you may find 
yourself required to make minimum withdrawals that will trigger a 
bigger tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
	These required distributions also boost the chances of another  
tax bite retirees often overlook -- the taxation of Social Security 
benefits. Married couples filing jointly can have half their Social 
Security benefits subject to tax if their ``provisional income'' 
exceeds $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisional income includes 50 percent of Social Security  
benefits, tax-exempt income and regular income. If their 
provisional income exceeds $44,000, then up to 85 percent of their 
Social Security benefits are subject to tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are strategies that can mitigate the tax bite in  
retirement, such as carefully choosing beneficiaries for IRAs, 
selecting the best distribution options or using charitable giving 
strategies,'' Cates says. ``Taxpayers should discuss options with 
their financial planner, preferably before they retire.''

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Posts Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Greater use of mobile phones and the Internet  
helped boost fourth-quarter pretax profits for British 
Telecommunications PLC by 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's largest phone company earned 836 million pounds, or  
$1.35 billion, before taxes in the three months ended March 31 
versus 630 million pounds a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Its sales rose 19 percent to 4.90 billion pounds, or $7.90  
billion, from 4.11 billion pounds a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	BT shares were up 4.6 percent in midday trading Wednesday in  
London. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, British Telecom posted a pre-tax profit of 4.30  
billion pounds, or $6.94 billion, up 34 percent from 3.21 billion 
pounds the previous year. The annual profit included a gain of 1.11 
billion pounds from the sale of the company's stake in MCI 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-year sales rose 14 percent to 18.22 billion pounds, or  
$29.39 billion, from 16.04 billion pounds a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	New ventures in Europe and Asia accounted for more than a third  
of the sales increase, while mobile and fixed-network calls in 
Britain made a strong contribution, BT said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapidly expanding use of the Internet and a rise in the  
number of calls to mobile phones were the main factors in a sharp 
increase in domestic traffic in the second half of the fiscal year, 
Chairman Iain Vallance said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, losses mounted at BT's start-up operations in Europe.  
The loss at German joint-venture Viag Interkom swelled to 429 
million pounds from 336 million pounds, while BT's Dutch unit 
Telfort sank deeper into the red, to 130 million pounds from 46 
million pounds.

	Excerpts from Republican presidential candidate Lamar  
Alexander's interview Wednesday with The Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	His plaid shirt, the gimmick from his 1996 campaign: ``It's  
literally all they knew about me -- I was the guy in the red plaid 
shirt. ... People would say, `Where's the shirt? Where did you buy 
it? Was it made in the USA? Is it hot? Where can I get one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	His chances to win: ``I'm comfortable with the fact that I'm  
better prepared for the job than the others. And I hope that shows 
in the Iowa caucuses. If it does, then I'll suddenly be the 
front-runner and they'll be chasing me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush: ``If ... he rolls into Iowa as the  
inevitable winner of the presidential race and shows up not ready 
to be president and then get beats right away, I think he'll start 
going down so fast that he never recovers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	Why he thinks Bush can't afford to skip or lose a straw poll in  
Ames, Iowa, this summer: ``If he doesn't have a huge win in the 
Iowa straw poll, I think it would be an indication that he's not 
what he's cooked up to be.''

	Personal character: ``It's a subject I expect to be asked about.  
I can't think of a more important question.''

	Creating better schools and making parenting easier: ``That is  
the single most serious problem we have in this country.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Faces Coalition Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Heading into coalition talks, Israel's next  
prime minister must contemplate whether to exclude the 
ultra-Orthodox Shas party to slow its phenomenal ascent -- or 
include it to speed the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Secular Israelis who gave Ehud Barak his crushing victory in  
this week's election fear the theocracy that Shas advocates, and 
prefer an alliance with Likud, the hard-line party Barak unseated. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least with the Likud we have a normative partnership on  
what the state of Israel is and how it looks,'' Avraham Burg, who 
led Barak's hard-hitting campaign against Likud Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu. ``With Shas, we do not have a normative 
agreement like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Shas leaders have been quick to reassure secular  
Israelis that their descriptions of a state run according to 
religious law is a utopian ideal to pray for, rather than 
legislate. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was before they leapt from 10 to 17 seats in  
parliament, making Shas the third-largest party. The Likud has 19 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas, which was part of Netanyahu's coalition, has yet to  
outline any new legislative tacks, but followers are already 
speaking of a new look for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is natural,'' said Yehuda Sharabi, a kiosk owner in the  
coastal town of Ashdod, a Shas stronghold. ``The state of the Jews 
must function according to Jewish law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk instills fear among secular Israelis, who resented  
incursions into their daily lives legislated while Shas was in the 
coalition, such as shutting down businesses that operate on the 
Sabbath and having Interior Ministry officials pose intrusive 
questions about immigrants' Jewish background. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas was able to cultivate support among Israelis -- especially  
Sephardic Jews who are of Middle Eastern background -- by offering 
free kindergarten education, long school hours and other social 
services through its control of deep-pocketed ministries such as 
Interior and Labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Shas out of government would dry up such sources, some  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it continues to be plugged into the coffers, the result  
would be that the Barak government would foster Shas and its youth 
at the expense of the good of the state,'' columnist Amnon Dankner 
wrote in Maariv. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the need to advance the peace process frozen by  
Netanyahu during his years in power was more important. The Likud, 
which touted its deep suspicion of the peace process and the Arabs 
as a campaign virtue, would slow the peace, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Shas supports the process, saying it fulfills a  
religious commandment to prevent bloodshed. Its legislative votes 
were crucial to sustaining the late Yitzhak Rabin's peace 
initiatives after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak could build a narrow coalition without Shas or the Likud,  
but he says he needs wide backing to make hard decisions, including 
withdrawing from territory, pulling troops out of Lebanon and 
dismantling settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, Barak is counting out Shas as long as Arieh  
Deri -- convicted last month on bribe-taking charges -- remains party 
leader.

<HEADLINE> Sportswear Maker To Sell Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Apparel maker Brazos Sportswear Inc., which  
entered bankruptcy reorganization in January, plans to sell its 
business units through auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based company, which sells clothing with logos  
and licensed characters printed or embroidered on it, announced the 
sale Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the company's Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court  
for protection from creditors, management and the board of 
directors had been trying to find the best solution for creditors 
and employees of the company, said Chief Financial Officer Clayton 
Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	``After careful consideration, it was determined that a prompt  
sale of the company's business units, either individually or as a 
whole, is in the best interests of Brazos' creditors, employees, 
customers and suppliers,'' said Chambers. He has been appointed 
interim chief executive officer and interim chief operating officer 
through the sale process. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers said management believes that new ownership will allow  
the company's business units to capitalize on their individual 
strengths, while having access to greater financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction is scheduled for June 10; bids to purchase some or  
all of the assets must be submitted by June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazos operates manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities  
in 12 states.

<HEADLINE> CBS Shuffles Lineup; Pax Adds Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Top-rated CBS is betting on lawyers to carry  
half of its six new fall series and is shuffling its schedule to 
move favorites like ``Cosby'' and ``Chicago Hope'' to new nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is canceling ``Promised Land'' and ``L.A. Doctors.''  
Its long-running comedy, ``The Nanny,'' is retiring this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of CBS's three new dramas will be legal shows with women as  
central characters. ``Family Law'' stars Kathleen Quinlan in a show 
about lawyers who form a new firm after one woman's husband leaves 
her and takes their practice with him. Former ``NYPD Blue'' actress 
Amy Brenneman stars in ``Judging Amy,'' about a single mother who 
becomes a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	A new CBS comedy, ``Work With Me,'' is about a husband-and-wife  
team of lawyers who work from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is keeping its strong weekend schedule intact but is making  
significant prime-time changes on weekdays. ``Cosby'' will be moved 
from Monday nights to Wednesdays, and ``60 Minutes II'' shifted 
from Wednesday to Tuesday. CBS will air a movie on Wednesday 
instead of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-running hospital drama, ``Chicago Hope'' is being moved  
to Thursdays and kept on the schedule after creator David E. Kelley 
promised to take a more active role in steering the show. 
``Diagnosis Murder'' will air an hour earlier, on Thursdays at 8 
p.m. ET. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some of its rivals, CBS is sensing blood on Thursday  
nights, which NBC has dominated for more than a decade. ABC and the 
WB have promised to attack NBC with youth-oriented series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think NBC will still win Thursday nights, but I think  
everyone's going to chip away a little at them,'' said CBS 
President Leslie Moonves. ``There's no reason to believe that 
they're not going to decline even further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is poised to wrest this season's Nielsen Media Research's  
ratings crown from NBC, the network's first win since 1993-94. Its 
rivals minimize the accomplishment, saying that CBS ranks fourth 
among the 18-to-49-year-old demographic most coveted by 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has tried to bring in a younger audience through football  
and Howard Stern, but won't be doing much more to shock its core 
viewers. One of its new comedies even brings back ``Golden Girls'' 
star Betty White as a character. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to play the hand you're dealt,'' Moonves said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of new business realities, CBS acknowledged that it  
owns a stake in each of its six new programs. Struggling with 
declining revenue, television networks have been trying to make 
money by owning their programs, instead of buying them from 
independent production houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are CBS's other new programs:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Now &AMP; Again,'' an action drama about a middle-aged insurance  
salesman who is hit by a subway train. In return for a promise that 
he'll be a government agent, his body is scientifically rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Ladies Man'' is about a furniture maker trying to keep peace  
in an extended family of women, including his mother, played by 
White. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Love or Money,'' an ensemble comedy about a New York  
apartment house that stars Swoosie Kurtz, David Ogden Stiers, Paget 
Brewster and Brian Doyle Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pax TV unveiled a schedule for its second year as a  
broadcast network. It will continue to air reruns of ``Touched By 
an Angel'' and ``Diagnosis Murder'' five nights a week, but is 
adding four new series. 
</P>
<P>
	The new series are ``Hope Island,'' about a minister who  
rebuilds a church on an island off Washington state; ``Twice in a 
Lifetime,'' about a guardian angel who guides people into their 
past to revisit a pivotal life decision; ``Chicken Soup For the 
Soul,'' a televised version of the inspirational books; and ``The 
Star Machine,'' an amateur hour-type entertainment show.

<HEADLINE> Discovery May Be Launched Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA completed repairs today to  
space shuttle Discovery's hail-damaged fuel tank and remained on 
track for a launch next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Tuesday that Discovery probably would not lift  
off on its station-supply mission until the Memorial Day weekend. 
But this morning, managers said they have a better shot now of 
launching the shuttle as early as May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the weather forecast has improved for the  
shuttle's planned trip back to the pad on Thursday -- the day it was 
originally supposed to blast off -- and because the repairs went so 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle is loaded with 1 1/2 tons of equipment for the  
international space station, which was hoisted into orbit late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was returned to the hangar last weekend for repairs to  
its external fuel tank. Technicians discovered 648 holes in the 
foam insulation covering the tank, more than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the insulation holes were so small they did not need to  
be fixed, Wells said. Most were sanded or patched to prevent ice 
from forming when the tank is filled with super-cold fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers feared ice in the cavities could break off during  
liftoff and damage the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle managers figure they will need a week to prepare  
Discovery for launch once it's back on the pad.

<HEADLINE> Ford May Face Larger Ambulance Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Three Massachusetts ambulance operators that sued  
Ford Motor Co. for allegedly building defective ambulances are 
asking a federal judge to expand the case so more companies can 
seek relief. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suit filed in 1996, three family-owned companies claim that  
Ford-built ambulances had defective drive belts and transmissions 
that caused breakdowns and left patients stranded. It does not 
allege that any patients were injured as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies -- Professional Ambulance and Oxygen Service in  
Cambridge, Action Ambulance Service in Stoneham and Fallon Service 
in Milton -- are seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ford 
for alleged breach of warranty and unfair and deceptive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Monday, they also asked a federal judge to grant  
class-action status to anyone who bought certain 1992, 1993, or 
1994 Ford Econoline or F-Series vans. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorney Joanne D'Alcomo said at least a dozen -- and  
possibly more than 100 -- operators statewide would meet the 
criteria to join the case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. has taken the matter  
under advisement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief filed in the case, Ford said, ``The record in this  
case reflects the story of a meandering but persistent effort to 
bring a class action, even though none of the requisite ingredients 
for such a lawsuit are present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in a written statement issued Wednesday, Ford denied the  
suit's allegations, calling the case ``an effort to throw before 
the court a hodgepodge of unrelated claims in an effort to obtain 
millions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers, private companies and towns such as  
Nantucket, Boston, Worcester and Sudbury have reported trouble with 
certain 1992, 1993 and 1994 Ford vans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's attorneys have said the company acknowledged a problem  
with some accessory drive belts in 1996 and offered to fix the 
vehicles at the time. But they blamed the chronic transmission 
problems experienced by the plaintiffs on improper maintenance by 
ambulance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints come more than a decade after Ford, the nation's  
largest manufacturer of vehicles built for use as ambulances, 
recalled 22,000 ambulances to correct problems that caused at least 
two dozen fires and five injuries.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Tests Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety officials say tests show  
inflating air bags in some DaimlerChrysler minivans could seriously 
injure or kill short female passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler officials strongly disputed that the 11 tests  
performed on dummies representing short women indicated they could 
be seriously injured by the passenger-side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Company engineers said the air bags in the tests were catching  
between the dummy's head and neck in a cavity real people do not 
have, causing false high readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
said Tuesday they experimented with four types of dummy necks, 
working to fill the space between the head and neck with protective 
wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the air bags appeared to catch in the crack between the  
head and neck of dummies in some tests, six of the 11 tests 
indicated the air bags were generally exerting strong force on a 
variety of dummy neck types, government officials said. The forces 
registered on the neck during the six tests indicated a high 
probability of serious injury or death, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocacy groups urged the safety agency to force  
DaimlerChrysler to recall the more than 2 million minivans the 
company has built since 1994 and replace the air bags with less 
forceful ones. Most of those minivans were built before Chrysler 
Corp.'s acquisition last year by Germany's Daimler-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA officials have not started the formal investigative  
process required of the minivans, or any other vehicle, before they 
would request any recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president in charge of  
safety, said company engineers believe the air bags were getting 
caught between the dummy's head and neck in all six of the tests 
where the neck injury levels were high. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anybody to make a link between these tests and what's  
happening in the real world is totally ludicrous,'' Cischke said.

<HEADLINE>  Mourning Wins Defensive Player Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For Alonzo Mourning, being named NBA Defensive  
Player of the Year isn't much of a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat center was a lopsided choice for the honor three  
days after his team's season ended against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning smiled when discussing the award at a news conference  
Wednesday, but he couldn't muster much enthusiasm upon learning of 
the honor Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's great,'' he said. ``Can I trade it in to be playing  
Atlanta?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it's the Knicks against Atlanta, while Mourning settles  
for the most prestigious trophy of his seven-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those individual awards just sit on my mantelpiece and collect  
dust,'' he said. ``I'd trade all that bleep to be playing now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning received 89 of a possible 118 votes in balloting by a  
panel of sports writers and broadcasters from the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo, winner of the defensive award three  
of the previous four seasons, was second with 10 votes. Seattle's 
Gary Payton, who won it in 1995-96, was third with six votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor, and one that I feel is deserved,''  
Mourning said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, 29, had the best year in his career, anchoring a  
defense that allowed 84 points per game, second-lowest in the 
league. The 6-foot-10 center led the NBA in blocked shots with 3.9 
per game, blocking at least six shots 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning also averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds while shooting  
.511 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Against New York, Mourning had by far the best series of any  
Miami player, averaging 21 points, eight rebounds and three blocked 
shots. Just as important, he kept his notorious temper in check 
during the rugged series, but the Heat lost the series against 
their bitter rivals 3-2 on Allan Houston's last-second basket in 
Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shot ourselves in the foot,'' Mourning said. ``By far we're  
a better team than they are. It's not like they annihilated us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning has been endorsed for the league's most valuable player  
award by teammates and opponents, including coaches Jeff Van Gundy, 
Chuck Daly, Alvin Gentry and Tim Floyd, and such players as Patrick 
Ewing, Penny Hardaway and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't get it, there's something wrong with you all who  
vote,'' Ewing said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The MVP award will be announced during the NBA conference  
finals.

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Leafs: Great Lakes Showdown / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Many Toronto sports fans have a soft spot for  
Buffalo, a small-market city with Canadian-style winters, just 100 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Temporarily, though, the Peace Bridge that links Buffalo to  
Ontario may need another name. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time ever, the beloved hockey teams of Toronto and  
Buffalo are facing each other in a playoff series, with a berth in 
the Stanley Cup finals at stake. Players on both teams agree: Leafs 
vs. Sabres is a classic rivalry waiting for ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to start writing some history now,'' said Sabres  
forward Dixon Ward after his team advanced over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference championship series opens Sunday in  
Toronto; it will be the Sabres' first visit to the new Air Canada 
Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the matchup was determined, the Canadian media dubbed  
it the ``QEW Series'' after Queen Elizabeth Way, the highway 
linking Toronto to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls region. 
</P>
<P>
	With the two arenas only two hours apart, large numbers of fans  
-- including some without tickets for the sold-out games -- are 
expected to drive to other city to support their team on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to lock our doors over here because of all the  
Leafs fans coming over,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``It should 
be mayhem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has an extra dimension for Sabres players such as  
Jason Woolley and captain Michael Peca, raised as Leafs fans in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca saw TV footage of Toronto fans celebrating in the streets  
Monday night after the Leafs eliminated Pittsburgh, and he recalled 
joining similar revelry as a fan six years ago when Toronto won a 
playoff series over Detroit with an overtime goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was me. ... I was that guy honking the horns and cheering  
the Leafs on,'' Peca said. ``It's going to be fun being one of the 
guys trying to upset those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Leafs, it's the first time in the Stanley Cup's final  
four since 1994. Toronto hasn't won the cup since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have never won the cup, although this is their second  
straight appearance in the Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo is often depicted sympathetically in the Canadian media  
as a Canadian-style sports city, faced with the same small-market 
challenges -- and often brutal winter weather -- that beset places 
like Edmonton and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League are covered  
like a hometown team by the Toronto media, a phenomenon that has 
intensified since the Bills gave their quarterback job to longtime 
Canadian Football League superstar Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Leafs met five times during the regular season,  
with Buffalo winning three but losing the last two. The Leafs, the 
NHL's highest-scoring team, outshot the Sabres 163-119 in those 
games, yet were outscored 17-10, thanks to the goaltending of 
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason the teams haven't met in the playoffs previously  
is that the Leafs, until this season, played in the Western 
Conference. The series with Buffalo is just the sort of showdown 
the Leafs' brass hoped for when they finally won their bid to move 
into the same conference with such natural rivals as Buffalo, 
Montreal, Boston and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be pretty intense,'' said Leafs president Ken Dryden.  
``We want rivalries, and rivalries get spawned in playoff series.''

<HEADLINE>  Gonzalez Hit Streak at 30 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arizona's Luis Gonzalez extended his  
hitting streak to 30 games with a two-run, first-inning home run 
off San Francisco's Chris Brock on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-game streak matches the longest this decade, set in 1997  
by both Boston's Nomar Garciaparra and Cleveland's Sandy Alomar 
Jr., then again last year by Baltimore's Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's streak is the longest in the National League since  
Jerome Walton also hit in 30 straight in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez becomes the 37th player in major league history to have  
a hitting streak reach 30 games. Eleven of those failed to get a 
hit in their next game.

<HEADLINE> Racing Writer Gallaher Dies at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Mary Jane Gallaher, a turf writer who also  
worked in advertising and public relations promoting the equine 
industry, has died. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	She died Monday night of a head injury received May 11 in a fall  
down a flight of stairs at her home, according to a Fayette County 
coroner's office report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallaher wrote about horses and their owners for the Lexington  
Leader in the 1950s. She also wrote for the Thoroughbred Record and 
The Blood-Horse magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mary Jane was just intimately involved in the thoroughbred  
business from the time she was a young woman, and was very 
involved, not just in a journalistic sense, but in a practical 
sense as well,'' said Arnold Kirkpatrick, former editor of the 
Thoroughbred Record. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Allan Gallaher, a horse trainer and owner, bought  
land near Lexington in the early 1920s. The 35-acre Gallaher Farm 
was sold by Gallaher and her sister, Polly Gallaher Gaitskill, to 
William du Pont III for $1,755,000 in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallaher landed a job at the Thoroughbred Record in the 1940s.  
She wrote a turf column called First Call for the Leader between 
1950 and 1957. She concentrated on racetrack color and topics of 
human interest. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote about horses at a time when women weren't allowed in  
most racetrack press boxes. She reportedly was the first female 
reporter allowed in the Churchill Downs press box in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallaher is survived by her husband, Fred R. Kissling; two  
stepdaughters, Jayne Kissling Tannenbaum of Atlanta and Sarah 
Kissling Hendrix of Lexington; and her sister, who lives in 
Lexington.

<HEADLINE> Bait Man Tries To Help the Herring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Every spring when the Atlantic  
herring begin to run, Paul Bettencourt can be found at an old dam 
at the mouth of Ten Mile River. 
</P>
<P>
	Stooped over in his flannel shirt and Greek fishing cap,  
Bettencourt scoops up the herring with a net and puts them in a 
pond on the other side so they can spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Without him, the herring would swim in vain in the churning  
waters below the 10-foot dam, trapped a few feet from their 
spawning grounds after a treacherous migration from the ocean and 
up Narragansett Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers have joined him over the years, but locals know it's  
Bettencourt who brought the herring back to Ten Mile River. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the last hunter-gatherers,'' said Andy Lipsky, a  
habitat restoration specialist with the environmental group Save 
the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bettencourt, 59, a retired bait fisherman, it's simply a way  
to repay nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a bad back forced him out of the bait business,  
Bettencourt caught just about anything that wriggled, swam and fit 
on a hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiners, eels, herring, crawfish, shrimp, shad: ``You name it, I  
fished it,'' said Bettencourt, whose face is etched with the lines 
of a lifetime in the wind and sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next to my family, the water is my one love.''  
</P>
<P>
	His interest in herring began as a child in the late 1940s and  
early '50s, when Bettencourt and his brother caught and sold the 
fish door-to-door in the Jewish neighborhoods of Providence's East 
Side. People pickled or smoked them for food; others ate the 
females' pungent orange roe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettencourt went into the bait business full-time as a young  
man, and he often found himself near the dam on Ten Mile River. 
</P>
<P>
	It's shameful, he thought, that no herring could reach Omega  
Pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to move the dam, Bettencourt decided to move the fish.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the early 1970s and the dam had long since choked off the  
pond. So, Bettencourt and his brother removed the back seat from 
his beat-up '63 Ford, put in barrels and drove to a thriving 
herring run down the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	They filled the barrels, drove back to Ten Mile River and dumped  
them just beyond the dam. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drove like hell, back and forth all night,'' Bettencourt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next spring, Bettencourt noticed a few herring had returned,  
so he scooped them over the dam. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a few more trips in his old Ford, continued to scoop the  
herring over the dam every spring and slowly brought life back to 
the pond, where the hatchlings fatten themselves all summer before 
heading to sea in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam on Ten Mile River is like many that were built on rivers  
up and down the Atlantic coast to create power or reservoirs for 
towns and cities. As the dams went up in a wave of industrial 
progress, the herring, salmon and other fish that travel upriver to 
spawn suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ponds and marshes became dumps. Industrial pollution and sewage  
made the rivers inhospitable. The herring stocks plunged in New 
England; commercial harvesting ceased in Narragansett Bay in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
	``They became a ghost of the past,'' Lipsky said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of 50 historic fish runs on Narragansett Bay, 35 are blocked,  
according to a report by the Save the Bay group. Water quality has 
improved dramatically over the past 25 years, but the fish can't 
get past obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same on many waterways up and down the East Coast, said  
Michael Hayden, president of the American Sportfishing Association 
in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``The herring are at the base of the food chain for a lot of  
bigger fish such as striped bass,'' said Hayden. ``They are 
critical to the ecosystem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The association provides $400,000 in matching money annually  
through its Fish America Foundation to help fishing clubs and 
communities restore fish runs, but more money is needed, Hayden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More people might be concerned if they knew George Washington  
was a herring man, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington earned much of his money by catching, salting and  
selling herring that surged up the Potomac River every spring near 
his Mount Vernon estate, Hayden said. To this day, the Potomac 
still supports one of the East's largest herring runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The herring runs here today are not what they were in George  
Washington's day, but they are a far cry from their lowest point'' 
in the early 1970s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at Ten Mile River, Bettencourt hoists his small net to show  
several observers two eight-inch herring. He plops them into the 
water and watches as they swam into the reeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everyone does his part, we can bring the fish back, improve  
the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he scrambled down the granite stones to the water's edge  
and plunged his net into the roiling water.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Calls Bush, Dole Untested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said  
Wednesday he has the experience and personal character to seize the 
White House in 2000, dismissing Republican front-runners George W. 
Bush and Elizabeth Dole as ``completely untested candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, in an hour-long interview with The Associated Press,  
also fleshed out his gun control policy by supporting mandatory 
trigger locks for guns, background checks at gun shows and raising 
the age limit for purchasing and possessing handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	He called Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic  
contender, the ``head cheerleader'' for a disgraced president and 
accused him of trying to run local schools from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He blasted President Clinton's policies on Kosovo, saying the  
Monica Lewinsky investigation distracted him early in the crisis 
and stripped him of ``the moral authority'' to lead America and its 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said nothing in his personal background will be out  
bounds for the 2000 campaign. ``I'll answer questions about my 
character,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 58, finished third in the 1996 Iowa caucuses and New  
Hampshire primary but is best remembered for his signature red 
plaid shirts. Dressed in a crisp suit and tie, Alexander said he 
retired his 1996 attire because voters knew more about his plaid 
than his platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``My shtick is I'm ready to be president and the rest (of the  
GOP field) are relatively untested,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shtick has yet to stick: Alexander is still a blip in  
Republican presidential surveys dominated by Bush, the Texas 
governor, and Mrs. Dole, the former American Red Cross president. 
</P>
<P>
	While Alexander has campaigned for president almost nonstop  
since 1995, Bush and Mrs. Dole are first-time candidates with 
well-known names. Bush is the son of former President George Bush; 
Mrs. Dole is the wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are almost completely untested candidates in the  
national arena,'' Alexander said of Bush, Mrs. Dole and the rest of 
the GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	As a former governor, college president, secretary of Education  
and businessman, Alexander said he is the most prepared. ``I've had 
more elective executive experience than all the rest of the 
Republican candidates put together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Alexander knows the only way he can win the nomination is  
for Bush to falter under the weight of high expectations. And thus 
the interview signaled a shift in his strategy, with an increased 
emphasis on Bush's potential weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big step from being a pretty good governor to being  
president of the United States,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-elected by a landslide in November, Bush has held elective  
office a little more than four years and has yet to campaign 
outside Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also said of Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	--''There've been Texans before with lots of money who've blown  
through Iowa and blown out without votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''I'm skeptical of people who begin their national careers in  
the Oval Office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''I was a one-term governor once. I thought I was pretty good.  
Was I ready to be president of the United States, to deal with 
Kosovo ... North Korea and the schools in this country and the 
aftermath of Littleton?,'' Alexander said, referring to the 
Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt it.''  
</P>
<P>
	In his most pointed reference to Bush's limited experience, he  
recalled that the governor recently called Kosovars ``Kosovarians'' 
and Greeks ``Grecians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of mistake would sink Bush in a general election  
debate against Gore, Alexander warned. ``We need to know going into 
the general election that we have a candidate who's ready to be 
president,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said, ``As governor as the second  
largest state in the United States and the 11th largest economy in 
the world, he has an outstanding record of leadership and proven 
ability to unite diverse people and achieve results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Mrs. Dole was ready for the leap from Red Cross  
president to American president, Alexander said it would be 
``unusual'' for a politician to make the Oval Office her first 
elective office. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 most likely GOP candidates, five have never held  
elective office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said his boss welcomed  
Alexander to the race, but had no comment on his remarks. Gore's 
office said his education record will speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of stern rebuttals may suggest that Bush, Mrs. Dole and  
Gore do not view Alexander as a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said character may be the most important issue of  
2000, even as Bush says he won't answers questions about his 
personal life 20 or 30 years ago. ``He'll have to decide what he 
does,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he supports some gun control, including raising the  
minimum age for gun purchases and possession to 21, Alexander 
accused Congress of taking part in a ``legislative orgy'' in the 
aftermath of the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the only way to prevent school shootings is to make  
parenting easier with family-friendly policies such as reducing 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austin, Bush said Wednesday he has no problem with requiring  
locks to be sold with guns, but thinks their use should be 
voluntary.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-EU Beef Confrontation Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The European Union's refusal to accept  
North American beef is jeopardizing the integrity of world trade 
law and will lead to retaliatory sanctions, U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman warned today. 
</P>
<P>
	But European Union Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler,  
speaking after Glickman to 600 delegates at the World Meat 
Congress, insisted that hormonally treated U.S. beef ``does 
threaten human health,'' so the EU ban could not be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation union has ignored a World Trade Organization  
ruling requiring it immediately to lift its 10-year-old ban on the 
hormone-treated beef from America and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials warn they will retaliate with $202 million in  
extra tariffs on EU imports when the arbitration deadline expires 
June 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for the WTO to work, its members have to respect its  
institutional authority. But in choosing to maintain its ban on 
beef from hormone-treated cattle, in my judgment the EU has put all 
this at risk,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	People should be skeptical about new food products but should  
not ``allow skepticism to evolve into complete denial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their speeches, Glickman and Fischler offered minor possible  
concessions. Glickman said that America might allow its beef 
exports to Europe to be labeled hormone-treated, while Fischler 
said the EU could organize a conference of U.S. and European 
scientists to agree on whether hormones pose a risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, however, both U.S. and EU officials said any  
significant shift was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	This three-day conference of meat officials from 30 countries  
provided a rallying point for those trying to persuade others to 
lower their barriers to meat imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lacy, American director of the International Policy  
Council on Agriculture and Food Trade, said many countries had 
exploited fears caused by outbreaks of Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy in the United Kingdom and E.coli bacteria in the 
United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanitary arguments today are more and more used as a means of  
trade protectionism,'' Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am well aware that beef producers in some countries see this  
ban as a measure to exclude beef imports from the EU,'' Fischler 
responded. ``There is no ulterior motive to this measure but the 
protection of human health.''

<HEADLINE> Fake Hughes Book for Sale on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now on sale for the first time, on the Internet  
only, a book that landed its author in prison instead of on the 
best-seller list: Clifford Irving's notorious ``autobiography'' of 
Howard Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a child I always loved,'' the 68-year-old Irving  
said Wednesday of the 1970s-era hoax, based on fabricated 
interviews with the reclusive billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is now available through an online seller owned in part  
by the author. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early '70s, Irving was one of the country's most  
talked-about writers. He had convinced publisher McGraw Hill that 
he had compiled an autobiography from secret meetings with Hughes. 
He received $765,000 for the proposed book. 
</P>
<P>
	But before publication, the scam was discovered. Irving served  
14 months in federal prison for fraud, and Time magazine named him 
Con Man of the Year. He has since come out with several books, 
mostly novels, but virtually all are out of print and he has no 
deals pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clifford Irving's Autobiography of Howard Hughes'' is being  
sold through the Web site terrificbooks.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt there was something unfinished in my life  
when it came to that book,'' Irving said from his home in Santa Fe, 
N.M. ``There are some wonderful things in it. It's highly 
entertaining. I'm not ashamed of the book, but I do feel a certain 
amount of shame for all the lies I told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author is complaining that he himself has been conned. He  
was to be seen Wednesday night in a taped interview with ``60 
Minutes'' newsman Mike Wallace, to whom Irving lied on air in 1972 
about the Hughes meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Irving said he was never told the interview would be part of  
the CBS special ``60 Minutes Classics: The Con Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disgusted,'' he said. ``They said the interview was meant  
to be a `60 Minutes Classic' on a regular `60 Minutes II' program. 
The word `con man' was never used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being fair to him,'' said ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Kevin  
Tedesco. ``We approached him to do a story about updating his great 
hoax from the '70s. And he saw it as a chance to say that he has 
now published his hoax. He's getting that from us and we're getting 
a great story.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Rally for Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Megawati Sukarnoputri grew up in  
Indonesia's presidential palace. Now she hopes that the first free 
election since her father suspended democracy 44 years ago will 
lead her back to the white-columned mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of her supporters choked Jakarta's streets  
Wednesday, dominating the official launch of the three-week 
campaign for the June 7 vote for a new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest outpouring of support so far for Megawati,  
the daughter of Indonesia's founding leader, Sukarno, and now a 
front-runner for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's parade through the capital was supposed to have  
promoted all 48 parties participating in what the government 
promises will be the first truly open ballot for the vast majority 
of the 130 million voters in the sprawling Southeast Asian island 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Each party had their own colorful convoys in the parade. But  
euphoric members of Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party for 
Struggle took over the procession by sheer numbers, waving red 
flags and banners from the backs of trucks and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's popularity has grown even though she rarely talks to  
reporters and remains vague about her party's policies. 
</P>
<P>
	While she did not take part in Wednesday's parade, she was  
clearly the object of mass adulation. Office workers lined 
Jakarta's main boulevard, cheering and clapping as party activists 
raised their fists and shouted ``Long live Mega!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts doubt her party can win power outright. Indonesia is  
the world's most populous Islamic nation and it's possible that 
conservative Muslims here might not accept a female president. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Megawati and her party top opinion polls ahead of  
the election for 462 seats in the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected legislators and government appointees are to form  
a special assembly later to select a head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Her chances of getting the top job were strengthened when  
Megawati agreed to enter a coalition with two other pro-reform 
opposition parties this week. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to put aside policy differences and use their combined  
strength in Parliament and the assembly to outvote the ruling 
Golkar Party for the first time in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar helped keep former authoritarian President Suharto in  
power for 32 years until he was forced to resign after riots and 
protests devastated the capital and left more than 1,200 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's parade was a noisy and festive affair that was  
marred only by sporadic attacks on Golkar vehicles and officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In one incident, spectators jeered as a mob tore yellow Golkar  
signs from a truck. Later, an angry group punched and kicked a 
Golkar member. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar dominated the tightly controlled political landscape  
under Suharto, but it is now languishing in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict it will face major losses at the ballot box as  
accusations of massive corruption and human rights abuses continue 
to swirl around Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar has nominated Suharto's hand-picked successor, President  
B.J. Habibie, as its presidential candidate. While he has 
instituted many reforms, he has been unable to shrug off close 
links to Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's political rise is perhaps ironic. Her father ended  
Indonesia's last experiment with unfettered democracy in 1955. He 
later declared himself president for life, before being replaced by 
Suharto after an attempted communist coup in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Since entering politics in 1993, she has consistently called for  
greater democratic reform while tapping lingering nostalgia for her 
tough-talking, nationalistic father who died in disgrace in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Her popularity soared in 1996 after Suharto's regime tried to  
oust her as head of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Megawati has become the people's symbol of resistance in their  
fight against Suharto's regime and now Habibie's government,'' said 
Daniel Sparingga of the University of Airlangga in Surabaya. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like her, and not just because she is her father's  
daughter.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Settles Teletubbies Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- The creators and marketers of  
Teletubbies have settled a lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in 
which the giant retailer was accused of copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	England-based Ragdoll Productions Ltd. and its North American  
licensing agent itsy bitsy Entertainment Co. alleged that 
Wal-Mart's small figurine characters known as Bubbly Chubbies were 
copies of its popular Teletubbies characters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement, Wal-Mart agreed to pull all Bubbly Chubbies  
items off shelves, destroy the remaining inventory and provide itsy 
bitsy Entertainment and Ragdoll Productions information on the 
manufacturing and distribution of such items. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart said Wednesday that it did not pay any monetary damages  
in the settlement. The lawsuit was brought in March in U.S. 
District Court in New York and still continues against the alleged 
manufacturer and another distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern in filing this suit was not about money, but in  
protecting the integrity of the Teletubbies trademarks which we 
have associated with products that insure the highest of safety and

<HEADLINE> Education Bill Seeks Small Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to base  
federal education aid on how well local school systems phase out 
uncertified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's public schools are going to rise and fall on the  
quality of their teachers,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley 
said, adding that schools in poorer districts rely too heavily on 
aides to instruct students. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's proposal for the $15 billion Elementary and  
Secondary Education Act also would require states and school 
districts to reduce class size, turn around failing schools, issue 
report cards to parents on how schools are doing, set strict 
academic and classroom discipline standards and end the practice of 
promoting children who are not academically ready by helping them 
with more after-school and summer programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It would renew the act, which provides, on average, about 7  
percent of states' education spending. Poorer schools, however, 
tend to get a larger share. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton proposal, first made in his State of the Union  
address in January, has critics. Some educators said Wednesday the 
timelines are too long and the standards are too low. Republicans 
say the plan runs counter to their efforts to ensure states and 
school districts have control of their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would impose Washington solutions to local problems,''  
said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and 
Workforce Committee, which is crafting its version of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gary Bauer, presidential candidate and former Reagan  
administration education official, said, ``Republicans might be 
nervous about taking on the administration, knowing the inevitable 
charge would be Republicans are anti-education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to the plan Wednesday focused on teacher-quality  
provisions that would make participating school districts do away 
with the practice of ``emergency certification,'' through which 
teachers teach subjects such as math or English in which they have 
not been certified by the state. It would also end the practice of 
allowing teachers' aides to supervise classrooms on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Smith, a Riley deputy, doesn't foresee wholesale  
opposition to the plan and noted that the teachers' unions support 
the teacher-quality proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have given the districts room and time to make this  
happen by phasing it in,'' said Sandra Feldman of the American 
Federation of Teachers, adding that the aides should not be 
eliminated. ``Working under the supervision of a classroom teacher 
and properly trained, they can be very helpful. But they are not 
teachers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher plan doesn't reach far enough, said Kati Haycock, of  
the Education Trust, a Washington-based nonprofit group promoting 
academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents want -- and children need -- highly qualified teachers  
now,'' Haycock said. ``We can't afford ... teachers who are on a 
three-year road to certification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States would be able to apply their various teacher  
certifications under the Clinton proposal, said Mary Jean LeTendre, 
who oversees the Education Department's administration of funds for 
poor students. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996-97 school year, almost as many teachers' aides  
(52,714) as teachers (61,252) were funded by the federal 
government. Education Department surveys found that 41 percent of 
aides at participating schools spent at least half of their time in 
the classroom without a teacher present. 
</P>
<P>
	Also a third of the nation's teachers said they either lacked  
degrees in the subjects they teach or did not spend enough time 
training in them. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, teacher shortages abound, with 2 million new  
teachers needed in the next 10 years. Urban districts have some of 
the greatest need, often two and half times the vacancies of other 
districts. About three-fourths of those districts have to rely on 
noncertified teachers to teach under emergency licenses, long-term 
substitute teachers, teachers with provisional licenses and 
internships or apprenticeships. But nearly half offer programs to 
prepare aides for licensed teaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to need substantially more help than there is in  
the bill,'' said Mike Casserly of the Council of Great City 
Schools, adding that most new teachers choose suburban posts with 
better pay and working conditions over urban ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding us accountable without providing us the assistance to  
achieve these goals puts everybody in a very difficult bind. It 
begs the question of who else is going to be accountable here.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Death Row Inmate To Go to Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent eight years on death row before  
DNA evidence cleared him has become the 12th condemned person in 
Illinois to be exonerated in the last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ronald Jones didn't have much time to celebrate. He was  
in court Wednesday and said he won't fight extradition to 
Tennessee, where he escaped from a prison work detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 49, escaped while serving a five-year robbery sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting for authorities from Tennessee to come and  
pick him up; he's basically their prisoner,'' said Bill Cunningham, 
a spokesman for the Cook County sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of the March 1985 rape and killing of Debra  
Jones. She was found fatally stabbed outside a Chicago hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he confessed, Jones said he did so after being beaten  
by police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction in July  
1997 after DNA tests of semen showed that Jones was not the 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cook County state's attorney's office on Monday announced it  
would not retry Jones on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Hobbins, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of  
Corrections, said Jones was convicted of a 1979 robbery in 
Chattanooga and was serving five years in Cold Creek Correctional 
Facility when he slipped away from a community work crew in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Pirates 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Jordan hit a sixth-inning grand slam off a  
tiring Francisco Cordova to give the Atlanta Braves a 7-3 win over 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine (3-4) allowed three runs and five hits in seven  
innings for the Braves, who won their fourth in a row and swept the 
three-game series. The Pirates have lost six straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova (0-2), making his first start since going on the  
disabled list April 10 with inflammation of his right shoulder, 
limited the Braves to one hit -- a solo homer by Andruw Jones in the 
second -- through five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova got the first out in the sixth, but then Ozzie Guillen  
doubled and moved to third on a single by Bret Boone. After Chipper 
Jones walked, Jordan hit Cordova's first pitch over the fence in 
left-center for his 10th homer to make it 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Atlanta's first grand slam of the season and the third of  
Jordan's career, his last one coming on July 13, 1996 when he was 
with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up a single to Javy Lopez, Cordova was lifted. He  
allowed five runs, five hits and three walks in 5 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones added a two-run single for the Braves in the  
seventh off reliever Jeff Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh loaded the bases in the ninth off John Rocker, but  
Turner Ward struck out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates scored three runs in the fifth to take a 3-1 lead.  
Abraham Nunez, who broke out of a 1-for-17 slump with a pair of 
hits, and Cordova, a .108 career hitter, each had RBI singles. The 
other run scored on a RBI grounder by Freddy Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Atlanta's Otis Nixon, hitting only .181, did not start for  
the fourth consecutive game, replaced by Gerald Williams. He drew a 
walk as a pinch-hitter in the seventh, stole second and third, and 
scored on Chipper Jones' single. ... Glavine avoided his first 
career 0-4 start on April 28 against the Pirates when the Braves 
scored three runs in the ninth inning for a 5-4 victory. ... 
Atlanta is 19-0 when scoring five or more runs. ... Boone has hit 
in 20 of his last 21 games and reached base safely in 21 straight. 
... Pittsburgh OF Adrian Brown was sent down to Triple-A Nashville 
to make room on the roster for Cordova.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Wants $100M To Fix Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force is asking Congress for $100  
million to fix problems with the engines in F-16 jets, after engine 
failure was blamed for seven crashes since November, spokesmen said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the recent F-16 crashes blamed on engine problems  
occurred Nov. 19 when an F-16 lost thrust during takeoff at Shaw 
Air Force Base in South Carolina. The latest related accident was 
on March 26 at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the crashes was fatal, the Air Force said, and were  
traced to a variety of engine problems. Engine repairs would 
address the most serious problems identified in those crashes, said 
Bobby Stone, an aerospace engineer at the Air Force's Propulsion 
Product Group at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force plans to repair all but about 300 of the newest  
engines in the inventory of about 1,800 engines, Stone said. Work 
would include strengthening or replacing fan blades and replacing 
two other parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Engine manufacturers General Electric and Pratt &AMP; Whitney are  
not being blamed for the problems and are cooperating with the 
repair plans, the Air Force said. 
</P>
<P>
	Repairs would take two to three years if Congress provides the  
additional money in the 2000 budget, but would take up to eight 
years if funded out of the regular maintenance and repair budget, 
the Air Force said. 
</P>
<P>
	The service has about 1,400 of the single-engine F-16s, plus  
about 400 spare engines.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Lottery at Vets' Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- Having risked their lives for their  
country, veterans living at the Holyoke Soldiers Home doubt it 
would be a big problem to risk a few dollars on scratch-off lottery 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is a gamble,'' said Geno Majewski, 71, a World War II  
combat veteran, chuckling at the debate in the state Legislature 
whether to allow the sale of lottery tickets in the state-run home. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling tickets at the home would be a convenience for its 284  
residents, Majewski said as he watched television in the spacious 
canteen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the fellows like to buy scratch tickets,'' he said May  
11. ``It gives them a little thrill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the big television set hung an even larger bingo board  
ready for the 50-cent-a-card games run nearly daily by local 
service and veterans organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill, including the Massachusetts Council on  
Compulsive Gambling, worry the aged veterans on fixed incomes are 
all too vulnerable to the lure of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't sound like a good idea to me,'' said Gov. Paul  
Cellucci. ``I'll listen to the proposal, but I don't think you want 
to have lots of tickets sold in a home or residence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature got involved because it is against state law for  
state employees to sell lottery tickets, and the home's canteen 
staff are on the state payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate approved the bill, which would allow state  
employees at the home to sell the tickets, and sent it to the House 
where gambling foes have said they will try to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like cigarettes, either'' chorused a group of  
veterans smoking on a sunny outside patio. The only place inside 
the home where smoking is allowed is a glassed-in area in one 
corner of the canteen. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, one reason the home's management wants to sell lottery  
tickets is the sharp drop in revenue the canteen suffered after it 
stopped selling cigarettes, according to Paul Morin, the home's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly they are still getting cigarettes,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, in the same way the Soldiers' Home canteen  
doesn't sell ice cream to diabetics, scratch tickets wouldn't be 
sold to compulsive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents are opposed to the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who wants to play the lottery can go downtown and get  
a ticket or have a friend pick a number,'' said Edgar Hebert, as he 
waited for the bus outside the home. ``I don't think they should 
sell them in the canteen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Senate Minority Leader Brian Lees, a sponsor of the bill,  
said it would only be fair, because veterans at the state's other 
Soldiers Home in Chelsea are able to buy lottery tickets from a 
canteen operated by blind people who are not state employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Some state-run veterans homes in other states, including New  
York and New Jersey, also sell state lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes the veterans feel like they are living on the  
outside,'' said Brian Gordon, community relations director for the 
Long Island Veterans Home run by New York state. ``They can wheel 
into our canteen just as if they were wheeling into a candy store 
in Brooklyn and buy a candy bar or a scratch ticket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some people who play a little bit more regularly,''  
Gordon said, but those who receive Medicaid for their care get less 
than $50 a month in discretionary money. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much of an addict can you be on $50 a month?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien, who supervises the  
Massachusetts lottery, agreed. Recalling visiting her late 
great-uncle in the Holyoke Soldiers Home, O'Brien said it is a 
question of individual choice and convenience for the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether they want to spend their discretionary money on a  
small ice cream cone or a pack of cigarettes, they deserve, as 
adults, to make these decisions for themselves,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Woman Dies at Own Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A woman paralyzed from the neck down by a  
bullet was taken off life support at her request and died 
Wednesday, clearing the way for prosecutors to bring murder charges 
against the person who shot her -- her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgette Smith, 42, had won a judge's ruling a day earlier  
forcing doctors at Lucerne Medical Center to disconnect her 
ventilator. She argued that she couldn't bear to live in such a 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Ms. Smith made the decision to die, prosecutors  
planned to charge her mother with murder, creating a highly unusual 
-- and perhaps unprecedented -- case that will be watched closely by 
legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's mother, Shirley Egan, 68, is already charged with  
attempted murder. Ms. Egan, a frail, 85-pound woman who is blind in 
one eye, allegedly shot Ms. Smith in March after overhearing Ms. 
Smith and her boyfriend talking about putting Ms. Egan in a nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet struck Ms. Smith in the neck, tearing through her  
spinal cord. The former Sears merchandise stocker was left unable 
to speak without effort, incapable of swallowing and unable to 
control her bladder. She was fed through a tube and ran a high risk 
of pneumonia, infections, ulcers and bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is wink my eyes and wiggle my nose, wiggle my  
tongue. I can't move any other part of my body,'' she said in court 
papers. ``I can't live like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Judge Richard Conrad, who had met with Ms. Smith and  
studied her medical history, ruled that she was mentally competent 
to make the decision to die. 
</P>
<P>
	He said she could have life support removed at 5 p.m. Wednesday.  
Ms. Smith was sedated before the ventilator was disconnected and 
was pronounced dead at 5:46 p.m. A hospital spokeswoman refused to 
say what time she was taken off life support. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day she won in court, Ms. Smith gave prosecutors a  
videotaped deposition from her hospital bed, and it will be among 
the pieces of evidence against Ms. Egan, who was in jail on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's attorney has said she did not mean to shoot her  
daughter and didn't want to see her suffer. But he argued against 
removing Ms. Smith from the ventilator because prosecutors had said 
they would seek a murder indictment against Ms. Egan. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have upgraded charges to murder when comatose  
victims have died after family members decided to take them off 
life support. But Robert Moffat, a law professor at the University 
of Florida, said this case is unique because Ms. Smith made the 
choice herself. 
</P>
<P>
	That could make murder charges harder to prove, because a strong  
case could be made that the cause of Ms. Smith's death was the 
removal of life support, not being shot, said Andrew Kayton, legal 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an important legal issue -- whether the mother's  
shooting was the legal cause of death,'' Kayton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's daughters, Candace Smith, 22, and Joeleen Hill, 19,  
supported their mother's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's prepared herself,'' Candace Smith said in court last  
week, ``because she knows she's lived a good life and she doesn't 
want to finish her life in this way.''

	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	May 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, La., on background checks for  
gun buyers: 
</P>
<P>
	One day a majority of U.S. senators are persuaded to forgo  
mandatory background checks on gun sales by private sellers at gun 
shows. The next, they discover it's a good idea after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen Larry Craig, R-Idaho, ... described the change as a  
``clarification'' that would build on ``the accomplishments we had 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a creative interpretation.  
</P>
<P>
	He originally wanted to encourage voluntary background checks on  
buyers by granting private sellers limited protection from 
liability in future lawsuits. He got enough Republican support to 
get his plan passed and turn back a rival Democratic proposal to 
require the background checks on private sellers. Dealer sales at 
gun shows already require such checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Littleton, Colo., school shootings that might  
not be a popular move, even in conservative districts. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The battle over getting a better handle on gun sales was won  
when the Brady Act was passed. If it is permissible to impose the 
Brady Act strictures on sales by licensed dealers in stores or at 
gun shows, it is permissible to do the same for private sales. The 
point is the sale. 

</P>
<P>
	May 18  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times, on crime:  
</P>
<P>
	Serious crime has declined for the seventh straight year  
nationally, and the news locally is even better. 
</P>
<P>
	Simi Valley, home to many police families, is (No. 1 among) the  
nation's safest cities. Murders in Los Angeles fell to a 28-year 
low last year, and serious crime here was down by more than 10 
percent, according to the yearly FBI crime reports. So why are so 
many Americans, here and elsewhere, convinced that crime is on the 
rise? In two words: media inundation. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, between 7 p.m. and midnight, Angelenos could view 59  
network or cable television shows in which serious crime, sometimes 
including murder, is an element. These shows include real-crime 
re-creations, prime-time newsmagazines, police dramas and murder 
mysteries. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Once a year, everyone is told that crime is way, way down and is  
told why. The other 364 nights Americans go to bed dreaming of 
crooks at the door in much the manner that children fear the 
bogyman under the bed. Reality is far better than that, and 
Americans can stand to hear, see and read a lot more about the 
improvement. What's sensational is the fact that crime is down. 

</P>
<P>
	May 11  
</P>
<P>
	Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune, on conflict between U.S. and  
China: 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomacy and leadership have the greatest value when they're  
most difficult to provide. Both are needed to avoid conflict 
between the United States and China, so this is no time for 
diplomatic retrenchment or demagoguery. 
</P>
<P>
	China is entitled to be outraged by the bombing of its embassy  
in Belgrade. The Chinese and Americans deserve complete answers and 
accountability following this inexcusable failure. ... (B)ut 
China's reaction threatens to trigger another Cold War and could 
prevent an acceptable settlement to the war in Yugoslavia's Kosovo 
province. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The government's role in the civilian protests over the weekend  
is a troubling sign of China's attempts to use the embassy bombing 
for political gain, and the suspension of high-level military talks 
with the United States closes communications when they should be 
open. Communication is essential to preventing deadly mistakes when 
tensions are elevated. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse are the signals that China might use its position on the  
U.N. Security Council to delay a peace agreement affecting 
Yugoslavia. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. has an obligation to make amends for its deadly error  
but, if China truly wants to join the developed world ... this is 
no time for Cold War-style antagonism. 

</P>
<P>
	May 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on flag burning:  
</P>
<P>
	If you made a list of burning issues before the current  
Congress, flag burning would not be among them. A proposed 
constitutional amendment to allow federal laws to prohibit 
desecration of the American flag is a truly big deal to only a 
small group of people. To the majority, including many members of 
Congress who support the proposed amendment, it is a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
	We hope the campaign fails again. Not because we support flag  
burning. When done for political reasons, desecration of the flag 
is calculated to offend. And it does offend the vast majority of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But what a great thing to live in a country where burning the  
flag is legally interpreted as a form of political speech, behavior 
for which you cannot be thrown in jail. The basic idea of freedom 
of speech remains radical by historical standards and is constantly 
under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	As a practical matter, if the Citizens' Flag Alliance (largely a  
creature of the American Legion) and its supporters really want to 
minimize the amount of political flag desecration that occurs in

	The Dallas Morning News, on antitrust suit against American  
Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
	After years of watching airline competition dwindle on many  
routes, the Justice Department has sued American Airlines for 
allegedly violating antitrust laws to ground its competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the lawsuit is whether American illegally engaged  
in a scorched-earth policy to effectively ground competition on 
certain routes. The government contends American flooded route and 
lowered fares to below cost to drive three smaller competitors off 
those routes. 
</P>
<P>
	American denies all of the charges, and counters that the  
government is unfairly telling the airline that it can't lower 
prices to compete with low-cost rivals. American also contends it 
matched competitors' fares, but did not price below competition or 
below cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The three airlines have had different fates. Western Pacific  
declared bankruptcy. Vanguard Airlines retrenched, while SunJet no 
longer flies from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless a pretrial settlement is reached, a federal court  
eventually will wade through volumes of evidence from accounting 
records, internal memos and strategic business plans. The lengthy 
process will inject the court into complicated business issues that 
courts often don't handle very well. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As watchdogs, regulators have a responsibility to consumers to  
pursue illegally anti-competitive business behavior. But the 
litigation standard for pursuing a case shouldn't simply be that 
consumers pay more than they like to pay to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The central issue must be whether American's tactics blatantly  
crossed the antitrust line, not whether American is an aggressive 
competitor with more resources than a start-up airline.

	Saint Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press, on suit against American  
Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
	When large hub airlines compete with low-cost challengers, two  
different models of air service, not just two companies, are 
dueling. In launching a long-threatened legal offensive against big 
airlines' alleged anti-competitive pricing, federal officials risk 
doing more harm than good to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between healthy price competition and ``predatory  
pricing'' is tricky to define. It may prove impossible to outlaw 
one without eliminating the other. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust  
lawsuit against American Airlines, charging that American slashed 
fares solely to drive smaller low-cost airlines from its Dallas 
hub. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The government says major airlines are acting unfairly whenever  
they respond to new competition by offering so many low-price 
tickets that they lose more profit than they would if they simply 
allowed a new competitor to have a piece of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is that the big carriers endure such losses only to  
cause their competitor to fail, after which they increase prices 
anew. But this amounts to saying that in fair competition, no 
low-cost carrier should ever fail. ... 
</P>
<P>
	How will that serve the consumer's interest in lower overall air  
fares? When large hub airlines compete with low-cost challengers, 
two different models of air service, not just two companies, are 
dueling. ...

<P>
	Look no further than the bulging sales figures of the now wildly  
popular sports utility vehicles for a reason federal regulators 
must raise the emission standards on them and other light trucks. 
...
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has proposed a new set of regulations  
that would require automakers to bring the emission standards of 
sports utility vehicles more in line with cars. The rules, to be 
enacted in the 2004 model year, would cut their allowed exhaust 
pollution by 93 percent. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency, backed by the auto industry  
and environmentalists, also has unveiled regulations requiring oil 
companies to produce cleaner burning fuels. 
</P>

	In tandem, these new steps will give American drivers the  
cleaner-burning, more environmentally efficient vehicles both 
drivers and our environment deserve.

	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on the Jenny Jones verdict:  
</P>
<P>
	Here's a way to dramatically improve television: Get rid of the  
``Jenny Jones Show.'' It is tasteless, insensitive and seems 
designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator of its 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	However, that should be a decision left to the court of public  
opinion, not the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent $25 million verdict against the show stands as an  
example of how people in this country -- sometimes jurors, sometimes 
elected officials -- often want to overlook constitutional 
protections of whatever they regard as obnoxious. ... 
</P>
<P>
	What we see happening is that juries want to find ways of  
punishing people they don't like. However, the consequence of 
tearing down such safeguards as the First Amendment -- among the 
most important hallmarks of American civilization -- is that 
everyone's freedom is endangered. It's not just the popular that 
have rights, and it's not just the unpopular that will suffer if 
the rights of all are not protected.

	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Israeli election:  
</P>
<P>
	Last night, Benjamin Netanyahu, who scraped home as Israel's  
prime minister in 1996, ran out of luck. The Likud leader had 
claimed that the withdrawal of three candidates during the weekend 
ensured that their votes were ``coming home'', but -- as was always 
more likely -- it heralded instead a huge increase in support for 
his opponent, Ehud Barak, the retired general who has promised to 
return peace talks with the Arab world to the top of the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	During the stagnation of negotiations, Mr Barak's acceptance of  
the principle of a Palestinian state, and of the exchange of land, 
has become steadily more popular with many secular voters. Nor did 
Mr Netanyahu's attempts to concentrate voters' attention on 
security issues -- as when he claimed that Mr Barak intended to hand 
east Jerusalem over to the Palestinians lock, stock and barrel -- 
carry much weight. ...

</P>
<P>
	There is just a year left to achieve peace in the Middle East.  
Negligence on the part of Prime Minister Nenanyahu to talk with the 
Palestinians is taking its toll. The Barak administration will need 
to start by trying to regain the trust of the Palestinians and the 
world. But Barak's own stand on peace with the Palestinians raises 
some concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In campaigning references to the Jewish settlements in Israel's  
occupied territories, Barak said he would not build new 
settlements, but instead would put most of the established 
settlements under Israeli control. He also did not yield on the 
status of Jerusalem. He said both East and West Jerusalem are the 
eternally indivisible capital of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	His stand on such issues is similar to that taken by Netanyahu.  
This will not make it easy to resolve differences with the 
Palestinians. We hope the new government will try to consider the 
Palestinian position and find common ground that both the Israelis 
and Palestinianss can find satisfactory. ...

<P>
	Theoretically on the left, Barak's policies toward Palestinians  
are just as tough as Netanyahu's. He has always contested the Oslo 
accord signed by the heads of his Labor Party. He also opposes the 
division of Jerusalem and will only consent to giving Arafat the 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the Israelis have shown that they have more  
confidence in Barak than in Netanyahu to carry out Netanyahu's own 
policies.''

</P>
<P>
	Il Giornale, Milan, Italy, on Israeli election:  
</P>
<P>
	Ehud Barak has triumphed, marking a shift in Israel's political  
orientation: Benjamin Netanyahu's crushing defeat and his 
subsequent resignation from the leadership of his Likud party have 
already caused a crisis in the right wing, which has dropped to its 
lowest level since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the unquestionable winner is (Palestinian leader)  
Yasser Arafat, whose political and international prestige has been 
boosted by these elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Militarily and economically weak, at the head of a corrupt  
administration, Arafat turned all of Netanyau's bitter pills into 
diplomatic advantages. His collaboration with Israel's secret 
service prevented terrorist attacks. His endorsement of the Wye 
Plantation agreement gained him President Clinton's sympathy and 
$600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat avoided all of Netanyau's traps and discreetly shifted  
the Arab votes towards Barak. 
</P>
<P>

personal affirmation overwhelmed some positive results of his 
premiership.

</P>
<P>
	In the debate over impeaching President Yeltsin, the Russian  
parliament was again asking the question `Who is to blame?' This 
time it was over the responsibility for the emotions and mistakes 
of the previous 10 years: the breakup of the Soviet Union, the war 
against Chechnya, the failed economic reforms. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Seen in the context of Russian history, this event is somewhat  
revolutionary. It was a signal that a future president will no 
longer simply be able to do what he wants. His actions must be 
transparent and controllable. 
</P>

and one that may prove a winner. But the blood pressure of Middle 
England is set to rise.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Might Limit U.S. Lab Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is ready to  
support limits on foreign scientific exchanges at U.S. weapons 
laboratories, but he warned Tuesday that a sweeping moratorium 
would hurt America's interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, touring an exhibit of anti-terrorist gadgets  
developed by scientists at the labs, said the kinds of restrictions 
being discussed by some in Congress would scuttle U.S. attempts to 
help Russia safeguard its nuclear material. 
</P>
<P>
	``If adopted it would literally mean the closure of our Russia  
lab-to-lab program,'' said Richardson. He was speaking of a House 
proposal to impose a broad, unrestricted moratorium on foreign 
visits to the three weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russia program has been a top Clinton administration  
priority because its aim is to help Russia keep its nuclear 
material and top scientists from going into the service of 
dangerous governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, more than 1,200 Russian and Chinese visitors were  
logged in at the New Mexico's Los Alamos and California's Lawrence 
Livermore weapons labs, Energy Department records show. The General 
Accounting Office, Congress' auditing agency, recently said visits 
to all the labs by scientists from ``sensitive'' countries soared 
from 500 to more than 1,800 in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange program has become a focus of attention in Congress  
as lawmakers attempt to grapple with reports of years of lax 
security at the weapons labs and of theft by China of nuclear 
warhead secrets. A voluminous congressional report on Chinese 
technology thefts is expected to be released within days. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said a Senate measure on the foreign visitor program,  
which cleared the Armed Services Committee this week, is one ``that 
we can live with'' and reflects ``bipartisan support to fix the 
problem cooperatively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That legislation would halt lab-to-lab foreign visitors unless  
the heads of the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI and the 
energy secretary certify adequate counterintelligence safeguards. 
Administration officials said under those conditions essential 
programs would not be affected under the new security measures 
being put in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The House proposal, offered by Rep. Jim Ryun, R-Kan., bans  
visits from ``sensitive'' countries unless a waiver is given by 
concerned congressional committees. Ryun called it ``a mechanism to 
ensure our vital national security secrets are protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such restrictions, Richardson said, would close down the Russia  
program and is an overreaction. ``It's draconian. It hurts our 
national security,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the anti-terrorist equipment Richardson viewed was  
developed at the weapons labs in conjunction with private industry 
and in some cases as part of the Russia lab-to-lab exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	One exhibit featured physical security measures aimed at  
preventing break-ins at nuclear facilities. Richardson was given a 
key to what was supposed to be a nuclear vault. He succeeded in 31 
seconds to break in, but was caught by the alarm and a hidden 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
	That project, as well as another from the Lawrence Livermore lab  
on detecting nuclear material in transit, were developed as part of 
the Russia exchange program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winifred Parker, a nuclear chemist at Lawrence Livermore, said  
she visited Russia twice and worked with Russians who have visited 
the U.S. lab in California to work on the nuclear material 
detection technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't visit the Russians and they can't come to us, work  
is almost impossible,'' she said. ``We really need to be able to 
talk, to have scientists talking to other scientists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At yet another booth, Morton Lieberman of Sandia National  
Laboratories in New Mexico, showed off a high-tech artificial foot. 
He said the foot was the product of a cooperative effort between 
Tufts University and a weapons lab in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Counselor Sets Up Talk Show Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Thousands of people appear on national talk shows,  
sharing their problems and perversities with millions of television 
viewers. When their 15 minutes of fame is over and the audience 
goes home, what happens to those who have aired their dirty laundry 
in public? 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Huysman, a clinical social worker and addiction counselor,  
has built a business helping talk show guests whose psychological 
problems may be magnified by the sometimes negative experiences 
they encounter on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman developed his AfterCare Program in 1991 after appearing  
as a guest expert on ``The Geraldo Rivera Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw that talk television was an incredible way to reach  
mainstream America,'' Huysman said. ``It could be a powerful 
process if you get healing attached or it could be terribly 
exploitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman approached the show about setting up opportunities for  
guests to receive outside counseling, and Rivera agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If talk shows decide to take on the job or the editorial  
approach of broadcasting people in crisis then I think television 
has an absolute obligation to do something about the crisis they're 
talking about,'' Rivera has said in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman created a nationwide network of hospitals, outpatient  
programs, therapists, lawyers, consumer credit agencies and other 
resources that would offer their services for free if they received 
some sort of publicity on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found that a 30 second spot on a national show was about the  
cost to treat a client,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman said he didn't like how talk show guests opened  
emotional wounds on television and then were sent home with little 
or no follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that a lot of them do go hoping for help,'' he said.  
``But expectations become the seeds of resentment. Whatever 
problems they had are now exacerbated because now the whole 
community knows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those treated by Huysman was Scott Sweat, who weighed 750  
pounds when he appeared on Rivera's syndicated show twice in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweat had sought help for his obesity from the Rivera show after  
being rejected by numerous clinics because he couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
	After his TV appearances, he worked with Huysman's counseling  
and weight control programs, and is now down to 549 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I would have done without (Jamie). He's kept  
me alive,'' said Sweat, talking by phone from a friend's home in 
Resaca, Ga. ``He saw me through and told me things were going to be 
OK and they were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Rivera's show went off the air a year ago, Huysman helped  
about 200 guests and secured $4 million in donated health care for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year, the AfterCare Program has worked with the  
``Leeza'' show on NBC, which pays about $5,000 a month for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman's team trains the show's producers to prescreen  
potential guests for warning signs that it would be detrimental for 
them to go on the show. In addition, Huysman's case managers follow 
the progress after the show of each guest and family members deemed 
potentially troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	He has helped about 50 ``Leeza'' guests and secured $500,000 in  
donated health care for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all shows use Huysman's services. ``The Jerry Springer  
Show'' doesn't, and neither does ``The Jenny Jones Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman testified against Ms. Jones' show in a recent lawsuit,  
saying that prescreening might have detected the potential 
emotional fallout between two male guests that allegedly led to 
one's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the family of former guest Scott Amedure was  
awarded $25 million by a Michigan jury that found that the show and 
its producer, Warner Bros., negligent in Amedure's 1995 shooting 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	In an episode that was never broadcast, Amedure admitted that he  
was attracted to Jonathan Schmitz, who had agreed to appear to meet 
his secret admirer. Schmitz had said he expected to meet a female 
admirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz's conviction for second-degree murder was reversed on a  
technicality; his retrial is scheduled for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman testified that he met with Ms. Jones a year before the  
shooting to suggest that her show could use the counseling 
available through the AfterCare Program. He never heard back from 
the show's producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls from The Associated Press to ``The Jenny Jones Show'' were  
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Farrell, a licensed psychologist in Engelwood, N.J.,  
who isn't associated with Huysman or Ms. Jones, said she supports 
therapy for some talk show guests, but is less convinced that a 
pre-show evaluation can help weed out potentially dangerous guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``A screening is no guarantee that you will pick something up,''  
she said. ``I think the problem is that many people don't realize 
that they have undiscovered buttons that if pushed can cause them 
to do things they never dreamed they would. No psychologist is 
going to be able to pick these up in an interview or in a 
screening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his work with AfterCare, Huysman has built  
another business, Partners in Health &AMP; Entertainment Management in 
Fort Lauderdale, which coordinates the services that come in to 
AfterCare. He also runs At the End of the Day Productions, Inc., 
which owns the license for AfterCare as well as a radio show, 
``Family Affairs,'' that Huysman has with his mother, a clinical 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Family Affairs'' has mother and son talking about issues often  
seen on daytime talk shows. They just finished a TV pilot for a 
talk show by the same name.

<HEADLINE> Sgt.: Volpe Boasted About Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer accused of torturing a Haitian  
immigrant in a station house bathroom boasted about it that morning 
and then showed the stick he used, a sergeant testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Kenneth Wernick, in an account never made public before,  
said that Officer Justin Volpe pulled him aside and told him what 
he did to Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima claims Volpe sodomized him with a broom handle in a case  
that shocked the city due to the brutal nature of the charges and 
has raised tensions between minorities and the police department. 
Five officers are accused in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wernick testified that Volpe told him he had been punched  
earlier that morning in a street disturbance which led to Louima's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe then said he ``took a stick and put it five or six inches  
up (Louima's rectum), took it out and put it up to his mouth and 
teeth area, kind of like showing it to him. ... He told him that if 
he told anyone, he'd kill him and his whole family,'' Wernick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe asked Wernick if he wanted to see the stick, then took him  
into the bathroom and pulled out a 2- to 3-foot, gray-colored stick 
from a sink area, Wernick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you believe him?'' asked prosecutor Alan Vinegrad.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, because I didn't think anybody would do that, and if they  
did, they wouldn't talk about it,'' said Wernick, a burly officer 
who wore his patrol uniform to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, officer Charles Schwarz and two other officers, Thomas  
Bruder and Thomas Wiese, are also charged with violating Louima's 
civil rights by beating him in a patrol car en route to the 
station. A fifth defendant is charged with covering up the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier testimony, another man, Patrick Antoine, claimed  
Volpe punched him for no reason in the street around the nightclub. 
He testified that he too was taken into the bathroom by the officer 
-- but that Volpe apologized after he noticed Antoine was wearing a 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe asked if he believed in Jesus, Antoine said. ``I said,  
`Yes'. ... He told me he believed in Jesus, too. ... After that he 
told me that if someone hits him, he hits the person back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Louima and Antoine have filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits  
against the city.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Bets on Internet for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Banks expect someday the walls will come tumbling  
down as they move to become virtual institutions offering an array 
of services over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at Bank One Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank,  
took the bold step Tuesday of announcing that they're placing their 
bets on the Web as the surest future source of profits, giving up 
the industrywide practice of mergers and consolidation for growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow your customer,'' Bank One chief executive  
John McCoy said. ``I've always loved this business for the last 20 
years, but we aren't going to be like that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related announcement, First Union Corp., the sixth-largest  
bank, announced it is realigning its senior executive team and 
appointing an 18-year bank veteran to take charge of its electronic 
commerce businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	David Carroll, now president of First Union of Florida, will  
become executive vice president in charge of Internet and 
``alternative delivery channels'' -- businesses that the bank called 
a key corporate priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll has been credited with leading First Union's ``Future  
Bank'' strategy that offers banking by telephone, computer and 
automatic tellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to fully leverage the various skills we have  
throughout First Union to build an Internet strategy and capability 
second to none in the financial services arena,'' said John 
Georgius, First Union president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking executives across the nation are tentatively exploring  
their options for virtual banking. The explosion of Internet use 
and the rise of such Wall Street darlings as the retailer 
Amazon.com and Charles Schwab Corp.'s online brokerage has many 
re-examining whether the concept of acquiring more branches, 
automated teller machines and banking satellites is the way to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	One Internet bank, Netbank Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga., has become a  
major player in just a year. With just 42 employees, the company 
had profits last year of $4.5 million on sales of $18.8 million. 
Because of its low overhead, it has signed up thousands of 
customers by offering higher interest rates on CDs and other 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Bank One was created last year through the  
combination of First Chicago NBD Corp. and Banc One Corp. It has 
about 2,000 branches in 14 states, mostly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	It recently launched http://www.bankone.com, a site offering customers  
the chance to open and review accounts, receive and pay bills 
online, apply for credit cards and loans, invest online, buy 
insurance and get news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The features make it one of the most comprehensive banking sites  
in the nation, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers them the opportunity to provide their services  
anywhere (in the world),'' Salomon Smith Barney analyst Henry 
Dickson said. ``Right now, that might not be the most profitable 
way of doing things, but it's something they have to offer because 
it's another way to reach customers who want convenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One is betting it can vault into national consciousness by  
signing long-term agreements with Internet portal companies such as 
Yahoo! and Excite Inc. Portals are the entry points for users to 
venture onto the Internet. The agreements guarantee that Web 
surfers looking for Internet banking on those sites will be 
directed to Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One also expects to sign up additional credit card  
customers online. It will generate additional revenue from customer 
fees for online banking. And it will collect fees from companies 
that will sell insurance and other products on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bank One merger was completed late last year, McCoy  
said it would be at least 18 months before he considered acquiring 
another bank. Even after that period is up, an acquisition may not 
be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what is happening on the Internet, I'm not sure that we  
will ever have to buy another bank,'' he said. ``There may come a 
time where we don't need to provide the brick and mortar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under First Union's ``Future Bank'' program, for example,  
customers use a telephone or computer to get information about 
account balances, advise whether checks have cleared, or transfer 
money between accounts. Customers also can apply for loans by phone 
or get help with investments. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union has about 2,400 branches in 12 states, mostly on the  
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it's too early to tell just how much banks can  
profit from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot will depend on how efficiently they offer products and  
whether increased competition will cause fees to fall and thereby 
lower profits, they say. Most predicted, however, that banks will 
need to maintain some branches for those customers who want to do 
their business face-to-face.

<HEADLINE> Pens' Future in Steel Town Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins went home until next  
season Wednesday with the prospect of the NHL moving or breaking up 
the franchise looming over them. 
</P>
<P>
	That wouldn't make the players happy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I hope the team stays in Pittsburgh,'' said Jaromir  
Jagr, the league's leading scorer last season. ``We have a lot of 
good players here. ... I had a lot of fun this season, and I think 
we can do better next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz said Wednesday he is  
inclined to present the NHL's plan to break up the Penguins to the 
team's 200 creditors for a vote alongside competing plans, possibly 
June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Rob Brown wants anything but.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to get the opportunity to play here, and I hope  
that everything works out this summer,'' he said at the Penguins' 
practice facility in Canonsburg, Pa. ``It's hard to believe there 
is a chance the team might not be here, but I think it should all 
work out in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Mario Lemieux is the best alternative.  
</P>
<P>
	The retired Penguins superstar and a group led by Penguins  
landlord SMG and broadcaster Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh have drafted 
proposals for running the financially troubled team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan is already set for a vote, and the SMG-Fox plan  
will be reviewed and challenged May 28. Fox must surrender its 
stake in the New York Rangers to own part of the Penguins, NHL 
attorney Jeffrey Levitan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL wants to dissolve the team and sell the franchise,  
reportedly for $85 million to Seattle billionaire Paul Allen for a 
move to the Rose Garden in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitan said the league also could allow other teams to  
cherry-pick Penguins players in a draft or buy the contracts and 
divide them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors on Wednesday faulted the NHL for vagueness about  
details such as what they would be paid if the Penguins are sold or 
players moved out. One creditors' attorney chided the NHL strategy 
as ``an option on an option on an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a scorecard here,'' said the attorney, Joseph  
McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
	The league eased off its May 31 deadline and now wants ownership  
resolved by June 27. Its plan guarantees the NHL the entire $1.7 
million it is owed, while most creditors will be paid only a 
percentage of the Penguins' total debt of $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitan said the NHL cannot accurately predict what the players'  
contracts will fetch. Any draft and its terms still would have to 
be approved by the NHL Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Lemieux and the SMG-Fox group will meet with Bill  
Newlin, a lawyer and negotiator appointed by Pittsburgh Mayor Tom 
Murphy, in an attempt to merge their plans. Newlin helped broker a 
deal that kept the baseball Pirates in Pittsburgh with general 
partner Kevin McClatchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the NHL needs to be a partner with us in trying to  
save this franchise here and not put up roadblocks to make that 
happen,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said the team might get a new arena supported partially  
by taxes once the team is financially healthy. The Penguins are 
committed to the Civic Arena, the league's oldest venue, which is 
managed by SMG, through 2007. SMG and Fox need to embrace Lemieux's 
group to save the team, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strength will be if we can combine them in a way that  
works for everybody,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mixed messages come forth daily in the case. The NHL has  
maintained public support of a Pittsburgh team run by Lemieux while 
moving ahead in court with the plan to padlock the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pittsburgh, the Penguins matter pits civic pride against the  
private stakes of the team's creditors, many of whom operate in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Lennox, attorney for creditor National City Bank, made a  
spirited plea for the team during objections to the NHL's plan. 
Markovitz interrupted to ask whether the bank would take a smaller 
percentage of what it is owed if the team would stay in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I really wouldn't characterize it that way,'' Lennox said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then let's get back to the real issues,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	The NHL is preparing three schedules for 1999-2000: one with the  
Penguins, one with the Penguins somewhere else and one without the 
team.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Education Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called on Congress today to  
impose strict new requirements on school spending, saying ``We do 
not have the luxury of waiting and continuing to subsidize 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's legislation -- already under fire from Republicans --  
would require schools that receive federal money to phase out the 
use of teachers who are not certified for the subjects they are 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's education proposal also would require  
school districts to reduce class size, set rigorous academic 
standards, bolster teacher training programs, broaden after-school 
and summer programs and work to make schools drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do a far, far better job of spending the $15  
billion in federal aid we send to our schools every year,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley said, ``We're not satisfied  
with the status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said schools that accept federal aid ``must take  
responsibility for turning around failing schools or shutting them 
down.'' He said his measure would provide children with safe 
learning environments. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time,'' Clinton said, ``it will require schools  
to adopt comprehensive school safety plans, use proven anti-drug 
and anti-violence programs, intervene with troubled youth, 
establish security procedures for schools and give parents an 
annual report of drug and violent incidents at their children's 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton already outlined most of the new plan last January in  
his State of the Union speech. It would renew the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act, which provides, on average, about 7 
percent of states' education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on  
Education and the Workforce, said he agreed with the goals of the 
administration's plan but not with its methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's proposals trample on our nation's long  
and proven traditions of local control of education,'' Goodling 
said in a statement. ``They would impose Washington solutions to 
local problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's proposal, one new part of the act would make  
participating school districts do away with the practice of 
``emergency certification,'' through which teachers instruct 
subjects such as math or English when they have not been certified 
by the state to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Education Department survey found that a third of the  
nation's teachers said they either lack degrees in the subjects 
they teach or did not spend enough time training in them. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Shust, a lobbyist for the National Education Association,  
said the teachers union's members back the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers should be teaching in the subjects in which they are  
certified,'' Shust said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also wants schools to end the practice of  
letting teachers aides supervise classrooms on their own. An 
Education Department survey suggested that 41 percent of aides at 
participating schools spend at least half of their time in the 
classroom without a teacher present.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Weighs Clem Haskins' Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota President Mark Yudof said it is  
``conceivable'' he might decide the fate of coach Clem Haskins 
before the university completes its investigation into the 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, which was launched March 19, is expected to  
conclude in September or October. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof did not specify what might prompt him to make an early  
decision, but he said he doesn't want recruiting efforts to be 
hindered by the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do have thoughts about where I think things may be headed,  
or at least where the evidence stands today, but I don't see any 
real point about speculating about that today,'' Yudof said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two outside law firms hired by the university are investigating  
charges of academic fraud after allegations by former university 
employee Jan Gangelhoff. She said she did more than 400 pieces of 
course work for 20 players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Archambault, a former player, also has said Haskins paid  
him, which could be a violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday on WCCO Radio in Minneapolis, Haskins  
denied wrongdoing and said he would not resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof acknowledged that basketball recruiting is a factor in the  
decision about Haskins' status. Under NCAA rules, the university 
may begin in-person evaluation of high school players on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rotenberg, university general counsel, said Tuesday the  
university's internal investigation is expected to last no later 
than September, and it could take until next spring for the NCAA's 
infractions committee to decide whether to issue penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said if he makes a decision on Haskins' future, he has  
various options under Haskins' contract, including exoneration, 
exoneration with some discipline, dismissal for cause, dismissal 
without cause, or something in between.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Face Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Never have the words ``road trip'' been more  
ominous to Pittsburgh Penguins fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Burdened by millions in debt and with no ownership in place, the  
Penguins could be history by June 24 -- not for the playoffs, not 
for the season, but forever. 
</P>
<P>
	There is only one man who can make the save, and it isn't  
goaltender Tom Barrasso or Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux. It is U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz, who will decide the team's fate 
within the next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the judge, and the dozens of creditors who are owed  
anywhere from $26 million (Lemieux) to a few thousand dollars (a 
limousine company), can save the 32-year-old franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	If creditors approve Lemieux's reorganization plan, the Penguins  
will remain in Pittsburgh. If not, the court could choose an NHL 
plan that calls for an unidentified buyer -- presumably, billionaire 
Paul Allen -- to buy them for $85 million and relocate them, 
probably to Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	A third plan emerged Tuesday. SMG, the Penguins' landlord at the  
Civic Arena, and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh presented a proposal 
that would make Lemieux a minority owner and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a city-of-Pittsburgh perspective and a fan perspective,  
they should be rooting hard for our plan,'' SMG attorney Saul 
Burian said. ``Our plan, I believe, would produce a franchise that 
is in better financial shape than that which would result from a 
Lemieux plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, SMG and their investors would own most of the team under  
their plan. If Lemieux rejects it, he would be lumped in with other 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said the team needs to be run by someone in Pittsburgh.  
SMG is based in Philadelphia, and Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh is part 
of a national broadcasting company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need an ownership team committed to one team in one market  
-- Pittsburgh,'' said Lemieux, the former Penguins superstar and 
sixth-leading scorer in league history. ``Our ownership group under 
my leadership will be committed exclusively to the Penguins and 
only the Penguins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for bankruptcy in October, borrowed to get  
through the season, then prayed for the best. They nearly got it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an avalanche of distractions, including the bankruptcy,  
co-owner Roger Marino's attempts to shop the team elsewhere, Petr 
Nedved's holdout and Darius Kasparaitis' knee injury, the Penguins 
surprised top-seeded New Jersey in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins then were in position to eliminate Toronto, only to  
lose the final three games. Two were in overtime, both at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The end -- and it might be permanent -- came with Monday's 4-3  
overtime loss on former teammate Garry Valk's overtime goal at 
1:57. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, I'm coming to Pittsburgh for training  
camp in September,'' forward Rob Brown said. ``In my heart, I'll be 
in Pittsburgh next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will the Penguins?  
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny County commissioner Mike Dawida said Pittsburgh would  
survive without the Penguins, ``but they are a sign that we can't 
be called major league anymore if we were to lose such teams. They 
bring people together in a positive way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm cautiously optimistic that we will maintain the team,''  
Dawida said. 
</P>
<P>
	If this was the Penguins' last season in Pittsburgh, at least  
they left behind lots of memories. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL scoring champion Jaromir Jagr further emerged as the  
league's dominant player in the post-Lemieux and, now, post-Wayne 
Gretzky era. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Jagr, the Penguins were mostly without their  
customary cast of stars (Lemieux, Ron Francis, Kevin Stevens, etc.) 
So they improvised, getting a career year from Martin Straka, a 
one-time castoff who made the All-Star game, and a big lift from 
rookie Jan Hrdina, who wasn't expected to make the team, but became 
the No. 1 center. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Kovalev finished with 53 points after being acquired in  
November for Nedved. Robert Lang and former career minor leaguer 
Kip Miller made major contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins had a 10-game winning streak earlier in the season,  
but slipped to the final spot in the conference playoffs by 
finishing 2-8-2. That sent them against top-seeded New Jersey, and 
the Penguins seemed destined for their third straight first-round 
elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr delivered a gutsy effort in Game 6, returning from a  
four-game layoff with a groin injury to score the tying goal late 
in regulation and the winner in overtime. 
</P>

	The Penguins won Game 7 in New Jersey to reach the second round  
for the first time since 1996. They won Game 1 in Toronto and were 
up 2-1 in the series, only to lose Game 4 at home in overtime. They 
didn't win again, losing the final three games of the series.

	``This group, at any point during the season, could have latched  
onto a reason to not do well,'' coach Kevin Constantine said. 
``They refused to ever latch on to a real, legitimate excuse, 
because they wanted to win a Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins wrote a memorable chapter in their intriguing  
history this season. Too bad for them it was Chapter 11.

<HEADLINE> Museum Guide Fired for Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A volunteer guide at the Los Angeles County  
Museum of Art was fired for the way she explained to a group of 
10-year-old girls a sculpture depicting beer and sex in the back 
seat of a Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Riseley said Wednesday she had described the piece  
precisely the same way for five years and never got any complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Riseley gave a tour in March to fifth-graders from Hurley  
Elementary School in Visalia, a farm community 150 miles north of 
Los Angeles. The Edward Kienholz artwork ``Back Seat Dodge '38,'' 
crafted from a real 1938 Dodge and featuring the life-size figures 
of a man and woman in a drunken sexual embrace, was part of the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since this particular piece of art is an expression of an  
artist's first sexual experience, I assumed it was my job to make 
sense of it,'' Ms. Riseley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Riseley explained to the children that the woman in the  
sculpture is faceless and the man is made of chicken wire to 
signify the empty feeling of the moment. Beer bottles surround the 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she asked the children to look at their reflections in the  
car's mirrors to understand what she said was Kienholz's message: 
``That you only get one first sexual experience, so think before 
you act. Make it meaningful, make it special, make it beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls' chaperones and teacher were stunned. On their return  
to Visalia, they complained to Principal Doug Bartsch. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote museum officials to protest that the artwork and Ms.  
Riseley's commentary were inappropriate for his students. Bartsch 
said his school has a ``very enlightened sex education program, but 
the trip to the museum wasn't part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's docent committee agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have followed your self-appointed role as a teacher of  
subjects such as sex education which may be consistent with your 
agenda, but it is not consistent with your role as a docent,'' the 
committee said in an April 28 letter notifying Ms. Riseley of her 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum was closed Wednesday, and nobody returned a telephone  
message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I became a docent after the 1992 riots. I said to myself,  
someone has to come forward and do something. People were moving 
away,'' said Ms. Riseley, a writer. ``I love Los Angeles and I love 
that museum.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Panel Mulls Donation Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal commission studying gambling  
approaches its final meeting with a major issue still up in the 
air: whether to recommend a ban on campaign contributions from the 
gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission may urge all  
states with legal gambling to emulate New Jersey, which prohibits 
casino companies, employees and other ``agents'' from giving money 
to candidates for state office or to political committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling interests have become prodigious givers on the state  
and federal levels. The National Institute on Money in State 
Politics says that in 10 states it has studied so far, gambling 
interests gave more than $1.5 million in the 1997-98 election 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission member Richard Leone, a former New Jersey state  
treasurer who proposed the ban, said the gambling industry should 
``bend over backwards to appear not to be buying their way into the 
business or into licenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner William Bible, former chairman of the Nevada gaming  
control board, opposes the idea. He said it would unfairly single 
out one industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue will be resolved when the commission meets for the  
last time on June 2 and 3 in San Francisco. On June 18, the 
commission finishes two years of work by delivering a report on the 
impact of legalized gambling to Congress, the White House, state 
governors and Native American tribal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Concluding a two-day meeting in Washington on Tuesday, the  
commission decided to recommend that governments require ``gambling 
impact statements'' -- akin to the environmental impact statements 
required of developers -- before approving new or additional 
casinos, slot machines or lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Robert Loescher, an Alaska businessman, objected to  
the idea as anti-business. ``This becomes a holdup. This becomes a 
delay,'' Loescher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel  
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, agreed that the 
statements would slow the approval process. But he added: ``I don't 
think that's bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also discussed, but tabled, a rebuke of American  
Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Most tribes that run casinos refused to fill out a commission  
survey because they said the information requested was private. 
Members of the commission opted not to subpoena the information but 
promised to make clear their displeasure in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm one of those who believe you don't always hide behind the  
law,'' said commissioner Paul Moore, a Mississippi radiologist and 
neighbor of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission considered a recommendation calling for creation  
of a new panel, ``with full subpoena power,'' to look specifically 
at Indian gambling. The idea was discarded after Loescher, an 
Indian, objected to singling out tribal casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Among commission recommendations approved for the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Automated teller machines should be banned from the area where  
betting takes place at casinos or race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	--State lotteries should not move into casino-style instant games  
such as slot machines and video poker. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should not allow casino-style gambling to be introduced  
at horse tracks or other pari-mutuel facilities for the primary 
purpose of bailing out economically strapped facilities or 
competing with other forms of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should stop the proliferation of ``convenience  
gambling'' outlets, such as video gambling machines in neighborhood 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	--So-called ``cruises to nowhere'' should be prohibited unless  
states from which the boats originate specifically allow them by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress should amend truth-in-advertising laws to cover  
American Indian gambling and state lotteries.

<HEADLINE> Nobelist To Lead Astrobiology Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Nobelist Baruch S. Blumberg is joining  
the search for life in outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumberg, who won the 1976 prize for physiology and medicine,  
was named Tuesday as the first director of NASA's Astrobiology 
Institute, based here at the Ames Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known for his work in developing the hepatitis B vaccine,  
Blumberg is a senior researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in 
Philadelphia and a professor of medicine and anthropology at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumberg should bring ``powerful and committed leadership'' to  
the search for life in outer space, said space agency head Daniel 
Goldin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely fortunate to have a person of his  
scholarship, experience and accomplishment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Educated at Columbia University, where he received his medical  
degree, Blumberg later received a doctorate in biochemistry at 
Oxford. He previously taught biology at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astrobiology Institute, formed last year, ties together  
researchers at NASA centers, universities and elsewhere. Its 
researchers study not only the possibility of alien life but how 
life began and evolved on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute will provide the ``intellectual underpinnings''  
for building new types of instruments and space probes for 
``finding if there is a thread of life beyond Earth,'' Goldin said.

<HEADLINE> Ultrasound Found To Help Tendinitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ultrasound treatment can give short-term relief to people with  
painful tendinitis in the shoulder, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, looked at the effectiveness of ultrasound in breaking 
down the calcium deposits in the rotator cuff that cause shoulder 
tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoulder tendinitis affects hundreds of thousands of Americans  
and is most common among people between 30 and 60. Women and people 
with sedentary jobs appear to be at higher risk. In some cases, 
tendinitis can become chronic, causing pain even when the shoulder 
is at rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultrasound -- inaudible, high-frequency vibrations created by  
converting electricity into sound waves -- is widely used to treat 
the condition, but its effectiveness had not been widely tested 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Other treatments include anti-inflammatory drugs, surgery to  
remove the calcium, physical therapy, or use of a needle to extract 
the calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerold R. Ebenbichler and colleagues from the University  
Hospital of Vienna conducted a study in which 32 patients received 
ultrasound for 15 minutes at a time in 24 sessions over six weeks, 
while 29 other people received a sham treatment -- essentially, no 
treatment at all. 
</P>
<P>
	After six weeks, the calcium deposits had cleared up in 19  
percent of those who got ultrasound, and 28 percent had less pain 
and more mobility. Of those who got the sham treatment, calcium 
deposits cleared in none and 10 percent had less pain and greater 
range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
	At a follow-up visit nine months later, the calcium deposits had  
cleared in 42 percent of those who got ultrasound and 8 percent of 
those had the sham treatment. But the difference in pain relief and 
mobility between the two groups had all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Cathy A. Speed and Brian L.  
Hazleman of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, said the 
study failed to show whether ultrasound should be the preferred 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our recommendation is that it be used only in patients with  
severe symptoms, in conjunction with other treatments,'' they 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries Again To Deport Demjanjuk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department renewed its 22-year  
legal campaign to strip John Demjanjuk of U.S. citizenship and 
deport him Wednesday, alleging again that the retired autoworker 
was a Nazi death camp guard during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the longest-running attempt by the U.S. government  
to revoke an alleged Nazi's citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed in federal court seeks to strip citizenship from  
the 79-year-old Demjanjuk, who was sentenced to die in Israel in 
1988 as the infamous death-camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible'' but was 
freed in 1993 when evidence indicated he was a victim of mistaken 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was criticized by a U.S. appellate court for  
``reckless'' withholding of evidence that might have cleared 
Demjanjuk in the earlier case. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special  
Investigations wins the latest case, it will then try to have 
Demjanjuk deported, said Myron Marlin, a department spokesman. But 
where Demjanjuk would be sent is unknown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Demjanjuk does not deserve American citizenship and has  
no business living in this country,'' said Neal Sher, who headed 
the OSI from 1983 to 1994 and is now chief of staff of the 
International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Tigar, Demjanjuk's attorney, said: ``Twenty-two years  
ago they sued Mr. Demjanjuk. It took 21 years, and all of his 
assets, to prove that the government was wrong. Now we'll try to 
show once again the Department of Justice doesn't have it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he is ordered deported, he would get to pick what country he  
would go to, but it would be up to that country to decide whether 
to take him. 
</P>
<P>
	However, any country that wants to bring a criminal case against  
Demjanjuk can ask at any time for his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The department wouldn't comment on whether Demjanjuk could face  
trial in another country. 
</P>
<P>
	The new lawsuit drops the charge that Demjanjuk was Ivan the  
Terrible. But it alleges that he was a guard at the Sobibor 
extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and at the Majdanek and 
Flossenburg concentration camps. It also accuses him of serving in 
the Nazi SS-run Trawniki unit that participated in a campaign to 
annihilate the Jews of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli courts have already heard all or most of these  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Israeli Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh  
declined to comment on the case, saying the issue is for the U.S. 
courts to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Israel would extradite Demjanjuk again, Elan  
Steinberg, executive director World Jewish Congress in New York, 
said: ``I doubt very much whether it would happen as a matter of 
practical reality because of the wrenching effect of the previous 
extradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk was born in Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet  
Union. He has denied serving as a guard in any concentration or 
death camp. He has said he was a Soviet Red Army soldier who spent 
most of the war in a German prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Demjanjuk was accused of being Ivan the Terrible, a  
guard who operated a gas chamber at the Treblinka extermination 
camp. His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981 and five years later 
he was extradited to Israel for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite overturning his conviction in the Ivan the Terrible  
case, the Israeli Supreme Court said it was convinced Demjanjuk had 
worked for the Nazis during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk returned to the United States in 1993, the same year a  
federal appeals court ruled the U.S. government had withheld 
evidence that might have cleared him. 
</P>
<P>
	A relative of Demjanjuk's noted the government's previous  
mishandling of the case and said the latest charges are old and 
lack credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just reshuffling the deck and throwing cards at him  
again,'' said Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law. ``Hopefully, it 
will not take another 22 years to clear his name once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to the United States, Demjanjuk has lived  
quietly in suburban Cleveland. His citizenship was restored in 
February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish groups across the country praised the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we can do to bring an SS man to justice is fair,  
particularly when we look at the unfairness and unjust manner in 
which they conducted themselves in the death camps,'' said Rabbi 
Marvin Hier, founder of Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Republican Aims for Philly Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A onetime fiery liberal activist bested a  
crowd of Democrats in his bid to become this city's second black 
mayor, and now faces a well-known Republican financial consultant 
in the final election. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Street, the former City Council president who over the  
years went from liberal activist to financial conservative, should 
have an edge in this heavily Democratic city. For every two 
registered Republicans, there are seven Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	To have any chance of beating Street, Republican Sam Katz must  
capture roughly three out of every five Democratic voters along 
with the Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That means going after the white rowhouse neighborhoods -- the  
folks who in the primary supported failed Democratic candidate 
Marty Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	But Katz, who made his fortune as a financial adviser to  
governments across the country, said he plans to appeal to all 
voters in all neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to make my candidacy attractive to all Philadelphians  
without regard to race, without regard to gender or ethnicity or 
(party) registration,'' he said while greeting the lunchtime crowd 
at the historic Reading Terminal Market. 
</P>
<P>
	His message -- lower wage taxes, strong schools and safe streets  
-- will be the same for all communities in the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Street asked his Democratic primary opponents to  
lunch Wednesday with the idea that they would unite behind his 
candidacy. Only one showed up, and not Weinberg, a longtime 
political powerbroker and Street's closest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg's campaign stressed Street's younger and more hotheaded  
days, running ads with TV footage of Street shoving a reporter and 
throwing a cup of water on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Street had 35.5 percent  
of the vote, or 100,597 votes, to Marty Weinberg's 31.2 percent, or 
88,564 votes. The rest were split among lesser-known Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Street, 55, said he plans to ask Weinberg ``to do his fair share  
to bring this party and this city together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, who served as a city school board member and made failed  
primary runs for mayor in 1991 and governor in 1994, helped develop 
retiring Mayor Edward G. Rendell's recovery plan in 1992, when the 
city was near bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, a popular Democrat who is credited with bringing the  
nation's fifth-largest city back from the brink of financial ruin, 
is barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He endorsed 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz took in $2.2 million and spent only $941,000 for the  
primary, leaving him well-positioned for the campaign for the Nov. 
3 election. Street raised and spent much of his $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, 49, is fond of pointing out that the nation's two largest  
cities, the longtime Democratic strongholds of New York and Los 
Angeles, elected Republican mayors in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia's voters haven't elected a Republican mayor in more  
than 50 years.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Shareholders OK Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- US Airways Group Inc. shareholders on  
Wednesday approved a management incentive pay plan giving top 
executives up to 500 percent of their base salary in bonuses. But 
chairman Stephen Wolf said he was withdrawing from the plan in 
response to a letter from a flight attendants union leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf told the company's annual shareholders meeting he and US  
Airways president Rakesh Gangwal agreed not to participate in the 
incentive plan after Lynn Lenosky, president of the US Airways 
chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants, wrote that the 
plan's approval ``can have a detrimental effect on employee morale 
and productivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf told approximately 350 shareholders, ``We considered it an  
issue that could lead to divisiveness in the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wolf also said he believes the plan was necessary to recruit  
and retain top managers. Under the plan, top executives can receive 
up to 500 percent of their base salary in bonuses if US Airways 
meets certain performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
	By not participating in the plan, Wolf and Gangwal will each  
forgo about $1.3 million in bonuses. Wolf's base salary is 
currently $580,000, while Gangwal's base salary is $566,538. 
</P>
<P>
	The overwhelming shareholder approval came despite complaints  
from union members, who argued that salaries of the company's 
41,000 employees stagnated for years while management's 
compensation skyrocketed. Shareholders holding about 63 million 
shares approved the plan, while those holding fewer than 3.8 
million opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the speakers at the meeting was a passenger service  
employee at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport who said his 
pay and pension have been frozen for six years. During that time, 
the only way he could support his wife and three children was to 
work a great deal of overtime, Danny Carter said, breaking down in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf seemed genuinely moved by the comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have not been compensated at a fair level for a number of  
years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines' 9,000 flight attendants have not had a  
cost-of-living raise since 1996, and they are working under a 
contract that came up for renewal that year. The 10,000 ticket and 
gate agents have not had a cost-of-living raise since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, flight attendants have complained that US Airways  
paid Wolf $34.2 million and Gangwal $36 million during 1998, making 
each executive more highly paid than the CEOs of American, United 
and Delta combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf defended his compensation, saying that most of it comes in  
stock options. He received 37 percent less than comparable 
executives at United, Delta and American in actual cash salary and 
bonuses, Wolf said. The company offered him and Gangwal stock 
options as an enticement to retain them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members say they are entitled to more compensation after a  
four-year-period when the airline earned profits of $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite saying it would move quickly to resolve labor issues  
after reaching a historic contract settlement with its 4,800 pilots 
in October 1997, US Airways has signed only one major contract 
since then, with its fleet service workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The slow pace is not unique. Seven of the 10 largest U.S.  
airlines are negotiating contracts, and some have been at it for 
years.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Brings Latin Flavor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ricky Martin's people skills go WAY beyond  
simple charm. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't just say ``hello'' when he sees a reporter waiting as  
he rushes down the hall to get something to eat between interviews; 
he makes immediate eye contact, smiles widely and shrugs, as if to 
say, ``Can you BELIEVE how hectic this day is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the interview starts, he admires a piece of jewelry, asks  
if the interviewer would like something to drink, and apologizes 
for the short time allotted for questions. Then, he settles his 
lanky, 6-foot-plus frame into the chair and waits attentively for 
the first question. 
</P>
<P>
	Others might be uncomfortable being the center of attention,  
always having to be personable. Not Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always had the need to be in the spotlight,'' said Martin,  
27, a former member of the Latino teen group Menudo. 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm for anything connected to his music is  
all-encompassing. And it's contagious, judging by the thousands of 
fans who waited hours to see him at a Manhattan record store on the 
day his latest record was released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' the first single from his new  
English-language album ``Ricky Martin,'' is at the top of the music 
charts. The video is in heavy rotation, he's been on morning 
television and ``Saturday Night Live.'' And thanks to his high 
eye-candy quotient, the Puerto Rican-born Martin is on People 
magazine's list of the 50 ``most beautiful people in the world'' 
for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have something special, and Rick has that,'' said  
Robi ``Draco'' Rosa, another former Menudo member, who has written 
songs and produced for Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant celebrities always run the risk of fizzling out. But  
Martin doesn't plan to be just a flavor-of-the-month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to come back to America in 10 years and still be  
respected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is no stranger to stardom. He's been through it with  
Menudo, then again when he went into acting on a soap opera and on 
Broadway. His Spanish-language albums have sold millions of copies 
globally, and ``La Copa de la Vida'' became the theme for the 1998 
World Cup of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	He is much better known outside of the United States. But Martin  
doesn't let that bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot expect for everybody to know me,'' he said. ``What am  
I going to say? 'How come you don't know me? What are you talking 
about? Where have you been, under a rock?' That's not how it goes. 
I'm more into, 'Yeah, let's start today, this is me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He's hoping his English-language album, which features a duet  
with Madonna, will be his introduction to audiences in the United 
States -- and their introduction to his Latin musical heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people to know where I come from and if, in order for  
that to happen, I have to speak in their language, I will,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the message of the album is to ``be who you are.  
Express yourself how you want to express yourself. Don't be 
afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is quick to allay fears that his foray into English means  
he's turning his back on his Spanish roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never stop singing in Spanish,'' said Martin, who is  
already working on his next Spanish-language album. ``That's my 
mother tongue, and I'm very proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So why did he do an English-language album when he's sung in  
Spanish elsewhere in the world? 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I wanted to do it. ... It's very simple, it's not a  
science project. I felt like it. Why not? It's not that if you 
don't do it in English in America, you're not going to make it. I 
didn't do English because of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the album also showcases his spirituality, which he  
credits with keeping him from getting caught up in his own hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very seductive to be part of that wave and I've felt  
it,'' he said. ``You start feeling that grandiosity complex and it 
becomes part of you, and then you think you're God and you deserve 
it all ... That's not good for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a balance is key, Martin said. For him, that includes  
taking time every morning to be by himself, to think about what's 
going on, and to take a step back and gain some perspective. He's 
been doing that for six years, and it's what keeps him enjoying his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this. I love it because I have a balance,'' he said.  
Not having that, he said, ``would be like creating a sabotage to 
your talents ... This is your mission, this is what you came to 
life for. In order for you to follow this path in a healthy way, 
look for the balance.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Correct New Stadium Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Structural defects found in five places in the  
new Cleveland Browns stadium were minor, and did not threaten the 
$283 million structure, Mayor Michael R. White said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors found the problems in five of 1,000 joints in the  
stadium where steel beams attach to concrete or steel columns. 
Contractors were paying to add bolts to improve support and fix the 
problems, he said. The cost was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``These deficiencies are not considered unusual nor are they a  
safety hazard,'' White said during a news conference at the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council President Jay Westbrook said some bolts had sheared  
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Bill W. Patmon, who worked in construction for 15  
years, said sheared bolts could be a serious problem. He also said 
if the bolts were flawed because of improper heat treatment, the 
problem easily could be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Fratianni, project manager for construction company Huber  
Hunt &AMP; Nichols, said the problems were typical of large-scale 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these presented imminent danger,'' he said. ``These  
are things that needed follow-up but not things that threaten 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Project managers said several inspectors check the stadium's  
construction regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the 72,000-seat stadium is about 85 percent  
complete. The stadium is expected to open on time in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns play their first regular-season game at home Sept. 12  
against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Tickets a Job Perk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Star Wars'' is finally here.  
</P>
<P>
	After months of relentless hype, fans stood in theater lines  
across the country on Wednesday as the latest installment of the 
space saga opened across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Theaters scheduled round-the-clock showings and some companies  
decided not to fight the Force -- they sent their employees to ``The 
Phantom Menace,'' which was on schedule to shatter Hollywood 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to see this movie, and we thought it would be  
fun to send our whole company,'' said Steven J. Lund, president and 
CEO of Provo, Utah-based cosmetics seller Nu Skin Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reserved a theater for all 1,600 employees and  
one guest each for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' 
which opened at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday after years of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	No official box office figures were available for the early  
showings, but movie analysts expected the movie to easily top $100 
million by the end of the five-day opening frame on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-day opening window, ``Menace'' was expected to beat  
the opening record of $90.2 million set by ``Lost World: Jurassic 
Park'' in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Menace'' also will be competing against its ancestors. The  
original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all time. Counting its 
various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in tickets 
domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 million, No. 
7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes Back'' has made 
$290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't get ``Star Wars'' tickets as a company  
perk, there were long lines outside the nation's theaters, dozens 
of which scheduled around-the-clock showings to accommodate crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Fyfe, wearing the brown robe of a Jedi master, was shaking  
and nearly unable to speak after emerging from a 3:30 a.m. 
screening Wednesday at Hollywood's Mann's Chinese Theater, where 
the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to see it again today,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The mainly male, 20-something audience that packed the theater  
for the 12:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. shows raved about George Lucas' 
$115 million prequel to the famed ``Star Wars'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so awesome. I think I'm going to hit double digits, and  
see it at least 10 times,'' said Larry Crouse, 24, who also wore a 
Jedi costume. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis, Mike Kunkel stood in line for more than 12 hours  
to get his ticket to the midnight showing. The 19-year-old from 
central Minnesota said he and his friend planned to see the movie 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding like a Jedi master, he summed up his philosophy this  
way: ``The first time to see it. The second time to notice things. 
And the third time to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans' raves were a far cry from most of the nation's movie  
critics, who have overwhelmingly panned the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were fears of mass labor shortages due to ``Star  
Wars,'' companies with big Force fans -- particularly computer and 
electronics firms -- reported no serious problems, due in part to 
lots of understanding from management. 
</P>
<P>
	At River Park Computer Group, a consulting company in San Jose,  
all five so-called ``home and small office gurus'' said they would 
be pulling a Silicon Valley Skywalker Walk-Out during the next day 
or two, said owner Frank Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared for no one to be here,'' he said. ``I'm going  
myself.''

<HEADLINE>  Sabres, Leafs: Great Lakes Showdown / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Many Toronto sports fans have a soft spot for  
Buffalo, a small-market city with Canadian-style winters, just 100 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Temporarily, though, the Peace Bridge that links Buffalo to  
Ontario may need another name. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time ever, the beloved hockey teams of Toronto and  
Buffalo are facing each other in a playoff series, with a berth in 
the Stanley Cup finals at stake. Players on both teams agree: Leafs 
vs. Sabres is a classic rivalry waiting for ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to start writing some history now,'' said Sabres  
forward Dixon Ward after his team advanced over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference championship series opens Sunday in  
Toronto; it will be the Sabres' first visit to the new Air Canada 
Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the matchup was determined, the Canadian media dubbed  
it the ``QEW Series'' after Queen Elizabeth Way, the highway 
linking Toronto to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls region. 
</P>
<P>
	With the two arenas only two hours apart, large numbers of fans  
-- including some without tickets for the sold-out games -- are 
expected to drive to other city to support their team on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to lock our doors over here because of all the  
Leafs fans coming over,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``It should 
be mayhem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has an extra dimension for Sabres players such as  
Jason Woolley and captain Michael Peca, raised as Leafs fans in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca saw TV footage of Toronto fans celebrating in the streets  
Monday night after the Leafs eliminated Pittsburgh, and he recalled 
joining similar revelry as a fan six years ago when Toronto won a 
playoff series over Detroit with an overtime goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was me. ... I was that guy honking the horns and cheering  
the Leafs on,'' Peca said. ``It's going to be fun being one of the 
guys trying to upset those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Leafs, it's the first time in the Stanley Cup's final  
four since 1994. Toronto hasn't won the cup since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have never won the cup, although this is their second  
straight appearance in the Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo is often depicted sympathetically in the Canadian media  
as a Canadian-style sports city, faced with the same small-market 
challenges -- and often brutal winter weather -- that beset places 
like Edmonton and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League are covered  
like a hometown team by the Toronto media, a phenomenon that has 
intensified since the Bills gave their quarterback job to longtime 
Canadian Football League superstar Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Leafs met five times during the regular season,  
with Buffalo winning three but losing the last two. The Leafs, the 
NHL's highest-scoring team, outshot the Sabres 163-119 in those 
games, yet were outscored 17-10, thanks to the goaltending of 
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason the teams haven't met in the playoffs previously  
is that the Leafs, until this season, played in the Western 
Conference. The series with Buffalo is just the sort of showdown 
the Leafs' brass hoped for when they finally won their bid to move 
into the same conference with such natural rivals as Buffalo, 
Montreal, Boston and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be pretty intense,'' said Leafs president Ken Dryden.  
``We want rivalries, and rivalries get spawned in playoff series.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Despite Inflation Worry / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices recovered Wednesday after several  
days of being shaken by fears of higher inflation rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/16  
point, or $10.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.80 percent from 5.88 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to up 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were 
up 1/8 point to 7/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first strong showing for Treasury bonds since the  
market got hit by inflation jitters on Friday following a report of 
an unexpectedly high rise in consumer prices. Bonds also swooned 
briefly Tuesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve said it would 
lean toward raising interest rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long bond ended the day higher Tuesday, and the gains  
continued Wednesday as buyers returned to the market hopeful that 
the overall benign outlook for inflation will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount fell 0.04 percentage point to 4.48 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.76 percent, as the discount fell 0.06 percentage 
point to 4.58 percent. One-year yields were 4.86 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.03 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.63 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.50 percent from 4.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 9/32 to 122 1/32. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.36 percent from 5.38 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Student Drinking Policy in Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- The state Board of Higher Education has  
voted to require Massachusetts public universities to notify 
parents when their underage children are caught with alcohol on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members unanimously approved the policy Tuesday, saying  
they hope to reduce repeat offenses and enhance public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just makes good sense,'' said Chancellor Stanley Koplik.  
``Parents want to know when there's been behavior by their on or 
daughter that will jeopardize the academic career and certainly the 
public safety of the individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent changes in federal law allow colleges to tell parents of  
violations by underage students. Before the change last year, many 
institutions feared they would violate privacy regulations if they 
told parents about their children's drug and alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
	The change followed several high-profile drinking deaths like  
those at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Louisiana 
State in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first colleges to take advantage of the new policy,  
the University of Delaware, sent letters last fall to 1,414 parents 
whose under-21 children had violated campus regulations. Sine then, 
the campus has recorded a decline in repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown University, Clemson University, Lafayette College and  
Indiana University are among the other schools that have adopted 
similar notification policies.

playoff series over Detroit with an overtime goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was me. ... I was that guy honking the horns and cheering  
the Leafs on,'' Peca said. ``It's going to be fun being one of the 
guys trying to upset those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Leafs, it's the first time in the Stanley Cup's final  
four since 1994. Toronto hasn't won the cup since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have never won the cup, although this is their second  
straight appearance in the Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo is often depicted sympathetically in the Canadian media  
as a Canadian-style sports city, faced with the same small-market 
challenges -- and often brutal winter weather -- that beset places 
like Edmonton and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Bills of the National Football League are covered  
like a hometown team by the Toronto media, a phenomenon that has 
intensified since the Bills gave their quarterback job to longtime 
Canadian Football League superstar Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Leafs met five times during the regular season,  
with Buffalo winning three but losing the last two. The Leafs, the 
NHL's highest-scoring team, outshot the Sabres 163-119 in those 
games, yet were outscored 17-10, thanks to the goaltending of 
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason the teams haven't met in the playoffs previously  
is that the Leafs, until this season, played in the Western 
Conference. The series with Buffalo is just the sort of showdown 
the Leafs' brass hoped for when they finally won their bid to move 
into the same conference with such natural rivals as Buffalo, 
Montreal, Boston and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be pretty intense,'' said Leafs president Ken Dryden.  
``We want rivalries, and rivalries get spawned in playoff series.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Peacekeeping Mission Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military mission that the Clinton  
administration originally envisioned for NATO in implementing a 
Kosovo peace accord is taking on a new look. The ground force would 
be much larger, and some allies think it ought to be prepared to 
move even before Belgrade signs on to a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	If peacekeepers moved in early, they might face scattered  
resistance from remnant Serb forces, the Pentagon says. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent is still to use this multinational force to implement  
a peace, not launch a ground war. But as NATO's Operation Allied 
Force entered its ninth week Wednesday, alliance and U.S. officials 
said questions remain on how soon the peacekeeping force should be 
assembled and when it should enter Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing is important because of the degree of risk and cost  
entailed in various options, and because NATO wants to end the 
conflict and get the hundreds of thousands of displaced ethnic 
Albanians in Macedonia and Albania back into their villages in 
Kosovo under NATO protection before the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there are going to be (NATO) ground troops of some  
type'' in Kosovo, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. The issue 
is whether they should be prepared to enter Kosovo without the 
consent of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, once Serb forces 
are too battered to offer much resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. position remains that ``we need an agreement or a U.N.  
Security Council resolution'' first, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, however, Bacon said it was possible that an  
international peacekeeping force could enter Kosovo without 
Milosevic's consent. ``You don't have to have an agreement to do 
that,'' Bacon said on Monday, so long as the Serb forces simply 
stopped the violence in Kosovo and withdrew from the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, NATO estimated it would need 28,000 peacekeepers, of  
which about 4,000 were to be American. Now it figures it might take 
50,000, of which the United States may contribute 7,000 to 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials have argued in recent days that NATO should be  
preparing for an early entry into Kosovo, given the increasing 
damage NATO airstrikes are inflicting on the hunkered down Serb 
army in the Serb province. British Air Marshal Sir John Day told 
reporters in London on Wednesday that NATO has seriously degraded 
Serb air defenses, fuel resources, lines of communication and 
fielded forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO's air campaign has already significantly eroded the  
military capability of Milosevic's war machine, and it is being 
further reduced as each day goes by,'' Day said. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, due in Washington on  
Thursday for talks with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said 
NATO should be ready to move quickly with ground forces to protect 
refugees once Serb forces are sufficiently devastated. ``The issue 
of judgment that needs to be made is at what point in the end game 
would it be appropriate, would it be safe, would it be right, for 
troops to enter,'' he said in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said Wednesday that the U.S. military could move its  
portion of a peacekeeping force into the area ``in days.'' He noted 
that 6,000 U.S. troops already are in Albania and NATO has about 
13,000 troops in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton stirred speculation about U.S. policy when he  
said Tuesday that no option should be ruled out on the use of 
ground troops, although he also said NATO should continue on its 
present course of airstrikes. Previously, Clinton had said he had 
no intention of introducing ground troops into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer was asked about Clinton's  
remark at a Senate hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he said is that ground forces are still an option on the  
table, under the right set of conditions,'' Reimer said. Yet to be 
determined is what that ``right set of conditions'' will be. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, spokesman Jamie Shea  
said Wednesday the alliance is focusing on plans for a peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo, to be dubbed Operation Joint Guardian, not a 
ground war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to send ground forces to fight in Kosovo, but  
as a peace force,'' Shea said. He said NATO was ``pushing this as a 
matter of priority'' because it does not want to leave a security 
vacuum in Kosovo if Serb forces suddenly give up and withdraw from 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us in the alliance share a sense of urgency that when  
Milosevic finally puts up his hand and says, 'I accept (NATO's) 
conditions,' we have to be ready with a peace implementation force 
to enter Kosovo rapidly,'' Shea said.

<HEADLINE> Senator Expects Fall Budget Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Appropriations  
Committee predicted another autumn budget clash between Congress 
and President Clinton on Tuesday as congressional leaders prepared 
plans for cutting domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're heading for a collision that will take us to  
September,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told reporters. ``It's a 
bad, bad scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens also predicted that because of spending cuts his  
committee will propose in bills covering environment, health and 
other programs, the Republican-controlled Congress will reject many 
of the measures unless more money is provided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we get the bills passed? No, we can't get the bills  
passed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens' remarks placed him among a small number of Republicans  
who have publicly said that ultimately, Congress will have to 
exceed spending limits imposed by the 1997 budget-balancing deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have said privately that Stevens' spending  
plans and a similar proposal by the House Appropriations Committee 
are purposely designed to convince GOP leaders and colleagues that 
more money is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	All year, Republicans have said they want to avoid a replay of  
last fall's spending battle with Clinton, when he forced them to 
provide billions of dollars more in spending than they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens spoke after delivering a similar message to GOP senators  
in a closed-door lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, his committee intends to approve plans for dividing  
up $538 billion among 13 spending bills for the coming fiscal year, 
measures that finance all government agencies. That is billions 
below 1999 levels, forced by the two-year-old budget deal, which 
imposed increasing annual cuts in such programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a similar House blueprint, Stevens' proposal would provide  
billions of dollars less this year for bills financing health, 
education, housing, environmental and other domestic programs, 
while adding billions to defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants increases, not cuts, for many of those programs.  
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, GOP leaders insist Congress will abide by the spending  
limits. In part, that is because money to increase the spending 
would have to come either from Social Security's surpluses or by 
reducing funds available for a tax cut Republicans want, both of 
which would infuriate conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of their position, top Republicans have begun noting  
that Clinton and congressional Democratic leaders have produced 
their own budgets that abide by the spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of any point on which there seems to be ... more  
universal commitment,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said GOP leaders would have to find a solution to the  
spending problem or fall prey to numerous Democratic amendments 
designed to embarrass Republicans for cutting programs during a 
time of federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about who controls the Senate,'' Stevens said.  
</P>
<P>
	Separately, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., acknowledged  
that he was beginning to address the spending problem in his 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to vent this,'' he said in an interview, adding that  
his lieutenants would conduct ``a listening session with members so 
we know what their feelings are.''

<HEADLINE> Kmart Announces $1B Stock Buyback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp.'s years of retrenchment are over, and  
the nation's No. 3 retailer plans to add 30 to 50 stores a year as 
it rides the growth in the discount retail business, chief 
executive Floyd Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also told shareholders at their annual meeting Tuesday that  
the company will buy back $1 billion in stock over the next several 
years, a response to what he said is the serious undervaluing of 
its shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like you, we are frustrated that our stock price is  
undervalued by many in the financial community,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that its price-earnings ratio is about half the average  
of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the market isn't interested in buying, you can be sure that  
we are,'' he said. ``Kmart is taking this dramatic action today as 
evidence of our strong confidence in the growth and future 
performance of this company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, chairman since June 1995, presented shareholders with a  
glowing overview of the company's recent performance. He noted that 
the company: 
</P>
<P>
	--Has posted 12 consecutive quarters of earnings increases,  
thanks partly to strong private merchandise sales from Martha 
Stewart, Sesame Street and Jaclyn Smith lines. 
</P>
<P>
	--Has refurbished all of its stores within the last three and a  
half years, freeing up cash for renewed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Will complete the conversion of traditional Kmart stores to Big  
Kmart stores, with a year-end total of more than 1,850 Big Kmarts 
in the chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In answer to one shareholder's question, he said Kmart was  
interested in finding a national retail chain to help it expand its 
grocery offerings. He said the company has been discussing the 
project with potential partners, which he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy-based Kmart is the nation's third-largest retailer, behind  
Wal-Mart and Sears Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had earnings last year of $518 million on sales of  
$33.7 billion. Kmart has 2,162 stores in all 50 states, Puerto 
Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell, Selleck Talk Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell said she wanted a peaceful  
discussion about gun control when actor Tom Selleck came on her 
show Wednesday. It didn't work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who has filmed a commercial for the National Rifle  
Association, instead got into a heated debate with O'Donnell, a 
frequent critic of the NRA since the Columbine High School 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said he believed gun control legislation wouldn't have  
done anything to prevent the tragedy, and that it was wrong to 
legislate against guns during a period of national mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	When O'Donnell complained about NRA opposition to efforts to ban  
assault weapons, Selleck said he couldn't speak for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say `I will not take responsibility for anything the  
NRA represents if you're doing an ad for the NRA. You can't say 
that. Do you think you can?''' O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said it was ``an act of moral vanity'' for O'Donnell to  
assume that someone who disagrees with her cares any less about gun 
control. He said he felt attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come on your show to have a debate,'' he said. ``I  
came on your show to plug a movie. That's what I'm doing here. If 
you think it's proper to have a debate about the NRA, I'm trying to 
be fair with you. This is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exasperated Selleck looked out on the silent audience.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly entertaining,'' he said. ``Look at the  
audience, laughing and having a great old time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious subject,'' O'Donnell shot back. ``I don't think  
it's something to laugh about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding the debate hadn't gone well, O'Donnell apologized to  
Selleck, saying she wasn't making a personal attack. Selleck, 
looking down at the floor, didn't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your show,'' he said, ``and you can talk about it after I  
leave.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Pulls Show on Violence Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS left a drama about mobsters off its fall  
prime-time schedule because of concerns about violent programming 
in the wake of the Littleton school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the right time to have people being whacked on the  
streets of New York,'' CBS President Leslie Moonves said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves said he screened the pilot for a new drama, ``Falcone,''  
the week after 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo. were killed by two teen-aged boys who later killed 
themselves. The massacre happened on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did affect us. It really did,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long television drama is about a mob war in New York  
City. The lead character, Joe Falcone, must choose between two 
rivals trying to take control of organized crime. Moonves said it 
was similar to the movie, ``Donnie Brasco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While it's not fair to blame the media for the rampage, Moonves  
said that ``anyone who thinks the media has nothing to do with this 
is an idiot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt a responsibility not to put it on now,'' he said. ``It  
just didn't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS announced its prime-time schedule on Wednesday and included  
six new series. ``Falcone'' is still being considered as a 
midseason replacement, Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB network is also reportedly considering what to do with  
its season-ending episode of ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' that 
treads uncomfortably close to Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the episode scheduled to air next week, heavily armed  
students at Buffy's high school try to confront the town's mayor, 
who has been turned into a monster. WB officials didn't return 
calls for comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Must Defend Knicks Better  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No offense, but the run-and-shoot doesn't seem to  
work against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	They're simply too young, too quick and too deep for the Atlanta  
Hawks, who know they had better find a way to bring New York down 
to their level for a bruising, low-scoring, half-court game 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, this Eastern Conference semifinal could be over -- and  
it's barely even started. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense has got to pick up, period,'' Atlanta guard Mookie  
Blaylock said after Wednesday's two-hour practice at the Georgia 
Dome. ``We can't let them score the way they scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, there was no defense for the way the Hawks played in  
Game 1 Tuesday. New York, hardly looking like an eighth-seeded 
team, jumped ahead in the best-of-7 series with a 100-92 victory 
that really wasn't that close as Allan Houston scored 34 points and 
Latrell Sprewell added 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta faces a virtual must-win situation in Game 2, before the  
series shifts to Madison Square Garden for Games 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew Atlanta didn't have a deep bench, so we tried to get  
their starting five tired,'' Knicks forward Kurt Thomas said. ``We 
just ran the ball. We played well and with a lot of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks hardly seemed the type of team to cause a defensive  
meltdown, ranking 27th in the league with an average of 86.4 point 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, meanwhile, were the NBA's top defensive team,  
allowing a mere 83.4 points on average. Only four players scored 
more than 30 points against Atlanta and just three teams managed to 
reach triple figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, Houston and Sprewell had not seen those numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it tough,'' said Chris Crawford, who kept the Hawks  
close with a career-high 26 points. ``You can't key on one guy or 
the other one will hurt you, too. We've got to come out with more 
intensity on defense. That's been a key for us all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks looked downright unstoppable except for a lull in the  
second quarter when Crawford led a 13-0 run that gave the Hawks a 
50-48 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out aggressive,'' New York's Larry Johnson said. ``We  
wanted to attack the basket at all times, and we did that well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to shooting 50 percent in every quarter but the  
second, the Knicks held a 40-32 advantage on the boards against a 
team that was top 10 in every rebounding category. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about attacking before the defense is set,'' said  
New York coach Jeff Van Gundy, making a strong run at keeping his 
job after a disappointing regular season. ``But to do that, you 
have to get stops and rebounds. And the rebounding part has been 
the hardest part for us -- keeping them off the boards. That was a 
critical factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, who missed the last three games of the opening-round  
victory over Detroit with a separated shoulder, returned to give 
the bench a much-needed boost. But he was the only reserve to 
contribute significantly, and the Knicks blamed themselves for 
allowing him to get too many clear looks at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take anything away from Chris Crawford,''  
Johnson said. ``But any player that's wide open is going to hit his 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the lead after two quarters, Atlanta should have known  
it was out of its element. In winning two of three from the Knicks 
during the regular season, the Hawks allowed an average of 76.7 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York has been a different team in the playoffs, knocking  
off top-seeded Miami in the first round before taking the homecourt 
advantage away from the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing played only 17 minutes in Game 1 due to foul  
trouble, finishing with 12 points and six rebounds. It didn't 
matter, since the Hawks had no one who could stop Houston or 
Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing well right now,'' Sprewell said. ``Regardless of  
all that's been said, we can play together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Can the Hawks, who started five over-30 players in Game 1, find  
a way to keep up with the high-flying Knicks? 
</P>
<P>
	``It ain't quickness,'' Blaylock insisted. ``We've got some  
quick guys on this team. The key to our defense is shot 
selection.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Torture Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One witness was a desk sergeant, the other a  
teen-age prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	One said he noticed nothing unusual while supervising from his  
perch at a Brooklyn police station. The other described disturbing 
sights and sounds observed from a holding pen around a corner, 
about 60 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard banging against a wall and I heard somebody  
screaming,'' said the teen, Connelle Lugg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugg and the sergeant, Jeffrey Fallon, testified Tuesday at the  
high-profile brutality trial of five police officers, providing 
starkly contrasting snapshots of the pre-dawn scene at the station 
on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say on that morning Officer Justin Volpe --  
mistakenly thinking Abner Louima had earlier punched him in a melee 
outside a nightclub -- rammed a stick into Louima's rectum and mouth 
while Officer Charles Schwarz held him on the floor of a police 
station bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involving the black Haitian immigrant stunned the city  
and has raised tensions between minorities and the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, Schwarz and two other officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas  
Wiese, are also charged with violating Louima's civil rights by 
beating him in a patrol car en route to the station. A fifth 
defendant is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugg, then 16, arrested on unrelated weapon and menacing  
charges, testified that he was in a cell adjacent to the 
stationhouse bathroom when he spotted a police officer leading a 
handcuffed Louima down a hallway; he said Louima's pants were down 
around his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	After he heard the screams through the wall, Lugg said, an  
officer he identified as Volpe threw Louima onto his knees in the 
same cell. He said Louima smelled bad, was moaning and complained 
that he needed to go to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	When Louima asked for help, Volpe told him to shut up, Lugg  
said. Other officers eventually summoned an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fallon on Tuesday described being seated behind the station's  
elevated front desk when a handcuffed Louima was brought before him 
to be searched and processed on a charge of assaulting a officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The sergeant testified there was no indication of any problem at  
all until two days later, when internal affairs investigators 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Fallon later was suspended for failing to safeguard a prisoner.  
The department charges, which could cost him his job, are pending.

<TEXT>
<P>
	A federal judge has dismissed a $1 billion lawsuit by the  
descendants of the Russian distiller who first produced Smirnov 
vodka 140 years ago, saying the family waited too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (family) did nothing,'' U.S. District Judge Gregory Sleet  
said in his ruling. ``More troubling, they did not even try to do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the Joint Stock Society, whose  
principal owners claim to be descendants of Piotr Smirnov, and the 
Russian American Spirits Company, sued UDV North America Inc. and 
the Pierre Smirnoff Company, claiming false advertising, false 
association and trademark cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
	The history of the case stretches back to about 1860, when  
Smirnov began distilling vodka under the family name, winning 
praise as the ``Official Purveyor to the Russian Imperial Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Smirnov died, he left the business to his five sons, with  
one, also named Piotr, buying out the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The business then passed to his wife, Eugenia -- but she fled  
when the Bolshevik revolution broke out in 1917. The following 
year, the new government nationalized the company, and stopped 
using the Smirnov name. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1923, another son, Vladimir -- who had sold his interest in  
the Smirnov name nearly two decades earlier and later fled Russia 
for Poland -- began making vodka under the family name, court 
documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move infuriated Eugenia, according to documents, but neither  
she nor other family members ever approached Vladimir about the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Vladimir Smirnov sold the rights to his vodka  
business to an American businessman, who started selling the 
product in the United States in 1934. Five years later, that 
businessman sold the company to G.F. Heublein &AMP; Brothers, which 
became UDV North America, a unit of London-based food and spirits 
conglomerate Diageo PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, five to six million cases of Smirnoff vodka are sold  
in the United States each year, making it the most popular brand of 
vodka -- and the second most popular distilled spirit -- in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, the Joint Stock Society began contracting with  
Russian vodka manufacturers to produce and sell vodka under the 
Smirnov name, and later filed the lawsuit, saying it was entitled 
to damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The vodka still carries essentially the same crown and bunting  
design as the original label and mentions the honors won by the 
original Smirnov, Sleet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, however, noted in his decision that the Joint Stock  
Society has not taken any steps to manufacture or sell vodka in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs have done nothing to elevate this controversy  
beyond anything more than a theoretical dispute between two 
companies that may, one day, find themselves competing with one 
another,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleet also said the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the case  
because they have not shown that they have suffered an actual or 
imminent injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Sleet said too much time had elapsed -- without UDV  
having any knowledge there was a problem with use of the name -- to 
hold that company responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Duncan Grant, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he was  
disappointed with the outcome and may appeal.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell, Selleck Talk Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell said she wanted a peaceful  
discussion about gun control when actor Tom Selleck came on her 
show Wednesday. It didn't work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who has filmed a commercial for the National Rifle  
Association, instead got into a heated debate with O'Donnell, a 
frequent critic of the NRA since the Columbine High School 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said he believed gun control legislation wouldn't have  
done anything to prevent the tragedy, and that it was wrong to 
legislate against guns during a period of national mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	When O'Donnell complained about NRA opposition to efforts to ban  
assault weapons, Selleck said he couldn't speak for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say `I will not take responsibility for anything the  
NRA represents if you're doing an ad for the NRA. You can't say 
that. Do you think you can?''' O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selleck said it was ``an act of moral vanity'' for O'Donnell to  
assume that someone who disagrees with her cares any less about gun 
control. He said he felt attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come on your show to have a debate,'' he said. ``I  
came on your show to plug a movie. That's what I'm doing here. If 
you think it's proper to have a debate about the NRA, I'm trying to 
be fair with you. This is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exasperated Selleck looked out on the silent audience.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly entertaining,'' he said. ``Look at the  
audience, laughing and having a great old time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious subject,'' O'Donnell shot back. ``I don't think  
it's something to laugh about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conceding the debate hadn't gone well, O'Donnell apologized to  
Selleck, saying she wasn't making a personal attack. Selleck, 
looking down at the floor, didn't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your show,'' he said, ``and you can talk about it after I  
leave.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Linebacker Thomas Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys linebacker Broderick Thomas  
was arrested on a pair of outstanding traffic warrants and is under 
investigation for involvement in an unrelated fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 32, was booked at about 9:55 p.m. EDT Tuesday on  
warrants from nearby Farmers Branch charging him with speeding and 
driving without proof of insurance. Thomas was freed on $865 bond 
less than two hours later, according to a jail supervisor for the 
Irving Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisor, who declined to be identified, said Thomas had  
been ``involved in some type of altercation in Irving'' and that 
any other possible charges were being referred today to the 
department's criminal investigation unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas television station WFAA reported that Thomas fought with  
a business partner before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 250-pound player has been one of the Cowboys' best  
pass rushers in the nine years since he was signed out of Nebraska 
as a free agent. He missed all of last season after injuring his 
left knee in training camp.

<HEADLINE> Joan of Arc Helps CBS Top Nielsens / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS can thank a 500-year-old heroine for its  
dominance in the ratings last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Its Sunday night movie about Joan of Arc proved a better draw  
than a train careening out of control or Diana Ross and Brandy, 
enabling CBS to earn an important Nielsen Media Research victory. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC came in second in prime-time ratings for the week, part of  
the May ``sweeps'' period during which viewership is closely 
watched to set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three networks each scheduled ``big event'' movies on  
Sunday to lure viewers. CBS's movie about the French heroine burned 
at the stake for heresy in 1431 drew an average audience of 23.3 
million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first part of NBC's ``Atomic Train'' miniseries had 16.6  
million viewers. The story about the train hurtling toward Denver 
drew poor reviews and had to be edited hastily because of concerns 
over its depiction of science and sensitivities about the Littleton 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's movie, ``Double Platinum,'' featuring Ross and Brandy in a  
drama about a singer reuniting with her long-ago abandoned child, 
had 14.2 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	All ranked among the week's 17 most-watched shows. ``ER'' was in  
its customary spot at the top of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.5 rating and 16 share. NBC had a 9.3  
rating and 16 share, ABC a 7.2 rating and 12 share and Fox a 6.1 
and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB, the only network to show year-to-year ratings growth,  
had a 3.3 rating and 6 share. UPN was at 1.8 and 3 and Pax TV had a 
0.7 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.2 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.0 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 10-16, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 18.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.6; ``CBS 
Sunday Movie: Joan of Arc, Part One,'' CBS, 15.2; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
14.8; ``Mad About You'' special, NBC, 13.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.4; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Ally McBeal,'' 
Fox, 11.4; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Atomic Train, Part One,'' NBC, 
11.3; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.1.

<HEADLINE> Italian Regulators Warn Olivetti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italy's stock market regulator warned  
Olivetti SpA to stick to the facts in statements about its hostile 
bid for Telecom Italia SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob's warning followed a complaint to the agency by Telecom  
Italia, which said statements attributed to an adviser to Olivetti 
could improperly influence the outcome of the takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has offered $65 billion for Telecom Italia in a tender  
offer that ends Friday. If successful, it would be the largest 
hostile corporate takeover in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has said it needs to garner at least 35 percent of  
Telecom Italia's ordinary capital to even consider proceeding with 
the bid. At 67 percent or more, Olivetti is obliged to take up the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian news agency Radiocor quoted an adviser to Olivetti  
CEO Roberto Colannino as saying it appeared the subscription rate 
already had passed the 35 percent mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia said that kind of statement violates the rules of  
correctness and transparency in that it influences subscription to 
the takeover bid. It could alter the price of financial instruments 
of both Olivetti and Telecom Italia with partial and undocumented 
information, Telecom Italia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob ordered Olivetti to ``immediately release any information  
it has, or its advisers have, on funds that have asked their 
brokers to tender their shares to Olivetti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti also must ``abstain from spreading information about  
the bid that is not backed up by hard data, isn't verifiable and is 
only based on the calculations of analysts,'' the regulatory agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Milan stock market Wednesday, Telecom stocks rallied on  
investor sentiment that Olivetti has a good change of winning the 
bid for the former telephone monopoly.

<HEADLINE> Missed Free Throws Risk Pacers Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers couldn't hit their free  
throws and couldn't inbound the ball to Reggie Miller. In the final 
minute of Game 2 against Philadelphia, it almost cost them dearly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite missing six free throws in the final 67 seconds, Indiana  
survived a late charge by Philadelphia for the second consecutive 
game and defeated the 76ers 85-82 Wednesday night to take a 2-0 
lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who led the NBA in free throw accuracy during the  
regular season, never touched the ball during that 67-second span. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to get the ball to Reggie in those situations, but if  
it's not available, you get it to someone else,'' Indiana coach 
Larry Bird said. ``Guys have to step up and make their shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana led 81-73 with 55.2 seconds to go after a basket by Dale  
Davis. After Philadelphia scored, Mark Jackson was fouled and 
missed two attempts with 40.9 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson redeemed himself by hitting two free throws with 32.9  
seconds left, giving Indiana an 83-77 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Snow cut Indiana's deficit to three by hitting a 3-pointer,  
and Indiana failed to lock up the victory as Derrick McKey and 
Jalen Rose each missed one of two from the line in the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in Game 1, the 76ers' full-court press in the final  
minute seemed to befuddle the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie's our best free throw shooter. They put two guys on  
him, double-teaming him. They weren't going to let him beat them,'' 
Davis said. ``And they were also being physical with him. We didn't 
want to try a risky pass just to get the ball to him and wind up 
turning it over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missed free throws down the stretch were unusual for the  
Pacers, who won the Central Division championship while leading the 
league in free throw accuracy at 79.6 percent. Miller led the 
league at 91.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Free throws are always real big down the stretch. This is  
uncharacteristic for us. We usually do a better job, especially 
Mark,'' Smits said. ``I don't remember him ever missing two in a 
row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers won with key contributions from several players.  
Smits scored 25 points, shooting 12-of-23 from the field. Miller 
scored 17, Dale Davis helped Indiana outrebound the 76ers 49-42 by 
pulling down 14 and Jackson had 14 assists while doing much of the 
defensive work against league scoring leader Allen Iverson, who 
scored 23 points but was 7-of-28 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very disturbing that we blew big leads two games in a  
row, but it was get to get two wins,'' Smits said. ``We seem to 
play well the first half and somehow the tone changes and we let 
things slip away.''

<HEADLINE> EU Hits Back at U.S. on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union accused the United States today  
of trashing scientific studies suggesting hormone-treated beef can 
cause cancer and of exaggerating U.S. losses from the EU ban on 
such meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says it will seek permission from the World  
Trade Organization on June 3 to impose $202 million in punitive 
tariffs on the EU for refusing to lift its ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States claims the EU has been uncooperative and  
unreasonable in negotiations to avert a trade war, but EU 
ambassador Roderick Abbott said the United States itself has shown 
little flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely angry when I read this kind of thing. I think  
this is designed for the domestic United States audience, but I 
hope you won't be misled by this kind of rhetoric,'' Abbott told a 
news conference at the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe claims some of the hormones may cause cancer and has  
banned their use by domestic producers. But officials say they will 
need until at least the end of the year to complete scientific 
studies to justify their actions according to WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 350 million consumers who want to be sure that this  
beef is okay. They have as much right to be heard and to have their 
views taken into account as the United States cattlemen,'' Abbott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said the EU would not dispute Washington's request but  
would argue the losses incurred by U.S. beef producers represent 
``less than half'' $202 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the United States of not taking enough notice of  
European scientific research indicating a link between hormones and 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have noted that the American side more or less trashed our  
recent studies before they even had looked at them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the plan for retaliation last week, U.S. Trade  
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said all other possibilities had 
been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take this course as a last resort. The EU should meet its  
WTO obligations. ... To do anything less is to jeopardize the 
credibility and integrity of the WTO,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Opens Sculpture Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's been 33 years in the making, but a  
sculpture garden first proposed when Lyndon Johnson was president 
was finally dedicated today, its 17 works of modern art promising a 
tree-shaded respite for museum-fatigued tourists on the National 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	The garden ``makes a powerful statement that art should be  
accessible to all people,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said at the 
dedication of the garden, which opens to the public Sunday at the 
height of tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s' Johnson administration plans to lay out the garden  
for the National Gallery of Art were abandoned long ago, after a 
circular pond that doubles as a wintertime skating rink was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``The skating rink was put in first, but then someone thought it  
wasn't dignified to combine art with a skating rink, and we 
couldn't get money from Congress to do the garden,'' said J. Carter 
Brown, chairman of Washington's Fine Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of delay, the garden was built by a $10 million  
grant from the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, a 
Washington philanthropy that is also buying seven of the 10 new 
works to be exhibited. Other sculptures will come from the 
gallery's present collection or from private donations. Taxpayer 
money will go to operate and maintain the garden, as it does for 
the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's current chairman, Calvin Cafritz, said his late  
parents would get ``great joy'' from seeing their 
great-grandchildren and other children ``romp through the garden'' 
and gawk at a huge, spindly spider sculpture that lurks between the 
trees in one corner. 
</P>
<P>
	New parks these days often are short on trees and shrubs, and  
even short on flowers because vandals tear them up and they are 
expensive to maintain, said Laurie D. Olin, who supervised the 
garden's landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``the National Gallery can do things right.''  
</P>
<P>
	The garden, which covers two city blocks just west of the  
gallery, has plenty of trees, shrubs and flowers, 45-foot cedars to 
pale pink geraniums in front of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no ``Keep Off the Grass'' signs, but five security  
guards will patrol the two-block area during museum hours. They 
also will have to keep visiting kids informed about which of the 17 
sculptures can or cannot be handled. No hanging from the legs of 
Louise Bourgeois' 24-foot bronze spider, for instance, and no 
climbing Sol LeWitt's ``Four-Sided Pyramid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits will change from time to time but will be limited to  
20th-century and 21st-century work. The works at today's opening 
range from Roy Lichtenstein's ``House I,'' in the same comic-strip 
style as his paintings, to 30 three-foot bronze statues by Polish 
sculptor Magdalena Abakanowicz. Titled ``Puellae'' -- Latin for 
``Girls'' -- they refer to Polish children who froze to death in 
cattle cars during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	The circular pool, newly enlarged, occupies the middle of the  
garden, with arching sprays of water. In the winter, the fountain 
will be turned off and new ice-making equipment will transform the 
pool into the skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-story, glass enclosed pavilion with indoor and outdoor  
seating will open in the fall as a cafe and full-service 
restaurant.

<HEADLINE> Few OK Tax Money for Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not only are fewer Americans voting, but they  
also are declining to use their tax dollars to help pay for 
presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: For the first time since federal financing of  
presidential elections began after the Watergate scandal, 
candidates will have to wait until the year after the election to 
get their full matching dollars, the Federal Election Commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Political observers say Americans are turned off by negative  
campaigning, so they stay home on Election Day and refuse to check 
the campaign financing box on their income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, people have been increasingly turned off from  
American politics,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the nonpartisan 
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. ``They're not 
anxious to pay for the types of campaigns that we're running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 13 percent of taxpayers in 1996, the latest year for which  
complete figures are available, agreed to earmark $3 of their taxes 
to the presidential election campaign fund. Preliminary figures for 
1997 and 1998 indicate the percentage is staying the same or even 
lower. In comparison, 29 percent checked the box in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, there will not be enough money to cover all the  
political expenses from next year's presidential election until the 
2000 income tax returns are filed in April 2001. Presidential 
candidates will get only about a third of the federal aid they are 
entitled to on Jan. 1, when the first matching funds are handed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC expects eventually to have to pay out $99 million in  
federal matching funds to candidates running in 2000, up from $59 
million in 1996. Each candidate can receive a maximum of $16.75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates become eligible for matching funds by raising at  
least $5,000 in 20 different states from individuals contributing 
no more than $250. In exchange, candidates agree to limit spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, the FEC must set aside money to pay the costs of the  
Democratic, Republican and Reform party nominating conventions, and 
the amounts required for general election candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Only then can the FEC begin making payments to the Democratic  
and Republican primary candidates. Under the law, the government 
fund matches dollar for dollar the first $250 of each individual 
contribution a qualified presidential primary candidate receives. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a similar shortfall meant that presidential candidates  
received 60 percent of their money on Jan. 1 and the rest after 
April's tax-return filings. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who sought the GOP  
presidential nomination in 1996 and is running again in 2000, said 
candidates borrowed money to make up the difference and then paid 
it off once with they got their matching funds. He said he expected 
to do the same again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a problem,'' Alexander said Wednesday. ``I assume it  
will be the same thing this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the percentage of Americans checking off the box on their  
tax returns has been in a steady decline, the maximum amount of 
federal dollars that candidates can qualify for continues to be 
adjusted upwards for inflation under a complex formula set up by 
the law that first created public financing for campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC annually recommends that the checkoff amount also be  
allowed to increase with inflation, but the requests have fallen on 
deaf ears in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the FEC on Thursday was to consider a staff  
recommendation that could make it easier for campaigns to raise 
money. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IRL Reponds To Fatal Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Open-wheel racing's latest fatal spectator  
accident is prompting the Indy Racing League to require wheel 
tether systems and a top promoter to raise the height of safety 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting at next week's Indianapolis 500, the IRL will make its  
teams use restraining cables designed to keep wheels from snapping 
free from the vehicles on impact, The Associated Press learned 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL's largest promoter, Speedway Motorsports Inc., also  
announced plans to upgrade the safety fences at its tracks to make 
them higher than at any other speedways in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The company owns the tracks at which five of the 11 IRL races  
are staged, including Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte, where 
three spectators were killed and eight injured by a flying wheel 
and suspension parts during a race May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL officials declined to confirm their intentions to require  
teams to use cables to restrain wheel and suspension assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
	But three authorities in the open-wheel racing industry,  
speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the AP that the IRL 
plans to announce the tether rule in the coming days, and put it 
into effect for the 500. The May 30 race at Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway is the first IRL event since the Charlotte accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL teams are to test the new restraining cables during  
Carburetion Day on May 27, the final scheduled practice session 
before the 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One began requiring its teams to use tether systems at  
the start of the 1999 season. CART, the world's other major 
open-wheel circuit, announced a similar mandate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tethers have come under fire from some industry authorities who  
say the restraints can yank wheels back toward the car, putting the 
driver in greater danger. Tethers that snap free also can 
accelerate the already high speeds at which many wheels fly away 
from vehicles during crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Charlotte wreck represented the second time in nine  
months that spectators at major open-wheel races in the United 
States were killed by wheels and debris that flew over safety 
fences and into the grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	The fences at most of SMI's properties where IRL races are  
staged currently stand 15 feet high and are topped with 3-foot-long 
overhangs. The company said fences in front of spectator viewing 
areas will be raised to 21 feet and topped with 6-foot-long 
overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is completely overbuilt, but we just don't want this to  
happen again,'' SMI president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler said. ``We 
want to make sure that we're going down the right path with this 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not determined exactly how high the wheel  
flew to clear Charlotte's safety fence. But Wheeler said based on 
the evidence available to investigators, it would have been 
unlikely the wheel could get past the new fence and its arched 
overhang. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI plans to spend about $1 million to upgrade its safety  
fences, starting with about 4,000 feet protecting grandstands at 
Texas Motor Speedway. The track in suburban Dallas is the next SMI 
venue on the IRL schedule. Wheeler said the upgrades should be 
finished for the Longhorn 500 on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI also plans to upgrade the safety fences at its tracks in  
Atlanta and Las Vegas, both of which are scheduled for IRL races 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	An 800-foot section of fence along Charlotte's fourth turn where  
the fatal accident began is to be upgraded in time for the 
Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR Winston Cup race on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying wheels and other parts usually aren't a major problem  
with the heavier, slower and sturdier Winston Cup cars. But Wheeler 
said SMI still wanted to upgrade Charlotte's fourth-turn fence to 
ease fans' concern about the IRL wreck, which produced the first 
spectator fatalities in the track's 40-year history.

<HEADLINE> Woman Counseled on Her Right To Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Hospital workers today were counseling a  
paralyzed woman -- who allegedly was shot by her mother -- to 
determine that she was certain of her decision to have life support 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgette Smith, 42, was still planning to have her ventilator  
removed shortly after 5 p.m., a move that could lead to murder 
charges against her mother, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith on Tuesday won a court order granting her wish.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to carry out the court order unless there would be  
a change in the patient's request,'' said Lisa Schultz, spokeswoman 
for Lucerne Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said that if Ms. Smith dies, her 68-year-old  
mother, Shirley Egan, could be charged with murder. She already is 
charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Smith has made a difficult choice, a choice which she has  
the right to make,'' Judge Richard Conrad ruled after visiting her 
in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan, a frail woman who is blind in one eye, allegedly shot  
her daughter in March when she learned Ms. Smith planned to put her 
in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet struck Ms. Smith in the neck, tearing through her  
spinal cord. It left her paralyzed from the neck down, unable to 
speak without effort, incapable of swallowing and with no control 
of her bladder. She is fed through a tube and runs a high risk of 
pneumonia, infections, ulcers and bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is wink my eyes and wiggle my nose, wiggle my  
tongue. I can't move any other part of my body,'' she said in a 
deposition. ``I can't live like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's daughters, 22-year-old Candace Smith and 19-year-old  
Joeleen Hill, supported their mother's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's lawyer, Bob Wesley, objected to the request to end  
life support because of the state's plan to pursue murder charges. 
However, he told the judge ``Ms. Egan does not want to see her 
daughter suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Ms. Smith had one last request before she dies:  
She asked to be an organ donor.

<HEADLINE> Mourning Wins Defensive Player Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For Alonzo Mourning, being named NBA Defensive  
Player of the Year isn't much of a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat center was a lopsided choice for the honor three  
days after his team's season ended against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning smiled when discussing the award at a news conference  
Wednesday, but he couldn't muster much enthusiasm upon learning of 
the honor Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's great,'' he said. ``Can I trade it in to be playing  
Atlanta?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it's the Knicks against Atlanta, while Mourning settles  
for the most prestigious trophy of his seven-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those individual awards just sit on my mantelpiece and collect  
dust,'' he said. ``I'd trade all that bleep to be playing now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning received 89 of a possible 118 votes in balloting by a  
panel of sports writers and broadcasters from the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo, winner of the defensive award three  
of the previous four seasons, was second with 10 votes. Seattle's 
Gary Payton, who won it in 1995-96, was third with six votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor, and one that I feel is deserved,''  
Mourning said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, 29, had the best year in his career, anchoring a  
defense that allowed 84 points per game, second-lowest in the 
league. The 6-foot-10 center led the NBA in blocked shots with 3.9 
per game, blocking at least six shots 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning also averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds while shooting  
.511 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Against New York, Mourning had by far the best series of any  
Miami player, averaging 21 points, eight rebounds and three blocked 
shots. Just as important, he kept his notorious temper in check 
during the rugged series, but the Heat lost the series against 
their bitter rivals 3-2 on Allan Houston's last-second basket in 
Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shot ourselves in the foot,'' Mourning said. ``By far we're  
a better team than they are. It's not like they annihilated us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning has been endorsed for the league's most valuable player  
award by teammates and opponents, including coaches Jeff Van Gundy, 
Chuck Daly, Alvin Gentry and Tim Floyd, and such players as Patrick 
Ewing, Penny Hardaway and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't get it, there's something wrong with you all who  
vote,'' Ewing said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The MVP award will be announced during the NBA conference  
finals.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged in Gas Station Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The fatal beating of a black electrician  
allegedly at the hands of two Arab gas station clerks has revealed 
racial hostilities and prompted the formation of a task force to 
ease the tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadhel Mazeb, 46, and Adel Altam, 26, are charged with  
second-degree murder in the death of Kalvin Porter, 34, who lived 
two blocks from the Sunoco station where the defendants worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's death on Friday has led to nightly protests,  
</P>
<P>
	``The African-American community has too long been the victim of  
mistreatment and disrespect by some who operate and work in stores 
and gas stations in our neighborhood,'' said the Rev. Wendell 
Anthony, president of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Porter's death is a tragic example of festering problems  
of ill will and ill feelings between African-Americans and some 
Arab-Chaldean store operators,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
will monitor the case to ensure that justice prevails, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An interpreter read the charges Monday against Mazeb and Altam,  
both immigrants from Yemen. The defendants, who were not 
represented by an attorney, pleaded innocent and remain in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter got into a fight with the men after one made an  
inappropriate remark to his 12-year-old stepdaughter, police said. 
They are accused of using a tire iron to beat Porter to death in 
front of his children. If convicted, they face life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole incident is very tragic to say the least. Our goal  
is to try to restore peace and tranquility as soon as possible,'' 
said Edward Deeb, an Arab-American community leader who helped 
organize the Crisis Intervention Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force hopes to hold a community forum soon where blacks  
and Arab-Americans can discuss Porter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan is home to more than 200,000 Arab-Americans, who began  
to dominate the grocery store, liquor store and gas station 
business in Detroit when many white business owners left after the 
city's 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are basic economic differences between many blacks and  
Arab-American store owners, resident Rod Scott said. Blacks make up 
80 percent of Detroit's population. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a situation like the Ku Klux Klan, where whites  
hate blacks just because of who they are,'' he said. ``A lot of the 
animosity stems from inequity. That's the undercurrent to a lot of 
these incidents. Look around -- how many black-owned grocery stores 
do you see?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jalil Saad, owner of a Detroit Mobil station, said business  
owners should train their employees to be culturally sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We teach our employees to interact with the customers and to  
get to know them on a personal level,'' Saad said. ``We greet them 
with a smile when they walk in and say `goodbye' when they leave.''

</P>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Record producer Bruce  
Fairbairn, who started as a musician and went on to produce some of 
rock's most successful acts, was found dead Monday. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	Fairbairn's portfolio included Aerosmith, AC/DC, Van Halen,  
Kiss, Cranberries, Loverboy and Bon Jovi. He produced Kiss' 
``Psycho Circus'' album last year, which returned the reunited 
veteran hard rock band to the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairbairn got his start in the `60s as a trumpet player in local  
rhythm and blues bands. His first serious recording band was called 
Sunshyne. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience led to the formation of the hitmaking Prism in  
the 1970s with Fairbairn as trumpet player and producer.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Alfredo Dias Gomes, author of some of  
Brazil's best soap operas and the screenplay for the only Brazilian 
film to win the Cannes Film Festival's top award, died Tuesday in a 
car crash. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Dias Gomes wrote the screen play for ``O Pagador de Promessas''  
(The Payer of Vows), which in 1962 won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes 
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best known of his several highly popular soap operas  
was ``Roque Santeiro,'' which was banned by the country's military 
regime in the 1970s because it painted an unflattering picture of 
an army colonel.
