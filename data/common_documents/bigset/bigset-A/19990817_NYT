OFFICER IN LOUIMA CASE REPEATS STATEMENT EXONERATING 2ND OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justin Volpe, who pleaded guilty in May to torturing
Abner Louima in a Brooklyn police station, has told federal
authorities that the second police officer who was convicted of
taking part in the attack had not, in fact, done so, Volpe's lawyer
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Volpe directly told the federal
officials that the officer convicted of helping him, Charles
Schwarz, was not the officer present in the station house bathroom.
Schwarz was convicted of holding Louima down while Volpe jammed a
stick into the victim's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe told the federal officials that the second officer in the
bathroom was Thomas Wiese. But he did not accuse Wiese of assisting
in the attack. Rather, Volpe said, Wiese had stood by the door and
``saw what was going on and did nothing to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe also said in the statement to the federal officials that
it was Wiese, not Schwarz, who called him at home two days after
Louima was attacked to speak with him about what had happened in
the encounter with Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that the early morning call, which had been
made from a pay phone near the 70th Precinct station house and had
been charged to Schwarz's calling card, had been made by Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   They held that Schwarz wanted to tell Volpe that Police
Department investigators were ``on to them'' because investigators
had arrived at the station to look into the attack on Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schwarz's trial lawyer, Stephen C. Worth, had noted to
the jury that ``Schwarz and Wiese were together when that call was
made,'' suggesting that Wiese could have made it, two jurors later
were quoted as saying that they believed Schwarz had made it and
that the call helped convince them that Schwarz was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe previously made the assertion exonerating Schwarz to
prosecutors and the news media while speaking through his lawyer,
Marvyn Kornberg. Volpe's statement to the federal officials was
first reported Monday in The New York Post, and Kornberg confirmed
it Monday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg declined to identify the officials to whom Volpe had
given his account, but other people involved in the case say he
made the statement to federal probation officers who were preparing
a pre-sentencing report on Volpe for Judge Eugene Nickerson. The
judge is tentatively expected to sentence Volpe on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   No sentencing date has been set for Schwarz, who plans to appeal
his conviction and denies the accusation at the center of his
conviction _ that he held Louima down while Volpe brutalized him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schwarz's lawyer argued at the trial, Schwarz was not
even in the 70th Precinct station house bathroom, where the attack
occurred after Louima was arrested in a street melee in August
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Schwarz, who were dismissed from the police force
after the trial ended in June and who are in jail awaiting
sentencing, face sentences of up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which
prosecuted the case, said the office would have no comment on
Volpe's statement to the probation officers. But the office
previously fought attempts by Schwarz's lawyer to have Schwarz's
conviction dismissed on motions based in part on the Volpe account
exonerating Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, Nickerson sided with the prosecution and upheld the
conviction, saying that the part of the dismissal motion based on
Volpe's account ``to put it charitably, lacks merit.''
</P>
<P>
   While pleading guilty in midtrial in May, Volpe said that a
second officer was present in the bathroom and had not done
anything to stop the attack, though at that time he did not
identify the officer as Wiese.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was considered likely that he was referring to Wiese
because court records show that Wiese told investigators in the
days after Louima was brutalized that he had walked into the
bathroom while Volpe and Louima were in there but had not seen the
attack with the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese was not charged with participating in that attack but was
charged with beating Louima in a police car as he was taken to the
station house. He was also charged with being part of an overall
conspiracy count that cited both the attacks in the bathroom and
the police car. He was acquitted on all charges. His lawyer, Joseph
Tacopina, said the acquittal on the conspiracy charge would protect
his client from any new prosecution stemming from the torture in
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Worth, was out of the country Monday and could not be reached
for comment on Volpe's statement. But a new lawyer Schwarz's family
has hired to handle the appeal, Ronald Fischetti, said it was ``too
early'' to discuss the appeal and suggested he would use Volpe's
account.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Volpe also apologized to Louima and ``all the
people in this city'' and said that after using the stick on Louima
he ``could not believe'' what he had done. At the same time, he
maintained that Louima had provoked him by repeatedly cursing him
in the station house bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Louima testified at the trial that the driver of the police car
that took him to the station house _ Schwarz, according to police
records _ restrained him while Volpe tortured him with the stick.
Two other officers testified they had seen Schwarz walk Louima, his
pants down, toward the bathroom. Worth argued that Louima and one
of those two officers had lied and that the second officer's
testimony was inconclusive.

 &HT;    5 homers for Braves in 14-6 win
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ They may have entered Monday night knotted in a
first-place tie in the National League East, but the Braves have
something the Mets don't. Four games in Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves teed off on Bobby Jones for seven runs in the first
three innings, and it proved a suitable cushion for Greg Maddux to
collect his fifth consecutive win and for the Braves to take a 14-6
win in another wild one in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who gave up 12 hits and two homers along the way, owed
his batterymate Eddie Perez for a pair of two-run home runs,
matching his career-high with four RBIs. The second homer stretched
a tentative 8-5 Coors Field lead to 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, moving from the NL West fourth-place Dodgers to the
fifth-place Rockies, opened this four-game series with their ninth
win in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching is no picnic here, but Maddux has found a way to
survive in the thin air throughout his career. He entered the game
5-0 in Colorado _ 2-0 in Coors Field and 3-0 at Mile High Stadium.
Maddux, who was on deck before he was on the mound in this game,
took a 5-0 lead and held on for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   He'd allowed double-digit hits by the fifth inning, stretching
that career-high mark to nine times on the season in which he's
allowed 10 or more hits. Two were home runs _ one to Henry Blanco,
which broke his 0-for-24 spell in the third inning, and one to
Dante Bichette, who sent a two-run homer off the top of the center
field wall to cut the Braves lead to 7-5 in the fifth inning. That
was a five-run comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves puffed themselves up with a five-run first inning,
all after Jones had gotten himself two outs against the first two
batters. Chipper Jones started the rally with a walk, which was
followed by three consecutive singles. Brian Hunter then smashed
his fifth home run of the year, second at Coors Field, with a
426-foot shot down the left field line.
</P>
<P>
   Perez lined out to end the inning but came back with a home run
of his own _ a two-run shot _ in his next at-bat to give the Braves
a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez added a homer in the eighth, as did Gerald
Williams in the ninth, for Atlanta.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since the first days of her house-hunting tour
through the hamlets of Westchester County, N.Y., Hillary Rodham
Clinton has worried that she and her husband may not be able to
afford the seven-figure showplace homes they have inspected.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are the least affluent couple to occupy the White
House since Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter lived there 20 years ago.
They have not owned their own home since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time they are viewing million-dollar-plus houses,
President and Mrs. Clinton are also deep in debt. They owe a
battery of lawyers $5.5 million, a sum that far exceeds their net
worth of approximately $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clintons are weighing whether to place bids on
Westchester properties, the administrators of the Clinton Legal
Expense Trust are mailing out new appeals for donations and are
expressing concern that they will not be able to erase the
Clintons' debt before the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an analysis of the Clintons' finances shows that the first
family can still afford to purchase a property in the price range
of the ones they toured on Sunday, from a seven-bedroom, $1.7
million house in Edgemont, N.Y., to a 4.14-acre property in Rye
Brook, N.Y., that is listed at $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clintons make a 20 percent down payment of $440,000 on a
$2.2 million house, a 30-year mortgage, at a fixed rate of 8.75
percent, would mean their monthly payment would be $13,845, said
Seth Cohen, the managing director of Home Mortgage Acceptance Corp.
in Manhattan. Cohen estimated that the Clintons would also owe
about $25,000 a year in property taxes and about $500 a month on
insurance. ``That comes to a monthly nut of about $16,645,'' Cohen
said. He said that the Clintons would need to earn about $525,000 a
year to qualify for that particular mortgage. Based on the
Clintons' 1998 income, the couple would qualify now for such a
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   One possible way that the Clintons could meet a high monthly
mortgage payment, before they left the White House, would be to
sell $150,000 or $200,000 worth of securities and keep the money in
an interest-bearing checking account, supporters said. Each month,
the couple could write a check drawn on that account to meet the
high monthly payments until the president's term expires and he
begins to earn a higher income.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters said Monday that the Clintons had not
decided whether to buy or rent a home, but they seemed to be
leaning toward making an offer and applying for, as one friend
described it, ``a super-jumbo mortgage.'' And it appears that banks
and mortgage lenders would be willing to lend them a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton wins election to the Senate from New York in
November 2000, her annual income will be $129,619, or 35 percent
less than the president's current $200,000 annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves office in January 2001, Clinton could become his
family's predominant bread-winner for the first time since the
early 1980s. His friends say he has strong potential to earn
millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements and,
possibly, serving on corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do great,'' said James Carville, a political strategist
and a close friend of the Clintons. ``His book advance alone will
be enough to pay off the balance of a large mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former presidents, including Gerald Ford, have served on
corporate boards. Former President Carter has done well as an
author. Former Presidents Reagan and Bush have earned high speaking
fees abroad, including a $2 million fee paid to Reagan by a
Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton loses or abandons her bid for the Senate, she,
too, would likely be in demand. She has already written a best
seller and several publishing executives have said they think her
memoirs could fetch more than the president's. Corporations would
likely compete for her service on their boards.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage experts say that a couple with an annual income of
$500,000 can easily qualify for a mortgage for a home costing $2
million. Of course, most couples do not have the Clintons' legal
debts, but then those who have such debts do not have a legal
defense fund raising contributions to erase it. But mortgage
experts said that most lenders will not penalize the Clintons for
their enormous debts unless a civil lawsuit was filed to recover
it, a possibility that is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to do 80 percent financing on a $2.2 million
house, there will be banks lining up to offer the Clintons a
mortgage, as long as there are no judgments or liens filed against
them,'' said Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage Co., a
broker for luxury homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohn said that banks would certainly also consider Clinton's
future earning potential after he leaves office. ``They'll be more
than willing to gamble on his ability to earn solid income because
of who he is,'' Ms. Cohn said. ``And they won't hold it against him
that he is about to become unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons estimated their net worth to fall somewhere between
$1.2 million to $5.57 million in their most recent annual financial
disclosure form released in May. The biggest chunk _ worth more
than $1 million but less than $5 million _ came from a blind trust
of securities held in Mrs. Clinton's name. The forms require only a
range of figures rather than precise numbers, but White House aides
said that the trust was worth slightly more than $1 million. Thanks
to the bull market, the blind trust's value has grown substantially
in the past five years, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' adjusted 1998 gross income of $504,109 came from
the $200,000 salary Clinton receives as president and $200,318 from
securities from a blind trust they sold shortly before they paid
$850,000 to settle the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit
against Clinton. They reported a $5,236 deduction for
self-employment, as well as $16,665 in taxable interest, $16,736 in
dividends, $1,329 in a state income tax refund from Arkansas and
$74,289 in royalties from Mrs. Clinton's best-selling book, ``It
Takes A Village.'' In Clinton's years in the White House, the
family's adjusted gross income on their federal income tax forms
ranged from a high of $1.065 million in 1996 to a low of $263,900
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton herself has worried aloud about whether a
multimillion-dollar home is within her family's reach. She
pronounced a $3.8 million house beyond her family's price range.
``If I can afford it, I'd buy,'' the first lady told reporters last
month, ``but I probably will end up renting.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, friends say the Clintons have felt more
confident about making an offer on a home because of the
expectation that the president will soon be earning a much larger
income.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Clinton was one of the lowest-paid governors in
the nation, earning $35,000 a year, while Mrs. Clinton pulled down
a six-figure income as a partner at the Rose Law Firm, one of
Little Rock's most profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Worry over the magnitude of their legal debt has also receded.
``It's not like a Mastercard,'' Carville said of the still-unpaid
legal fees. ``There's no interest, and the lawyers are not going to
sue the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clintons' unpaid legal fees are substantial, and they
continue to escalate, even now as Kenneth Starr nears the
conclusion of his five-year-old inquiry. According to their 1998
disclosure report, the Clintons reported owing $1 million each to
the Washington law firms of Williams &AMP; Connolly and Skadden, Arps,
Slater, Meagher &AMP; Flom. The Clintons also reported owing $100,000
to $250,000 to the Little Rock, Ark., firm of Wright, Lindsey &AMP;
Jennings and $250,000 to $500,000 to Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt. The
Clintons' legal defense fund, which can go only to pay certified
legal bills, has already paid $5 million to their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, friends say, the Clintons had to sell more of
their securities to help pay the $850,000 settlement to Paula
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than half of the settlement, $475,000, came from
an insurance policy against civil liability that the president held
with Chubb Group Insurance. Most, if not all, of the remainder was
withdrawn from the blind trust held in Mrs. Clinton's name. A White
House official said that although both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton held
blind trusts in separate names, they were, in effect, joint
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and friends said they did not know how much those costs
reduced the first family's net worth. More recently, a federal
judge in Little Rock ordered the president to pay $90,000 for a
contempt of court fine for Clinton's misleading answers in a
deposition in the Jones lawsuit. Friends said they did not know how
the Clintons' have paid that fine.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with the cash for a down payment, the Clintons could
sell a portion of their blind trusts. In addition to Mrs. Clinton's
blind trust, the president has a blind trust estimated to be worth
$100,000 to $250,000, his disclosure report says. But most mortgage
brokers said that the Clintons would not be required to put down a
large down payment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several close friends of the Clintons' discussed the
possibility of buying a home for the first family, and leasing it
to them, an arrangement similar to one made by friends of the
Reagans when they retired to a $2.5 million ranch-style house in
Bel Air, Calif. ``We talked about it pretty seriously,'' said one
friend, who insisted on anonymity. ``But with Hillary's run for the
Senate, it's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Strict Senate gift rules would make it impossible for Mrs.
Clinton, if she wins the New York Senate seat in November 2000, to
accept gifts of more than $50. Federal ethics rules would also
prevent lawyers from forgiving the debt owed by the Clintons,
because such a move would constitute an impermissible gift to a
federal officeholder.

OH, WHAT A TANGLED WEB ATHLETES WEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe the Seahawks should give Joey Galloway want he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   The reason to suggest such blasphemy has nothing to do with how
lackluster and undangerous the Seahawks offense looked during the
Hawks' first preseason game Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Without the speedster receiver, the Seahawks were about as
flamboyant as Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Galloway might deserve a few style points is because
unlike other sports stars who have used Internet Web sites to
negotiate contracts, rabble-rouse fans, tweak the media and/or
clarify their no doubt justified economic positions, Galloway has
been wondrously silent.
</P>
<P>
   Not a peep out of Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   All silent on the Buckeye front.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. Run a search on your Lycos, Altavista, AOL, MSN or
Yahoo! engine. You won't find a Joey Galloway official Web site on
which Galloway pleads for peace, love and understanding on this
maybe-backfiring training camp holdout. At least I didn't find a
Galloway site.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a few kudos to the publicity reluctant Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to ask for the sun and the moon and a $12
million signing bonus, it's better to shut up, sit tight and wait
rather than attempt to appeal to the celebrity-pandering tendencies
of the populous by filling your Web site with junk.
</P>
<P>
   (Meanwhile, Mike Holmgren and the Seahawks appear to be making
an example of Galloway, since the team is still quite comfy with
its $35 million offer, thank you very much.)
</P>
<P>
   But as for the state of star player tactics on the cusp of the
millennium, Web site grandstanding was exactly the course of action
taken up recently by Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   His Dirty Bird apparently flies in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Falcons finally did settle a new deal with
Anderson. But during his holdout, the running back did seriously
escalate the level of insidiousness in big-business sports
negotiating _ a feat he accomplished with fan-bating journal
entries on his official Web site, wherein he asked fans to
understand his position by clarifying inaccuracies from the
Falcons, newspapers, TV or radio.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Anderson invented the inventive use of athlete Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Baltimore slugger Albert Belle raised the bar on
ingenious cyber-communication this summer. On his Athlete Direct
site, Belle started offering not only his insights on baseball
(Bird's Eye View) but is also posting investing tips (Bank on
Belle) and inviting visitors to challenge themselves to beat Belle
(Big Belle Puzzle) during a crossword puzzle competition.
</P>
<P>
   There were even an uproarious few days when Belle, who routinely
refuses to speak with the media, tweaked reporters with comments he
posted on his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``And speaking of the news,'' Belle wrote, ``I'm going to have
fun with the Baltimore media. It seems whatever I do invokes an
article. I put up a sign to joke about our trip to Rochester (N.Y.)
game that was meant only to get a laugh from the players and the
media `ran with it.' ... In case you're wondering what's next,
(here are) future signs on my locker: `Albert Belle to go out for
the Ravens,''' Belle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the media visit my site routinely, but I still have
yet to receive a media request online. Guess we'll have to wait and
see,'' Belle wrote _ with some obvious delight.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a way for some of sports' great misunderstood
athletes to tell their versions of the truth, Belle has been a
league leader.
</P>
<P>
   But while Belle was just joking about trying out for the Ravens,
Barry Sanders was serious about not playing for the Lions _ a story
whose confirmation came in cyberspace on the Wichita Eagle's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The story of the future Hall of Fame running
back's surprise retirement at age 31 was played out in a big way in
cyberspace through the Kansas daily's site.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the story about Sanders is that he not only abruptly
and curiously has retired from the NFL, but that he posted his
retirement notice on the Web before first officially notifying the
Lions, the NFL or the national media.
</P>
<P>
   This not exactly the case. It wasn't the publicity-shy Sanders
who posted the news of his decision (which is still apparently
final) but on July 28, Sanders did authorize the newspaper in his
home town to release his retirement statement on its Web site
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually got feedback from our reporters that people in
Detroit were insisting that this (retirement statement) should have
been shared,'' said Sherry Johnson, sports editor of the Wichita
Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have seen several stories since then that have referred
to the fact that Barry's retirement statement was first posted on
the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe Sanders is merely on the cutting edge of
employee-employer relations. Maybe he _ like Belle and Anderson and
the hundreds of other star athletes who are more comfortable
communicating in cyberspace _ are the quintessential products of
our time.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows, maybe Galloway's official site is about to be
posted for all of the Seahawks front office to read.

NEW YORK SEES THE OLD CLEMENS AS YANKS SHUT DOWN TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That was Roger Clemens excitedly patting his right
hand against his glove several times after Derek Jeter started and
completed a nifty double play. That was the same Clemens creeping
toward second base and waving his right arm after Shane Spencer
threw out a runner. And that was also the animated Clemens pumping
his right fist three times when Jorge Posada erased a Twins runner
trying to swipe second base.
</P>
<P>
   Stoicism took a vacation Monday night at Yankee Stadium. It
might have seemed like an ordinary weeknight game against the
terrible Twins, but not to Clemens. Every start is a test now, a
chance for Clemens to show the Yankees there is some power in his
right arm. Every start is a chance for Clemens to help everyone
forget the last four months and shift the focus to the next two.
</P>
<P>
   So Clemens reacted as if the calendar read October, not August,
on a night when there was much to express himself about. The
five-time Cy Young award winner was searching for his old magic and
Eric Milton was searching for redemption against the team that
traded him. Both pitchers came close to getting what they wanted,
with Clemens winning the taut duel, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tremendous performance by Clemens, who faced only 27
batters in missing a complete game by one out. When Clemens was
replaced by Mariano Rivera with two out in the ninth inning after a
single by Marty Cordova, he received a prolonged standing ovation
from the fans, many of whom have booed the underachieving
right-hander heavily this season.
</P>
<P>
   As he neared the dugout, Clemens held up his glove and
acknowledged the applause for his four-hit effort. Rivera notched
the final out for his 33rd save.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, Milton and Clemens matched zeroes. Then
Milton walked Jorge Posada on a 3-2 pitch to begin the eighth, his
first walk of the game, Tino Martinez, who had two of the three
Yankee hits against Milton, followed with a single to right field
that made Posada the first player on either team to reach second
base.
</P>
<P>
   With a 1-2 count on Spencer, the left-handed Milton tried to
fool the right-handed batter with a 1-2 off-speed pitch. But
Spencer blooped the ball over shortstop Cristian Guzman for a
run-scoring single. Posada read the flight of the ball well from
second and never hesitated, even though Guzman came within a few
feet of catching it. As Spencer stood on first base, he turned to
the coach Jose Cardenal and simply said, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   After Milton's errant throw to first on a pickoff attempt
enabled the runners to advance to second and third, Scott Brosius
had a sacrifice fly to center field that gave Clemens a 2-0 edge.
</P>
<P>
   In this game, the two felt like 22. Over the first 8 2/3
innings, Clemens faced the minimum of 26 batters. He was nicked for
singles in the third, the fifth and the sixth and walked a batter
in the fourth, but two runners were wiped away on double plays, one
was nailed trying to turn a single into a double and the other was
eliminated trying to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had a sturdy fastball, an effective split-finger pitch
and excellent control, even if he only whiffed two in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But, while Clemens toyed with the Twins, Milton was even more
formidable against the team that traded him, plus three others,
plus $3 million for Chuck Knoblauch on Feb. 6, 1998. The Yankees
managed only Martinez's single in the third as Milton opposed 22
Yankees through seven innings. The 24-year old Milton was living up
to the pre-game hype that was supplied by Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see he's going to be a big-time left-hander,'' said
Torre, who added, ``You know he wants to come back and beat our
brains in. Everybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton did. He struck out Jeter twice and he whiffed Bernie
Williams, Paul O'Neill, Chili Davis and Posada. After Martinez
singled to open the third, Milton calmly retired the next three
batters and did not allow Martinez to budge an inch. The Yankees
were mesmerized by Milton's sneaky fastball, his nifty changeup and
a developing slider he learned a few months before New York traded
him.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the eventual return of Darryl Strawberry to the major
leagues and how that will impact the already crowded situation in
left field, the only compelling story for the Yankees from now
until the post-season is the Clemens watch. The Yankees are almost
sure to participate in the playoffs and, as they ponder how they
can be better in October, their thoughts focus on Clemens. He has
not been a dominant pitcher much of the season. He has been
average.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night, Clemens was 2-3 with a 5.51 earned run
average in his last eight starts. That is a long stretch of
ineffectiveness for anyone and it is particularly glaring for a
pitcher who holds the American League record by winning 20 straight
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's groping at this point,'' said Torre. ``He wants
the results the way he wants them. His stuff has been good. The
velocity has been good, but the splitter has been inconsistent. I
think part of the problem is emotional. He hasn't done as well as
he expects to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Clemens did.

 M's WALK AWAY WITH VICTORY; A-ROD HOMERS IN FIFTH STRAIGHT GAME  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In a game of Canadian monopoly, Mariners hitters
turned over the free pass card 10 times. Their next move was
automatic: Go directly to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a three-game series Monday night at SkyDome, the
Mariners fused uncharacteristic wildness by Toronto's young ace,
Chris Carpenter, with routine stinginess by their own seasoned
leader, Jamie Moyer, and went on to claim a 7-5 win.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter walked nine batters, giving him a share of the club
record for this type of mound frustration. He walked two of the
first four batters he faced. He walked three of his last four. He
walked David Bell three times. He served up two bases-loaded walks.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this all made for a long walk from the mound to
the dugout when the 6-foot-6 right-hander had agonized enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I walked nine guys in a game, I might retire,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Walks were not the only story in this game, it just seemed like
it. There also was the familiar home run trot of Alex Rodriguez,
his fifth in five games, leaving him with 32 homers. And then there
was an all-out sprint by Ken Griffey Jr., who beat out a throw,
brought in a run and allowed the Mariners to score three times in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners' momentum all started with Carpenter (10-6).
And it could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He loaded the bases with one out in the first inning on two
walks and a single, and got out of it with a double-play grounder.
He left a runner on third in the second, two runners on in the
third. Through five innings, Carpenter had given up two hits and
trailed just 1-0. However, all he had done was prolong the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You weren't sure what you were going to get when you went up
there,'' said Mariners catcher Dan Wilson, responsible for the
game's first two runs with a sacrifice fly in the second and RBI
single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpenter threw the ball inconsistently well,'' Rodriguez
said. ``He was wild, but he got out of jams. He was like Houdini.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter normally averages a walk per every three innings.
Monday in the seventh, he outdid himself. He served up three,
including bases-loaded passes to Edgar Martinez and Ryan Jackson,
to fall behind 4-0 and get the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew what was going on, I wouldn't have walked nine guys,
I would have changed it,'' the New Hampshire native said. ``In that
last inning, I couldn't find the strike zone. The ump wasn't going
to give it to me. I don't expect him to when I'm all over the
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (12-6) was just the opposite. He had pinpoint control and
held the Blue Jays scoreless for six innings, scattering two
singles and a walk, with one runner erased by a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty made a hasty exit in the seventh only when a rare walk
(his second of the night) and a not-so-rare Russ Davis error led to
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm getting back on track,'' said Moyer, winning
for the fourth time in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wilson of his pitcher, ``That was awesome. Even in the
seventh inning, I thought he pitched well. He just got a couple of
tough breaks and a couple of bloopers fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   Up 4-3 and the game in the hands of the bullpen, the Mariners
pushed across three more runs in the eighth. With two outs and a
runner on third, Griffey hit a screecher to Blue Jays first baseman
Carlos Delgado, who had to dive to get it. With a Delgado toss
required, Griffey and reliever Graeme Lloyd hit the bag at the same
instance. Griffey got the call and his club got their fifth run.
</P>
<P>
   After a pitching change, Rodriguez hit John Frascatore's third
pitch into the second deck in left for a 7-3 lead. For those
keeping track, the Mariners shortstop now trails Griffey by just
four for the league lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just swinging well and have a nice stroke going,''
Rodriguez said, ``and I'm going to keep working on it and not be
content with what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Tom Davey, acquired from Toronto three weeks ago, was
called on in the ninth but put two runners on, requiring closer
Jose Mesa to clean up the mess. Mesa earned his 26th save, aided
greatly by left fielder Brian Hunter, whose throw to second caught
Toronto's Homer Bush rounding too far around the base for the
second out.

NEW WIRE SERVICE WILL BE DEVOTED TO FASHION  
 VISIONAIRE MAGAZINE IS PUBLISHING A SPINOFF 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So apparently novel is the concept of a wire service devoted to
fashion and similar fluff that when people call up Fashion Wire
Daily, they hesitate before saying, ``Fashion Wire Deli?'' or
``Fire Wire Daily?'' Confusion is understandable since the service,
which offers articles and photographs, mainly for newspapers, on
such subjects as the rage for pashmina shawls, opened for business
only last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Wire Daily was founded (with money from a private
investor) by Brandusa Niro, a former vice president at Ralph Lauren
with a background in magazines. She said she noticed a dearth of
good fashion and beauty articles by established wire services and
thought she could assemble a group of New York editors and
correspondents who could offer readers in Des Moines or Phoenix
something with _ how can one put it? _ more flair. Among those she
hired was Joe Dolce, the former editor of Details.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we contacted fashion editors around the country, we
asked, `What do you want?''' Ms. Niro said. ``They all said, `We
want celebrity and In Style magazine-type coverage, along with
practical fashion features.'''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a fashion wire service sounds good. For about $150 a
major daily can have a 700-word article about what's happening on
the New York runways or what color of lipstick Julia Roberts is
using. Ms. Niro said the plan is to build regular subscribers, who
will pay up to $24,000 a year for articles and photos, though
newspapers can also buy articles a la carte. She predicted it would
take about 300 regular users for the company to break even, adding
that last week it sold articles and pictures to nine newspapers,
including The Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   But is there that much demand for fashion outside New York?
``From what I've seen, it's too inside-fashion and East
Coast-centric,'' Susan Bischoff, an assistant managing editor of
The Houston Chronicle, said of the service. ``Also, the stuff
they're featuring is too pricey. It's for someone who's going to
spend a lot of money _ not someone whose entire back-to-school
clothing budget is $200.''
</P>
<P>
   Although The Chronicle devotes about 10 pages a week to fashion,
Ms. Bischoff pointed out that many other dailies have reduced their
fashion pages because retail advertisers have shifted to news
sections. ``Increasingly, local retailers have not liked the
direction of fashion coverage because it's too high-priced,'' Ms.
Bischoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Another editor who expressed doubts was Angela Shannon, who
covers fashion for The Charlotte (N.C) Observer. ``We try to
reflect what's going on in Charlotte, like what to wear to a
wedding,'' said Ms. Shannon, adding that her readers become irate
when she prints articles by someone else. ``They say, `Don't use
that wire stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niro is unfazed. ``All newspapers are looking for ways to
attract female readers and advertisers,'' she said. ``Well, we're
offering them a cheap and easy way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A VISIONAIRE SPINOFF
</P>
<P>
   The way Stephen Gan sees Visionaire's new spinoff, V, is like
Archie Bunker's idea of a delirious Saturday night. ``It's like 40
television screens put together,'' said Gan, an editor of both
publications. ``Each page reflects its own story.''
</P>
<P>
   V, which is printed on heavy stock and is folded in half like
the old Interview magazine, arrives on news stands Sept. 3. The
first issue, devoted to men's fashion, includes photographs by
Steven Klein, Miles Aldridge and the Dutch team of Inez Van
Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. Carine Roitfeld, the well-known
Gucci stylist, and David Bowie are among the contributors to the
magazine, which will be published six times annually and sell for
$5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that New York needed something that felt like an
underground magazine,'' Gan said. ``We wanted something that didn't
reek of the commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but V could do with a little more old-fashioned content.
The text, including an interview with the actor Jude Law, is a bit
skimpy. Gan, who is used to making statements with images in
Visionaire, a fashion insider's publication that sells for $150,
conceded that this was a short-coming. ``Well, text, as you know,
is very new to us,'' he said with a laugh.

EDITORIAL: THE NEW REPUBLICAN LANDSCAPE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Iowa straw poll, though it drew only 23,685 participants,
has jostled the Republican presidential field and clarified some
issues. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas remains the strong
front-runner, but after losing nearly seven out of 10 votes in the
poll he looks a little less invincible. Steve Forbes showed that he
could use his money effectively to undercut Bush. Elizabeth Dole
has regained some of the credibility she lost earlier in the year,
and Gary Bauer has emerged as the favorite of religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Though an artificial exercise, the straw poll winnowed the
crowded Republican roster. Monday Lamar Alexander, the former
Tennessee governor, dropped out of the race. Patrick Buchanan,
still the most crowd-pleasing speaker on the right, seemed closer
to leaving the Republican Party altogether. Former Vice President
Dan Quayle could muster only 916 votes despite what should have
been a major advantage in name recognition. He could be the next to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the accelerated primary schedule next year, the
nomination for both parties may well be locked up by March. That
leaves little time to churn through a full range of issues and
personalities. Bush's less-than-spectacular performance was of
interest, not simply because of the voting but because he delivered
a lackluster speech. He will almost certainly have to bring more
focus to issues in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Forbes have demonstrated the power of money. The
$2 million that Forbes was said to have spent translated into more
than $400 per voter. His showing in the straw poll most likely
insured that he will continue to pound away at Bush, indirectly
helping Mrs. Dole, who finished third. Sen. John McCain, who is
getting good notices on the road and stayed away from Iowa, may
also benefit.
</P>
<P>
   As for issues, Bush was attacked by conservatives for showing a
measure of tolerance on abortion and a moderate position on China.
There was not much heard about tax cuts, the centerpiece of the
Republican congressional agenda, and little was said about health
care. On Social Security, both Forbes and Bush said they favored
turning at least part of the system over to private investment or
savings accounts, a position that Democrats are certain to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right showed some strength in Iowa, though not
nearly as much as in years past. But Republicans who are trying to
move slightly away from the right wing remain respectful _ witness
Mrs. Dole's waffling when asked whether she believed in the theory
of evolution. Politics is interesting because it is unpredictable,
and this season just became a little more so. For now, it is worth
remembering that there are real divisions in the Republican Party,
and they are a little clearer today than they were before the
voting in Iowa.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleaders with their shimmering pom-poms signaled an end
to the official mourning period Monday at Columbine High School. On
a sunny Colorado morning, at a picture-postcard rally, Columbine's
students, teachers, parents and guidance counselors came, as they
put it, to take back their school. They returned for the first day
of classes at Columbine since the terror of April 20 when two
classmates stormed their school, killing 15 people including
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While this incident and others around the nation have turned
some schools into fortresses, Columbine chose a more measured
approach to security. It distributed student IDs and deployed more
guidance counselors, more security officers and surveillance
cameras. School officials promised that inhumane behavior to other
students would not be tolerated, a hopeful antidote to frictions
that may have played a role in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But administrators decided against the tougher measures now
being considered for some schools, such as metal detectors,
backpack searches and even see-through bags to help detect illicit
drugs or weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine tragedy forced educators to reconsider school
safety, examining how to spot dangerously troubled teen-agers and
how to provide security that protects but does not imprison
students. Some schools have built fences with controlled entries or
conducted SWAT team drills for mock student assaults. Even tougher
proposals, including random searches of students, raise questions
about whether such measures violate the Fourth Amendment against
unreasonable search.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 million weapons in the country and Congress still
dawdling on even minor new restrictions on gun control, Columbine
High School's choice against metal detectors and searches is a
brave decision, one that reflects the community's wishes. For other
schools that need more security because of repeated problems,
students and teachers often deserve the extra protection. At 70 of
New York City's 1,100 schools, for example, metal detectors last
year allowed officials to confiscate over 1,500 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine's moderate approach now becomes a potential testing
ground, not merely for parents and educators but also for police,
politicians and the media. As school opened, about 400 parents and
graduates formed a protective and symbolic human ring around the
grounds. At the same time, Mike Sheehan, the student body
president, rallied his classmates and exulted that four months
since their ordeal, ``We have prevailed; we have overcome.'' It is
a wishful declaration that deserves to be true.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 17: If
a company's auditors discover that it has exaggerated its profits
by $25 million, should they immediately force the company to
correct its financial reports?
</P>
<P>
   To the Securities and Exchange Commission, the answer to that
question is obvious. But it has not been obvious to companies or to
their accountants in recent years. Some argue that if the
misstatement is relatively small _ say, less than 5 percent of the
total _ it is immaterial and need not be disclosed or changed.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1997 case, accountants from Ernst &AMP; Young found a $23
million accounting finagle at CUC International, but let it pass on
the ground that it was a relatively small proportion of total
profits and therefore was not material. The inaccuracy was not
disclosed at the time, but came out after CUC had been merged into
another company, which concluded there had been widespread fraud
and sued Ernst &AMP; Young. The accounting firm denied wrongdoing,
saying it was a victim of the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the SEC released an accounting bulletin _ which is the
law for public companies _ saying that companies and accountants
may not hide behind a numerical test in determining whether or not
something is material and therefore must be disclosed. The bulletin
also warned that companies should not make even small changes to
their accurate financial accounts for the purpose of managing
reported earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That such a bulletin is necessary is a sad comment on the state
of accounting. But it is welcome. Companies should not introduce
even small errors into their books in an effort to make the numbers
look better. Those that do deserve to be sued _ both by the SEC and
by investors.

BUSINESS LEADERS ESTABLISH CHARTER SCHOOL

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Barnett Helzberg and Tom Bloch headed
two of Kansas City's top businesses they wanted to teach their
employees the intricacies of their particular industry. They sure
didn't have time to teach their workers their ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the two businessmen are getting back to the basics of
education so future workers will be prepared when they enter the
work force. Helzberg, his wife Shirley Helzberg, Bloch and educator
Lynne Brown have founded a charter school with the working title
University High School.
</P>
<P>
   At Helzberg Diamonds, ``I sure didn't want to be giving literacy
classes; I wanted to be selling diamonds,'' Helzberg said.
``Education is the seed of everything. It creates progress in
medicine, philosophy, journalism, you name it. That's where it
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's charter school experiment is one of the most
aggressive in the nation. Perhaps reflecting businesses' desire for
a better-educated labor force, business leaders are serving on the
boards of many charter schools and offering them other assistance.
Fifteen of the independently operated schools are set to open in
Kansas City this summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   University High School wanted to move more slowly. It hopes to
open in the summer of 2000 somewhere in the 49//63 neighborhood,
between the Paseo and Oak Street. It will start with just a
freshman class and add at least a grade each year. It hopes to have
a student body that is at least 40 percent minority.  &LR; brk:Something
different
</P>
<P>
   Although it is just in the planning stages, the charter high
school does hope to set itself apart from traditional public
schools by offering:
</P>
<P>
   - Twenty additional days of instruction, for a seemingly
year-round school.
</P>
<P>
   - Performance pay for staff, to be awarded when results are
achieved, just like bonuses in business.
</P>
<P>
   - Small enrollment, so each student gets individual attention.
The school plans on only 25 to 50 students in its first freshman
class.
</P>
<P>
   - An extended school day to support students academically and
the family as a whole. This could include field trips and computer
time after regular school hours.
</P>
<P>
   - A neighborhood school with strong ties to urban universities.
</P>
<P>
   - College courses for qualified students.
</P>
<P>
   - Course work based on projects that integrate English, math,
history and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools typically receive the same amount of state money
per student as any other public school but operate free of a
district's central office and most traditional school rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Missouri Charter Schools Information Center in
St. Louis, the first charter school opened in 1992 in St. Paul,
Minn. Now there are more than 1,200 operating charters serving
300,000 students in 36 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show parents pick charter schools because they think
they will offer higher standards, better teachers and a
neighborhood school experience, including greater opportunities for
parents to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   The schools must be able to measure student achievement and
manage their finances. They cannot charge tuition but can take
grants from foundations and other outside sources. They must
observe all federal anti-discrimination laws and meet health,
safety and accessibility regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools also must have a sponsor. The University of
Missouri-Kansas City will sponsor University High School, and the
charter school also will have strong ties to Rockhurst University.
 &LR; brk:University ties
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Oliver, who's in charge of teacher education for the
School of Education at UMKC, said the university looked for charter
schools that had the resources and opportunity to carry out their
mission and that wanted to form partnerships with UMKC.
</P>
<P>
   University High School was deliberate in its plan, and its
founders ``really did their homework,'' Oliver said. ``They've
narrowed the area they want to serve, narrowed their focus, so they
have a good opportunity for success.''
</P>
<P>
   The charter school's founders hope their students will be able
to take some classes at UMKC and Rockhurst so the academy can
function as a prep school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the students have not...even thought about going to
college,'' Bloch said.
</P>
<P>
   Helzberg became interested in alternative school programs after
reading an article on voucher programs in Forbes magazine. Bloch
was already looking at the charter school system.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on a charter school, they took a business
approach of checking out the competition to the traditional public
school system. They visited such groups as CEO America, a
clearinghouse for private voucher programs in Bentonville, Ark.,
and Partners Advancing Values in Education in Milwaukee, one of the
largest private voucher programs. They also visited several charter
schools in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not inventing the wheel; you go to the successful ones
just like in business,'' Helzberg said. ``When I was in business, I
had talked to jewelers all over the country and traded ideas. We
helped each other out. After visiting these programs, we borrowed
the things we liked most.''
</P>
<P>
   The Helzberg Foundation will help finance the school for a few
years, until it operates in the black. But the real bottom line
isn't a net profit on the financial statement, it's grades on a
report card, the board said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of business if we don't deliver the quality we say
we're going to deliver, and that's how it should be,'' Helzberg
said. ``It's like a business _ if you don't deliver, you're out of
business. We need to require ourselves to come up to a standard.''
 &LR; brk:Making better workers
</P>
<P>
   Dave Camden of the Missouri Charter Schools Information Center
said business people were backing the charter schools because they
were getting employees who were not ready to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce agreed, saying area
employers were not seeing as many qualified, skilled applicants so
they weren't able to hire as many qualified employees.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Blair, director of work force development for the chamber,
said: ``It has a direct impact on the economic viability of the
community. Businesses have to do something to upgrade education in
the high schools, metropolitan community colleges and the four-year
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with their business backgrounds, Bloch and Helzberg also
have strong educational ties.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch spent nearly 20 years at H&AMP;R Block Inc., the corporation
founded by his father and uncle. He rose through the ranks from tax
preparer to president and chief executive officer. But in 1995 he
stunned the business community when he announced he was quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch was looking to spend more time with his two sons and for a
different type of fulfillment in his career. He joined St. Francis
Xavier School in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis continued to primarily serve African-American
families who are non-Catholic and accomplished that without a great
amount of funding,'' said Bloch, who later earned his teacher's
certificate. ``It seemed like a great opportunity. I was
fortunately in position to make a life change.''
</P>
<P>
   Helzberg has taught retailing and management courses to MBA
students at Rockhurst for eight years. He also has held seminars at
several other colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Brown taught grade school for six years in Denver and has nearly
earned a master's in elementary education from the University of
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be more fun than working with children? And what
could be more exciting than to create something from scratch?''
Brown said. ``I'll get in there and scrub floors if that's what is
needed.''  &LR; brk:Getting excited
</P>
<P>
   The academy founders are careful not to criticize the public
school system, saying their charter school will be different, not
necessarily better. They want to be able to work with the teachers
union and the education establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the customer? It's the family,'' Helzberg said. ``We'll
look at the student as part of the family, not just the student in
a vacuum. In smaller schools the principal should know every
student. And in smaller schools the kids don't form the groups, the
gangs, the cliques.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy founders also have had no problem getting volunteers
and even donations from architects, real estate agents and
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's excited; everyone wants to help,'' Helzberg said.
``It will be so fun getting to know the students, seeing them
progress, seeing them graduate and go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be the easiest school in the country. We're not
just preparing them to get jobs but to be successful.''

EDITORIAL: PERFECTLY MATCHED AT MEDINAH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Aug. 17:
The look of relief on Tiger Woods' face said it all as he tapped in
a short putt on the last hole to win the PGA Championship at
Medinah Country Club outside Chicago on Sunday. It was not just
that Woods had survived an inspired challenge by Sergio Garcia, a
fearless 19-year-old Spaniard whose creative shot-making recalled
the miraculous strokes of a young, charging Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   That alone would have made this a memorable afternoon of golf.
But for Woods the greater significance lay in proving to himself
and the world that his runaway victory in the 1997 Masters
Tournament would not become just a symbol of unfulfilled
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Though Woods, now 23 years old, has won plenty of tournaments
and collected mountains of endorsement money since the Masters, he
had not won another of golf's four major titles, which also include
the U.S. Open, the British Open and the PGA. Championship. After
all the buildup when he turned pro in 1996 and his sizzling
performance at Augusta two years ago, the drought was clearly
weighing on Woods. Jack Nicklaus, the man he is someday expected to
rival, has won 18 majors, including six Masters Tournaments. If
Woods fancies a future in that company, he had better start winning
the big ones.
</P>
<P>
   The subplot was provided by Garcia, who has won in Europe but
was not well known in America. He led the field the first day at
Medinah by shooting a sparkling 66, 4-under par. His boyish
exuberance captivated galleries accustomed to the blandness of the
pro circuit. By the 12th hole on Sunday, Garcia trailed Woods by
five strokes. Then the gap suddenly narrowed to one as Woods
stumbled and Garcia coolly sank an 18-foot birdie putt at the 13th
green. The duel was on and golf's newest rivalry was born,
supplanting for a day the competition between Woods and his
archrival, David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia saved par at the 16th hole with a spectacularly reckless
swing after his tee shot came to rest between two roots, six inches
from the base of a tree. Instead of safely chipping out to the
fairway, he closed his eyes to protect them from flying dirt and
bark, and somehow smacked the ball to the green, some 180 yards
away. Woods iced the championship at 17 with a nervy 6 foot putt to
save par. Anyone looking for more electricity in golf will hope for
a rematch in Augusta next April. &QL;

STATE SHUTS DOWN WEB SITE FOR MONTICELLO UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas authorities still hadn't found Leslie Edwin Snell by
Monday, but they had managed to shut down the Web site for
Monticello University, his online correspondence school.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants to serve Snell with a lawsuit it filed Wednesday
in Johnson County District Court against him, Monticello and more
than a dozen other Snell entities. Process servers have been
looking for Snell since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we are going to find him,'' said Mary
Tritsch, spokeswoman for the Kansas attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   A Johnson County District Court judge Wednesday ordered Snell to
temporarily stop doing business in Kansas, as the attorney
general's office requested. The judge also gave the state
permission to seize Snell's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses Snell of violating the state's Consumer
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   It says Monticello has misled potential students by advertising
that it offers ``real degrees'' when in fact Monticello has no
degree-granting authority in Kansas. What's more, authorities say,
Monticello's programs have not been accredited by any agency
recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the lawsuit states, Snell has misled consumers by
implying that the university has a faculty and staff when, in fact,
the university has been run primarily by Snell and a small number
of family members and associates.
</P>
<P>
   Monticello had been located at www.monticello.edu until sometime
over the weekend. The Internet service provider that is host of the
site shut it down at the state's request, Tritsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Snell's house in Olathe's Cedar Creek subdivision was up for
sale as of late last week. An office building that the state says
Snell owns also was up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Monticello, which used to be called Thomas Jefferson University,
was incorporated in Hawaii in 1997. It offers bachelor's, master's,
doctoral and law degrees for prices that range from about $4,000 to
$5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Its literature says that a student can earn a bachelor's by
taking 10 courses, and that the courses generally can be completed
in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   In a legal motion filed in May, Snell said that Kansas does not
have jurisdiction over Monticello. Also, the motion said the
Consumer Protection Act does not apply to businesses engaged in the
``dissemination of information.'' That makes Monticello exempt,
Snell's motion said.
</P>
<P>
   The university claims to have degree-granting authority in
Hawaii and South Dakota and to have a presence in Canada, China and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Kansas, however, contend that Monticello's real
home base has always been Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit asks a judge to permanently bar Monticello and
other Snell entities from doing business in Kansas. It also seeks
damages on behalf of consumers and calls for $5,000 to $10,000 in
civil penalties for each violation of the Consumer Protection Act.

CHEAP FARE AT THE MISSOURI STATE FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDALIA, Mo. _ Through Kamron Trosper's eyes, the uniformed
Missouri Highway Patrol sergeant holding a microphone in front of
the old-fashioned jalopy was at least as big as any storybook
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old from Holt seemed shy, even before the car
suddenly sparked to life, blinking one softball-sized eyeball,
snorting a stream of white smoke and speaking: ``Hey there, Kamron.
How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Kamron jumped back, startled, and then toddled around the car,
looking for the source of that mysterious car voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kamron's trying to look up your tailpipe, Otto,'' quipped Sgt.
Archie Dunn to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Otto blinked both eyeballs at once, and honked out a multitoned
``OOOOOooga! OOOOoooga!''
</P>
<P>
   For almost 30 years the Missouri Highway Patrol has brought Otto
the Talking Car to the Missouri State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have grandparents bringing their grandkids to see Otto,
because they saw him at the fair 20-some years ago,'' Dunn said.
``He's a tradition here, and he's free entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto fits in with one of the biggest attractions of the 97th
State Fair: People here don't get what they pay for _ they get a
lot more. And much of it is free.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of exhibitors offer souvenirs, food samples, free
entertainment and other carrot-and-stick enticements to lure the
crowds to their booths and purchase or use their products. The fair
runs until Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   At the Woman's Building, which houses the Missouri Department of
Natural Resources, the giveaways include fly swatters, park ranger
paper hats, yo-yos, pencils, erasers, posters about soil-loving
worms and a 6-inch plastic rain gauge. There also are packages of
postcards and trading cards of Missouri parks and a notebook-sized
card of mammal tracks, fossils and ferns found in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Five buildings away is the new AG-Citement Center. Here children
can create Christmas ornaments out of corks, sculpt soy modeling
clay into art and play with millions of soy beans in a big bin.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, veteran 4-H youths parade to the Missouri Farm
Bureau building, cater-cornered from the grandstand. Teens whisper
that within the building's walls is one of the best kept secrets at
the fair: For 10 pennies, fairgoers can get a 6-ounce cup of the
best cold chocolate skim milk around.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't remain a secret for long; the milk mustaches and
wide smiles of people leaving the building announce to the world
that they ``got milk.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ozark Mountain Concession stand outside the Missouri Farm
Bureau, a Kettle Corn vendor offers free samples of the sticky,
gooey popcorn, and a lemon-flavored drink. Patrons get as much of
the Kettle Corn as the palm of their hand can hold.
</P>
<P>
   And on a hot day, a lot of corn sticks to a sweaty palm.
</P>
<P>
   For more free nibbles, don't miss the Agricultural Building. The
smell of hundreds of country hams, kind of like smoked bacon on a
winter's day, can knock over even the most discerning vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of jerky meat and sausage vendors offer free bites. Make
sure to ask for a taste of the smoked summer sausages of ostrich
and buffalo meat at the Alewels booth. Naturally, the ostrich
tastes a whole lot like chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner from the meats are samples of corn chips with
a raspberry barbecue sauce, compliments of Buck Creek Inc. The
company's chefs won first place for their sauce at the American
Royal in 1996 and third in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Free water drinks are available at the Kinetico Quality booth.
While sipping water, make sure to take in a stupendous sight just
steps away: Missouri's largest pumpkin, a 407-pound bloated,
orange-ribbed monster, grown by Dan Westfall of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone over the age of 60, there are free tram rides
throughout the park (otherwise a ride within the park is 50 cents),
and free glaucoma screenings. Seniors must register at the Senior
Citizen's Lounge, which also should win the blue ribbon for having
the coldest air-conditioning on the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the Conservation Building, an animated Smokey Bear tells
children not to play with fire. At a wet sand table, children can
stamp Missouri critter tracks. More free giveaways are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``You outgrow the plastic bags they hand out real quick,'' said
Angie Hummer, 34, of Savannah, Mo., as she stuffed into her bag
more plastic rulers, pencils, a Smokey Bear comic book and a
bookmark for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really surprised by all the free stuff you do get at the
fair,'' she said. ``We weren't really expecting it. But it seems
like everywhere you go they're giving you handouts. I just wish
someone would give out a really big bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the fairground, there are more freebies, too numerous
to mention.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one other place to find a giveaway, maybe even the
very last place one would expect to find such a thing: at the
first-aid station.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who receives first-aid gets to choose a stuffed animal
from a bin overflowing with colorful plush toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping we don't have to give too many of these little
guys away,'' said one emergency medical technician, picking up a
bear and giving him a little hug. ``People who get these aren't
having fun, and that's something we don't want anybody to go
through, let alone remembering it without a souvenir.''

SOME CREDIT CARDS NOW CARRY COLLEGE NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colleges now market credit cards bearing their names and logos.
</P>
<P>
   In return for giving the bank or credit card company a mailing
list of potential cardholders, the college gets a cut of every
purchase made on the card.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown University was the first college, in 1982, to have
its own credit card through MBNA, a large credit-card issuer.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of schools have signed agreements for
cards.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators and alumni directors say the cards are
good for two reasons: Alumni and college staff like to show off
their school pride, and the school collects a percentage of each
credit card purchase.
</P>
<P>
   William Jewell College in Liberty has its own credit card, which
boasts a picture of historic Jewell Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years of offering the card, the college has earned
more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although college-sponsored cards are generally aimed at alumni
or staff members, some students carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Golubski, a student at Emporia State University, had a
standard one but couldn't pass up the Emporia State card.
</P>
<P>
   She loved the card's cute ``Corky the Hornet'' mascot.

CREDIT CARDS ACT AS EXTRA TEMPTATION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   College student Toby Stowe often is short on cash.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. He just whips out a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Voila. He's got a tuxedo for the dance. A groovy CD. A cool shot
glass for his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards have become a passport to the material world for
thousands of college students like Stowe.
</P>
<P>
   Although he keeps up with the bills, many other college students
have wound up deeply in debt.
</P>
<P>
   As young people head to campus this month, parents have the
usual worries: Will they drink too much? Study too little? Get into
messy scrapes?
</P>
<P>
   Add another: Will their sons and daughters, on the cusp of
adulthood, fall into credit-card debt?
</P>
<P>
   More and more students are getting more and more credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted the United States Student Association, in
conjunction with MasterCard International, to start a
peer-counseling program on money management for college students
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The program, announced Thursday, will include money-management
tips in student newspapers, Web sites and dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of college students have at least one credit
card, a 1998 survey by two education research groups found. One in
five students said they had four or more credit cards, and one in
10 students owed more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because many students work part time and for minimum wage,
making minimum payments can be hard. Paying off the entire amount
can be difficult, especially if high interest rates result in large
finance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the cards are in a parent's name, the students are
responsible for the debts. If they don't pay, the credit-card
companies can send a collection agency after the money. A bad
credit history can limit the student's opportunities for future
loans, including home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges, worried about some students' high debt, have started
restricting credit-card availability on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Israelsen, associate professor of consumer and family
economics at the University of Missouri-Columbia, knows students
who work so many hours to pay off credit-card bills that they slack
off on schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   He says blame rests not just with the students for lack of
discipline. To Israelsen, colleges also are responsible because,
for a fee, they allow credit-card vendors onto campus.
</P>
<P>
   Offering credit-card applications ``dirties the campus,'' he
said. ``Not because lenders are lepers, but because I'm just not
convinced that purveyors of credit cards are a necessary component
of campus. I view the university as a place apart....To say it's
just a marketing arena is to cheapen it.''
</P>
<P>
   As students settle in for the semester this month, they will see
credit-card applications everywhere _ slipped into bags at the
bookstore checkout, stacked up by pay phones, hawked by vendors
with come-ons of free T-shirts and soda, and pitched over the phone
and in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card companies say that students need to establish a
credit history so they can get loans later and that young people
should have a credit card in case of emergencies. Credit limits
also usually are lower for students.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of students with credit cards pay off their
monthly balances right away, according to the 1998 poll by the
Education Resources Institute and the Institute for Higher
Education Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that students have been very responsible in
handling credit,'' said Alex Giacco, executive vice president for
MBNA America, a large credit-card issuer. ``You feel badly for the
people who get into trouble, but we have found that that is a very,
very small minority. The student population probably handles credit
as well as the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   But credit-card critics say the companies are exploiting
students because they are unable to find other new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student market is the most important niche market,'' said
Robert Manning, a Georgetown University sociologist. ``The
(student) market changes every year with new people, so it's not
saturated...and the group is young, so they offer corporate loyalty
that could last 50 or 60 years.''  &LR; brk:`Fantasy Island' spending
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards can be an overwhelming temptation for students away
from home.
</P>
<P>
   Many still are a bit immature, irresponsible and unorganized.
They have little cash but want to fit in with the fancy things and
fun times they can afford only on credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of `Fantasy Island.' It's kind of like when
we're on vacation, money flies out of my wallet,'' Israelsen said.
``For some students, the college experience is like vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students pretend not to see the problem they're creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're feigning ignorance, like a possum will do when he
thinks you're going to bonk him on the head,'' Israelsen said. ``On
the other hand, there are students who...scrimp and save. They are
bastions of integrity and fiduciary virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sheets, community development director for Consumer Credit
Counseling Service Mid America, said students often don't track how
much they are buying with money they haven't earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality only hits them in the face when they find out they
can't make the payments or they make the payments and the balance
never goes away,'' Sheets said. ``They realize, `Oh! What did I do
here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Golubski, 22, will graduate from Emporia State University
in December and plans to be a teacher. She has worked as a
temporary office worker this summer, with much of her earnings
going toward credit-card bills.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman with a new credit card, she always paid off her
balance. Then, she loosened up her spending. The card limit started
at $500. When she hit that, the company raised her limit to $1,000,
then again to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Now she owes a little more than $1,000, which seems manageable
but still a burden. She can't save for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they're paid off, I'm cutting them up,'' Golubski said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Gretz, 19, is about to start her sophomore year at St.
Louis University, doesn't use credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But she knows students who will go out to dinner with friends,
put the whole tab on their credit card, then collect cash from the
others.
</P>
<P>
   They spend the cash and then can't pay the credit-card bill
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   They spend without distinguishing between ``want'' and ``need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the time it's not something you can't live
without,'' Gretz said. ``You really have to know yourself and know
your limits. I wouldn't trust myself with one.''  &LR; brk:Fighting debt
</P>
<P>
   Students and debt counselors urge parents to talk to their
children about the advantages and disadvantages of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay on their case if you think it's going to be a problem for
your kid. It's so easy to get one and not tell (your parents),''
Gretz said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Robin Strachan, believes in talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, I think, is a very mature young woman, but she
doesn't have all the experience in the world, so she may need some
help sometimes coming to some decisions....It's always a scary
thing when you send your 18-year-old off into the world. You have
to take it upon yourself to keep the lines of communication open.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges across the country also are taking action.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Missouri-Kansas City last year, the
residence hall staff organized a credit-card debt seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Worried by a study showing that students with large credit-card
debt are more likely than other students to be depressed and smoke
and drink heavily, administrators at the University of Minnesota
decided not to let students pay for tuition with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   A few small colleges have banned credit-card vendors altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Kansas and the University of Missouri-Columbia
have limited the number of days per semester each credit-card
company can be on campus. They require the companies to post their
percentage rates.
</P>
<P>
   MU also requires companies to hand out fliers on money
management and the danger of too much credit-card debt, while KU
has instructed credit-card vendors to avoid high-pressure selling
at on-campus tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brush (warnings) off,'' said Stowe, a 20-year-old
Independence resident who attends William Woods University in
Fulton, Mo. ``But they stay in the back of our minds. I know I'll
have to cut back on some things _ the things I don't have to have.
A little patience better go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Willpower, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had another card call me offering a higher balance,''
Stowe said. ``I admit it was hard to say no. But I did. It just
would have gotten me in trouble, and I'm trying to build good
credit.''

REFORM PARTY'S DIRECTION, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE REMAIN A
QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1992, Ross Perot led an impassioned following of
angry voters that caused fits for the campaigns of President Bush
and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His independent candidacy won almost 20 percent of the vote, the
best showing for an independent or third-party presidential
candidate in more than a half-century. It sparked a debate that
continues about whether he sealed Bush's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to 2000. Could a third-party candidate wield that
kind of political clout again?
</P>
<P>
   It depends upon who carries the banner. After a messy leadership
fight at the recent convention of the Perot-created Reform Party,
the party's direction, to say nothing of the identity of its
presidential nominee, is a blank slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a leader who also has some political savvy, who can
go up against the two major parties and challenge them,'' said Greg
Mueller, a Republican consultant who worked for Pat Buchanan in
1996 and is now aiding Steve Forbes. ``The leader needs to be
somewhat of an outsider who understands the insiders' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Perot. And now, as he learns more about politics, like
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the former pro wrestler whose blend
of candor and impatience with political niceties has made him a
marquee figure.
</P>
<P>
   But Perot's share of the vote has declined. And Ventura, whose
forces took over the party leadership last month, has said he would
not be a candidate in 2000, even as he sets the party machinery in
place possibly for a run in 2004. He would then have at least one
term as governor on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``His appeal depends on his image as a straight shooter,'' said
John Pitney, an expert on third parties, at Claremont McKenna
College in California. ``If he were to pull a maneuver that
resembles Bill Clinton, he loses that appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive he's not going (to run),'' said Russ Verney,
former Reform Party chairman and Perot's chief political adviser.
``To win, the only thing we can offer is the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk persists, however, and Ventura said in a recent C-SPAN
interview, ``I am not a candidate for president...but if the party
drafted me and put me on the ballot, I guess there's not a whole
lot I can do about it, is there?''
</P>
<P>
   Other names have floated into the vacuum: Lowell Weicker, a
former Republican senator and governor from Connecticut; New York
developer Donald Trump; and a current GOP presidential hopeful,
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the conservative commentator's Republican campaign has
not gained much traction _ in the polls, among donors or in the
media. But he has experience, name recognition and a core of
followers who probably would stick with him. Reform Party activists
have mentioned his name as potential candidate if he could be
convinced to bolt the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Buchanan said he had no plans to leave the
Republican fold, yet on the the Fox News Channel acknowledged
engaging ``in impure thoughts about possibly running for another
party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan, a rocked-ribbed conservative, and Weicker, a
social liberal, are indications of the jumble of the viewpoints
beneath the Reform Party's umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The party has its share of critics. The conservative political
magazine The Weekly Standard harshly characterized it as ``a place
for malcontents and disconnects, third-rate politicians and
pamphleteers with bleeding ulcers. It is a big teepee, with no
flap.''
</P>
<P>
   The equally conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page
called the group ``Ross Perot's increasingly zany party'' kept
alive only by the boon of taxpayer subsidies as a result of
campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever becomes the Reform nominee next summer will have $12.6
million in federal campaign funds at his disposal. That, and the
Ventura model for using the Internet to instantly and cheaply
organize a grass-roots campaign, could make it a force to contend
with in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point I was getting 80 e-mails a day,'' said Gary
Allen, the Reform Party state chairman in Idaho. ``I think we can
do more with less than other parties can.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a lawyer who began as a Perot volunteer in 1992,
acknowledged that the party did not fit the ``traditional political
spectrum'' but said that was its strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to differentiate us is grass-roots America vs.
big business,'' he said. ``If you look at who the candidates are
that the other parties are touting for president, they are just as
establishment-big business-big government as you could be.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Perot tapped into that same kind of restiveness among
voters largely on the basis of his personality, his deep pockets
and his message. He was ``mad-as-hell'' about trade, the $4
trillion national debt and the venality of two-party politics. Exit
polls showed that he probably drew about equally from Republicans
and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he founded the Reform Party and ran again, but
he got less than 9 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The party bounced back last year when Ventura, from seemingly
out of nowhere, won the Minnesota governor's race by upsetting two
better-known, better-funded, major-party contenders. And he did it
with the aid of a voter turnout of more than 60 percent, when
nationally it was an anemic 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough not to be impressed,'' said former Clinton
press secretary Mike McCurry. ``It tells you that he has awakened
something in the body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll gave Ventura 12 percent of the vote in a three-way
race with Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son
of the former president. Gore, the leading Democrat, got 32
percent, and Bush, the leading Republican, got 44 percent. Without
Ventura, Bush polled 50 percent and Gore 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey showed that if Gore and Bush were the only
candidates on the ballot next year, 46 percent said they would want
the choice of a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Matalin, a political adviser to President Bush in 1992,
said a third party needed a ``good message and a good messenger.
There is no way for a third party to be successful unless the
message is powerful.''

KC RESTAURANT FEEDS BARBECUE FOR CLINTON, AIR FORCE ONE ENTOURAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A taste of Kansas City cuisine was on the menu for President
Clinton and his entourage Monday after his stop at the Veterans of
Foreign Wars 100th anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken tetrazzini, barbecued ribs, mashed potatoes and gravy,
baked beans and cinnamon rolls made up 55 boxed lunches prepared by
Stroud's Restaurant for Clinton and passengers of Air Force One,
the president's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Stroud's, known for its fried chicken, geared the lunch for the
president's palate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president really likes barbecue, so we added some
barbecued ribs,'' said co-owner Jim Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   The food was from Stroud's in Kansas City, North, where ribs are
a regular menu item.
</P>
<P>
   The order came last Thursday from a friend of Hogan's who
handles public relations at the White House. White House staff
members visited Stroud's a week prior to the president's appearance
to test the food.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan helped deliver the food to Air Force One at Kansas City
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service have to inspect everything,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, agents opened every box, searched vehicles and
checked Hogan and his family, who helped deliver the lunches, with
metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan admitted he was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's all these guys standing around and they all have guns,
they all have the sunglasses and they are talking into their wrist
radios,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Hogan and his wife, Anne, met Clinton at the steps
of Air Force One and had their picture taken with him.
</P>
<P>
   Stroud's also prepared a buffet of chicken-fried steak, mashed
potatoes and gravy, green beans, tossed salad and cinnamon rolls
for 65 members of the media covering the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks started at 6 a.m. preparing the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not much different from any order we've done,'' said
Chris McSorley, kitchen manager.
</P>
<P>
   Except for this job, McSorley took extra care in handling the
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are cooking for the president of United States, you
try to be more careful. We were a little more watchful of the
chicken,'' he said.

JEWISH CENTER REOPENS WITH SHOW OF FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hugs and smiles, magicians and clowns made the
North Valley Jewish Community Center a fun place Monday as it
reopened less than a week after a gunman wounded five people during
a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Joining hundreds of parents and children at the center was the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said the Aug. 10 racist attack has helped
bring together people of different faiths and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw two children with casts on their legs who'd been
shot,'' he said. `We saw rabbis praying with congregants. We saw
parents hugging children. We saw a community turning pain into
power.''
</P>
<P>
   All but five of the 170 day campers and preschoolers returned
Monday, and two new day campers enrolled. Center officials said
those are sure signs the center's extended family is returning to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Helping with the healing was the return of some victims. They
included Isabelle Shalometh, the 68-year-old receptionist grazed by
two bullets; 6-year-old James Zidell, who was shot in the left
foot; and 6-year-old Joshua Stepakoff, wearing a cast over his left
leg that was broken by a single bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Among those eager to sign Joshua's cast was 6-year-old Joshua
Yeager, said his father, former Los Angeles Dodger catcher Steve
Yeager.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest boy was in such a big hurry to get here today that I
had to get up early,'' said Yeager, a coach for the Dodgers' minor
league team in San Bernardino. ``It's a brand new day.''
</P>
<P>
   The last week of summer camp featured the usual kickball games,
swimming and enriching activities that help make the center a focal
point for many in the Jewish community within the San Fernando
Valley and neighboring areas. Adding to the fun were magicians and
clowns who also visited with children in the center's year-round
preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnout has been just phenomenal,'' said day camp
counselor Robert Roig of Porter Ranch. ``The kids are ecstatic.
It's like nothing ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Counselors were available for children and the elderly, who were
there Monday for a weekly lunch and social program.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet-pocked walls have been repaired. Bloodstained carpets
and broken windows have been removed and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's a sense of normalcy beginning to return as we
return to our Jewish community center,'' said Jeffrey Rouss,
executive vice president for the Jewish Community Centers of
Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Parris Moskowitz, the center's president, thanked the
staff for their hard work to make the center ``the best place for
our children to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got everyone coming back. It's our center, our family,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. has been charged by Los Angeles County
prosecutors with the attempted murder of Shalometh, Joshua, James,
5-year-old Benjamin Kadish and 16-year-old Mindy Finkelstein, and
the murder of postal carrier Joseph Ileto a few miles away. Federal
prosecutors also have charged Furrow with murder of a federal
employee and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to patching the lobby, center officials beefed up
security with help from Los Angeles police.
</P>
<P>
   Patrol cars lined the center's gated driveway. Uniformed
security guards were posted throughout the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Rouss said officials for the city's Jewish community centers
also are considering installing video cameras and monitors to
improve security.
</P>
<P>
   The security measures reassured parents who said even a
community center needs more protection than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was none before. It was kind of an open-door policy,''
said Lesley Pincus of Northridge. ``I think it's necessary now.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important for Pincus, however, was the center's
reopening less than a week after the shooting. Pincus said she and
her 6-year-old son, Scott, were eager for day camp to resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I was a maniac, but today I'm fine, he's fine. I
feel relieved,'' she said. ``Everyone's happy. I'm thankful because
it shows that life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   More parents than usual stayed to join in the fun Monday. They
also savored with counselors and teachers what some described as a
sense of peace and security the hate-inspired bloodshed allegedly
brought by the white supremacist Furrow couldn't destroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of our family. It's a very important center for
us,'' said Joanne Vescera of Granada Hills, who has three children
in the center's day camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little anxious coming back to this building,'' she
said. ``They've done an excellent job providing a warm and secure
environment for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   The center remains a ``home away from home'' for Bonnie
Gottlieb's family. The Northridge mom returned her two children to
day camp and preschool Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children especially needed to see the faces of their
friends and their teachers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the community continued to demonstrate their
support, adding to the flowers, banners and other tokens of
sympathy placed out front or taken inside the center.
</P>
<P>
   Gayana Vardanyan brought more than 20 teddy bears for children
at the center. The stuffed animals are part of a collection that
has grown in the six years that her son, Abraham, has remained in a
coma after being struck by a motorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't deserve this kind of emotional problem,'' the
Winnetka woman said of the center's children. ``I've been there.
It's hard.''

MERGER DOUBTS HURT KCP&AMP;L STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy belated anniversary, shareholders of Kansas City Power &AMP;
Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Monday, you voted down the merger with UtiliCorp
United Inc. And today? Your subsequent deal with Western Resources
Inc. not only hasn't happened but might not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly in question and has been in question for a long
time,'' said Doug Fischer, senior electric utility analyst at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The doubt has weighed on KCP&AMP;L shares recently. The still
incomplete merger also has tied the stock to Western's shares,
which have weighed on KCP&AMP;L investors far more.
</P>
<P>
   So here you are three years later with no more than what you
started with.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L investors have gained a minuscule 0.26 percent, counting
dividends, in the three years since the vote. KCP&AMP;L shares closed
at 23 on Monday, down 7/16, after falling 3.85 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Western Resources deal gone through long ago, you might
not be any happier. Shares of Western Resources have lost 1.31
percent in those three years. Western had been a hot property until
last October. The stock has fallen 40 percent since then, wiping
out big gains that had accumulated since the UtiliCorp vote on Aug.
16, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Had KCP&AMP;L shareholders taken the UtiliCorp deal, they'd be
happier but not necessarily happy. UtiliCorp shares have gained
45.4 percent in the three years since the vote. But the Russell
1000 Utilities index has doubled, rising 103.92 percent, which
means even the better choice was a poor choice.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp shares closed at 23 1/2 on Monday, down 3/8, and were
unchanged last week.
</P>
<P>
   And what to do now?
</P>
<P>
   Ed Tirello offers some hope. The senior utilities analyst at
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in New York likes Western Resources and
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Both have suffered from problems at Protection One Inc., the
home security company of which Western owns more than 80 percent.
Protection One is losing money in a business that swims in profits.
But the company has changed management recently, and Tirello said
he expected improvements and earnings to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Tirello rates Western shares a ``strong buy'' and expects their
price to reach 35. Western closed Monday at 23 15/16, down 5/16,
after falling 6.95 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks the KCP&AMP;L merger will happen. He's just a little
unsure about the terms Kansas regulators and the companies
ultimately will settle on.

   You can't go wrong writing about puppies and kittens, especially
on your first day back from vacation during the dog days of August.
</P>
<P>
   That's not something they teach at journalism school, but it
seems like sound advice, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   So I spent some time Monday morning watching Fonzi, a 5-year-old
black-and-white Shih Tzu. Fonzi was hanging out online.
</P>
<P>
   Fonzi was the featured pet on the Humane Society of Greater
Kansas City's PuppyCam, the latest in pet adoption technology.
Mounted in a cage at the Humane Society's shelter in Kansas City,
Kan., the camera shoots a fresh photo every five seconds and beams
it to a worldwide audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had calls from Washington state; we've had calls from
all over,'' said Lorna Helmig, director of operations for the
Humane Society. ``They'll call and say, `That's a cute dog or cat.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society has featured about 12 animals since the
camera was plugged in last month. The results have been good. Nine
of the animals _ dogs, puppies, kittens and a cat _ found new
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Helmig said the organization picked animals with a high ``cute
value'' that were likely to stay active for the camera. The camera
is on all day. When the lights go out, the PuppyCam shows
``highlights'' from the day.
</P>
<P>
   The PuppyCam Web site _ www.thepuppycam.com _ also has general
information on pet adoption and raising a pet, a chat room, and two
experts _ a veterinarian and a Humane Society official _ who answer
questions online posed by visitors to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The PuppyCam is a program started by a Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.-based Internet company that has placed kennel cameras in
animal shelters in more than 20 cities across the country. About 25
more shelters are scheduled to go online in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Online Pet Adoption Network pays for the cameras and
provides technical support for participating animal shelters. The
company is hoping to make money by selling advertising on the site,
and plans to split profits with the animal shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Helmig said the PuppyCam had been a great deal for the Kansas
City Humane Society. The organization's only expense was a new
phone line to connect to the Adoption Network.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fonzi ... well, if he knew he was on center stage Monday
he was pretty blase about it. He wandered around the cage a bit,
occasionally jumped up on the side, and even mooned the camera a
few times.
</P>
<P>
   It beats the heck out of network reruns and midseason
replacements.

</P>
<P>
   AltaVista, one of the largest Internet search engines, is the
latest company to enter the free Internet service market.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista last week began offering local service in the Kansas
City area, Leavenworth and hundreds of other cities nationwide. The
hitch to avoid a monthly Internet charge that averages about $20
for paid Internet service? Users have to visit advertiser Web sites
on a regular basis to remain online.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available at www.altavista.com.
</P>
<P>
   Free Internet service has become big business in Europe, where
consumers often are billed per minute for telephone service. Free
Internet services there have snagged hundreds of thousands of users
who opted for free service to reduce their overall online costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several free Internet providers have popped up in the United
States. The Microsoft Network, which runs a poor second to America
Online, is said to be considering a free service.

WEATHER AND EXPORT FACTORS PUSH GRAIN FUTURES HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City wheat and Chicago wheat,
corn and soybean futures prices closed higher Monday, with weather
and export factors boosting the market.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City Value Line stock index futures and Isdex Internet
stock index futures were mostly higher; Kansas City's Western
Natural Gas futures finished down slightly on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and soybean futures prices were boosted by forecasts of dry
weather in the Midwest, which could further stress crops.
</P>
<P>
   Many traders continue to speculate that the crop production
report released last week was overstated for corn, providing
further support for prices. Corn futures prices also got support
from news that Taiwan and Japan bought 221,728 metric tons of U.S.
corn for delivery in the marketing year that begins Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also got support from news that Taiwan today will bid
for more than 50,000 metric tons of U.S. beans.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices mostly followed corn and soybeans higher, although
rumors that Algeria would be in the market for wheat today provided
underlying support.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Value Line and Isdex finished mostly higher as
traders squared positions ahead of today's Consumer Price Index
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a lot going on, and trade was quiet,'' said
Kansas City trader Mark Grismore.
</P>
<P>
   Value Line stock index cash settled down 16 basis points at
1,007.15. The September Mini Value Line settled up 65 basis points
at 1,010.65. Isdex cash settled up 1,036 basis points at 461.26.
The September contract settled up 1,000 basis points at 462.00.

SPRINT MOVE HAS YET TO OPEN MORE OFFICE SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The midyear market
report by broker and office manager Trammell Crow Co. suggests that
fear of Sprint-sponsored vacancies is stronger than the reality _
at least right now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Most tenants in the market thought there was going to be a lot
of space as soon as the Sprint campus opened,'' said Matthew
Spachman, broker for Trammell Crow. ``It's not right now. Yes, it
is going to affect the overall market over the next three years.''
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily right now. That's partly because Sprint is
still a big specter in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at every block of vacant space that is over
30,000 square feet,'' Spachman said.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Trammell Crow's new building, which is scheduled
to open this fall. Spachman acknowledged that Sprint's presence as
a potential tenant sometimes could scare away other tenants.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint isn't affecting leasing prospects at Trammell Crow's
new building, Spachman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of potential tenants come look at it,''
Spachman said. ``We told them that they are welcome if they want to
come and lease it at our rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Trammell Crow is quoting lease rates of $23 a square foot in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The office market is filling up office space at a healthy rate,
and the midyear vacancy rate is 9.8 percent. That's a slight
increase from 9.58 percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chunk of available office space is in downtown class
B buildings, where 1.5 million of the 7.3 million square feet are
available for rent. The midyear vacancy rate is 19.96 percent, up
from 19.6 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Polsinelli law firm is expanding its offices in Johnson
County, Kan., and is expected to move into the fifth floor of the
NCAA building.
</P>
<P>
   Spachman, the broker with Trammell Crow, said the law firm's
lease on 6,000 square feet in the Lighton Tower expired last month.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm is making an even bigger imprint in the suburbs by
agreeing to lease a 20,000-square-foot floor in the former
headquarters of the NCAA at 6201 College Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really exciting location because it's right in the
heart of Johnson County and Overland Park,'' said Russell Welsh,
chief executive officer for the law firm. ``It's near Sprint, Black
&AMP; Veatch and the (planned) convention center. That's where the
action is.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has 12 lawyers in Overland Park, Kan., now and will
have 18 when it moves into its new office Oct. 1. The firm signed a
seven-year lease and plans to grow to 35 lawyers in the Overland
Park office, Welsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Biery, an agent with Copaken White &AMP; Blitt, handled leasing
in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brown, Stan Durwood's successor at the helm of AMC
Entertainment Inc., last week expressed his support for his
predecessor's pet project, the Power &AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Brown said the hired guns from Atlanta were
the developers now driving the project.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Power &AMP; Light District LLC, a subsidiary of
AMC, added Regent Partners Inc. of Atlanta to the team developing
the $628 million Power &AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   When Durwood died in July, the torch passed at the company and
at the Power &AMP; Light District. Brown, leader of the Kansas
City-based movie theater company, said Regent Partners was the
leader of the downtown revival project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the car, but in my view Regent Partners is at
the wheel, driving that car,'' Brown said. ``Whether we're in the
front seat or the back seat is debatable, but we've got to make
sure this legacy of Stan's becomes a reality.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Costanzo, manager for engineering for MC Real Estate
Services Inc., gets a gold medal for going the extra mile during
this summer's heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   When the air conditioning died at a Prairie Village building
managed by the company, he found the replacement parts in
Louisville, Ky. Couriers refused to deliver it over the weekend, so
Costanzo enlisted Grandpa and Uncle Jimmy to deliver the 500-pound
compressor to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa and Uncle Jimmy _ James Hood Sr., 76, and James Hood
Jr., 53, both of Louisville _ made the 500-mile trip on a recent
Friday night. The part arrived Saturday morning, and cooling was
restored by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS better watch out or Grandpa and Uncle Jimmy will be
cutting into their business,'' Costanzo said.

COMPETITOR BUYS MISSOURI-BASED ELEVATOR MANUFACTURER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   A Memphis, Tenn., elevator company has
acquired a Grandview, Mo., manufacturer in the same industry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thyssen Elevator Corp. of North America bought Access Industries
Inc. earlier this month. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Access Industries makes stairway lifts, vertical and inclined
platform lifts, and residential elevators. The company has about
380 area employees, as well as 90 more at its subsidiary in
England.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Access said that no personnel changes would be
made and that the company would maintain its name and operations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Mahoney, president of Access, said customers,
suppliers, dealers and employees would not be affected by the
ownership change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additional resources that Access Industries will be able
to draw upon will allow us to further our growth in North America
and expand our distribution network worldwide,'' he said. ``We will
immediately benefit from Thyssen's expertise in elevators.''
</P>
<P>
   Thyssen Elevator is the biggest elevator company in North
America, where its annual revenue is $1.5 billion. Worldwide, the
company's sales are more than $3.5 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Access began in 1947 as American Stair-Glide and was acquired in
1968 by Ewing M. Kauffman and made a subsidiary of Marion
Laboratories. Local investors led by Mahoney bought the company
from Marion Labs in 1980.

JACKSON URGES UNITY AGAINST HATE CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Helping to reopen the North Valley Jewish
Community Center, the Rev. Jesse Jackson has urged people of all
faiths to join in the fight against a recent rash of hate crimes
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, accompanied by ministers from the San Fernando Valley
and elsewhere in the Los Angeles area Monday, said the gunman's
attack on the center Aug. 10 underscores the need for the
government to act swiftly to fight extremists by toughening hate
crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have underestimated the extent of the rise of hate
crimes,'' said Jackson, president and founder of Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition. ``Every time it happens, we think it's an isolated
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson on called on religious and community leaders to work
together to prevent similar attacks in the future. ``In times of
crisis, people must turn to each other to find hope and healing,''
Jackson said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said everyone is ``guilty of living in our own ethnic patch''
and finding comfort in those communities, or ``patches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must sew those patches together and build a quilt of
cooperation,'' he said. ``It's not until the underbelly of violence
hits our patch that we tend to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   The wake-up calls have come in rapid succession in recent
months, Jackson said, citing the Granada Hills shooting; white
supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith's shooting rampage a month
earlier of Jews, Asians and African-Americans in the Midwest; the
killing of a gay student in Wyoming; and the slaying of an
African-American man in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson cited numerous Internet sites where hate groups spread
their gospel of violence. ``This generation of haters makes bombs
and blows up buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the government needs to expand hate crime laws to
enact a ``high level of justice'' on those who violate them. ``In
the 2000 presidential race, the effort to stop hate crime violence
must be central to the campaign,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson explained that the GOP's response to gun violence has
shifted in the past 30 years. In 1969, the party was advocating gun
control because the Black Panthers posed a threat of violence. In
1999, the party is advocating the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now walking around more heavily armed than the
police,'' said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said the government needs to address the growing
alienation of white people who in many communities are experiencing
increased diversification in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must relieve them of their fears,'' he said. ``Somehow, we
must inform them, not just disarm them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ministers joined Jackson in calling for an effort by
various faiths to work together to stop hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wake-up call, especially in the San Fernando
Valley, that hate can exist everywhere unless people stand up
against it,'' said Rev. Zedar E. Broadous of Calvary Baptist Church
in Pacoima.

TALKS ON WESTERN-KCP&AMP;L MERGER PRODUCE MIXED RESULTS SO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Western Resources Inc. is working toward
a settlement with federal regulators to approve the company's
merger with Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. So far, the talks have
had mixed results.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Western last week was dealt a setback by Kansas regulators, who
rejected Western's plan to help pay for the merger. But state
regulators are not the only potential obstacle to the deal. The
merger must also get the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency produced its own snag to the deal earlier
this year when it decided the merger must go to a hearing, a
decision that could put off a ruling by federal regulators until
late next year. Western and KCP&AMP;L have said such a delay is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But a settlement with federal regulators could keep the merger
on schedule. If other regulatory approvals are received, the deal
could be completed by the end of the year, the utilities'
self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference, the federal agency's staff and other
interveners in the case met to discuss a settlement. There are 18
interveners in the federal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties left that settlement conference agreeing to talk
more,'' said John Coffman, deputy counsel of the Missouri Office of
Public Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   And talks have continued. The Board of Public Utilities, which
is one of the interveners, had its first meeting with Western on
Thursday. Little, if any, progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   Things ``didn't go too well,'' said Leon Daggett, BPU's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   BPU now has interconnect agreements, which it paid for, with
Western and KCP&AMP;L that allow the Kansas City, Kan., utility to
export and import electricity. The competition has been healthy,
BPU officials say, and they want Western to pay for an interconnect
with AmerenUE, a St. Louis utility.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Electric Power Cooperative Inc., which supplies power to
21 Kansas electric cooperatives, has several issues. Among them:
The size of the merged company gives it a market power that
requires safeguards to protect smaller companies such as Kansas
Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
   Talks have been held with Western Resources and Kansas Electric,
but ``at this point we have a long way to go,'' said Stephen Parr,
chief executive officer of Kansas Electric Power in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility, a group of
municipal utilities, has concerns about rates the merged company
would charge for transmitting electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is final, but progress is being made in the Missouri
group's discussions with Western.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our talks have been very productive,'' said Duncan Kincheloe,
chief executive officer of Missouri Joint Municipal Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Western could also be helped by its agreement with the staff of
the Missouri Public Service Commission and Missouri's Office of
Public Counsel, which represents utility customers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which must still be approved by Missouri
regulators, requires a market power study as one of the conditions
to approve the merger. The Office of Public Counsel, which also is
an intervener in the federal proceeding, has agreed not to oppose
the merger if the Missouri agreement is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the talks with the staff of the federal
regulatory commission. The staff recommended the hearing in part
because of concerns about the market power of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   A Western spokeswoman said talks continued, but she provided no
further details. A spokeswoman for the federal agency said any
settlement talks were confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Any settlement would go to an administrative judge, who would
have to certify the agreement before sending it to the federal
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   If some interveners don't agree to a settlement, it's still
possible that a contested settlement could be certified and sent to
the commissioners.

ANNUAL RAISES EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOUT 4 PERCENT, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Don't wait for your annual raise to
improve your lot.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six years of raises averaging slightly more than 4
percent, it looks like more of the same, according to the annual
William M. Mercer Compensation Planning Survey for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, double-digit raises died with the 1980s. American
workers may be keeping modestly ahead of inflation, but they
certainly aren't getting rich by increments, and they shouldn't
expect to next year.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Mercer survey found that midsize to large employers
nationwide intend once again to give raises averaging between 4
percent and 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That range, consistent throughout most of the 1990s, continues a
compensation shift away from fixed-salary increases to more
variable, incentive-based pay, said Jeffrey Fuller, a Mercer
compensation consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent numbers available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics showed that working urban Americans experienced an
inflation rate of 1.9 percent for the 12 months ending in June.
Because the annual inflation rate has hovered around 2 percent or 3
percent through most of the 1990s, most workers have been realizing
real annual income gains, though small.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercer salary survey covered 2,000 employers with 13.9
million employees, or 13 percent of the nation's private-sector
work force.
</P>
<P>
   Complete survey details won't be released until later this year;
meanwhile, organizations use such preliminary information as a
barometer for salary decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As in recent years, Fuller said the raise stagnation at 4
percent puzzled economists who would expect salaries to rise higher
in response to the continued low unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said employers were holding the line on fixed
compensation, probably in an effort to maintain earnings growth and
avoid price increases on goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   This year's survey outlook found that, since 1996, half the
employers surveyed had increased the number of employees eligible
for some kind of incentive pay. That means employers are more
likely to give pay increases that reward performance rather than
give annual raises as a matter of course.

   The 1999-2000 survey also echoes past years' findings that
executive raises are likely to be slightly higher than everyone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   Executive salaries are expected to rise 4.4 percent to 4.5
percent, compared with 4.2 percent for managers, professionals and
technical workers, 4.1 percent for nonexempt workers who are
eligible for overtime pay and 3.9 percent to 4 percent for
non-union hourly employees.

POST OFFICE STAFF DEALS WITH DEATH

News.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The condolence calls are still coming into the
Chatsworth post office from all over the country. If you need
anything, just ask, the callers say.
</P>
<P>
   Costco's Northridge store sent over 90 roses, one for each of
the letter carriers and supervisors in the Chatsworth office to
place on slain postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto's coffin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Forty carriers and supervisors from other San Fernando Valley
stations gave up a day off to cover for the Chatsworth carriers so
they could go to a service for Ileto and pay their last respects to
a fallen comrade.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had to ask them. They just showed up and did it.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle postal workers sent down a box of special black ribbons
with the postal logo on them Monday. Chatsworth Postmaster Ramona
Franco handed them out to her carriers before they went out on
their routes.
</P>
<P>
   Her office is filled with condolence cards, flowers, cookies and
candy sent by people from all over the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like this every day since the shooting,'' Franco
said Monday. ``The kindness shown by the community has touched us
and filled us with a deep sense of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to see this public display of caring for the men and
women who deliver the mail. It's been a rocky time for them.
</P>
<P>
   Their profession has been the butt of jokes and derision for
such a long time that a lot of these people had been thinking no
one out there really cared about the job they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the mail of this country through snow, rain, heat, gloom
of night _ and, yeah, even death last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost dark last Tuesday night when Franco and a
supervisor, Alfonso Ontiveros, got the OK from the Los Angeles
Police Department homicide detectives to take back their mail truck
from the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Still in shock and sick about the shooting death of Ileto, they
could have returned the truck to the station and said the heck with
delivering the rest of the mail on the route that night.
</P>
<P>
   A murderer was loose out there somewhere. He had already shot
and killed one mail carrier. What was to stop him from killing
another one that night?
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful anyone would have complained if the mail hadn't
gone through on route 18 last Tuesday. People would have
understood.
</P>
<P>
   But the mail did get through. Five carriers with flashlights
split up the rest of Ileto's route. They delivered every piece of
mail in that truck before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took a lot of bravery for our carriers to volunteer
to do that,'' Franco said. ``They didn't know if the killer was
still out there, hiding somewhere on those streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning _ with suspect Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. still
on the loose _ Ontiveros took off his supervisor's tie and loaded
up that mail truck to go back out on route 18 and deliver the mail
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was still a lot of apprehension and fear because the guy
was still at large, and I didn't want any of my people worrying
about it, so I scheduled myself to carry the route that day,''
Ontiveros said.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left the station, word came in that Furrow had
surrendered to police in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros scratched his name from the board and put carrier Eva
Agustin's name on route 18 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of support from the other carriers when I left at
12:30 p.m. because they knew it was going to be a tough, emotional
day for me,'' Agustin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I started delivering the first block, people were
already coming out of their homes, saying how sorry they were and
offering their sympathy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The words were nice to hear, Franco said. The phone calls,
cards, flowers and cookies were appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful feeling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's nice to see. This public display of caring for the
men and women who move the mail of this country through snow, rain,
heat, gloom of night _ and, yeah, even death last week.

WILD, WILD WIN FOR RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-ATHLETICS-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Yes, Dave Jauss said, it was foul. A foot, two feet,
what did it matter? The Red Sox first base coach dreaded what was
coming next.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see things like that,'' Jauss said of Brian Daubach's bid
for a game-winning grand slam, one that cleared the wrong side of
the right-field foul pole even as the Red Sox rookie raged at first
base umpire Mike DiMuro. ``That's your hit, then they get you out
on the next pitch. That's what they do in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But not to Daubach, not on this hot night that long will live in
the memories of those who one day will spin the tale of the
Belleville Basher, shaking their heads in sweet mystery at every
retelling of how the son of a small-town Illinois mailman delivered
yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, after fouling off five consecutive pitches with the
bases full, drove Tim Worrell's next pitch the opposite way, high
off the Monster. Darren Lewis, who was on third base, scored. Butch
Huskey, who was on second, scored. And Jose Offerman, who took off
from first as Worrell released his changeup, crossed the plate with
the run that gave the Sox a 6-5 win over the Oakland Athletics, one
that resonated with meaning far beyond its immediate impact on the
wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard even to describe, when you think about where I came
from,'' said Daubach, who didn't miss a backroads whistlestop on
his long, improbable trip to the big leagues. ``You do that in the
minor leagues, you do it in front of maybe a thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing compares to winning a game in Boston, in the bottom of
the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn on any TV, and you will see Daubach shedding any semblance
of his Midwest reserve, leaping off second base as if he'd been
shot out of a rocket launcher and throwing out his arms as if he
could gather all of Kenmore Square in one giddy, glorious embrace.
The crowd of 30,957, poised to file out after a near-miss, instead
surrounded Daubach as he transformed Joe Mooney's infield into his
personal dance floor, while Fenway Park organist Richard Giglio
shook the Back Bay night with the strains of ``Stars and Stripes
Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday,'' Jauss said, ``after he's been an outstanding major
leaguer, we'll look at this, and he'll sit back and be able to tell
his grandkids, and I'll be telling my kids' kids, about this night.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not now. Not yet. But today, he's the story, and everybody
who got us to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Sox clubhouse during that ninth-inning comeback, as
first Jason Varitek singled, then Huskey (on an 0-and-2 pitch), and
finally Offerman to load the bases, relievers Mark Guthrie and Rich
Garces were standing on the couch with clubhouse man Pookie
Jackson. They were shrieking at the big-screen TV, especially when
DiMuro threw out his arms, signaling a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was screaming, `No way,' '' said Garces, who followed
Guthrie's 3 1/3 scoreless innings of relief with 2 1/3 innings of
one-run work after the A's had leaped out to a 4-0 lead in the
third against starter Brian Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were jumping around,'' said Garces (and pity the upholstery
that had to bear his kangaroo act). ``It's so exciting, to come
back and win a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach has now driven in 15 runs in the last four games after
what Guthrie called ``one of the most incredible at-bats I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Five RBIs Friday night, six Saturday, one Sunday, the three to
win Monday night and cool off the A's, who were fresh off a
three-game sweep in Toronto and had opened August with 11 wins in
14 games. The A's were one pitch away from drawing into a tie for
the wild card. Instead, they fell two games behind the Sox, who
have now won 8 of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 6 inches away from winning this game,'' said Oakland
catcher A.J. Hinch, who hit a three-run home run in the third after
fouling off a squeeze bunt, then came that close to catching
Daubach's foul pop near the third-base railing on the Basher's last
at-bat. ``We threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach is hitting .408 since the All-Star break, with 10 home
runs in 26 games. He has 14 extra-base hits in his last 10 games.
Monday afternoon, he was named American League Player of the Week.
Monday night, he was claiming a higher reward, a niche of Red Sox
lore all his own, as improbable a story line as any heard in these
parts in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Truth stranger than fiction? No, Sox manager Jimy Williams said,
he has never heard of Joe Hardy, who sold his soul to the devil so
the lowly Washington Senators could win the pennant in ``Damn
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a musical?'' he said. ``No, I don't know that story.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he know?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this kid is a very good hitter,'' he said. ``He
really is.''

IT WAS A HOUSE OF CARDS FOR A'S IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-ATHLETICS-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Larry Whiteside 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When you ask the Oakland Athletics about the wild-card
race in the American League, their usual response is this: Where
else can you have so much fun on a major league baseball field in
August and September?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it couldn't have felt like much ``fun'' Monday night at
Fenway Park after a demoralizing loss in the ninth inning that
reminds you that playoff competition at this point in the season
can be a heartwarming or chilling experience, depending on whom
you're rooting for. With a 5-3 lead, the A's played a game of
chicken and lost when Brian Daubach spanked a three-run double.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that's what a wild-card race is all about.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear when the A's got into town that they were a worthy
entry in this wild-card derby. A three-game sweep in Toronto over
the weekend was impressive. All you had to do was look at the AL
West standings to see that the second-place A's were the best entry
from the East Bay in years. The club has power and pitching. The
bullpen is balanced and tough. Manager Art Howe usually makes all
the right moves.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows whether the A's have what it takes inside to
stay in the race, especially in head-to-head competition on enemy
soil. They led through eight innings but flinched in the ninth. It
all came down to a six-minute, 10-pitch duel between Daubach and
reliever Tim Worrell. It was classic Fenway baseball. And a classic
Fenway loss that the A's will have to avoid if they are truly to
contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about,'' said A's catcher A.J. Hinch.
``Middle to late August, it's a dogfight out there. We're going to
bounce back. If we want to be in the race, we have to bounce back.
These are the kind of games that playoff teams are going to have.
It's unfortunate that it got away from us but tomorrow's game
counts as much as today's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland got 6 1/3 strong innings out of Omar Olivares, a newly
acquired starter. Greg McMichael and Buddy Groom got a 5-3 lead to
42-year-old closer Doug Jones, but he couldn't close the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get any closer,'' said Howe. ``We came within four
inches of catching a pop fly that would have won it for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the Red Sox credit. They didn't quit. We just
couldn't add on after a four-run lead. With a club like them, you
just have to keep adding on and put them away. We gave them a
chance to get back in and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Jones been successful, Worrell would not have even gotten
the chance. But in tough series, Howe prefers to alternate his
closers. Jones didn't have it. Worrell's job was to overpower
Daubach, and if not, mow down Nomar Garciaparra, who was on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning,'' said Worrell, ``we were throwing fastballs
away. We came in twice and that's when we got two foul balls and
the popup. I came back with my changeup. Do I regret throwing the
changeup? No. Everything he fouled off was a fastball. You can't
just keep pumping fastballs in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones struggled and I had a chance to pick him up and our team
up. We've been playing good ball lately. I feel like we should have
been able to get one out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Howe had to admit that the dramatic hit by Daubach was
exciting to watch. He did not fault his pitcher. There is a war
going on out there and pitchers sometimes lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great at-bat,'' said Howe. ``But you didn't have much
choice but to face him. With Nomar on deck, you have to make him
swing the bat. The kid came through. We have to come back and get
after them. We've had tough ones like this early in the year and
we've come back. We have to do it again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hinch, ``This was a heavyweight fight. Nobody wanted to get
knocked out. We battled just like they did.''

Rangers hit five home runs in rout of Indians 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Rafael Palmeiro has been way too courageous with
this knee problem.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just another ho-hum 30-home run, 100-RBI season, he
could have spent the season doing his best Kirk Gibson imitation, a
pinch-hitter extraordinaire who comes up in crucial situations and
saves the day with a dramatic home run.
</P>
<P>
   He could be doing what he did last night against the Cleveland
Indians at sold-out Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, unable to start at first base because of swelling in
his knee, pinch hit in the seventh inning and hit a three-run home
run, a shot that broke a 5-5 tie and helped carry the Rangers to
13-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost like Gibson did it as a pinch hitter in the 1988
World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit different scenario,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``It was a nice win for us but ...''
</P>
<P>
   All right, Palmeiro didn't win a World Series game. But he did
help the Rangers increase their lead to 51/2 games in the American
League West after the Oakland Athletics lost to the Boston Red Sox
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but I'd still rather have my four at-bats in a game,''
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's home run was one of 11 hits _ including four home
runs _ the Rangers had in the final 31/3 innings, allowing them to
erase the Indians' 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had 16 hits and five home runs overall, including
four hits by catcher Ivan Rodriguez. In a game that showcased
several most valuable player candidates _ including Palmeiro,
Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez and second baseman Roberto
Alomar _ Rodriguez went 4-for-6 with two home runs, a stolen base
and three runs batted in. He is now hitting .427 with 11 home runs
and 27 RBI in his past 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good right now,'' Rodriguez said. ``I'm just
concentrating at the plate and trying to hit the ball hard. I'm not
looking to hit home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the firepower shown by Palmeiro and Rodriguez, Oates
said the biggest hit of the night might have been a ground ball
single up the middle by Lee Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has been a regular all season but suddenly found himself
on the bench this week because Juan Gonzalez has been limited to
designated hitter duty because of a strained hamstring muscle. That
left Palmeiro at first base and Stevens on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro's knee was aching yesterday, so Stevens got the job
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, I've kind of been the odd-man out,'' Stevens said.
``Johnny's had to shuffle the lineup. It's frustrating, but there's
nothing I can do about it. Obviously I want to play; I'm not going
to be a joy to be around, but I have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   His big moment came in the five-run seventh when the Rangers
went ahead for good. Mark McLemore's home run made it 5-4 against
Indians starter Dave Burba, and Rodriguez followed with a single to
left. Indians manager Mike Hargrove then brought in left-hander
Ricardo Rincon.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon struck out Rusty Greer, but Gonzalez singled to left and
Stevens, batting .338 against left-handers this season, then
bounced his single up the middle to bring home Rodriguez with the
tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, with runners at first and third, then brought in
right-hander Steve Reed to face Roberto Kelly, but Oates responded
by bring Palmeiro off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to try to make him get a pitch up,'' Palmeiro said.
``I knew he's a sinkerball pitcher and wanted me to \Rhit into a
double play\S. But I said to myself `Look for a ball up and get it
into the air.' Fortunately I was able to drive it out of the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson couldn't have done it better. nn

LEHMAN, PATE ALONG FOR THE RYDER
</HEADLINE>
 GLF-RYDERCUP-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By JIM MCCABE 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ In the end, it was no surprise that Ben Crenshaw
leaned on experience. It was a mild surprise as to whose experience
he favored.
</P>
<P>
   The United States captain for next month's Ryder Cup matches at
The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., Monday tabbed Tom Lehman and
Steve Pate _ who have a combined 26 years of PGA Tour play, 10
victories, and three Ryder Cups _ to complete the 12-man team that
will attempt to wrest the coveted trophy from the Europeans for the
first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said the decision process was painful, because it meant
bypassing players with whom he was friendly. Fred Couples, a
fixture on the last five Ryder Cup teams and a player many
predicted would get one of the nods, was the most notable omission.
Crenshaw said he also considered Bob Estes, Lee Janzen, Steve
Stricker, and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, 40, has played in the last two Ryder Cups, and his
selection was pretty much a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about his diligence and determination, his
strength and his character,'' said Crenshaw, who called Lehman late
Sunday night with the news.
</P>
<P>
   The second call went to 1991 Ryder Cup member Pate, though not
until Crenshaw had done some lengthy soul-searching. Not that the
US captain lacked faith in the 38-year-old Pate. On the contrary,
said Crenshaw, Pate ``is confident and he has played well and he
feels good about where his game is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to those whom he bypassed were hard, said Crenshaw.
Particularly the one to Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal note, that was the hardest to make,'' said
Crenshaw. ``The whole world loves Fred. Julie (Crenshaw's wife) and
I do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What worked in favor of Lehman and Pate worked against Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had said before that even if he plays mediocre, mediocre for
Fred is tremendous for somebody else,'' said Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Couples's recent form has barely been mediocre _
that is, when he has even played. He skipped the British Open, as
well as the three Tour events leading up to this weekend's PGA
Championship, just his 14th event of the year and fourth since June
1. He was 17th in the standings (the Top 10 are automatic picks),
but faded with weekend scores of 75-72 at Medinah CC and never came
close to playing himself onto the team.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Pate, on the other hand, have been in the weekly
lineup most of the year, their passion to make the Ryder Cup team
hardly a secret. At Medinah, Lehman tied for 34th, completing his
ninth tournament since June 1, a stretch that included the Greater
Milwaukee Open and Greater Hartford Open. Those are tournaments he
normally would not have entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be on this team, and I knew I needed to
play,'' said Lehman, whose year has been solid. He lost at Bay Hill
in a playoff to Tim Herron, was fifth at the Greater Greensboro,
and runner-up at Milwaukee and the recent Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   Pate's schedule was just as hectic. He has played 21 times this
year, seven times since June 1 (it would have been eight, but he
withdrew from the GHO after a death in the family). He closed the
week at Medinah 73-69 to finish tied for eighth, his fifth Top 10
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Pate, Crenshaw has a fiery competitor, one who ``would walk
through a wall for you if you asked him to.''
</P>
<P>
   And after a week in which his top stars _ Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Phil Mickelson, and Mark O'Meara _ voiced opinions about the
Ryder Cup that prompted an emotional condemnation from Crenshaw,
the captain was most assuredly going to pick someone in whom he
sees loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Pate fit the bill, and Crenshaw emphasized that the
pay-for-play issue that divided the team during a Tuesday meeting
was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to all the players,'' said Crenshaw.
``Regardless of what happened this week and how it happened, we
have to be a team because we know that (the Europeans) are a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Lehman has demonstrated leadership in so many ways. Steve
Pate is somebody that the players know and understand where he
sits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said he was eager to gain revenge for Ryder Cup losses in
1995 and 1997 that he was a part of. Pate's Ryder Cup experience is
bittersweet; the US won the year he played, but Pate was injured
and played in only one match.
</P>
<P>
   If Crenshaw's call to Couples was a personal struggle (they have
been friends for many years), the one to Estes was tough from a
professional standpoint. Estes was 15th in the standings entering
the PGA Championship and needed to finish at least in a two-way tie
for fifth to jump into the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Like Crenshaw, Estes is a University of Texas graduate, a fact
that was not lost on the captain. When Estes got to 8 under through
15 holes Sunday, he moved into fourth place. But bogeys on 16 and
17 dropped him into a tie for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that was lacking in his column was
experience,'' said Crenshaw. ``I look forward to him on many Ryder
Cup teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But not at The Country Club Sept. 24-26. That roster is filled.

PROPOSED FLOOD INSURANCE CHANGE WOULD LIMIT CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By Catherine Hollingsworth   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Homeowners who enjoy subsidized federal flood
insurance should build responsibly to avoid repeat disasters, say
members of Congress who want to cut the high cost of the program by
limiting claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than find a home farther from the water's edge, many
homeowners in flood-prone areas stay in the same spot _ close to
the coastline or a river. But several lawmakers want to make it
harder to collect on flood insurance in such vulnerable areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should not ... subsidize homeowners who choose to
live in the high flood risk areas,'' Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb.,
said this month in introducing legislation that would limit repeat
insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., has vowed to fight the bill, dubbed
the ``Two Floods and You Are Out of the Taxpayer's Pocket Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the National Flood Insurance Program would
provide up to $400 million to either buy or flood proof properties
that have had more than one claim over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   If property owners refuse the government's offer, they could end
up paying more for their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson said the bill is unfair to coastal
states. ``We're committed to killing the legislation.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone in Louisiana telling someone in Nebraska
that they'll lose insurance if they're struck by a tornado twice,''
Johnson said. ``Protection from natural disasters is the reason we
have insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Emergency Management Agency says repeat claims
put a strain on its National Flood Insurance Program, which has a
debt of $738 million. In some cases, property owners have claimed
losses worth more than the value of their property, according to
FEMA.
</P>
<P>
   The flood insurance program pays an average of $675 million in
claims a year. Roughly 30 percent of that, or $200 million, is
spent covering repetitive losses.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of repetitive flood losses come from 10
states: Louisiana, which has more repeat claims than any other
state, plus California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know what the risks are and we're paying for flood
after flood,'' said Billy Penn, spokesman for the FEMA's Dallas
office. Starting in 1974, FEMA began to map communities across the
country to determine their flood risk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Penn said, the federal insurance costs to individual
homeowners don't reflect the varying risks.
</P>
<P>
   He described the program as ``a bad deal'' for property owners
who live in lower-risk areas.
</P>
<P>
   But Louisiana lawmakers argue the state is a special case, with
its low elevation and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. The bill
leaves the state few options, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., one of the bill's authors, said
the proposal is cost effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending federal dollars to prevent loss is not only more
fiscally responsible than continually paying to clean up after the
fact, but it's also safer,'' he said.

MARLINS WIN AS MONDESI MAKES NICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi was late for another team stretch,
but this time he had a good reason. For the first time since the
Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder laced into his manager and club
management last week, all sides sat and talked.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, his agent Jeff Moorad, manager Davey Johnson, general
manager Kevin Malone and Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano met
before the Dodgers' 7-5 loss to Florida at Dodger Stadium on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And while all sides presented a feel-good, happy ending to the
ordeal that began last Wednesday when Mondesi demanded a trade, no
one said the trade demand was rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi declined comment, but he did apologize to Johnson and
Malone during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul was remorseful and expressed those feelings to both Davey
and Kevin,'' Moorad said. ``I think he is looking forward to
continuing to play hard and, hopefully, successfully with the team
over the last six weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a session designed to take appropriate steps, make
amends and move on. Raul is a Dodger. Not withstanding his comments
of the last week, he's going to give his all for the team and he's
hopeful, over time, the fans and the organization will forgive
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans' forgiveness might be hard to come by, especially in a
season in which the Dodgers haven't come close to the playoff race
and Mondesi is hitting .247. They continued to boo him every time
he came to the plate against the Marlins, and jeered when he
committed a sixth-inning error and was caught stealing in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, thanks to the Dodgers' PR machine, issued a statement
of regret the day after ripping into Johnson and Malone, and then
told his two targets he was sorry during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He personally apologized and I do feel he's sorry about what
he said and he's ready to move forward,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was called by the Dodgers after Mondesi blasted
Johnson and Malone while the team was in Montreal. It came after
Mondesi was not in the starting lineup for a second straight day,
punishment for arriving to the ballpark late for the team stretch.
Sources said Mondesi has been late for numerous team stretches this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In a profanity-laced interview last Wednesday, Mondesi said he
was tired of what he perceived to be a the lack of confidence
Johnson and Malone showed in him.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials wanted to meet Friday, when the team returned
from its 10-game road trip, but Moorad was on vacation and couldn't
get back into town before the weekend, so the meeting was pushed
back to Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel what we did today was put it behind us and move
forward,'' Graziano said. ``It was good for us to sit down and talk
face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it drew ire from fans that Mondesi wasn't suspended by
the club after he made the comments about his two immediate bosses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though Mondesi was held out of the starting lineup for
two days in Montreal, he was a pinch-hitter in both games and
returned to the starting lineup Thursday. He started his fifth
straight game against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to be fined again, but the amount of such a fine
wasn't talked about during the meeting. Instead, it was designed to
get all the parties talking again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a positive, productive meeting and we're moving
forward,'' Malone said. ``We'll still deal with the issues
internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called the meeting ``positive, constructive'' but didn't
want to discuss it, saying instead he wanted to turn the page and
not deal with it any more.
</P>
<P>
   But Mondesi's future with the Dodgers after this season wasn't
addressed, and none of the participants wanted to talk about what
they plan to do once the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   While Mondesi is one of the sports' most talented players,
moving him in the offseason could be chore because of his contract.
He's guaranteed $20.5 million over the next two seasons, but he
hasn't produced like a $10 million ballplayer this season.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Mondesi has experienced disciplinary
problems. He's been fined numerous times for violating team rules,
including missing a mandatory workout and sitting in the bullpen
for half an inning instead of returning to the bench.

WILL D-BACKS LAND IN AL WEST IN SHAKE-UP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They are poised to become the first team to win a
division title in its second year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere down the road, they could become the first team in
more than 100 years to make the playoffs in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the winds of realignment are swirling once again, and the
hottest rumor has the Diamondbacks moving to the American League.
Nothing is certain, but Tampa Bay is lobbying hard to get out of
the American League East. Schedule and travel concerns abound
across the major leagues. The Expos might leave Montreal. And there
are some serious geographic imbalances within the current
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   By agreement, the Diamondbacks can be moved arbitrarily any time
within the next three years. If it happens, it will likely occur
before the 2001 or 2002 season, and renewed speculation has the
Diamondbacks landing in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo has heard the same
things, and his conversation with Commissioner Bud Selig on Monday
did nothing to dispel the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a team player,'' Colangelo said. ``They have the right to
do what they want to do. I put my trust in the commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be asinine to realign an expansion team, especially for
a community just starting to embrace rivalries with the Dodgers and
the Giants. And realistically, it's highly unlikely Selig will risk
upsetting Colangelo and one of the game's few flourishing
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   But if it happened _ the Milwaukee Brewers are the only team to
switch leagues since 1900 _ there is one up-side.
</P>
<P>
   The growing dilemma at first base would be instantly resolved.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Travis Lee hobbled around the clubhouse on crutches.
The poster boy for the Sophomore Jinx. In his place is Erubiel
Durazo, a kid who has feasted on major league pitching. And you
have to wonder: Is the position big enough for the both of them?
</P>
<P>
   Not if the team remains in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the Diamondbacks erred in their handling of Lee,
a stallion suddenly stuck with a bat of Swiss cheese. For nothing
but confidence and his own sanity, Lee should've been sent to the
minor leagues weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: In his second season with Houston, Luis Gonzalez
struggled just like Lee. He was sent to the Triple-A affiliate in
Tucson, where he tore up minor league pitching. He came back two
weeks later and has been rock steady ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wake-up call,'' Gonzalez said. ``And it did wonders for my
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit late for that, but don't believe that the Diamondbacks
were about to ship Lee to the minor leagues before he sprained his
ankle on Sunday. If that were the case, someone explain why he was
shagging fly balls in right field, preparing to be an emergency
outfielder in case Steve Finley's bad back gets worse?
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is, for all the thunder in his bat, Durazo is a
liability in the field. And in theory, one key error could mean the
difference between a champagne shower and second place. Between a
pennant and a quick playoff exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis Lee is going to be a great player,'' the Cubs' Mark
Grace said. ``You've got to stick with a kid when he's struggling.
My rookie season, I made 17 errors. I was the master at turning the
3-6-3 double play into the 3-7-5. I kept throwing that SOB to
Rafael Palmeiro in left field, who kept throwing it back to Vance
Law at third base. But I learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I know Buck (Showalter) was caught between a rock and a
hard place. But Lee and (Colorado's) Todd Helton are going to be
the first basemen carrying the torch when guys like myself, Fred
McGriff, Andres Galarraga, Alex Karros and Jeff Bagwell are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you can't give up on Lee after one season of hardship. And
even though he'd have a wonderful future as a designated hitter,
can you afford to trade Durazo? A kid who looks like the next Sean
Casey?
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the Yankees. The American League doesn't look like such
a bad idea, after all. &QL;

CARDS, SHELTON TRY TO BREAK IMPASSE  
 BUT LITTLE PROGRESS REPORTED SO FAR IN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ On a Monday when tragedy struck deeply and little
else seemed to go right, there was a glimmer of hope that the
contract negotiation between the Cardinals and first-round pick
L.J. Shelton has moved from impasse to promising.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's agent, Denver-based Lamont Smith, and Rod Graves,
assistant to the Cardinals president, were locked together in a
room Monday in the Valley trying to break an impasse that has kept
Shelton out of training camp since its start.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's advisers reported that little progress has been made
but they would remain in town and talks would resume today.
</P>
<P>
   The team also has two veteran holdouts _ wide receiver Rob Moore
and defensive tackle Mark Smith.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the parties were negotiating, the Cardinals
coaches and players were reeling from news that offensive linemen
Ernest Dye and Lester Holmes and defensive lineman Carl Simpson,
had been injured in a one-car rollover, 24 miles south of Flagstaff
on Interstate 17.
</P>
<P>
   The accident left Dye in marathon surgery at Flagstaff Medical
Center as trauma surgeons tried to save his fractured right arm,
which was nearly amputated.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Shelton and the Cardinals are talking is a
startling development, considering Shelton and Smith held a news
conference in Denver on Saturday in which they ripped the team for
failing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who before his holdout was expected to contend for the
starting left offensive tackle job, said he wouldn't sign with the
Cardinals unless they gave him a four-year deal or a five-year
contract that included extras.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have $909,605 that they can pay Shelton this
season from their remaining rookie pool. Smith claims the Cardinals
have offered only a $2.6 million signing bonus on a five-year deal,
when they can offer as much as $3.673 million.
</P>
<P>
   On a four-year deal, which the Cardinals are not interested in,
they can offer Shelton $2.94 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the Saturday news conference, Smith also claimed he told team
Vice President Bill Bidwill Jr. on draft day that they wouldn't
accept a straight deal for five years. Smith said, ``He told me, `I
think we can live with that. We're going to take him, anyway.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bidwill Jr: ``My version of what happened is that I called
and asked if they would agree to a straight deal. He put me on hold
to talk to L.J. They said they would like to keep their options
open and not rule out anything. They said they would work with us
to get a fair deal done. I said we could live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he can misconstrue it to say we would give
him voidable years or escalators. I had the same conversation with
(Cardinals top pick) David Boston's agent and (Kansas City
first-round pick) John Tait's agent. We didn't talk about years or
salaries. I was just trying to rule that out from the beginning,
not trying to shove a bad deal down their throats.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only three first-round holdouts remaining in the NFL,
quarterback Akili Smith of Cincinnati, Tait and Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   If Shelton and the Cardinals are able to reach agreement, it
would go a long way toward solving a rapidly growing numbers
problem on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Dye and Holmes, coupled with elbow surgery Saturday
on guard Chris Dishman, and the fact that offensive linemen Matt
Joyce (knee) and Jerome Daniels (groin pull) were in the Valley
having injuries evaluated, left the team lacking offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had eight lineman who practiced today,'' Coach Vince Tobin
said. ``A couple guys, Matt and Jerome, went down to the Valley to
have injuries checked out. Whether they'll be able to practice
(today), we don't know. We would like to bring another lineman in
here if we possibly can.'' &QL;

PARK'S WOES CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ The park Chan Ho Park once owned has become his
bane. He failed to win again at Dodger Stadium, but by now that's
hardly news.
</P>
<P>
   That he pitched well is newsworthy, though it didn't matter.
Park, who's winless in 12 home starts this season, saw his personal
winless streak extend to six starts as the Florida Marlins beat the
Los Angeles Dodgers 7-5 Monday at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Wilson hit a grand slam for the Marlins and Kevin Millar
homered and drove in two.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many reasons the Dodgers toil near the NL West cellar
is Park's performance. At one time he was unbeatable at home. He
won his first six decisions here last season and had an 11-game
winning streak, one shy of Orel Hershiser's club record.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Park is 19-15 with a 3.36 ERA at Chavez Ravine.
But there's been no sign of that this season.
</P>
<P>
   Though he allowed three runs (two earned) against the Marlins on
five hits, he's 0-6 with a 5.86 ERA at home.
</P>
<P>
   __ A's looking for help: With leadoff man/center fielder Tony
Phillips out for the season with a broken leg, expect A's manager
Billy Beane to make a few calls in hopes of landing a capable
replacement before the Aug. 31 waiver trading deadline to continue
their push for the wild card spot. And the Dodgers expect him to
inquire about outfielder Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   A's personnel have scouted the Dodgers throughout the season,
and there's always interest in Hollandsworth because his small
contract ($850,000) and youth. The A's, rich in pitching in the
minors, would also be good trading partners for the Dodgers, who
are trying to rebuild their farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland doesn't figure to last long with Ryan Christensen
(batting .216) and Jason McDonald (.202) sharing time in center
field, which could hasten a move.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hollandsworth hasn't batted leadoff this season, he has
221 at-bats from that spot in the order and is a career .299
leadoff hitter. Also, A's first baseman Jason Giambi sprained his
knee Monday against Boston, and Hollandsworth has experience
playing first.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers like Hollandsworth, but with $70 million of
guaranteed salary tied up in outfielders for the next few seasons,
playing time could be hard to come by unless Gary Sheffield, Devon
White or Raul Mondesi are traded.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring-training rhetoric: Dodgers officials are still willing
to listen to offers from the Fort McDowell Indian Community
regarding a spring-training site on the tribe's property in
Arizona, but tribal leaders said they might scrap plans to build a
baseball complex and focus on another way to develop their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to regroup and review other economic options,''
tribal lawyer Ed Roybal said. ``We're going to a neutral corner.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other options the Fort McDowell folks talked about
before attempting to woo the Dodgers was a water park, which Roybal
didn't discount.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers director of business development Fred Coons said the
club hasn't talked with Fort McDowell since rejecting its offer for
a $40 million complex two weeks ago, but he said discussions could
reopen at any point.
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Manager Davey Johnson was ejected in
the bottom of the seventh for arguing a call by second-base umpire
Mike Winters on a slide by Trenidad Hubbard. . . . Dodgers
right-hander Ismael Valdes isn't expected to miss a start despite
being bothered by a sore back. . . . Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca
and pitchers Jamie Arnold and Mike Judd will participate in the
Arizona Fall League, as will minor-league pitchers Eric Gagne and
Ricky Stone and infielder Adam Riggs. Outfielder Bubby Crosby,
catcher David Ross and pitchers Adrian Burnside and Craig Taczay
will play in the newly formed California Fall League.

ATTN: TEXAS PREP EDITORS  
 WIN OR LOSE, GILBERT, PARKER IN FOR BIG YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILBERT, Ariz. - The room is packed with young faces. Each one
is far too intimidated to speak to the man with the Popeye-like
forearms, stone expression and intense eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Even this is novel for Jesse Parker, perhaps the most successful
_ and controversial _ high school football coach in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The scene has nothing to do with Parker's domineering coaching
presence. After three decorated decades in the classroom, Parker is
attending new-teacher orientation workshops at Gilbert High School.
</P>
<P>
   Parker might be back, but it is not without missing a beat. At
60, he's a new teacher and new head football coach all over again.
Classes and football practice began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His four-year sojourn to Texas wiped out his celebrity status
from this wave of high school athletes. Unlike the days when the
Toros were reared to play for Parker at Mesa Mountain View, the
only reason his Gilbert players know of him is because of the
tarnishing his image took last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Parker quit his Texas coaching and athletic director job over a
player-swatting incident and had his name dragged through the
``pink belly'' uproar at Mountain View, the football powerhouse
with his scribble on the 1975 blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd return to Arizona,'' said Parker, who won
five state championships at Mountain View (1978, 1983, 1986 and
1993) and Camelback (1974) and reached nine title games in all.
``(Gilbert administrators) must understand the fact that them
choosing me for a coach puts them under scrutiny. If they would've
hired one of the other candidates, nobody would've paid any
attention to Gilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers can't hide now. Parker wants to make Gilbert the
first Arizona school to win a state title in every class. On paper,
the 5A title seems a tall order. The Tigers return marginal talent
from an injury-riddled 4-7 season that got Doc Holaday, now a Mesa
Dobson assistant, fired.
</P>
<P>
   But between Parker's legacy and the mediocrity of the newly
formed Fiesta Region that moves Gilbert away from the Mesa schools,
expectations have taken a 180-degree turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go for it all,'' senior two-way tackle Dan
Mullins said. ``He's done it before, and he can do it again with
us.'' &QL; 
They're finding out
</P>
<P>
   The players heard the tales of drill-sergeant discipline going
into spring ball but still got a shocking dose of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   About six lettermen left the program before this month's
preseason ``boot camp'' in Round Valley, where the four daily
practices again stunned the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Monday's real practice. And just wait until they put
on pads for the first time under Parker on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to go all out because they don't want to find
out what happens if they don't,'' senior fullback/linebacker Ben
Kerwin said. ``We don't want to know the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   That aura is what makes Parker, an otherwise amiable man away
from the field and a decorated teacher, so controversial as a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Coach Bernie Busken and assistant Jerry Wheeler were
suspended for a Mountain View playoff game last year, it was for
continuing the program's tradition of pink bellies _ a form of
punishment in which players slap a teammates' bare stomach with an
open hand.
</P>
<P>
   The practice originated elsewhere in the Toros' athletic
program, according to Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never did it once in season,'' Parker said. ``It wasn't so
much punishment. I guess the kids would call it that. We would
wrestle and if you'd lose, you got a pink belly. Losing ought to
hurt a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, it's OK to lose. I don't think you ought to
get used to losing or accept losing. Out of losing should come a
determination to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   That credo rang loud in Parker's head after leaving Mountain
View for Texas High in Texarkana. The trouble there started quickly
when his $57,000 coaching salary (with no classes to teach and an
AD stipend to boot) was published just after teachers' salaries had
been slashed.
</P>
<P>
   The battle on the field was his biggest challenge ever. &QL; 
Big change in Texas &QL; 
Parker left Mountain View, a suburban school of little ethnic
diversity, for a campus where the student body's majority was Black
and the community was poor.
</P>
<P>
   Texas High had three losing seasons, totaling 12-20, under
Parker but did win its first playoff game in 28 years in Class 4A,
which has more schools (226) than all of Arizona (213). Parker felt
he had captured the team's confidence with a new-found compassion
and turned the program around when last season's incident at a
preseason leadership seminar prompted his exit.
</P>
<P>
   Parker whacked an out-of-line player with a switch that he says
was the size of a straw, a form of corporal punishment he had used
before and understood to be acceptable in the district. The
superintendent, who came on after Parker's hire, disagreed. Their
ongoing feud prompted Parker to resign a week before the 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   Parker declined comment on that situation, although he did cast
some blame on himself and wonders why he ever left Arizona. He
spent the year off visiting one son in Germany, watching another's
games at Arkansas Tech and joining wife Latsy at church for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things happened in Texarkana for me, Latsy and the kids
there, and people don't understand that,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   As football faded out of his life, his passion for it did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be even stronger because I'm more aware of individual
problems,'' said Parker, one of six sons of an Oklahoma
sharecropper. ``I learned a lot about people. It made me more
compassionate, especially for the less fortunate. I discovered
Black kids in the South have a much harder road to hoe than even
books will have you believe. I'll reach out to players more.'' &QL; 
Loyalty always there
</P>
<P>
   A testament to Parker's methods is the indisputable player
loyalty he has developed at every stop from Camelback to Texas.
Gilbert's gate receipts could skyrocket just from the thousands of
people he coached and taught who commonly fill his classroom each
Homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see a spanking new Jesse Parker,'' St.
Mary's Coach Pat Farrell said. ``I'd be disappointed if I did.
There's an element to Coach Parker's theory that is very sound. If
the community responds to his style, they'll regain success
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules have been laid by his community, namely the
administration that put Gilbert's reputation on the line when old
friend and district athletic director, Joe Pico, campaigned to hire
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pink bellies, of course,'' Parker said he was told. ``I
wouldn't do it, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Swats? He said he never used them in Arizona, where he is the
third-winningest coach with a 232-64-3 record in 29 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics remain, be the coaches, parents, educators or critics
at large who question his ways and the message they send.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a proven winner so people overlook the other
stuff,'' Horizon Coach Doug Shaffer said. ``He's a great coach, but
I don't agree with all the things he does off and on the field.
It's good for him to be back, though, because it makes everybody
else better.''
</P>
<P>
   His staff and players will not be outworked. The goal remains
the same: win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was, `Where are we going?' '' Kerwin said.
``This year, it's, `Wow, look what we've got.' ''

LEHMAN, PATE GET RYDER CUP CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Tom Lehman has played on two straight U.S. Ryder
Cup teams that have lost to the Europeans, and he doesn't like the
feeling very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a sense of urgency to get it right this time,'' he said
Monday. ``I'm sick of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman will get a chance to help the United States do that after
being added to the team, along with Steve Pate, by captain Ben
Crenshaw on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-man team will face the Europeans on Sept. 24-26 at The
Country Club in Brookline, Mass., and Crenshaw said the site
weighed heavily in making his picks.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has made his affection for playing in the Ryder Cup
well known, was an easy selection, but Crenshaw said he struggled
with the second pick.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples was considered the favorite, and others considered
were Bob Estes, Chris Perry, Steve Stricker, Lee Janzen and senior
tour player Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the hardest call to make from an emotional standpoint
was Freddy,'' Crenshaw said of Couples, who has played in the past
five Ryder Cups. ``Mediocre for Fred can be tremendous for some
other guys, but he just hasn't played much this year, and the
bottom line is I had to do what I thought was best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples finished 17th in the standings. The only points he
earned since March were in a tie for 10th in the Buick Classic on
June 28, which also was the last time he played until last
weekend's PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a year when I wanted to take some time with my
family,'' Couples said after completing Sunday's round in the PGA.
``It probably looks like I didn't play all year and now I want to
be on the team, but if I wasn't playing well I wouldn't consider
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate has four top-10 finishes this season and reached the
semifinals of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship. He's
played in only two Ryder Cup matches, in the 1991 event, where he
was injured in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a player's player,'' Crenshaw said. ``He has a sense
of humor that players enjoy, but he's also a very fierce competitor
who would walk through a wall if you asked him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Lehman exudes leadership. I can't say enough about his
diligence, determination, strength and character. I couldn't be
happier than to have him on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who underwent shoulder surgery in December, has focused
intently on his game over the past two months in hopes of making
the team. He noted that he hasn't been to his Valley home since May
28, and will continue to play and practice until the matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a good chance of making the team,'' Lehman
said. ``I've played my best golf over the last two months. I
haven't been home because I wanted to do whatever I could to make
the team. I'm thrilled to be part of it. It's a great honor to be
selected and I can't wait to get to Brookline.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Pate join a team that includes Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton,
Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Jeff Maggert, who
were the top 10 in points.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw has scheduled a team practice at The Country Club for
Aug. 30. All are expected to attend except Woods and O'Meara, who
made commitments well before the practice date was announced.
Crenshaw said the two golfers told him they would practice at the
course on their own before the event.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw noted that Pate finished third at Brookline in the 1988
U.S. Open, 2 shots behind Nick Faldo and Curtis Strange, and that
Pate likes the match-play format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that was a big factor,'' Pate said. ``I've always
loved match play. I like the fact that at the end of each day,
you've either won a match or lost a match. I swing more freely
during match play because if you make a 10, it's not a big deal. It
just means you lost one hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw wouldn't say if he is planning to pit Woods against
Spanish teenage sensation Sergio Garcia in a singles match that
might offer a replay of their electrifying battle for the PGA
Championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that Crenshaw was moved by watching the two
young lions of pro golf fight it out at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw (Sunday) was so telling for the future of golf,''
Crenshaw said. ``There's no doubt we saw something in Sergio that
is electrifying and captivating. The shot he hit on 16 was one of
the greatest things I've ever seen on a golf course, and Tiger hit
fabulous shots all week. They are the future of golf.'' &QL;

MERCURY CAN SHIFT PLAYOFF PICTURE

<P>
   PHOENIX - With no Yo at America West Arena tonight, the Mercury
could pass go to collect sole possession of the WNBA record for
most consecutive home wins.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake for Phoenix (14-15) is avoiding a sweep by the
Sacramento Monarchs, a team it was 8-0 against before this season,
and moving to .500 overall.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff-bound Monarchs (19-11) will be in their second full
game without Yolanda Griffith, who is in contention for three major
postseason awards: Most Valuable Player, Newcomer of the Year and
Defensive Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 center had a partial tear of the medial meniscus in
her right knee repaired Monday. She is out at least through this
final week of the regular season and probably Sacramento's
first-ever playoff game, which will be Aug. 24 against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A quick healing Griffith might have a chance to return for the
Western Conference semifinals against Houston, Aug. 26, 29 and if
necessary 30, should the Monarchs still be standing after the
one-game third- at second-place showdown, new this season.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why tonight is important. Sacramento has a half-game
lead on LA (18-11) for the right to host at UC Davis next Tuesday
(its usual home, ARCO Arena, is committed to the U.S. Gymnastics
Championships).
</P>
<P>
   What the depth-shy Monarchs must do is figure out how to win
without Griffith, which they managed Friday when the injury
occurred but couldn't repeat the next night even with 28 points
from Griffith's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Griffith) gets those numbers and we get the win,'' said 6-4
Tangela Smith after a 97-89 loss to Utah. ``I don't care if I get
the numbers as long as we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a sleek second-year pro who was the 1998 Big Ten Player
of the Year for Iowa, had problems late in the game against the
Starzz's 6-5 Elena Baranova. And without Smith off the bench, the
Monarchs' post support essentially is limited to 6-1 Linda Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   In the three wins over Phoenix, Griffith put up 20-point,
13.3-rebound averages and two of her league-high 17 double-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had an important 13 points and six rebounds in the last
meeting as Sacramento never trailed after 2-0 despite the absence
of shooting guard/forward Ruthie Bolton-Holifield because of back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton-Holifield, in her comeback season from knee surgery,
knocked down 25 points in each of the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Ticha Penicheiro is the league assists leader (7.1
per game). Kedra Holland-Corn has raked the Mercury with 19
points-per-game average, including 9 for 14 from three-point range,
10 steals and perhaps the best defense played against Michele Timms
and Kristi Harrower.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury 6-8 backup center Maria Stepanova had the second of four
consecutive double-doubles against Sacramento. She is averaging
14.2 points and 9.2 rebounds since Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night (Sunday) was one of her best performances,'' said
Mercury assistant coach Carrie Graf of Stepanova's 10 points and
seven rebounds in a 65-54 win over Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played smart basketball. She didn't try and score every
time she touched the ball. We've made a point of saying to her,
`Maria, that's easy to defend.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three touches, she threw the ball back outside, then
it opens it up for our perimeter and it opens it back up for her.
She showed more of how she needs to play, and if she gets the
numbers to go along with that, she's much closer to reaching that
potential.'' &QL;

HAWAIIAN FRASER MAKING WAVES AT UA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. - A year ago, he felt a little bit like a surfer
who suddenly had been stranded. No beach. No waves. Just miles and
miles of empty desert and distant hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first couple of days, I must have called my mom
every night,'' Keoni Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   Janielle Fraser couldn't send her son a solid set of waves from
the nearby beaches of Kailua, the Fraser family's hometown on the
windward side of Oahu, Hawaii's most populated island.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just told me to hang in there, night after night,'' Fraser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Give mom a scholarship. With her encouragement, Arizona has one
of the nation's most promising defensive ends. Actually, a lot of
the promise was displayed repeatedly last year. In a season full of
surprises, Fraser might have been the biggest one of all.
</P>
<P>
   He was a virtual unknown 12 months ago when he arrived at
Cochise College for the Wildcats' annual summer ritual, Camp
Cochise. But after just a few games, Fraser was doing things that
made running backs wince and offensive coordinators wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Who is that guy?
</P>
<P>
   Fraser forced the question to be asked enough that it's safe to
say he's a known quantity as he begins his sophomore season. Often,
the second time around is the toughest of all for a young player
who achieved unexpected success in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be no surprises this time. But there don't appear to be
any illusions, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I'm going to have to play a lot harder,'' Fraser
said. ``By now, people know I like to stop the run, basically. I'm
sure I'll probably be seeing a lot of double teams and different
looks. Things like that. I'm just going to have to adapt to it when
it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's adjustment, Fraser has proved himself to be very adept
at the task. The long trip from Polynesia to the Arizona desert is
nothing if not a trip full of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been around some, too, so that helps,'' Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   He's the son of retired Marine Sgt. Norman Fraser, a Desert
Storm veteran. There have been stops at bases in California and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Washington, D.C., but Hawaii is home,'' said
Fraser, who has a shock of hair that is dyed blond. ``Life on the
Mainland is just a little too quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, quick is what Fraser is all about. At 6 feet,
270 pounds, he's built a little bit like one of those wide-bodied,
close-to-the-ground Humvees. He moves like one, too.
</P>
<P>
   He displays terrific balance and agility along the line of
scrimmage. Last year, offensive linemen simply could not knock him
off his feet, much less find him.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's sudden emergence coincided on the same night that the
rest of the nation began to notice Arizona. The Wildcats' victory
at Washington is remembered for quarterback Ortege Jenkins'
game-winning flip into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But without Fraser, nobody would have been doing any
somersaults, then or later. He was credited with two solo tackles
at the goal line. He kept Washington from scoring so that Jenkins
could.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden impact surprised more than just Washington and
subsequent opponents. It surprised him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did, it really did,'' said Fraser, who will return as a
starter along a defensive line that many think could be among the
nation's best. ``As a freshman, you just hope you get a chance to
make plays. When you first do, you think to yourself, `Wow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser sounds as though he's energized at the prospect of being
something of a marked man this season. He hopes offenses will try
to challenge him, Joe Tafoya, Mike Robertson and Anthony Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fraser even loves the desert island that happens to
be Arizona's preseason football camp. He can't hear the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But he can hear the hits. Fraser likes to hit almost as much as
likes to surf. ``Only had to call mom twice this time,'' said
Fraser, who likes the sound of his new home. &QL;

READY TO REPAY FAITH IN HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA, Ariz. - When his knee quit on him, so did most
of the universities on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   One game into his senior season at California's Irvine High
School, Alfred Williams hyperextended his knee. Suddenly, the
highly sought recruit's phone became uncharacteristically quiet.
Only one coach continued to show up: Arizona State offensive
coordinator Dan Cozzetto's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my man,'' Williams said. ``He's the only one that stuck
with me. I'll never forget that.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hopes to thank the Sun Devils on the field this season.
He is a key figure in ASU's planned four-man safety rotation and
one of the defense's best athletes.
</P>
<P>
   He was a standout tailback as a high school junior and a state
hurdles champion, but that wasn't enough for several Pac-10
schools, including UCLA, which felt the severity of his knee injury
made him too much of a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Cozzetto felt differently. When he met with ASU's staff, he made
a strong case for the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lectured my staff 100 times about this,'' ASU Coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``If there's somebody you really believe in, then
you've got to pound the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny doesn't necessarily operate that way. He really is not
very vocal at all in the staff room. But he kept saying, `This guy
can play. This guy's going to be OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Dick Arbuckle showed the same kind of commitment
toward former linebacker Pat Tillman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good hunch, we went on it and it worked,'' Cozzetto
said. ``I just did what (Snyder) taught me to do. I felt this kid
was a player and made a stand for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Snyder had faith in me, and the rest is history. I think
he's going to be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils need him to be. Their five safeties combined for
only three ASU starts last year, and all belong to Willie Daniel,
who was thrown into the fire as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what was perceived as a weak link is not that at all, said
Snyder, who likes his returning players as well as a pair of junior
college transfers _ Monte' Franks and Craig Koontz.
</P>
<P>
   The two transfers, Williams and Daniel likely will make up the
four-man rotation. Redshirt freshman Brandon Falkner also hopes to
work into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to work out well,'' Williams said. ``We're
all young and athletic. The players they brought in are real
tenacious, real fighters. We're called the wild dogs, which
describes us well.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams still has four seasons of eligibility, despite playing
in two games in 1998. Pinched nerves sidelined him most of the
year, and he was granted a redshirt exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Williams' leadership and discipline came be traced
to his family. His father, Alfred Sr., is a chief warrant officer
in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline wasn't the only thing taught in the Williams home.
Alfred Sr. is trained in Japanese martial arts, and it inspired his
son, who likes to practice on his roommates, Daniel and defensive
end Erik Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to watch him,'' Flowers said. ``He likes to sneak
up on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The discipline as well as the closeness of Williams' family
impressed ASU's coaches during the recruiting process. Williams is
particularly tight with his 13-year-old brother, Rashad, who is
developmentally delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my inspiration, that's my man,'' he said. ``He's always
upbeat. He's always smiling. When I think my life is messed up, I
go home and see Rashad and think, `Dang, things aren't so bad.' He
doesn't even know what's going on in the world and he's so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is happy about an off-season position change. He was
recruited as a linebacker, but he and the coaching staff agreed he
probably is better suited for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Spring practice was his tryout, and the move proved to be a hit.
His size and speed are a good fit for the job, plus he already has
demonstrated the ability ``to knock your face off,'' Snyder said.
</P>

SUNS AGREE TO DEAL WITH LIV INGSTON, OFFER CONTRACT TO MACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns have agreed to terms on a two-year contract
with point guard Randy Livingston and expect to have him signed to
the deal soon.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo confirmed the team is close
to a deal with Livingston but would not discuss the terms. It is
believed to be two years for the NBA minimum.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Livingston, who signed late last season and
played solid basketball as Jason Kidd's backup during a first-round
playoff series against Portland, the Suns are close to completing
their roster.
</P>
<P>
   The club still holds a $1 million salary cap exception and has
offered it to Houston three-point ace Sam Mack. Mack, however, may
have better financial offers from other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told his agent, Bill Duffy, we're interested in acquiring a
shooter and player who can play several positions,'' Colangelo
said. ``Sam fits the description, but they told us there are two or
three situations that may be a better for him financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they also said that if something falls out, they will
consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the team may consider holding onto the $1 million
exception until after the season starts or not using it at all. The
$1 million cannot be used in consecutive seasons, so if the Suns
use it now, they would not have an exception next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a key free agent out there entertaining offers
who ends up being available,'' Colangelo said. ``It may be in our
best interest to wait and see who falls through the cracks to
maximize the value of the exception rather than to spend it just to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that has paid dividends for the Suns in the
past. They signed Clifford Robinson to a $1 million exception in
1997, and a year earlier they signed guard Rex Chapman for the NBA
minimum, which was less than $300,000 at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 6 feet 4, 209 pounds, signed with the Suns before
the final regular-season game last season and was impressive enough
in that game _ 12 points and three assists _ and the Portland
series to warrant a contract.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent parts of three NBA seasons with Houston, Atlanta,
Miami and the Suns.

DOTEL LOSES NO-HITTER BUT METS WIN GAME OVER PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ If the Boston Red Sox have been plagued by the Curse
of the Bambino for nearly 80 years, there are those who believe the
Mets have been jinxed for trading Nolan Ryan to the California
Angels in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won the World Series in 1918, with Babe Ruth on their
team. They sold the Bambino to the Yankees a year later, and
haven't won the Series since. Similarly, no Mets pitcher has ever
thrown a no-hitter in the 38-year history of the franchise,
something Ryan went on to do seven times after he left New York.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel did his best Monday night to make Mets history
against the San Diego Padres. In his ninth major-league start, the
23-year-old Dotel took a no-hit bid and a two-run lead into the
seventh inning. But he lost command of his pitches and walked the
first two batters. The situation got worse when Phil Nevin smashed
a full-count offering into the left-field stands. Dotel not only
lost his bid at history but his shutout and nearly the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied for a run in the eighth to tie the score at 3-3
and then Edgardo Alfonzo belted a one-out solo home run off the
reliever Will Cunnane in the 10th to give the Mets an exhilarating
4-3 victory that enabled them to remain in a first-place tie with
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   When Dotel took the mound in the seventh he already had two more
hits than the Padres, with the first two hits of his major-league
career. He had also thrown 86 pitches and had allowed just one base
runner, Tony Gwynn on a four-pitch walk in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn led off the San Diego seventh with a four-pitch walk
again. Dotel, who fell one pitch shy of a no-hitter in the minor
leagues earlier this season, was overthrowing with each successive
pitch. He threw a ball to John Vander Wal, who fouled Dotel's next
pitch straight back. Then came ball two, ball three and ball four,
the last of which was high, high and away.
</P>
<P>
   Out came catcher Mike Piazza and the pitching coach, Dave
Wallace, to try to settle Dotel down.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work. Dotel's first two pitches to Nevin were balls.
He fouled a pitch off, then swung and missed. And now the count was
2-2, Nevin fouled off the next pitch, then took ball three. Dotel
reached back with his 16th pitch of the inning, his 102nd of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The full-count fastball was on the inside corner, but not for
very long. Nevin turned on it and pulled it beyond the left-field
fence for a three-run homer. And even though the Padres still had
one fewer hit than Dotel, they now had one more run.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel set the next three hitters down in order to complete his
remarkable outing, striking out two to give him nine for the game.
Over 112 pitches, the young right-hander had allowed just one hit
over seven near-perfect innings. But that one hit was enough to
leave Dotel nine outs shy of making history. It probably also made
for a sleepless night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were able to get him off the hook. Piazza, who had
opened the scoring when he led off the second with a prodigious
home run, grounded into a double play with runners on first and
third in the top of the eighth to tie the game at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   But for much of the evening, it had looked as if the only run
Dotel was going to need was Piazza's earlier home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this season that Piazza had hit home runs
in four consecutive games, matching the club record. The All-Star
catcher did it with emphasis this time. Piazza's second-inning
blast off Sterling Hitchcock, a former Yankees left-hander, landed
four-fifths of the way up the second deck in left to give the Mets
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Piazza's 27th of the season, tying him with
Robin Ventura for the team lead. The ball traveled an estimated 448
feet, or about 100 feet past _ and a few hundred feet above _ the
portable palm trees beyond the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza became the first opposing player to hit a ball into the
loge at the former Jack Murphy Stadium more than once. He also
homered into the second deck on Sept. 22, 1996, when he was a
member of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 balls have been hit into the loge, and only one other
player has done it more than once: Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 home
runs for the Padres last season.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very different Padres lineup this season, however. And
Dotel, in just his ninth major-league start, made the San Diego
hitters look feeble for the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-faced 23-year-old right-hander walked Gwynn on four
pitches in the top of the first. For six innings, that was the only
base runner he allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn advanced to second on a wild pitch that Vander Wal swung
at for Dotel's first strikeout. But Nevin fouled out to Piazza to
end the inning, and then Dotel began to mow the Padres down.
</P>
<P>
   The closest any San Diego hitter came to getting a hit until the
seventh was the rookie catcher Ben Davis, who flew out to the
warning track in right for the second out of the second. Dotel then
struck out Damian Jackson to end the inning and struck out the side
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Dotel had six strikeouts and the Padres
were still looking for their first hit. That's how in command Dotel
was. And then Rickey Henderson opened the top of the sixth with his
10th homer of the season to give Dotel a little breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dotel had a 2-0 lead. He induced Chris Gomez into a
groundout to open the bottom of the sixth. Hitchcock missed on a
two-strike bunt attempt for Dotel's seventh strikeout, and then
Eric Owens hit one of the few solid shots off Dotel until then _
but right at Shawon Dunston in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel had tossed six hitless innings, and then came the seventh.
And so still no pitcher in a Mets uniform _ not Seaver nor Ryan,
not Gooden nor Cone _ has accomplished a no-hitter in the history
of the franchise.

COYOTES SIGN RIGHT WING TO A 2-YEAR CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes' list of unsigned Group II free agents
dropped to four on Monday with the signing of right wing Tavis
Hansen to a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith, who refused to disclose the terms
of Hansen's contract, said the team is continuing to negotiate with
the other Group II players _ goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, right wing
Shane Doan, defenseman Stan Neckar and center Robert Reichel.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, 24, was the Coyotes/Winnipeg Jets' third choice in the
1994 entry draft. He played in 20 games with the Coyotes last
season, scoring two goals and an assist, while serving 12 penalty
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 204-pound Hansen spent most of the season with the
Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League, finishing second
on the team with 23 goals and fifth in scoring with 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   He has played 215 games in Springfield with a career total of 51
goals and 93 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tavis is a good right wing who we feel has come along and has
a great chance to make our hockey team this year,'' Smith said.
``He also impressed us quite a bit with his play in Finland this
summer, during our off-season training program with a Finnish team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guy and he plays hard. He has been improving every
year at the AHL level and I think this could be the year he makes
his mark in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   As for negotiations with the other Group II players, all of whom
have been tendered qualifying offers and therefore are technically
under contract, Smith said, ``We're busy working away and we're
making progress on some fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichel, who came to the Coyotes in a trade deadline swap with
the New York Islanders last season, has said he will stay in the
Czech Republic as a player/coach for the Czech National Team unless
the team meets his demand for $3 million per season. Smith has said
it's doubtful that demand will be met. &QL;

MATTHAUS WILL JOIN METROSTARS NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-awaited signing of Lothar Matthaus has become a
reality. According to several league and team officials, Major
League Soccer will officially announce Tuesday that the heralded
German sweeper of Bayern Munich will join the struggling MetroStars
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Voted the top player in Germany last week for the second time in
his career, the 38-year-old Matthaus could have the same impact
with the MetroStars that Franz Beckenabuer had with the Cosmos 22
years ago. Matthaus is a world-class player who will bring
credibility to the league and stability in the MetroStars' defense.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Matthaus may cost less than the $2 million the
league spent on striker Ariel Graziani. The $2 million price tag is
the highest paid for a player by the league, which owns all player
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Matthaus will be a huge boost to the MetroStars
on the field and in the stands. His arrival will raise the level of
confidence of the players and could secure Charlie Stillitano's
position as general manager of the team and convince coach Bora
Milutinovic to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the loss to Kansas City on Saturday set a team record
of seven consecutive losses and 15 of their last 17 matches. But
the team's investors, John Kluge and Stuart Subotnick, the
hierarchy of Metromedia, have always viewed the team as a long-term
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went into this, we recognized it was not an overnight
sensation,'' Subotnick said of Metromedia's involvement in MLS,
where Metromedia has the right to a second team in the league and
plans to exercise that right in a year or two. ``It's going to take
time, it's going to take effort and it's going to take money.''
</P>
<P>
   A small portion of the money spent by the MetroStars will go to
Matthaus, who came close to playing for the MetroStars this season,
but decided to stay in Germany until the end of the year.

PLAYOFF-BOUND SPARKS BREAK LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Sparks finally got their groove back,
snapping a losing streak at four games while handing Charlotte its
fourth consecutive loss in a 76-65 victory before 9,243 at the
Forum, the second largest crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   News that the Sparks had clinched their first playoff berth when
Minnesota lost on Saturday arrived late and was not known by all
the players. And Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge did not announce it
in the pregame meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds better to clinch it with a win,'' Woolridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I told the team after the game is, `You're a
great team,' and I said that because they've beaten the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Grubin, fairly quiet offensively in the first half, made
an impact late in the game, scoring eight of the team's final 11
points, including two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks held a 65-61 lead, their largest of the game to that
point, when Grubin connected on a 3-pointer from the left baseline
with 3:51 to play. After Rhonda Mapp grabbed and converted Dawn
Staley's miss for Charlotte, Grubin converted again from long
distance at the top of the key for a 68-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always there when they need me,'' said Grubin, who
finished with 11 points and four assists. ``I was not so
offensive-minded in the first half. I tried to organize things.
Maybe that's bad, but I came through when they need me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks stretched their lead to 70-63 on a pair of free
throws by La'Keisha Frett with 1:27 to go.
</P>
<P>
   It was a better offensive game than the Sparks have had
recently. Lisa Leslie led four players in double figures with 25
points and Frett, one of the players unaware that the team had
already clinched a spot, had an all-around performance with 12
points, 10 rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (18-11), seeking to regain home-court advantage in an
August 24 playoff game, had a franchise-low nine turnovers to move
within a half-game of idle Sacramento (19-11) in the race for
second place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting (15-16) lost all four of its games on the Western
Conference swing. But as with the Sparks, it got outside help to
gain a playoff berth, getting in when Washington lost on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tight first half with the score tied eight times,
including a 37-37 standoff at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie scored 11 points in the first half but was limited to
only nine minutes of playing time after picking up three quick
fouls. The Sparks led 17-16 when she was whistled for her third
foul with 11 minutes, 17 seconds left in the half. She started and
played the entire second half, picking up only one more foul.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Mapp and Andrea Stinson had 15 points apiece and reserve
Shannon Manning finished with 12 for the Sting.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-CORRUPTION (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ As much as a
billion dollars has disappeared from public funds or been stolen
from international aid projects through fraud carried out by the
Muslim, Croat and Serb nationalist leaders who keep Bosnia rigidly
partitioned into three ethnic enclaves, according to an exhaustive
investigation. By Chris Hedges. (We plan to move the story by 8:30
p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.) 2,200 words.

   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-FOLIAGE (Litchfield, Conn.) _ The vistas in the
Berkshire foothills are already brown, and shriveled oak leaves are
crunching under the boots of hikers on the Appalachian Trail. With
all six New England states suffering from the drought, bare
branches may be all that is left to greet the tourists on their
foliage pilgrimages. Although it may be unseemly to be stewing
about the view when farmers are losing their livelihoods, a dud of
a fall-foliage season would be more than an aesthetic loss. The
proliferation of bed-and-breakfasts has helped make leaf-peeping an
$8 billion annual business in New England. So autumn glory has
become cut-throat. By Mike Allen. 1,600 words.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-SKY-MYSTERY (Undated) _ Astronomers have an unyielding
mystery on their hands, something they have observed and pondered
for three years, a point of light deep in the northern sky that
appears to be like nothing seen before. The mystery object has so
far confounded astronomers because they cannot decipher the
language of its light. This may turn out to be only a curiosity, an
odd variation of a familiar phenomenon, or it may be the first
evidence of some unsuspected object with reverberating theoretical
implications. By John Noble Wilford. 1,600 words.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HOUSE (Washington) _ Though plagued by legal debt, the
Clintons seem able to afford a pricey home in New York. Some of
their financial confidence is based on the president's future
earning potential and an almost certain book deal. By Don Van
Natta.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YELLOW-JACKETS (Undated) _ It turns out that yellow jackets
are not the mean-spirited vermin their victims assume them to be.
They are the pinnacle of animal architects. ``They're better at it
than anyone else but humans, and they do it without blueprints,
without a foreman or an engineer. They create a structure too vast
for any individual worker to perceive, and yet the whole thing fits
together,'' says John Wenzel, associate professor of entomology at
Ohio State University. By Natalie Angier. 2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ When scientists identified two
genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, as the culprits in most hereditary cases
of breast cancer, the discovery prompted much excitement and hope.
Women with a family history of breast cancer would at last be able
to determine if they, too, were likely to get the disease. And so
armed, they could take preventive action. But as with most highly
promising developments in cancer, the decade-long story of the
breast cancer genes, while it has revealed important insights and
greatly increased scientists' knowledge, has turned out to be far
from simple, both from a scientific perspective and a personal one.
By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: The columnist
writes of her decision, after completing treatment for an early
breast cancer, to seek genetic counseling. She opted to have her
blood tested, to find out whether her cancer might have been
inherited, the result of a mutation in one of the two known tumor
suppressor genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. But not every woman with a
history like hers, she writes, has chosen to be tested, often for
good reasons. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CASSINI-SATURN (Washington) _ A giant robot spacecraft
called Cassini is to streak past the Earth Tuesday night on its way
to Saturn, culminating a circuitous, two-year journey through the
inner solar system designed to send it on its way. This journey,
which already has involved two trips around Venus before the Earth
swing, is like a celestial baseball pitcher taking an extremely
long windup before throwing a curve ball 2 billion miles. By Warren
E. Leary. (1200 words)

<P>
   SCI-CASSINI-PORCO (Undated) _ A scientist-at-work profile:
Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist who had worked on the Voyager
missions to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, was already known for her
ability to convey the excitement of space exploration in a
vocabulary that everyone could understand. Now she is leading the
imaging team for the Cassini mission. By Carolyn Niethammer. (1800
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-WEATHER (Undated) _ The canals that the 19th century
astronomer Percival Lowell believed he saw on Mars were thought to
be evidence of an active civilization. Their existence was long ago
disproved, of course, but Mars has been shown to be an active place
nonetheless. It's just nature, not little green men, that is
raising a ruckus. A recent series of photographs from the Mars
Global Surveyor spacecraft, which finally reached its circular
mapping orbit in April, a year behind schedule, shows a huge storm
system near the north pole at the end of the Martian summer. By
Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-INTUITION (Undated) _ Anyone who has been to the
racetrack knows that picking a horse is part art and part science.
It was intuition, after all, not statistics, that rewarded those
who picked Charismatic to win the Kentucky Derby last May at
32-to-1 odds. Now, a small group of researchers say that such
intuition can, at least in part, be duplicated by computers. Rules
of thumb that are only partially accurate can be combined into
precise prediction tools using an artificial intelligence technique
called boosting. By Jennifer 8. Lee. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-KEEN-NOSED-DOGS (Undated) _ How dogs in the employ of the
U.S. Customs Service can find anything in the confusion of an
airport terminal is explained not just by their keen sense of
smell, developed over thousands of years of hunting for food and
fleeing predators, but also by scientists' increasing understanding
of this olfactory ability, and the sophisticated training
techniques developed to exploit it. By Christopher S. Wren. (1400
words)
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Photos are being sent to NYT photo clients.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SKIN-PATCHES (Undated) _ The dry, flaky outer layer of skin
that covers human beings from head to toe gets very little respect:
People oil it, clean it occasionally and otherwise ignore it,
except when they decide to buff some of it right down the shower
drain. But to pharmacologists who would like to slip drugs
painlessly into the body, that layer of skin is the biologic
equivalent of Mount Everest, one of the body's most persistent
challenges to scientific ingenuity. Despite 30 years of research
into the subject, fewer than a dozen drugs are available in skin
patches, little discs that adhere to the skin and allow a drug to
seep slowly into the bloodstream over hours or even days. By
Abigail Zuger. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Photo and graphic and are being sent to NYT photo and
graphics clients.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEAR-DEATH (Undated) _ An essay: In 20 years of practice, I
have cared for several persons who have had near-death experiences,
many of whom have had a clear vision about an afterlife. The
diversity of these experiences astonishes me; the clarity with
which some patients talk about these issues is one of the great
treasures of working with the dying. We have learned that death
might not be as frightening as we thought. And the visions take
some of the sting out of the medical battles we lose. By Timothy
Quill. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FEMALE-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Female doctors are viewed as less
authoritarian and more likely to involve patients in their health
care than male doctors, according to a new study by Johns Hopkins
University researchers. The study also found that black patients
see white doctors as inviting less participation than doctors who
are black. By Anne Eisenberg. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ This just in, from the
Human-Bites-Are-More-Dangerous-Than-Dog-Bites Department: A
28-year-old man attending last year's Oktoberfest, Munich's
celebration of beer-drinking and frivolity, was dancing on a table
top when a woman he had never met came up behind him and sunk her
teeth into his leg. Calf-biters, it appears, are a local tradition
at the festival. It can be a perilous tradition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists have discovered a way to speed the healing of
wounds in mice, and the finding, they say, may eventually benefit
humans.
</P>
<P>
   _ More evidence that going to church is healthy living.
</P>
<P>
   _ They are tasty in salads, and make a crunchy addition to a
turkey sandwich. But a new study suggests that the elderly, small
children and those with weak immune systems should steer clear of
raw sprouts, which are often contaminated with disease-causing
bacteria like E. coli, B. cereus and salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: On early signs
of illness in plants; another new planet; the eclipse revisited. By
Henry Fountain.

</P>
<P>
   BAUER-PROFILE (Washington) _ A profile: Gary Bauer, trying to
position himself as the rightful heir to President Reagan, has
built a strong organization on the right. (Part of a continuing
series on the candidates.) By Frank Bruni. 1,700 words.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FUEL-CELLS (Omaha, Neb.) _ In 1997, electrical power flickered
briefly at the headquarters of the First National Bank of Omaha,
causing a computer crash that executives vowed would never happen
again. The bank's solution? It uses fuel cells, a technology that
shows promise for reliability, flexibility and cleanliness. By
Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SHUTDOWN (Undated) _ The 10-day partial outage of MCI
WorldCom's high-speed data network took a cataclysmic toll on
dozens and possibly hundreds of small Internet service providers
who were forced to shut down altogether last week. Some say they
may go out of business as a result. By Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Through the end of last month,
Tiger Management was down 13.1 percent for the year, compared with
a gain of 8.9 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index.
But fund manager Julian Robertson has lured some top talent to
Tiger recently, and the influence is becoming apparent. By Richard
A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DODGE-AD-COLUMN (Detroit) _ For the last seven years, Dodge cars
have been advertised as ``new.'' Starting in September, they will
be ``different.'' By Robyn Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-ONLINE (Undated) _ Many college students checking their
e-mail or course outlines online will be looking at advertising
from dozens of companies including Amazon.com and Dell Computer.
More than 500 institutions that have signed up commercial companies
to run campus Web sites and e-mail services. While at many
universities students continue to use Web pages that the schools
have created and paid for themselves, at these 500 schools
advertisers will be paying the bills. And the placement of
advertising on what some regard as the purest area of the Internet
_ the educational domain _ has spurred debate. By Lisa Guernsey.

</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-BANKS (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Looking at the next steps
for the three big French banks now that BNP has been thwarted in
its bid for Societe Generale. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily Marketplace column.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY (Moved in ``k'' category)  &LR;

   BBO-VECSEY-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sports of The Times column on
baseball. The appreciations for Pee Wee Reese, the Brooklyn Dodger
great, all too often described his era as being the good old days
of baseball. But the current collection of players is not so bad,
either. By George Vecsey.

and general manager who can make the smaller-market team as
competitive as others who are doing well this season. By Murray

STEAMED JOHNSON EJECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers might be hopelessly out of
it, but that doesn't mean manager Davey Johnson is going to sit
aimlessly on the bench and allow anything to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the kind of fire many of the players lacked this season,
Johnson was ejected after a questionable seventh-inning call in the
Dodgers' 7-5 loss to Florida on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard was called for interference when he slid into
second to break up a double play on Eric Young's grounder. Todd
Hundley scored on the play, but Young was ruled out because
second-base umpire Mike Winters ruled Hubbard's slide was illegal.
It came with the Marlins holding a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about 30 minutes after the game and I still haven't
touched the guy,'' Hubbard said of Marlins second baseman Luis
Castillo. ``This is major-league baseball. I think (Winters) wanted
me to go give the second baseman a high-five. I wanted to knock him
into left field, fairly, and I tried to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson argued and was thrown out for the third time this
season. It's also the second time the Dodgers had an inning end
with a baserunner being called for interference. It happened to
Adrian Beltre earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the worst calls I've seen,'' Johnson said. ``I
was hoping for some contact, but there wasn't any.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A's looking for help: With leadoff man/center fielder Tony
Phillips out for the season with a broken leg, expect A's manager
Billy Beane to make a few calls in hopes of landing a capable
replacement before the Aug. 31 waiver trading deadline. Oakland
obviously wants to continue its push for the wild-card spot. And
the Dodgers expect Beane to inquire about outfielder Todd
Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   A's personnel have scouted the Dodgers throughout the season,
and there's always interest in Hollandsworth because of his small
contract ($850,000) and youth. The A's, rich in pitching in the
minors, would also be a good fit for the Dodgers, who are trying to
rebuild their farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland doesn't figure to last long with Ryan Christensen
(batting .216) and Jason McDonald (.202) sharing time in center
field, which could hasten a move.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hollandsworth hasn't batted leadoff this season, he has
221 at-bats from that spot in the order and is a career .299
leadoff hitter. Also, A's first baseman Jason Giambi sprained his
knee Monday against Boston, and Hollandsworth has experience
playing first.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers like Hollandsworth, but with $70 million of
guaranteed salary tied up in outfielders for the next few seasons,
playing time could be hard to come by unless Gary Sheffield, Devon
White or Raul Mondesi are traded.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring-training rhetoric: Dodgers officials are willing to
listen to offers from the Fort McDowell Indian Community regarding
a spring-training site on the tribe's property in Arizona, but
tribal leaders said they might scrap plans to build a baseball
complex and focus on another way to develop their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to regroup and review other economic options,''
tribal lawyer Ed Roybal said. ``We're going to a neutral corner.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other options the Fort McDowell folks talked about
before attempting to woo the Dodgers was a water park, which Roybal
didn't discount.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers director of business development Fred Coons said the
club hasn't talked with Fort McDowell since rejecting its offer for
a $40 million complex two weeks ago, but he said discussions could
reopen at any point.

TEAM, FANS SHOW SUPPORT FOR STRICKEN HOUSTON COMET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN TRUEX 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Even though the Houston Comets had clinched home-court
advantage throughout the upcoming playoffs, and even though their
opponents, the fallen Starzz of Utah, were hardly a draw, a crowd
of 10,014 entered Compaq Center on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Many came not so much to enjoy a basketball game as to express
affection and support for Kim Perrot, the Comets' point guard who
lay in a bed, breathing through a ventilator, at M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot is suffering from the most virulent strain of lung
cancer, and the fans wanted her and the entire city to know how
much they feel for her.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of Perrot, Comets management distributed white ribbons
for fans to pin on their clothing. The white ribbon was selected to
symbolize ``the bright light that radiates from Perrot.''
</P>
<P>
   Many patrons brought their own acknowledgments. The most popular
attire for the evening was a No. 10 Perrot jersey. One woman wore
one that had block letters on it: ``For Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   Others pinned on handmade cardboard hearts that said, ``Kim.''
Signs and banners saluting Perrot could be seen throughout the
building. Even as the game progressed _ toward an 80-71 Comets
victory _ some fans were painting signs.
</P>
<P>
   One placard, created by LaJuan Brockermeyer of nearby Missouri
City, said, ``God guard Kim, so Kim can guard the Comets.''
</P>
<P>
   Brockermeyer, wearing a red No. 10 jersey, said she talked with
Perrot ``a couple of times at autograph sessions. After she signed
my hat, she spent a lot of time talking with me. She's a person who
cares about other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she admired about Perrot, Brockermeyer said: ``More
than talent, it's her dedication, her intestinal fortitude and a
never-say ... I don't want to say that word. Never-give-up
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wanted to say what everyone suspected, that the end was
near for Perrot, whose cancer spread to her brain, where a
golf-ball-sized tumor was removed in February. Brockermeyer was
dismayed to hear Comets players ``talking about praying not for her
to get healthy but praying that she's making peace with God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have hope,'' Brockermeyer said. ``If anybody can pull
through this, she will. I love the Comets, but I love Kim more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, has a special relationship with the public. She
wrote columns for the Houston Chronicle's youth-oriented Yo
magazine. She made 120 community appearances during the offseason.
When she was diagnosed with cancer in January, she refused to back
off from her speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want to quit when they diagnosed her,'' said Angela
Blakeney, who works in the Comets' communications department. ``She
just added the cancer to her program. Fans identified with her
because she was viewed as an underdog who wasn't expected to make
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, a petite 5-5, not only made the team after a tryout but
was the starting point guard for the Comets' first two seasons,
both of which ended with WNBA championships. Last year she averaged
8.5 points and ranked sixth in the WNBA with 4.7 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   But her contributions went far beyond numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked her for her defense and the way she fired up the
team,'' said Faith Hall, a Comets season-ticket holder who lives in
suburban Humble.
</P>
<P>
   Hall recalled how her daughter, SeLena, came home excited after
attending a Calvin Murphy basketball clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I saw this player who was real little, but she's
feisty and works so hard,''' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old SeLena, who attended Monday's game, said, ``I
remember how Cynthia Cooper was kidding Kim, saying, `She's really
5-3.' They were playing two-on-two, going to five baskets for the
winner, and Calvin Murphy said he and another guy would beat them.
But the girls won 5-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Perrot became such a fan favorite, Faith Hall said:
``It's not who you think is the best player. It's who works hard
and overcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basketball court, Perrot could overcome just about any
adversity. But now she's up against the most ruthless and tenacious
of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Brockermeyer herself is a survivor of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand some of what Kim is going through,'' she
said, ``but mine was nothing compared to hers. Here she is, the
ultimate in physical fitness. But it shows how cancer can strike
anyone. It's a shock, and it's so sad.''

GOING OUT ON AN ARTIFICIAL LIMB

<TEXT>
ANYONE LOSE a penis? Check with the Sausalito PD.
<P>
   The cops there arrested a 64-year-old man Friday after he
allegedly tried to run over a parking officer with a Volkswagen
bus. The cops found, wrapped up on the bed, what appeared to be a
human, male-type manhood.
</P>
<P>
   The county coroner was called, took the evidence to his lab and
a few hours later reported that it was artificial. The arrested man
told police the ersatz appendage was not his, and he had no idea
how it got there.
</P>
<P>
   As we used to say back in the '60s, it's amazing the things that
find their way into the back of your VW bus.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGINE THE SURPRISE at the major downtown hotel when a former
employee came back to pick up his final paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the man, he had forgotten that he had long
since collected and cashed that paycheck. Also unfortunately for
the man, hotel employees knew he was wanted by the cops, so they
phoned the law, and the ex-dishwasher was arrested in connection
with two murders in San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Think twice before you complain to your waiter about
a dirty fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``LADY OF SPAIN'' fans, take note: The Cotati (Calif.) Accordion
Festival is near (August 29 and 30), which reminds Walt Giachini of
a recent incident in S.F.'s North Beach, where a man parked his car
and left his accordion on the back seat. He returned to find his
rear window smashed and two accordions on the backseat.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, how about settling an old debate once and for
all: a one-day festival, battle royal, accordions vs. bagpipes.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever happened to the sitar?
</P>
<P>
   YOU THINK you've got gas problems? Up in Fort Bragg, Calif., at
the Union 76 station, premium is $2.09.
</P>
<P>
   But that's for full service. They pump your gas, clean your
windshield, check your oil and vacuum your pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and whine about the petrol prices, but if the gas
people promise to stop killing refinery workers, polluting the bay
and pumping poison into the air over East Bay cities, I'll pay
$3.09, with a smile (yes, better than the smile on this column's
mug shot).
</P>
<P>
   OLD JOKES' HOME: At Caldwell's on Bayshore Boulevard, the fall
of the bathtub may have inspired a great notion. A pretty woman
mannequin that soaked in an antique bathtub on Caldwell's roof for
decades crashed to the ground recently, fatally injuring the
bather.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Caldwell says the famed landmark tub will go back up on the
roof soon, with a new bather or bathers. To keep them company,
Caldwell's is offering to provide a roadside refuge to any other
vintage San Francisco-area relics.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, bring us your weary Doggie Diner heads, your
Laughing Sals yearning to breathe free.
</P>
<P>
   With city officials now studying whether to make it illegal for
anyone to  &UR; own &LR;  a pet, Caldwell says he will accept the role of the
doggie head's ``guardian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PALO ALTO,'' cried the Caltrain conductor. ``Next stop is Palo
Alto.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say Palo Alto is a structured, regimented kind of place,
which explains why a passenger called out, ``Have your papers in
order.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY HELD a straw poll out in Iowa. Straw won.
</P>
<P>
   YOU SEE a panhandler, his cardboard sign says that he's a
Vietnam vet.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's a fraud, as noted in a recent Chronicle story about a
man who unmasks phony Viet vets. Maybe your spare change, meant as
a token of appreciation for the guy having risked his life and
sanity so you could pursue your sins, is going into the pocket of
an impostor.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the folks at Swords to Plowshares point out that 11
percent of San Franciscans are vets and that more than a third of
the city's homeless are certified vets. The Swords people also note
that they don't have nearly enough money to help all the vets in
need.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe this is the way to go: Flip that ``Vietnam vet'' a
quarter and let the Big General in the Sky sort it out.
</P>
<P>
   SEE ``BOWFINGER'' NOW, thank me later. Reports of the deaths of
Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy have been greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   YOU WON'T be able to park near the Giants' new ballpark. So
volunteering for a highly scientific research project, Jerry
Matters walked briskly from Moose's in North Beach to Momo's across
the street from the new China Basin ballyard. From one oasis to
another. Elapsed time: 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That info might come in handy next season when you're thinking
of driving into SoMa's Bermuda Triangle, where parking places
mysteriously disappear and are never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   SCOOP LITE: Capt. Rich Cairns of the SFPD dropped out of the
mayoral race before it started, but sources say the cap'n is
seriously considering a run for the Board of Supervisors,

</P>
<P>
   SWARMS of vintage Vespas and assorted mopeds and scooters
invaded the city over the weekend, thousands of 'em from all over
the state and beyond, here for a giant weekend rally.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a solution to the growing parking crisis: Get
thousands of locals to convert from gas-guzzling gridlockers to
Eurotrash scooter-hipsters.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the town was buzzing with swarms of the little putters.
As the late sports columnist Jimmy Cannon once said, as he and some
pals stood on a Manhattan curb and watched a swarm of Vespas
sputter past: ``It's a shame what inflation has done to the Hell's
Angels.''

SENATORS URGE END TO FEES ON PRISON CALLS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SACRAMENTO _ Two California senators are trying to stop the state
from collecting commissions on collect calls made by state prison
inmates, saying the practice gouges the friends and families of
prisoners.
<P>
   State Sens. John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose, and Richard G.
Polanco, D-Los Angeles, have asked the Department of Corrections
and the Department of General Services to end the practice, which
they say forces people who talk to prisoners to pay just about the
highest phone rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The senators were responding to complaints from inmate's
families and a recent Chronicle investigation that revealed the
state earns as much as 44 cents per dollar on each collect call
made from a state prison. Last year, California collected $16
million from prison phone calls, which went to the state's general
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is a public service and not in business to make
profits off the people,'' Vasconcellos said. ``For the state to
make money off the people who can least afford to pay these rates
is reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators said they plan to talk with the corrections and
general services departments again this week and if the agencies do
not agree to end the commissions, they will ask Gov. Gray Davis to
intervene. If Davis does not halt the process, Vasconcellos said,
he will propose legislation to stop the commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' actions came at the same time that MCI, which
operates most prison pay phones, admitted it overcharged for some
calls made by California prisoners. The admission came last week in
response to a complaint filed against MCI by a consumer group,
which said MCI was systematically overcharging people who accept
collect calls from prisoners. MCI said its billing mistakes were
isolated and denied widespread overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   In California, state inmates can make only collect calls, and
they can use only MCI or GTE _ whichever has the exclusive
pay-phone contract in their prison. MCI provides long-distance
service at 33 California state prisons, and GTE provides pay-phone
service at four.
</P>
<P>
   For each dollar it collects on prison calls, MCI pays the state
44 cents. GTE pays 33 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say this process encourages the state to award
prison-phone contracts to the company that pays it the biggest
commission, not the one that charges the lowest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, long-distance collect calls from pay phones in
state-run prisons cost about 50 cents per minute, on top of a $3
surcharge per call. That rate far exceeds rates charged to most
other customers, except for those making operator-assisted calls
from places such as airports and hotel rooms during peak weekday
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Even on local calls, the prison rate is higher. A 15-minute
collect call from San Quentin Prison to Oakland costs about $5. The
same call made from a pay phone right outside the prison costs
about $2.55.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoner advocates say the high costs cause some families to cut
off contact with inmates, which could hurt society. Studies have
shown that inmates who keep in touch with family members are less
likely to commit another crime once released.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and GTE say some of the money it collects from prison calls
pays for mandatory operator assistance, added security features and
commissions to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Polley, deputy director of the telecommunications
division, said vendors must recoup costs for installing expensive
pricey  &LR; equipment and said companies also run the risk of not being
paid for many of the calls they process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a much higher risk of uncollectable invoices for
those calls,'' Polley said. If the vendors can't make a profit off
these calls, she said, the state runs the risk of losing a phone
provider all together.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the commissions California collects takes &LR; 
in  &LR; pay for costs associated with monitoring inmates who use the
phones.
</P>
<P>
   The state will not disclose what it spends on such activities.
But consumer advocates, including Gerald Norlander, deputy director
of the Public Utility Project in Albany, N.Y., say the state's
commissions far exceed its costs.
</P>
<P>
   The state is currently rebidding the pay-phone contracts, which
expire this month, and had been expected to select a vendor before
the end of August. However, the process has been delayed because
the governor has asked state officials to delay any project that's
not ``mission critical'' until after February 2000 to avoid any Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Polley said the general services department hopes to award the
contract in November, with implementation scheduled for sometime
after February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   She added that commissions for the state are likely to be
included in the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state were to say no commissions, ... that would not,
in and of itself, change what the inmates pay,'' Polley said. She
said the vendors would simply take all the money, instead of
sharing it with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not benefit inmates' families, it would benefit
vendors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other states also collect commissions on prisoner phone
calls. But most of them _ including New York, Florida and Ohio _
send commissions to inmate welfare funds to pay for books, prison
education programs and other inmate-related expenses. Only a
handful of states, such as Hawaii and Virginia, send commissions to
their general funds.
</P>
<P>
   On top of high rates, The Chronicle investigation also revealed
that customers are often overcharged for prison calls. Several
customers provided The Chronicle with bills showing rates that
exceed MCI's published rates.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a complaint filed in June by the Utility Consumers
Action Network, MCI told the state Public Utilities Commission it
improperly charged a higher rate on calls made by some prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Utility Consumers Action Network submitted bills showing
that MCI charged some customers higher-priced day rates for prison
calls that were made during cheaper night or evening hours.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills showed customers being charged intrastate rates
higher than what MCI is supposed to charge, according to tariffs
filed with the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, MCI admitted that it charged day rates on some
night and evening calls and said the intrastate rates it charged
some customers do ``not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company denied that it ``systematically''
overcharged customers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Carbone, who filed the complaint for the consumer group,
said, ``We have every reason to believe all the bills we've
collected are representative of a problem that exists statewide.''

BERKELEY'S SCHOOL CAFETERIA'S ARE GOING ORGANIC
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MEREDITH MAY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  BERKELEY, Calif. _ Move over mystery meat _ make way for the
rice cakes.
<P>
   Berkeley's school cafeterias are going organic under a new food
policy expected to win approval from the school board tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, students will have the option of munching on
pesticide-free baby carrots and sandwiches made with organic bread.
They will grow some of the food in their school gardens, and some
will be purchased from local organic farmers. They will wash down
their meals with organic milk _ the kind that does not have bovine
growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   According to the experts, they will be some of the first
children in the state to feast on au naturel cafeteria food.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty rare _ and pretty expensive _ but Berkeley is an
unusual place,'' said Rick DeBurgh, who added that he has never
heard of schools serving organic cafeteria fare in his 22 years
with the California School Food Services Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new menu is part of a back-to-nature overhaul of the school
cafeteria, intended to start kids on good eating habits and teach
them that lunch comes from somewhere other than the trucks that
deliver their foil meal trays.
</P>
<P>
   But even in Berkeley, students could use a little schooling in
healthy eating, said junior Coriale Areceneaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't even know what organic means,'' the Berkeley
High student said. ``For lunch, they walk off campus for Burger
King or $1 Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   The district started looking at what it serves for lunch in
response to complaints of bad cafeteria food and parental worries
about pesticides and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling it airplane food would be a compliment,'' said Tom
Bates, former assemblyman and project director of the Berkeley Food
Systems Project, a nonprofit group working with the district.
``School kitchens and cooks are disappearing, and instead you're
seeing cafeterias with warmers to heat prepackaged food. We want to
break that.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica has experimented with a farmers' market salad bar,
but Berkeley wants to serve organic foods in the main dishes and
after-school snacks. Not only that, the new policy calls for
removing irradiated and genetically altered foods from the school
menu.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say adding organic items should not cost too
much more than buying the old standbys. The healthy alternatives
will be purchased with grant money, as well as a portion of the
$650,000 the district currently spends on cafeteria food. The
organic foods will be phased in with the traditional pizza, burgers
and Taco Bell burritos as grant money comes in to pay organic
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley Food Systems Project has raised $245,000 so far,
some of which will go to buy organic food, some to help create the
new school gardens, and some on teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   The first organic offerings will come from Veritable Vegetable
in San Francisco, which will start sending 700 organic apples and
oranges a day to Berkeley schools next month.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed food policy also calls for a garden in every
school, so students can grow, prepare and eat their harvest. Eleven
of Berkeley's 16 schools have gardens, most notably the Edible
School Yard at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, created by the
doyenne of California cuisine, Alice Waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole philosophy is to have food become part of the
education,'' said Jered Lawson, a coordinator at Berkeley Food
Systems Project.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson is helping train teachers how to incorporate garden
lessons into their math, science and literature classes.
</P>
<P>
   High school junior Areceneaux, who works in a community garden
at Berkeley Youth Alternatives, said she is concerned about
pesticides on her food and would be willing to try the organic
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not think many of her peers will join her in buying
organic offerings at the high school's portable that serves as a
snack shack during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Carr-Johnson, 18, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have been eating sugar and fast food for so long, they
just don't like the taste of organic,'' he said. ``They've never
had it before, so it tastes strange to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr-Johnson conducted organic taste tests over the summer for
fourth- and fifth-graders to help the district design an organic
menu. He gave them graham crackers and fruit bars. The kids tried
processed and organic versions of each, and said they liked the
processed ones better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But families who avoid the school cafeteria because they eat
organic food at home are happy with the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd consider sending my child to the cafeteria now,'' said
Dave Stark, who sends his 7-year-old son Matthew to Columbus School
with an organic lunch in a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to get kids thinking about what they're
eating, and the long-term effects of pesticides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fern Royce, another parent, said her children will not go to the
cafeteria, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the cafeteria to threaten them to make their lunches,''
she said. ``The school food is five steps worse than fast food.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked for the past year on Berkeley's new school
food policy know the cafeteria has a spotty reputation. They are
hoping that organic offerings will bring students back to campus
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to provide food for students, why not provide
the most healthy food?'' said Superintendent Jack McLaughlin. ``It
doesn't sound right _ to provide food that in classrooms we teach
them they shouldn't be eating because it's unhealthy.''

 &HT;    Texas Telecampus sends freshman to cyberspace
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas Telecampus is launching
the freshman year into cyberspace this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding beyond the traditional classroom, the UT System's new
``Freshman Year Online'' program will offer typical first-year
courses such as English, government and college algebra on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By logging onto their computers, Telecampus students _ who could
be scattered all across the state, if not the world _ will take
notes from lectures, complete assignments, take tests and visit
during office hours using chat rooms, e-mail and instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason to do this is to help the current UT student keep
up with their education,'' said Darcy Hardy, director of the UT
Telecampus, which runs the programs. ``We see a need for these
kinds of courses for students who aren't quite ready to come to the
universities and can begin the process by taking courses online.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy also said Web classes can help students work around job or
personal conflicts that cause as many as 40 percent of UT freshmen
to drop out. That flexibility also attracts older-than-average
students who want to take classes but have work and family
schedules to manage, she added.
</P>
<P>
   For UT, the new courses are more than just a nod to the
influence the Internet has on Texans' daily lives. Instead they see
Web classes, also referred to as distance learning, as a tool for
UT to aggressively expose many more students to opportunities in
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   UT Regent Tony Sanchez said the Telecampus programs essentially
flings open the doors to all 15 of the UT System's campuses,
allowing its students to rummage through the different libraries
and to talk to an entire corps of professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance learning opens up an entirely new world to students
who wouldn't have had them otherwise,'' Sanchez said. ``This is the
tremendous advantage of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Students interested in taking online classes must already be
accepted into a UT System school to enroll. Cost of the courses
include normal tuition and fees levied by the UT campus as well as
an $80 per class access charge that helps pay for an outside
contractor who runs the Telecampus server.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said each class is currently restricted to 25 students. If
Regents approve, history, sociology and psychology classes could
come online in fall 2000. Each online course costs about $35,000 to
develop curriculum and to buy a professor's time away from their
home campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the courses will be taught by professors at
UT-Brownsville and UT-Arlington. UT-Austin President Larry Faulkner
said for now, the Austin campus' resources are better used on
course programs tailored to Austin's work-force needs, including
the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Telecampus supporters say they hope the system flagship
UT-Austin will also participate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to prepare courses, (but) I'm going to encourage
the System to increase the Telecampus and distance learning
offerings,'' said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks to a virtual classroom. Online courses don't
give students the experience of watching a campus explode to life
when classes change. Classmates and professors are e-mail addresses
instead of full-bodied colleagues and mentors. Heated scholarly
discussions are mostly swapped URLs.
</P>
<P>
   Some students may discover they don't have the self-discipline
to successfully complete an online class. And it is nearly
impossible to detect if someone other than the student is actually
doing the work. Using essays instead of multiple-choice questions
on exams makes it harder for students to cheat, Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no absolute security because someone could be standing
there giving the student answers,'' she added. ``But with the class
sizes so small, the faculty members can get to know a student, and
we encourage daily and weekly conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   By using regular e-mail chats or conference calls, professors
can get to know their students' personalities and the type of work
they produce. Any sudden changes could be investigated, Hardy said.
The program, according to Hardy, gives students another option:
``We're not trying to take them out of the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas high school students who are considering attending UT
say online classes are attractive. Amando Reyes, a junior at Austin
High School, said the Telecampus program would help him balance
school with work responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Gallegos, a junior at LBJ High School who ultimately
wants to attend medical school, said online courses would help her
finish introductory classes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help me transition, too,'' she added. ``The
transition between high school and college is so great. It would be
another way for me to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Shah writes for The Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

 &HT;    How to avoid goofs many investors make
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Don Connelly has watched investors make
their fortunes _ and their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mistakes were small or were made in such narrow
circumstances that they aren't likely to be repeated often.
</P>
<P>
   But in his rise as an investment advisor _ Connelly now is a
senior vice president at Putnam Investments, handling the accounts
of wealthy investors _ he has seen plenty of big-time errors. Those
are the mistakes that a lot of people make and that can blow major
holes in an investment program.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 goof: procrastination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lament is always the same, 'I wish I'd started sooner,' ''
Connelly said. The reason is compounding. The longer your dollar is
invested, the more it will grow. The chart below shows how big an
impact you can make by investing early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to invest is when you pay your bills,'' Connelly
said. ``You're diligent about paying your mortgage and your utility
bills. You should be just as diligent about paying yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests saving a portion of each paycheck, starting with the
next one. As your account gets larger, you will be pleased by
seeing the immediate results of your scrimping. Then there are the
long-term rewards of all your efforts, such as building yourself a
comfortable retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly has seen many other common mistakes, of course. These
are among the worst:
</P>
<P>
   _ Flying blind. ``There's a cliche: People don't plan to fail;
they fail to plan,'' Connelly observed. Too many people, and not
just the young, haven't made basic decisions about their investment
goals, how much risk they can bear and how much return they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make yourself do it,'' Connelly said. A
professional himself, he recommends hiring a professional to help
with planning and investing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do it yourself, a good place to start is Jane
Bryant Quinn's ``Making the Most of Your Money.'' Another good
resource is ``The Wall Street Journal Lifetime Guide to Money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving in to greed. If you try to get rich quick, you may end
up buying silly or even dangerous investments. You may well end up
assuming more risk than you can bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We climb out on a limb a little bit, then we tend to panic
when things go wrong,'' said Connelly. ``That happens only to the
person who violates his own code of risk.'' Remember the old saw:
Bulls can make money; bears can make money; pigs get slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignoring tax breaks. ``You should take advantage of every
tax-deferred program that comes your way,'' he said. ``That means
IRAs, 401(k) plans, maybe even deferred annuities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing the market. Almost nobody succeeds at guessing when the
market will reach extreme highs or lows. ``When you try to time the
market, you have to be right twice _ when to sell and when to
buy,'' Connelly said. ``Nobody can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trading too much. ``Most people assume profits are made by
buying and selling,'' he said. The alternative is to buy and hold,
reinvesting your dividends and compounding your profits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checking your investments too often. ``The more often people
check prices, the more risk-averse they become,'' Connelly
explained. ``The shorter term becomes their time horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grow strawberries, you don't pull the plants up every
morning to see how the roots are doing. But they get up every
morning and check their stock prices. I tell clients, `If you want
to know, watch Dan Rather. If he says the market is up, then your
mutual fund is up, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   CHART
</P>
<P>
   Compounding is powerful. Suppose you start right now, investing
$2,000 annually, tax-deferred, for 10 years. Now suppose your pal
puts it off, investing $2,000 in a similar account from year 10
through year 40. Look who comes out ahead.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Banality of evil revisited
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about the time a hate-engorged gunman was opening up on
little kids at a Los Angeles Jewish center, two memoirs by Adolf
Eichmann were opened in Israel and Germany. Eichmann preferred
being seen as the dutiful clerk-in-charge of the Holocaust. He
became the archetype for the ``banality of evil'' theory of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how, according to The New York Times, Eichmann explained
himself in his new German memoir:
</P>
<P>
   ``From my childhood, obedience was something I could not get out
of my system. ... I found being obedient not a bit more difficult
than it had been during my life to that point. It was unthinkable
that I would not follow orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back, I realize that a life predicated on
being obedient and taking orders is a very comfortable life indeed.
Living in such a way reduces to a minimum one's own need to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann, bereft of hope of acquittal, tried to rig his 1961
trial record to show he was a commonplace, merely a guy following
orders. His crimes, he maintained, were of a lesser order, because
they were so drab. Eichmann's terminal presentation of himself is
an even more baleful vision.

 &HT;    Romance of travel too boring for today's kids
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Are we there yet?'' ``I'm hungry!'' ``I'm
thirsty!'' Sound familiar? Probably does if you've taken your kids
for a drive lasting longer than the batteries in his Game Boy. And
if you've been all the way to grandma's house, you've probably
listened to: ``No-o! I can't wait. I gotta' go NOW!'' or, ``Ma! She
touched me!'' and ``Wa-a! He's looking at me!''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, these days may be gone forever, thanks to
the innovative folks at Ford and Oldsmobile. I'm told they're
offering backseat entertainment units complete with pop-down
television screen, video cassette player, and individual earphone
jacks rigged for silent running so that Junior can listen to his
latest ``Screeming Meemie'' CD without fear of the family
abandoning him and his noise at the next rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the whole thing could get out of hand, as all
innovations tend to do. Thus the following scenario is not too
far-fetched:
</P>
<P>
   Mom: We're here, Junior. Don't you want to get out and look at
the Grand Canyon?
</P>
<P>
   Junior: Naw. I'm just getting to the good part where the vampire
bites the baby sitter and grandma shoots the mailman.
</P>
<P>
   It's right about now that Dad wonders why he took out a vacation
loan just to drive Junior to a scenic wonder when the kid refuses
to leave the back seat of the car. Think about it _ after a
two-week vacation, Junior could wind up back home mole-blind and
profoundly hard of hearing without ever having seen much more than
a few Cracker Barrels and some filling station restrooms. And
what's he going to do when nosy old Aunt Millie asks what he saw on
his trip? Start listing the ``Star Wars'' series?
</P>
<P>
   The average American family has 2.3 children. The three-tenths
of a kid is not much of a problem, but the other two are the pests
who hang around the house all summer whining about having nothing
to do. They argue constantly because neither can remember whose
week it is to mow the lawn or who's supposed to be emptying the
dishwasher. When they're not fighting about chores, they're
eye-locked onto the television screen, engrossed in the video game
of the moment, shrieking ``Aiyeee! You're dead!'' or ``That's no
fair! I wouldn't have missed that shot if I hadn't had to stop and
scratch my poison ivy!'' The only time they leave the house is to
go uptown to the video store for more games and movies.
</P>
<P>
   So tell me folks, why take these kids anywhere if all you're
going to do is mobilize their entertainment center and then lock
yourself in with it? At home, you can at least go down in the
basement to get away from the racket.
</P>
<P>
   There is however, another side to this story. Time was when auto
travel meant a change of scenery. In Tennessee, there were winding
narrow roads through the mountains with an occasional lean-to
selling chenille bedspreads. In Georgia there were motor courts
with cabins set back under the trees. If you got lucky, they had a
family restaurant thrown in where Pop barbecued the ribs and Mom
baked pies. It took three times as long to get anywhere, but the
trip was fun.

   The difference is, 50 years ago it made sense to want to see
what was outside the car window. Now it's pointless. MacDonald's
and Holiday Inns look the same in Florida as they do in Alaska. And
forget the roadside stands and Mom and Pop shops. Now we have
cookie cutter outlet malls. One of my eighth-grade students said
the highlight of her summer trip to Disney World was counting
Waffle Houses.
</P>
<P>
   So Dad, my advice to you is to spring for the entertainment unit
because like it or not folks, the romance of travel has fallen
apart.

 &HT;    Iowa schlock fest was all about who put what on whose bread
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``By the time we got to Porkstock, we were .25
million strong. And everywhere there was song and celebration...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, were you at Porkstock?''
</P>
<P>
   Children will be asking it 20, 30 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you at George Bush's buffet table? Or Forbes'? Who did
you see play? Crystal Gayle? Debbie Boone? Ronnie Millsap?''
</P>
<P>
   Years from now hundreds of thousands of people will claim they
were there Saturday in Ames, Iowa, at Porkstock _ otherwise known
as the Iowa Straw Poll. But only a few survivors will be around to
tell. The rest will have taken their stories, and their leaden
arteries, to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   As this point, the only deaths attributed to the festival are
more pigs than you can count and one candidacy of a Lamar
Alexander. However, Dan Quayle may be boning up on the spelling of
``rotisserie,'' because it is his next campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle blamed his eighth-place finish on starting his campaign
late. Observers at Ames, where 25,000 converged hungry for meat,
commented that part of Quayle's problem was serving food too late.
Steve Forbes was dishing out the goodies at 11 a.m. Quayle waited
until 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to press reports, barbecued pork sandwiches were the
clear victor in this straw poll, and not George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The event was all about politicians buying others' support with
whatever inducement they could muster. The $1.5 million that
millionaire Steve Forbes spent acquiring people's love bought him
3,100 pounds of pork and ultimately 4,921 votes. Not bad, per
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up winner behind sliced pork, that being Bush, spent
roughly $850,000, about half of it busing people from all over Iowa
to feed, entertain and vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   No TV ad blitzes, said Bush proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Iowa way _ neighbor to neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be your neighbor. Would $25 do it for you? How about
free food, live entertainment and a bus ride on top of that?''
</P>
<P>
   In the South in the '60s we had the Freedom Riders. In Iowa, a
whole other era, a whole other shade, we have the Free Riders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign spent $250,000 alone buying admission tickets
(votes) for participants at $25 apiece, the uniform practice.
Almost nobody inside paid their own money.
</P>
<P>
   For those who care one whit about how this money factors into
campaign spending laws, the $25-a-pop bribes went right to the Iowa
Republican Party _ making it the unregulated soft money that some,
including GOP candidate Sen. John McCain, have tried to ban.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder McCain boycotted. He called it all ``sham.'' Then
again, he may just be averse to swine.
</P>
<P>
   The whole reason for having the straw poll in the first place
was to raise money for Iowa Republicans. This stands as the best
money-raising idea since Girl Scout cookies, and as fattening.
</P>
<P>
   ``A carnival of democracy,'' one observer called it. A
``rock-festival atmosphere,'' one emoted. Yeah, like Woodstock.
Only instead of declaring a free concert as in 1969, the acts at
this gig paid everyone to come and love them.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush supporter from Promise City, Iowa, told the Dallas
Morning News he had little idea where Texas' governor stood on the
issues, that he had been induced by a free target shoot.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Iowa State coeds, in the great Woodstock tradition,
declared themselves uncommitted and were ``free-floating'' _ out to
accept anything for free. Apparently no one advised them about a
bad batch of brown barbecue sauce circulating in the crowd.

 &HT;    How to avoid goofs many investors make
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Don Connelly has watched investors make
their fortunes _ and their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mistakes were small or were made in such narrow
circumstances that they aren't likely to be repeated often.
</P>
<P>
   But in his rise as an investment advisor _ Connelly now is a
senior vice president at Putnam Investments, handling the accounts
of wealthy investors _ he has seen plenty of big-time errors. Those
are the mistakes that a lot of people make and that can blow major
holes in an investment program.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 goof: procrastination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lament is always the same, 'I wish I'd started sooner,' ''
Connelly said. The reason is compounding. The longer your dollar is
invested, the more it will grow. The chart below shows how big an
impact you can make by investing early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to invest is when you pay your bills,'' Connelly
said. ``You're diligent about paying your mortgage and your utility
bills. You should be just as diligent about paying yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests saving a portion of each paycheck, starting with the
next one. As your account gets larger, you will be pleased by
seeing the immediate results of your scrimping. Then there are the
long-term rewards of all your efforts, such as building yourself a
comfortable retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly has seen many other common mistakes, of course. These
are among the worst:
</P>
<P>
   _ Flying blind. ``There's a cliche: People don't plan to fail;
they fail to plan,'' Connelly observed. Too many people, and not
just the young, haven't made basic decisions about their investment
goals, how much risk they can bear and how much return they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make yourself do it,'' Connelly said. A
professional himself, he recommends hiring a professional to help
with planning and investing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do it yourself, a good place to start is Jane
Bryant Quinn's ``Making the Most of Your Money.'' Another good
resource is ``The Wall Street Journal Lifetime Guide to Money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving in to greed. If you try to get rich quick, you may end
up buying silly or even dangerous investments. You may well end up
assuming more risk than you can bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We climb out on a limb a little bit, then we tend to panic
when things go wrong,'' said Connelly. ``That happens only to the
person who violates his own code of risk.'' Remember the old saw:
Bulls can make money; bears can make money; pigs get slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignoring tax breaks. ``You should take advantage of every
tax-deferred program that comes your way,'' he said. ``That means
IRAs, 401(k) plans, maybe even deferred annuities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing the market. Almost nobody succeeds at guessing when the
market will reach extreme highs or lows. ``When you try to time the
market, you have to be right twice _ when to sell and when to
buy,'' Connelly said. ``Nobody can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trading too much. ``Most people assume profits are made by
buying and selling,'' he said. The alternative is to buy and hold,
reinvesting your dividends and compounding your profits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checking your investments too often. ``The more often people
check prices, the more risk-averse they become,'' Connelly
explained. ``The shorter term becomes their time horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grow strawberries, you don't pull the plants up every
morning to see how the roots are doing. But they get up every
morning and check their stock prices. I tell clients, `If you want
to know, watch Dan Rather. If he says the market is up, then your
mutual fund is up, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   CHART
</P>
<P>
   Compounding is powerful. Suppose you start right now, investing
$2,000 annually, tax-deferred, for 10 years. Now suppose your pal
puts it off, investing $2,000 in a similar account from year 10
through year 40. Look who comes out ahead.

 &HT;    Ragweed a source of suffering
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For anyone with a serious ragweed allergy, this
would be a good time for a vacation. ``Maybe go out west, or along
one of the coasts,'' said Bruno Maier of the Regional Air Pollution
Control Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Drought or no drought, ragweed pollen can be counted on to fill
the air from mid-August to mid-September every year in this part of
the country. It peaks around the first of September, with readings
above 300 pollen grains per cubic meter, compared with fewer than
50 most of last week, when the ragweed was just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're suffering this time of year and it's a big change
from July, then obviously you're suffering from a ragweed
allergy,'' Maier says.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot more people are suffering than previously thought _
double the number that even allergists had suspected, the American
College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology announced this month.
</P>
<P>
   According to a telephone survey of 1,004 adults by Opinion
Research Corporation, 38 percent of Americans are affected by
allergies. Most have the hay fever symptoms of runny or stuffy
nose, sneezing, coughing, headaches and fatigue that ragweed
triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of the respondents with allergies had never
tried or considered the allergy vaccination shots that naturally
desensitize the immune system, which causes allergy symptoms by
overreacting to pollens and other allergens.
</P>
<P>
   That is of ``even greater concern,'' said Dr. Ira Finegold, an
ACAAI past president, because ``a lot of them are either suffering
from the symptoms or from the medication side-effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Monthly allergy shots for grass pollens remain effective three
years after the regimen ends, British researchers reported last
week in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers ``have done an excellent job of making
allergy sufferers aware of many effective allergy medications''
that treat only symptoms, Finegold said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's too late for desensitizing vaccines against this
year's ragweed, Maier said the best thing people can do for their
allergies is to see a physician about medication that will make
them comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Rain would help, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather's wet, you're not going to have very high
levels of ragweed pollen,'' Maier said. ``If it's dry, you're going
to have high counts.''
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures make the symptoms worse, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seems sure about what impact this year's drought will
have on the next allergy season. One theory says if it's wet
earlier in the year, ragweed plants will thrive and produce more
pollen. Another says dry weather is more conducive for spreading
the pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to see a correlation either way,'' Maier
said. ``We pretty much get the same elevated levels every year.''

 &HT;    Simms: possibly the best thing out of New Jersey since
Springsteen
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now hear this. Major Applewhite is the
Longhorns' starting quarterback. Chris Simms is the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Got it?
</P>
<P>
   OK, now that we have that settled, we can proceed. Although
Applewhite is solidly entrenched as the No. 1 man and deservedly
so, let it be said that Simms is good. Maybe not quite 1 1/2 good
yet. But No. 2 good. The rest will come in its own time.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched the true freshman zip his passes to
receivers the past two weeks know that Simms is capable of becoming
a great college quarterback. Maybe with a year's seasoning. He's
clearly the best thing to come out of New Jersey since Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly one of the best I've ever been around as a true
freshman,'' Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis said Sunday.
``He's physically gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defensive coordinator Carl ``Bull'' Reese, ``He's got a
cannon. He's got as good a velocity and accuracy as anybody I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not perfect. Not yet anyway. Obviously, he can't read the
defense and check out the entire field yet as well as he will, but
he might be the most advanced and highly developed quarterback to
ever come to Texas. Better than Bobby Layne, Bill Bradley and Shea
Morenz. At least, as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Longhorn coaches talk of his poise, his arm strength, his
football savvy, his footwork, his willingness to take coaching and
his zeal for learning. This from a quarterback who threw only 12
times a game at Ramapo High.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be good,'' sophomore wide receiver Montrell
Flowers said. ``Real good. Real, real good.''
</P>
<P>
   That good, huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a freshman come in and play quarterback that
well,'' Flowers said. ``He's learned how to play real fast. I think
he'll get a lot of playing time. And he'll make Major that much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that. Every player improves more with someone
pushing him. And Applewhite's bright enough to know that Texas will
be better off with better quarterbacks, which explains why the
sophomore has been sharing his insights and knowledge with the
rookie. Morenz didn't necessarily do that with James Brown, who
didn't necessarily confer his experience on his understudies.
</P>
<P>
   Simms should see a lot of action this fall, as early as
September. Perhaps as early as Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Brown would be smart to press his rookie into action as
soon as the North Carolina State game _ circumstances willing _ to
test him under fire. A couple of series in the second or third
quarter would make perfect sense for a team that has only one
experienced quarterback who has ever taken a snap in a college
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major's not one to abdicate the throne,'' Davis said. ``He
likes to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Redshirting Simms would be dumb. College coaches are too scared
to sit budding superstars for a year, given the tendency of
collegians to leave campus early for the NFL. You shouldn't give up
a year you might never get back.
</P>
<P>
   Simms is Texas' first lefty since Mark McBath, a leaner,
stronger-armed McBath, if you will. He can throw every pass in the
playbook, none better than the 15-yard comeback route. He's got so
much on the ball that one of his passes knocked the wind out of
flanker Kwame Cavil. He throws hard, and he can be too hard on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws rockets,'' Flowers. ``We were in a walk-through, and
he was still drilling the ball. I gave him the sign: 'Don't throw
it to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cornerbacks like him, too, although they like it more that
he's on their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' cornerback Ahmad Brooks said. ``He works
really hard; he's a team leader off the field and in the weight
room. He's made an impression on a lot of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms has Robert Redford good looks, the 6-foot-5-inch height,
the requisite humility, the perfect pedigree, and, oh yes, loads of
talent. He is ``The Natural,'' and it's only natural some
incorrectly assume he'll beat out Applewhite by October and hold
the position until the NFL beckons him like his father, former New
York Giants quarterback Phil Simms. Between the two and Adam Hall,
the position is in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major is the starter. That is not a question,'' Brown said.
``The second-team quarterback needs to play some. If Major got
knocked out at Nebraska, I'd hate to throw (Simms) in there. Chris
could play a series now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming no one gets hurt, next year's competition could be
keen. As far ahead of schedule as he is, Simms hasn't adopted a
prima donna personality. You shouldn't be surprised to learn that
the elder Simms hasn't been to one practice and doesn't have
Brown's private number on speed-dial. Respecting the coaches' need
to coach without interference, he hasn't called once.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, his son checks his ego at the locker-room door, the
same as all the other prep All-Americans who are competing for
playing time. That plays well with his older teammates although
they have noticed he comes from different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahmad gets on him,'' Flower said. ``For things like his
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   His watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's got a Rolex,'' a grinning Flowers said.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Davis has the tats, but can he post the stats?
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Nathan Davis is an imposter.
</P>
<P>
   This surely can't be the same Nathan Davis who was born 25 years
ago and attended Indiana University on a football scholarship. This
can't be the same guy who won the state shot-put title as a high
school junior and starred on his school's football team.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the real Nathan Davis, he must prove it by removing
his body piercings (10) and tattoos (five). Until then, how is
anybody to know that the man with all the metal on his face and
other body parts isn't related to Inspector Gadget?
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys are taking their chances.
</P>
<P>
   According to top-secret NFL information, Davis happens to be a
talented defensive tackle, an area of need for the Cowboys. At 312
pounds, he is the biggest defensive lineman in training camp, and
has a good chance of making the 53-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has impressed coaches with his defensive ability. He has
impressed others with his willingness to turn his body into a piece
of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a release for me,'' said Davis, referring to his
collection of pierced body parts and tattoos. ``When things get
rough, I go out and get something pierced. It helps me get through
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis must have had plenty of rough moments.
</P>
<P>
   The first things you notice are the pierced ears and eyebrows.
During games and practice, they are protected by his helmet. Davis
tells a visitor that the metal is either gold or surgical steel,
which means metal detectors at airports don't explode when he walks
through.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the tongue. Davis has two inch-long metal rods
pierced through his tongue. They are easily visible when he speaks,
and some wonder how they don't get stuck in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   There must have been some pain involved in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not any more,'' Davis responded. ``Once you get your tongue
pierced and it heals up, it's just like piercing your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has body piercings in places that cannot be described
in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said his first experiment came when he put a tattoo of a
small tiger on his chest when he was 18. His body also has tattoos
of a scorpion, his daughter's name and the word `persevere'
scripted across his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was OK with all this _ except for the tongue and the
eyebrows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey is more concerned about Davis' ability to play
football. Davis was taken by the Atlanta Falcons in the 1997 draft
but played only two games as a rookie. There was animosity between
Atlanta coaches and Davis _ a subject he declines to discuss _ and
he was released in the summer of '98.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas signed him last October, but he didn't play in a game.
This season he wants to prove that he belongs on an NFL roster.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, Davis has been afforded a chance with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason he was a second-round draft choice,''
Gailey said. ``He has some ability. As long as a guy comes in and
does some good things, you give him a chance to mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hold something against a guy that happened
way back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey does not seem concerned that Davis' desire to play
football has been questioned. When reminded that the Falcons were
burned by Davis, Gailey responded by saying that the player has
been given a fair chance in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, he has to do it here and now,'' Gailey
said. ``The reason he was a second-round draft pick goes out the
window. The reason he didn't work out in Atlanta is out the
window.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will keep eight or nine defensive linemen. If Davis makes
the cut, he will be one of the last players chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to practice and get better,'' Davis said. ``If I
can, I'll help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is having fun talking about his tattoos and body
piercings. When asked why his nose isn't pierced, Davis answered,
``I just haven't gotten to it yet.''

again. The Atlanta Botanical Garden's new children garden, poised

in kids the idea that wellness begins with an understanding and
appreciation for nature. Children visiting the Egelston Scottish
Rite Children's Garden will be taught through interactive exhibits
that plants help us live, laugh and learn. They'll travel through a
caterpillar maze that makes them laugh, an air factory that
illustrates how plants provide the air by which they live, a modern
day home from which they'll learn how they use plants every day _
for food, clothing and medicine. The $3 million garden, part on an
ongoing expansion project, also is aimed at broadening the
botanical garden's audience and future generation of visitors.

   Y2K-CAN _Interest in canning and preserving foods is way up this
summer and local experts say part of the increase is due to Y2K
concerns. ``Folks are particularly interested in canning because
they are afraid their electricity might go out on their freezers,''
said Elizabeth Andress, UGA extension food safey specialist. We
visit cannery in Dawsonville, where ``business is booming.''

several potted Christmas ferns and Japanese painted ferns have
simply refused to go on. In the mist of all this death Lyn May (a

   KIDS-GARDEN _ ATLANTA _ If your idea of a children's garden is a
place where kids are taught to plant a packet of seeds, guess
again. The Atlanta Botanical Garden's new children garden, poised
to open next month, is the first in the country aimed at instilling
in kids the idea that wellness begins with an understanding and
appreciation for nature. Children visiting the Egelston Scottish
Rite Children's Garden will be taught through interactive exhibits
that plants help us live, laugh and learn. They'll travel through a
caterpillar maze that makes them laugh, an air factory that
illustrates how plants provide the air by which they live, a modern
day home from which they'll learn how they use plants every day _
for food, clothing and medicine. The $3 million garden, part on an
ongoing expansion project, also is aimed at broadening the
botanical garden's audience and future generation of visitors.

SENATE IGNORES AMERICANS WHO WANT WILDERNESS PROTECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   The
U.S. Senate loaded the Interior appropriations bill (S. 1292) with
more than a dozen shameless anti-environmental riders, then
reinstated Senate Rule XVI, which prohibits adding policy
legislation to appropriations bills. It's the Senate's version of
bait and switch _ a con game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reinstatement of Rule XVI after the fact not only shuts the
barn door after the horses have escaped, it hog-ties the rancher so
he can't chase them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Senate parliamentarian, Rule XVI cannot be used
retroactively; it cannot remove the anti-environmental riders
already attached to the Interior appropriations bill. However,
after Rule XVI was put into force, any senator who calls for a
point of order can challenge and prohibit pending policy amendments
including those that would remove, cancel or modify the
anti-environmental riders already attached to the appropriations
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, by reinstating Rule XVI after the fact, the
Senate acted to protect the anti-environmental riders it had
already shoveled onto the appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Riders to appropriations bills receive very little discussion,
are not subject to hearings and allow no time for the public to
respond. Johanna Wald, senior attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, in an interview Friday, said, ``I really feel if
more people knew what this Congress is doing, they would rise up in
revolt because it is so anti-democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wald pointed out that the 104th Congress and the 105th Congress
tried to pass grazing legislation that would have prohibited public
and federal oversight. Both bills failed. Now Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., has attached a rider (Section 117) to the Interior
appropriations bill that would accomplish much of what the previous
defeated two grazing bills attempted. There was little discussion
about the Domenici rider. It was added to the appropriations bill
while in committee.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are secret legislation. They can't stand alone in the
light of day. The Domenici rider states in part: ``Grazing permits
and leases which expire or are transferred, in this or any fiscal
year, shall be renewed under the same terms and conditions as
contained in the expiring permit or lease ...'' In other words, the
Bureau of Land Management would not be allowed to oversee the
federal grazing land under its management.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely that a bill with this language would pass
in the Congress. And that's why Domenici attached it as a rider.
</P>
<P>
   The Domenici rider, Wald said, ``would make it extraordinarily
difficult for the Bureau of Land Management to change existing
grazing practices that are harming the public land. And like those
former grazing bills, this rider treats grazing lessees as if they
have an entitlement. It completely undercuts meaningful public
participation by dictating in advance what the terms must be, as
well as mandating that the grazing leases and permits must be
reissued.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., intends to introduce a rider to
amend and limit the damage the Domenici rider could cause. It is
possible, even probable, that Senate Rule XVI will be used to kill
Durbin's rider. Then the public will know the real reason Rule XVI,
which was suspended in 1995, was reenacted.
</P>
<P>
   Section 329 of the Interior appropriations bill would allow the
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to scrap
science-based management plans on BLM and national forest lands. It
would allow those departments to take shortcuts around information
collection on wildlife resources and analysis of that information.
The rider undermines scientifically credible conservation
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., added a special little rider
(Section 124) to benefit a handful of ranchers in his state. The
rider reopens 1,000 acres of the popular Lake Roosevelt National
Recreation Area to grazing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after giving ranchers seven years to find other grazing
lands outside the national recreation area, all grazing ended in
Lake Roosevelt. Gorton's rider reinstates the grazing practices _ a
little pork-barreling at the public's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, teamed up to
attach a rider (Section 336) that would weaken the already weak
1872 Mining Law. The Reid-Craig rider exempts existing and proposed
mining operations from toxic mining waste dumping limitations on
federal public lands. It allows mine owners to ignore the 1872
Mining Law's restrictions on the size and number of waste sites.
The rider removes the only incentive the mining industry has to
follow environmental reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate isn't paying attention to the wishes of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks three major national polls have been conducted
that show a large majority of Americans want wildlife and public
lands protected.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, conducted a nationwide
survey of 900 Americans on behalf of the nonpartisan group,
Americans for Our Heritage and Recreation. Nearly 90 percent of the
respondents said they wanted our public lands better protected.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by the University of Arizona showed that 84
percent of Americans support the current or a stronger Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   And a poll conducted by the Mellman Group, Inc. for the Heritage
Forests Campaign, the Wilderness Society and the National Audubon
Society indicates that 63 percent of Americans feel that too little
of our national forests are protected and would favor a proposal
that protects all roadless areas of 1,000 acres or larger.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time to buttonhole the members of your congressional
delegation. They are home for the August recess. Face to face, they
may listen to those who voted them into office. Tell them to scrap
the anti-environmental riders.

 &HT;    Iowa schlock fest was all about who put what on whose bread
 &HT;    EDITORS: NOTICE THE CHANGE IN LEDE GRAF.
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``By the time we got to Porkstock, we were .025
million strong. And everywhere there was song and celebration...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, were you at Porkstock?''
</P>
<P>
   Children will be asking it 20, 30 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you at George Bush's buffet table? Or Forbes'? Who did
you see play? Crystal Gayle? Debbie Boone? Ronnie Millsap?''
</P>
<P>
   Years from now hundreds of thousands of people will claim they
were there Saturday in Ames, Iowa, at Porkstock _ otherwise known
as the Iowa Straw Poll. But only a few survivors will be around to
tell. The rest will have taken their stories, and their leaden
arteries, to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   As this point, the only deaths attributed to the festival are
more pigs than you can count and one candidacy of a Lamar
Alexander. However, Dan Quayle may be boning up on the spelling of
``rotisserie,'' because it is his next campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle blamed his eighth-place finish on starting his campaign
late. Observers at Ames, where 25,000 converged hungry for meat,
commented that part of Quayle's problem was serving food too late.
Steve Forbes was dishing out the goodies at 11 a.m. Quayle waited
until 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to press reports, barbecued pork sandwiches were the
clear victor in this straw poll, and not George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The event was all about politicians buying others' support with
whatever inducement they could muster. The $1.5 million that
millionaire Steve Forbes spent acquiring people's love bought him
3,100 pounds of pork and ultimately 4,921 votes. Not bad, per
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up winner behind sliced pork, that being Bush, spent
roughly $850,000, about half of it busing people from all over Iowa
to feed, entertain and vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   No TV ad blitzes, said Bush proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Iowa way _ neighbor to neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be your neighbor. Would $25 do it for you? How about
free food, live entertainment and a bus ride on top of that?''
</P>
<P>
   In the South in the '60s we had the Freedom Riders. In Iowa, a
whole other era, a whole other shade, we have the Free Riders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign spent $250,000 alone buying admission tickets
(votes) for participants at $25 apiece, the uniform practice.
Almost nobody inside paid their own money.
</P>
<P>
   For those who care one whit about how this money factors into
campaign spending laws, the $25-a-pop bribes went right to the Iowa
Republican Party _ making it the unregulated soft money that some,
including GOP candidate Sen. John McCain, have tried to ban.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder McCain boycotted. He called it all ``sham.'' Then
again, he may just be averse to swine.
</P>
<P>
   The whole reason for having the straw poll in the first place
was to raise money for Iowa Republicans. This stands as the best
money-raising idea since Girl Scout cookies, and as fattening.
</P>
<P>
   ``A carnival of democracy,'' one observer called it. A
``rock-festival atmosphere,'' one emoted. Yeah, like Woodstock.
Only instead of declaring a free concert as in 1969, the acts at
this gig paid everyone to come and love them.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush supporter from Promise City, Iowa, told the Dallas
Morning News he had little idea where Texas' governor stood on the
issues, that he had been induced by a free target shoot.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Iowa State coeds, in the great Woodstock tradition,
declared themselves uncommitted and were ``free-floating'' _ out to
accept anything for free. Apparently no one advised them about a
bad batch of brown barbecue sauce circulating in the crowd.

<P>
   MONEY TALKS: GROW YOUR WEALTH. This is the first of three
excerpts from the book ``Money Talks'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.) by
Juliette Fairley. Fairley, a personal finance writer, has
interviewed prominent black leaders in such areas as banking,
financial planning and investment. In this excerpt, Dr. Emma
Chappell, founder of the United Bank of Philadelphia, offers tips
on saving and investing for African-Americans who are beginning to
plan their financial portfolio. Two more excerpts from this book
will be transmitted over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   WANTED: CLINICAL STUDIES ON ASIAN-AMERICANS. Dr. Marion Lee,
associate professor and researcher at the University of California,
San Francisco, is one of millions of America women taking hormone
replacement therapy, or HRT. But she only takes half the daily
recommended dosage, she says, because ``all the studies on HRT have
been based on Caucasian women.'' (The weight and frame of the
average woman of Asian descent is often lighter and smaller than
most Caucasians.) Lee's fears of being prescribed inappropriate
dosages of medication is common. When information regarding the
medical histories of Asian-Americans as a group is sought, health
professionals find that the Asian-American category is rarely
included in the existing body of research. A report by Theresa Kim.
Excerpted from A. magazine.

<P>
   THERE ARE TERRORISTS AMONG US, THANKS TO MR. PRESIDENT _
President Clinton has once again pandered his office for votes _
not for himself, but for his wife's run for the U.S. Senate for New
York. How? President Clinton is releasing convicted Puerto Rican
terrorists from prison on nothing more than their promise to
renounce terrorism. In this commentary, columnist Raoul Lowery
Contreras argues that the purpose of Clinton's actions is to help
Hillary gain votes from New York City's Puerto Rican community _ a
community that accounts for about 10 percent of the city's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ROSA PARKS BACKS SOUTH CAROLINA BOYCOTT _ The Confederate Battle
flag was placed above the South Carolina Capitol dome as a
declaration of war against racial change in 1962 and still flies
there. ``I support the NAACP's call for a boycott of South Carolina
until that flag is removed,'' declared Rosa Parks on Aug. 9 at a
boycott. ``A slavery symbol over any state capitol is an affront to
our American sense of decency,'' she said. The National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People is calling for all citizens
to cancel conferences, conventions and family reunions in South
Carolina until the Confederate flag is removed. ``A Confederate
battle flag waving over a state capitol in the new millennium will
be an insult to that state's white and black citizens,'' writes
Vernon Jarrett in this commentary.
</P>
<P>
   STEREOTYPES, MYTHS UNDERLIE SCOUTS' ANTI-GAY POLICY _ The New
Jersey Supreme Court recently ruled that the Boy Scouts violated
the state's laws against discrimination in public accommodations by
ousting a gay Eagle scout. The ruling marks the first time a state
high court has ruled in favor of a gay plaintiff. The Scouts say
they will appeal the decision to the U. S. Supreme Court. Columnist
Chuck Colbert believes the myth of the gay male child molester _
based on prejudice and stereotype _ is the underlying reason why
the Boy Scouts organization still clings to its anti-gay policy.

not for himself, but for his wife's run for the U.S. Senate for New
York. How? President Clinton is releasing convicted Puerto Rican
terrorists from prison on nothing more than their promise to
renounce terrorism. In this commentary, columnist Raoul Lowery
Contreras argues that the purpose of Clinton's actions is to help
Hillary gain votes from New York City's Puerto Rican community _ a
community that accounts for about 10 percent of the city's vote.

   ROSA PARKS BACKS SOUTH CAROLINA BOYCOTT _ The Confederate Battle
flag was placed above the South Carolina Capitol dome as a
declaration of war against racial change in 1962 and still flies
there. ``I support the NAACP's call for a boycott of South Carolina
until that flag is removed,'' declared Rosa Parks on Aug. 9 at a
boycott. ``A slavery symbol over any state capitol is an affront to
our American sense of decency,'' she said. The National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People is calling for all citizens
to cancel conferences, conventions and family reunions in South
Carolina until the Confederate flag is removed. ``A Confederate
battle flag waving over a state capitol in the new millennium will
be an insult to that state's white and black citizens,'' writes
Vernon Jarrett in this commentary.

   STEREOTYPES, MYTHS UNDERLIE SCOUTS' ANTI-GAY POLICY _ The New
Jersey Supreme Court recently ruled that the Boy Scouts violated
the state's laws against discrimination in public accommodations by
ousting a gay Eagle scout. The ruling marks the first time a state
high court has ruled in favor of a gay plaintiff. The Scouts say
they will appeal the decision to the U. S. Supreme Court. Columnist
Chuck Colbert believes the myth of the gay male child molester _
based on prejudice and stereotype _ is the underlying reason why
the Boy Scouts organization still clings to its anti-gay policy.

   MONEY TALKS: GROW YOUR WEALTH. This is the first of three
excerpts from the book ``Money Talks'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.) by
Juliette Fairley. Fairley, a personal finance writer, has
interviewed prominent black leaders in such areas as banking,
financial planning and investment. In this excerpt, Dr. Emma

   WANTED: CLINICAL STUDIES ON ASIAN-AMERICANS. Dr. Marion Lee,
associate professor and researcher at the University of California,
San Francisco, is one of millions of America women taking hormone
replacement therapy, or HRT. But she only takes half the daily
recommended dosage, she says, because ``all the studies on HRT have
been based on Caucasian women.'' (The weight and frame of the
average woman of Asian descent is often lighter and smaller than
most Caucasians.) Lee's fears of being prescribed inappropriate
dosages of medication is common. When information regarding the
medical histories of Asian-Americans as a group is sought, health
professionals find that the Asian-American category is rarely
included in the existing body of research. A report by Theresa Kim.

NEW WIRE SERVICE WILL BE DEVOTED TO FASHION  
 VISIONAIRE MAGAZINE IS PUBLISHING A SPINOFF 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (ms) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So apparently novel is the concept of a wire service devoted to
fashion and similar fluff that when people call up Fashion Wire
Daily, they hesitate before saying, ``Fashion Wire Deli?'' or
``Fire Wire Daily?'' Confusion is understandable since the service,
which offers articles and photographs, mainly for newspapers, on
such subjects as the rage for pashmina shawls, opened for business
only last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Wire Daily was founded (with money from a private
investor) by Brandusa Niro, a former vice president at Ralph Lauren
with a background in magazines. She said she noticed a dearth of
good fashion and beauty articles by established wire services and
thought she could assemble a group of New York editors and
correspondents who could offer readers in Des Moines or Phoenix
something with _ how can one put it? _ more flair. Among those she
hired was Joe Dolce, the former editor of Details.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we contacted fashion editors around the country, we
asked, `What do you want?''' Ms. Niro said. ``They all said, `We
want celebrity and In Style magazine-type coverage, along with
practical fashion features.'''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a fashion wire service sounds good. For about $150 a
major daily can have a 700-word article about what's happening on
the New York runways or what color of lipstick Julia Roberts is
using. Ms. Niro said the plan is to build regular subscribers, who
will pay up to $24,000 a year for articles and photos, though
newspapers can also buy articles a la carte. She predicted it would
take about 300 regular users for the company to break even, adding
that last week it sold articles and pictures to nine newspapers,
including The Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   But is there that much demand for fashion outside New York?
``From what I've seen, it's too inside-fashion and East
Coast-centric,'' Susan Bischoff, an assistant managing editor of
The Houston Chronicle, said of the service. ``Also, the stuff
they're featuring is too pricey. It's for someone who's going to
spend a lot of money _ not someone whose entire back-to-school
clothing budget is $200.''
</P>
<P>
   Although The Chronicle devotes about 10 pages a week to fashion,
Ms. Bischoff pointed out that many other dailies have reduced their
fashion pages because retail advertisers have shifted to news
sections. ``Increasingly, local retailers have not liked the
direction of fashion coverage because it's too high-priced,'' Ms.
Bischoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Another editor who expressed doubts was Angela Shannon, who
covers fashion for The Charlotte (N.C) Observer. ``We try to
reflect what's going on in Charlotte, like what to wear to a
wedding,'' said Ms. Shannon, adding that her readers become irate
when she prints articles by someone else. ``They say, `Don't use
that wire stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niro is unfazed. ``All newspapers are looking for ways to
attract female readers and advertisers,'' she said. ``Well, we're
offering them a cheap and easy way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A VISIONAIRE SPINOFF
</P>
<P>
   The way Stephen Gan sees Visionaire's new spinoff, V, is like
Archie Bunker's idea of a delirious Saturday night. ``It's like 40
television screens put together,'' said Gan, an editor of both
publications. ``Each page reflects its own story.''
</P>
<P>
   V, which is printed on heavy stock and is folded in half like
the old Interview magazine, arrives on news stands Sept. 3. The
first issue, devoted to men's fashion, includes photographs by
Steven Klein, Miles Aldridge and the Dutch team of Inez Van
Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. Carine Roitfeld, the well-known
Gucci stylist, and David Bowie are among the contributors to the
magazine, which will be published six times annually and sell for
$5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that New York needed something that felt like an
underground magazine,'' Gan said. ``We wanted something that didn't
reek of the commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but V could do with a little more old-fashioned content.
The text, including an interview with the actor Jude Law, is a bit
skimpy. Gan, who is used to making statements with images in
Visionaire, a fashion insider's publication that sells for $150,
conceded that this was a short-coming. ``Well, text, as you know,
is very new to us,'' he said with a laugh.

B.J. WARD TOSSES JOKES, REELS OFF ARIAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Armed with wit, a pretty, expressive voice and a
terrifically talented accompanist, B.J. Ward captivated a nearly
full house Sunday with her ``Stand-Up Opera'' at West Hollywood's
Tiffany Theaters. The 5 p.m. show was breezy and entertaining, even
if it did get off to a slightly clunky start.
</P>
<P>
   Ward takes the stage with no fanfare, wearing a dressy suit and
black sneakers. With her is accompanist Joseph Thalken. Ward could
probably use more of a divalike entrance to get the show rolling.
She seemed to rush and stammer her way through the first few jokes
before getting her footing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the jokes and arias in the first 15 minutes or so were
familiar to those who have seen Ward here before or heard her
album, ``Stand-Up Opera,'' recorded at Pasadena's Ambassador
Auditorium in 1995. The first jokes were also undermined by the
rushed delivery. But by her introduction to her third aria _ which
humorously instructed the audience on the fine art of timing one's
shout of ``Bravo!'' _ Ward hit her stride and never lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Between jokes, Ward performed some very famous arias, including
``Sempre libera'' from ``La Traviata'' and ``Seduidilla'' from
``Carmen.'' Her warmth and acting talent more than compensated for
some minor shortcomings in her voice, such as a too-dark lower
range.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, she was most effective on the two least-known
works: ``To This We've Come'' from Gian Carlo Menotti's ``The
Consul'' and ``Ain't It a Pretty Night!'' from Carlisle Floyd's
``Susannah.'' Singing both these songs in English, Ward was really
able to make them meaningful to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Thalken, Ward's new accompanist, is a splendid addition. Not
just a fine and sensitive player, he also has a nice voice and
great comedic flair. He was an excellent straight man for Ward in a
couple of instances, including singing a small bit from fictional
Swiss opera that extolled the virtues of being neutral and wearing
a nice watch.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest treat of the evening, though, came about three
quarters of the way through the briskly paced show when surprise
guest Michael Smith _ a native Angeleno with an impressive baritone
voice _ joined Ward on stage for ``Bess, You Is My Woman Now'' from
Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   After their duet, Ward introduced him and told the audience
they'd be ``hearing a lot'' from Smith. She's right _ and her
inclusion of Thalken and Smith in her program shows that, in
addition to her own gifts, Ward is confident enough to share the
stage with other talented musicians and has a keen eye for talent
as well. &UR;  &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR SHOULD RETURN HIS BLOOD MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown has no problem returning
political donations when they're clearly afoul of the law. But when
they merely smell foul, his campaign is inclined to take the money
and run.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the alleged offenders in San Francisco's live-animal
market debate, Ming Kee Gamebirds and Sun Duck Market, kicked in a
century note apiece for the re-elect Brown effort in June.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal _ $100 probably barely covers the mayor's weekly
dry-cleaning bill. The attorney for the two markets, Paul Wartelle,
points out that the contributions themselves also are perfectly
legal and no different in kind from donations made by labor unions
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it be said that the markets _ vital fixtures in the
Asian-American community for generations _ aren't entitled to
conduct business in just about any way they choose or that their
patrons have no right to fresh meat.
</P>
<P>
   All that is being said is that the markets are in dire need of
reform with regard to the care and treatment of the animals
destined for slaughter. In the meantime, the animal-welfare
activists say, Brown should hold them at arm's length _ and he
should return their contributions to his compaign, if for no other
reason than appearance's sake. They're right.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that politicians in San Francisco are well-advised to
think long and hard before doing anything that might offend the
Asian community.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is wrong to accept bucks from two petty players in a
contest that's not over. Even now, after heated public debates in
San Francisco, discussion of the controversial issue continues in
Sacramento, with the state Assembly and the Fish and Game
Commission moving _ albeit slowly _ toward more thorough regulation
of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   So, while neither the state nor the city has yet mustered up the
courage to flatly crack down on the inhumane practices found in the
markets, it's hard to believe the barbarity will be allowed to
continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is due to the persistence of animal-welfare
activists. On the whole, they're an impassioned bunch; some might
say too impassioned. However, I don't see them busting up medical
experiments and destroying scientific work intended to benefit
humanity. I see them EXERCISING their humanity.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, longtime Brown buddy Ron Cowan, an industrious and
irrepressible East Bay developer, made a second donation of $500 to
the mayor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Oops! Since $500 is the legal limit, Cowan's generosity was in
violation of state clean-government law. The mayor's campaign staff
returned the second donation, saying it was just an innocent
mistake. The live-animal market money should get similar treatment,
according to the animal-welfare folks.
</P>
<P>
   David Brower, the onetime Sierra Club luminary who now chairs
the Earth Island Institute in San Francisco, told me he thinks not
only Brown but all politicians should reject ``legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Brower's associates, Mark Berman, said some turtles
clubbed or cleaved to death in the markets are upward of 40 years
old. That means we're allowing the men in the bloody aprons in
Chinatown to destroy something it would take nearly two generations
in human years to restore.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's acceptance of the money, Berman said, is a patent
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps the money, it's going to keep him from looking at
the issue in a fair way,'' Berman said. ``These markets need to be
regulated, and there should be a ban on the sale of wildlife from
other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said he will send a letter to all the candidates in
mid-September urging them to take stands on the issue. Richard
Schulke, chairman of the city Animal Control and Welfare
Commission, said he wants to have a candidates' forum on
animal-rights issues. Baron Miller, a lawyer pressing a lawsuit
against the markets in the state Court of Appeal, said all the
candidates should make their positions known ``on this form of
animal abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates must take the initiative. As Richmond
District resident Patricia Briggs, a volunteer with the Fund for
Animals, said, animal-welfare groups lack the money to ``buy off
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, one of the animal- welfare movement's biggest
red-hots, Eric Mills of Action for Animals in Oakland, was against
Brown's returning the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it any way you can get it. Morality doesn't matter
anymore,'' Mills said. ``That's the name of the game in San
Francisco. It's a sewer in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   I like and respect Mills, but that's not true, though things
often look bad here. Morality does exist. I found it in Pius Lee, a
Brown-appointed port commissioner, landlord to two live-animal
markets and a strong proponent of the efforts to block sweeping
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lee could stand pat and dare elected officials to provoke the
Asian-American community. But he said he wants to improve the
situation in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support that. There's room for improvement,'' he said,
adding, ``Each side has to give a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed. I'd just like to see the process begin with refunds of
those blood-stained century notes.
</P>

SOMETIMES THE ROAD BEWILDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY SHATTUCK  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was calling to confirm a reservation at a much-touted
bed-and-breakfast in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible to request a king-size bed?'' I inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' the voice on the telephone responded in one of those
unmistakable how-dare-you-insult-my-intelligence tones, ``this
house was built in 1812. There were no king-size beds at the time
of construction. Will twin beds suffice?''
</P>
<P>
   I resisted the urge to ask, ``Do you mean that I will be
sleeping in the house's original bed?'' Instead, I simply canceled
the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I shake my head in bewilderment at what I hear. And
read.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE WRITTEN WORD
</P>
<P>
   Among many publications that cross my desk is The Upscale
Traveler: The Newsletter for the First and Business Class Traveler.
It frequently contains useful information, and as I perused a
recent issue, a headline across the top of Page 3 caught my
attention: ``Southwest Airlines offers great getaway fares for
fall,'' the headline in this ``newsletter for the first and
business class traveler'' proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. I have nothing but admiration for Southwest as a
high-quality, consumer-friendly airline; it's among my favorite
carriers. And given Southwest's competitive fares, next trip I may
just consider splurging for its first or business class.
</P>
<P>
   I was less amused by a recent correspondence from American
Express: ``Win free first class air travel for life!'' the
sweepstakes entry brochure enticed with bold type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine winning free first class air travel for two ... every
year for life,'' the accompanying letter began. ``It could happen
to you if you're selected as the Grand Prize winner. ... You'd
enjoy two free tickets to the destination of your choice anywhere
in the world. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the kicker: `` ... up to $10,000 a year, every year, for
the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Have you surveyed first-class air fares for international
flights lately? Destination of my choice anywhere in the world?
Let's see, where do I want to go? Paris appeals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A LIFETIME OF TRAVEL?
</P>
<P>
   Just for grins, I accessed American Express' Internet site
(www.americanexpress.com) and was rerouted automatically to
expedia.msn.com, the online address for a well-known low-fare
search engine. Upon request, I provided potential travel dates
(arbitrarily choosing a Sept. 1 departure and Sept. 10 return) and
requested the lowest first-class round-trip fare between Houston
and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The response: $8,991.58 per ticket. Or $17,983.16 for two
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   So that ``destination of my choice'' didn't qualify under the
$10,000-for-two limitation.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm not choosy. What about Hong Kong? $13,947.68 for two
first-class tickets. Sydney? $22,830.02. Rio de Janeiro?
$13,558.80. Capetown, South Africa? $18,862.20. London? $17,895.92.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo; Amsterdam; Auckland, New Zealand _ none qualified under
the $10,000 restriction.
</P>
<P>
   I do give American Express some credit: Unlike in many
promotions, mention of the annual spending limitation wasn't buried
in small type; it was included in all literature I received,
befitting one of the industry's most reputable companies. And
$10,000 in annual free first-class travel is still a prize worth
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't erase the practical reality that even if I won
this particular sweepstakes' grand prize, I couldn't travel
first-class with a companion even once _ much less for life _ to
the ``destination of my choice anywhere in the world,'' as
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   What about in death? An unrelated morsel of recent information
referred to the lucrative business of transporting bodies from one
destination to another. It seems some funeral directors are
receiving frequent-flyer mileage and free trips for booking corpses
on specific airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on. Every time I ask, I'm told that my frequent-flyer
program mileage is nontransferable. If I'm headed to my gravesite
in a box aboard a jetliner, at least give me _ not the funeral
director _ the mileage.
</P>
<P>
   And I won't even demand first class.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sometimes I am bewildered. But let's round out this
potpourri with some uplifting sentiments courtesy of Travel Weekly,
an industry publication, which cites examples of airline crew
member efforts to make safety information more entertaining (thus
gaining better passenger attention): _ Flight attendant: ``Your
seat cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of a
water landing, please take them with our compliments.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pilot: ``Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so
I am going to switch the seatbelt sign off. Feel free to move about
as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land. It's a
bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the
flight pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Flight attendant after an extremely hard landing: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with
your seatbelts fastened while the captain taxis what's left of our
airplane to the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe travels. Dead or alive.

TEXAS NATIVE STEINKE COULD SEE HER DEBUT BECOME A MADONNA MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LOUIS B. PARKS  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rene Steinke would like to make one thing clear. The
promiscuous, scarred, alcoholic, fire-setting young woman who is
the main character in Steinke's first novel, ``The Fires,'' is not
autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the girl, Ella, is from a small town just like Steinke, who
grew up in Friendswood, outside Houston. But that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life was not like Ella's,'' Steinke says, calling from her
home in Manhattan. She sounds amused, but also a little concerned.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for people to wonder how much a writer is like her
character, particularly when the character is as distinctive and
unusual as Ella, a 22-year-old whose way of dealing with the
burning questions that consume her is to set fires in her hometown.
Or when the narrative is told in the first person in a voice as
startlingly strong as Ella's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fires are mainly her means of release and escape,''
Steinke says, ``but they come to represent all kinds of things as
the novel goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Steinke, Ella and ``The Fires''(Morrow, $23),
interest has been fueled because Madonna quickly optioned the book
last spring, shortly before it was published, as a possible film
for her company MadGuy. There has even been talk of Madonna making
it her directorial debut.
</P>
<P>
   The film is scheduled to go into production next year, possibly
as early as spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (project) is one of our babies,'' says Caresse Norman,
Madonna's manager, who produces films with her.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Katie Holmes of ``Dawson's Creek'' and the new film
``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' has been interested in playing Ella since
the book was published.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katie has certainly expressed an interest in this,'' Norman
says. ``It would depend on her schedule and the script. She is a
huge fan of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   MadGuy and its partner in the production, Handprint
Entertainment, have hired Tony-winning playwright and screenwriter
David Henry Hwang (``M. Butterfly'') to turn the book into a
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has made a lot of people curious about Steinke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me is in the book,'' Steinke admits freely. ``Part of
everything you write is autobiographical. A piece of it. But I
guess I identified with someone who was trying to be good and
having a double life.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinke, 34, is married and teaches English at Queensborough
Community College in New York. She has strong memories of living
and going to school in Friendswood _ she still has friends there.
</P>
<P>
   One of those friends, with whom she worked on the Friendswood
High School paper, is Danielle Thomas, now the manager of Handprint
Entertainment in Los Angeles. When Thomas read Steinke's manuscript
of ``The Fires,'' she was so impressed she took it to Norman and
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Almost before she knew it, Steinke was involved in a film deal.
</P>
<P>
   Steinke left Friendswood in her late teens. Her parents _ her
father is a Lutheran minister _ moved to Highland Park in Dallas
during her senior year. Steinke went off to college in Valparaiso,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   That small town inspired the setting for the novel, she said.
That should be a relief to anyone from Friendswood, since the town
and people in the book are not all that appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Though everything in Valparaiso seemed nicey-nice on the
surface, Steinke sensed disturbing undercurrents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was focusing on the more sinister side, the David Lynch
version,'' Steinke says, evoking the director of bizarre films such
as ``Eraserhead,'' ``Blue Velvet'' and ``Wild at Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the small Midwestern town is called Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dark view of that town. There is a history of the Ku
Klux Klan there and a lot of false piety and repression going on.
Especially in the main character's family, which has all of these
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ella uncovers some of these secrets in the course of the
novel. Because of the secrets and her own personal history, she is
driven to set fires,'' Steinke says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard about this fire in Valparaiso. I had seen the
place where the building had been when I was a child. This was an
arson, and the person who set the fire was a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Hmm, who would set a fire in this perfectly
pleasant small town? What would drive someone to do that?' That's
where my character came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinke is not kidding about the David Lynch-style strangeness
of the story, although much of that comes from the writing, rather
than from odd events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke has as many different scents as skin. Part of the
pleasure is not knowing what it will be _ sulfurous or closer to
incense or airier and sweet as I imagine the smell of clouds.
Nothing relieves me so much as burning something old, watching it
flicker and disappear into air.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses dance as they go, lifted as if by some music. A
photograph flaps like a wing or a hand waving. Perfumes hiss, then
shatter, papers curl, plaster jewels curdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ella is a disturbed woman seeking answers to mysteries about her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandfather has recently committed suicide, but her family
treats it as a nonevent, refusing to discuss the causes. Then
there's the fire that scarred Ella when she was young. An accident?
The scars add a macabre touch to the mental image readers form of
this vibrant, physical, attractive woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big theme,'' Steinke says. ``The scars are metaphors
for emotional scars. I think a lot of women feel damaged or scarred
someway in their body.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the book, you can see how it relates to her sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinke adds, knowing by now how people probably wonder, ``It's
entirely fictional. I'm not scarred.''
</P>
<P>
   Also not scarred is the Uma Thurman-ish blonde woman on the
book's dust jacket, a fact Steinke seems to be a little sorry
about, even while she laughs about it. She figures it was probably
a well-thought-out oversight on the publisher's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're imagining (the scars) are in the shadows,'' she says of
the picture, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Steinke is now working on her second book, ``Holy Skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historical novel based on the life of a German woman
who was a dada artist and a model for people like Man Ray and
Marcel Duchamp.
</P>
<P>
   She's a very intense, flamboyant person. She's not famous, but
she did actually exist.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to finish that in a year, perhaps about the time her
first book is out as a film.

ACTRESS ADAPTS TO COMIC ROLE IN SATIRIC `DICK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAMELA MITCHELL  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maturity becomes Michelle Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she may be best known for her role as Jen Lindley,
misunderstood bad girl on the WB's teen angst fest ``Dawson's
Creek.'' And her new film, ``Dick,'' a ``Clueless'' meets ``All the
President's Men'' take on Watergate, will further tie her to the
high school experience.
</P>
<P>
   But spend 15 minutes talking with the 18-year-old actress and
her beyond-her-years composure instantly impresses. As does her
desire to grow professionally by taking on interesting and
challenging roles, parts her peers from TV land wouldn't dream of
tackling during their downtime.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Williams spent her hiatus on the set of ``Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the script, I thought it was original, hilarious
and really charming,'' she said recently from Los Angeles. ``But I
was scared. I had no experience with comedy and didn't know if I
could adapt to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized the role would challenge me. And it was a good
experience for me as a person. I spent three months being silly and
lighthearted and innocent. That was a switch from the show.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dick'' (rated PG-13), Williams plays Arlene, a naive
Washington teen who stumbles upon the Watergate break-in with her
best friend, Betsy (Kirsten Dunst).
</P>
<P>
   Arlene lives in the Watergate building with her mother (Teri
Garr), and late one night the girls sneak out to mail an entry to
the ``Win a Date With Bobby Sherman'' contest. On their way back
in, they bump into G. Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer), whom they
discover lurking in a stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   They scream, run into Arlene's apartment and watch from the
window as the police arrive to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   During a field trip to the White House soon after, the pair spot
Liddy and end up face to face with President Richard Nixon (Dan
Hedaya) and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tricky Dick'' hires the girls to be official White House dog
walkers so he can keep an eye on them. A strange friendship forms
between the three, but Arlene and Betsy eventually wise up to
Nixon's ways. They, at first as a joke, become Deep Throat, the
Washington Post's famous secret source on Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are praising the comic skills of Williams and Dunst.
Neither were born when the scandal broke (Dunst is 17), but
Williams doesn't think that makes the movie any less interesting,
or funny, to her or her generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to have lived through Watergate or have a great
historical knowledge to find the film special,'' she said. ``I saw
it with a bunch of friends and they didn't have a hard time getting
the jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Williams is more politically savvy than the average teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up surrounded by a knowledge of history and politics,''
she explained. ``My father (Larry Williams) was very political
growing up. He ran for the Senate twice. By osmosis, I became
involved. I've always had a passion for politics and a real
interest since childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, a still-starstruck Arlene has this to say about
Nixon: ``He's the president. He always means what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress isn't as trusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very jaded, disheartened politically,'' she said. ``Once I
moved out on my own, I began to see the human side of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Democrat. I'm more middle of the road. I have
problems with both parties. With Republicans, it's their stand on
women's rights, abortions. Socially, I see it as the cold,
male-oriented side of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, the Democrats,'' Williams added with a laugh. ``They take
too much of your money.''
</P>
<P>
   She does have a theory about why today's young people aren't as
politically involved as generations past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s, revolution was in the air. Now, young people are
more passive, complacent. We have food. We have shelter. We don't
have war.
</P>
<P>
   We have nothing to fight for. It's not their fault that the
climate around them doesn't encourage getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was born in Montana, and her family later moved to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   She left high school after her freshman year and finished
through correspondence courses, graduating at 15. She then packed
her bags and moved to L.A. as an emancipated minor to pursue an
acting career. She landed some small TV and film roles, including
the young Sil in ``Species,'' before winning the role of Jen on
``Dawson's Creek.'' While last year's hiatus project was silly and
lighthearted, Williams spent this summer acting even more serious
than her ``Dawson's Creek'' character.
</P>
<P>
   She hit the stage during May and June in the off-Broadway play
``Killer Joe.'' Her performance as Dottie, the virginal daughter of
a dysfunctional Texas trailer-park family, was acclaimed by
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Williams enjoyed the immediacy theater offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love theater so much. It's just so safe there and free. The
liveness, I think that's the beauty of it, the purity of it.
Theater gets me back to everything I started acting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also joined Chloe Sevigny, Nia Long and pal Natasha
Lyonne in ``If These Walls Could Talk II,'' a three-part HBO drama
focusing on the lesbian experience in the United States, set to air
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the piece to be so brave and so necessary,'' she said.
``The topic is still sort of taboo, because there is a lack of
knowledge or education.''
</P>
<P>
   Her segment brought her back to the '70s again, this time as a
brunette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I so enjoyed being a brunette,'' she admitted. ``It was a
completely different experience. I feel like I was taken more
seriously. It was really strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Williams returned to Wilmington, N.C. _ where
``Dawson's Creek'' is shot _ and to what she describes as a simple
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three destinations there: work, bookstore, grocery
store. My life is very basic.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what book might visitors find on her bedside table? ``Oh my
God,'' Williams exclaimed quickly, sounding her age for the first
time during the interview. ``I'm reading the most amazing book
right now.
</P>
<P>
   It's called `Cities of the Interior.' I don't want to finish
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those watching her career develop feel the same way about
Williams.

GROWING PANSIES FROM SEED NOT EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY HUBER  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I enjoy starting plants from seed. I have a difficult time
getting pansy seed to germinate. What is the trick?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid I'm one of those gardeners who just picks up a
flat or two of pansies at the nursery because they are not as easy
as, say, calendulas, to start from seed.
</P>
<P>
   Cool darkness is needed for germination of pansy seed, with an
ideal soil temperature between between 60 and 65 degrees. Sow seeds
1/8-inch deep in a clean seed flat or individual containers filled
with a soilless germinating mix. Sprinkle the mix over the seed.
Water carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Since pansy seed must have darkness to germinate, it is a good
idea to cover the seed flat with black plastic. Or cover with clear
kitchen wrap, then place damp newspapers on top of the wrap. Check
the moisture of the germination mix daily or at least every other
day. Do not let the mix dry out; mist to moisten.
</P>
<P>
   Germination usually occurs in 10 to 20 days. Once tiny sprouts
are visible, permanently remove the plastic/newspaper. Move the
seedlings to a cool area where there is bright light. Transplant
when seedlings have two sets of leaves. Move to a cool, sunny spot.
Apply a diluted water-soluble fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have moved into a house that is overgrown with shrubs. I
would like to cut the azaleas back to 3 or 4 feet. They have lots
of tall shoots. Should this be done after blooming in spring?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is best to prune right after spring blooms, because
azaleas set buds during the summer and pruning now would mean few
or no blooms next spring. You could prune the shrubs down to 3 or 4
feet now, but you might consider just removing extra-leggy shoots
to shape your plants.
</P>
<P>
   Then you'd still get flowers on the bulk of the shrub next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Prune soon, however, rather than waiting until fall, because
pruning promotes tender new growth that would be more susceptible
to freeze damage. You can root those long shoots if you like or, of
course, donate them to a compost pile.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am having a problem with my hamelia, or hummingbird bush.
This is the first one I've had. I know that when weather cools, the
leaves turn color and drop. It's doing that now, and all the full,
beautiful leaves are going. Is there something I need to do that I
may have overlooked?
</P>
<P>
   A: Full sun will brighten hamelia foliage, and in fall the
leaves can turn blood red. A freeze will burn the top, perhaps to
the ground, but new growth should appear in spring.
</P>
<P>
   While the sun may affect the coloring of your plant now, the
leaves should not be dropping. Hamelia tolerates any soil that
drains well, and, once established, it is drought-tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Does the soil in your bed stay wet too long after a rain? Some
plants react to overly wet conditions by dropping their leaves. Or
perhaps your plant got too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, a well-draining soil and average water might well restart
your hamelia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house faces northwest and has a planter box across the
front. This gets direct west sun in the afternoon, and I need to
know what I can plant in the box that would bloom, be decorative
and pretty, yet take this direct sun. Right now I have aspidistra
in it, and it looks awful.
</P>
<P>
   It always has yellowish tips. I am removing the aspidistra and
want to start preparing the soil for new plants.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're smart to improve the soil. Work in compost to improve
texture and add nutrients. Sharp sand will improve drainage.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest using two or three different types of plants _ if you
have room. I recently saw a long, narrow bed with plants that were
upright and others that spilled over a retaining wall. It sounds as
though yours would be a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   You could use the low-maintenance evergreen giant liriope for
fountainlike, upright growth, then add blue or white plumbago to
spill over the sides. The giant liriope is much more attractive to
me than the regular type we use for edging. It matures to 21/2 to 3
feet, forms dense, dark-green clumps and produces summer stalks of
lavender flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The plumbago is a tough perennial with nonstop flowers late
spring to frost. It will eventually get big, so you'll need to
pinch it back in years to come, but it certainly is an easy plant.
</P>
<P>
   Society garlic is another option. This perennial, as you may
know, has grasslike foliage, green or variegated, and produces
lavender blooms atop slender stems for months. It, too, is tough,
once established. It will freeze back.
</P>
<P>
   I also think the combination of giant liriope, `Indian Summer'
rudbeckia (large, long-lasting, golden-yellow blooms) and `Solar
Sunrise' coleus (burgundy, green, yellow and cream variegated
foliage) is attractive late spring to frost.
</P>
<P>
   You could add late-fall-to-spring color when the coleus dies out
in winter and the rudbeckia goes dormant. Cool-season alternatives
include alyssum, pansies or violas, petunias and trailing
nasturtiums.

TEXAS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AIDS STUDENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR STAYING
CLEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PATTY REINERT  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ By the time Lori Fitzpatrick was old enough to
buy her own beer, she was already addicted to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend beat her nearly every day. Every night, she slept
in shelters, or on the streets of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I continued to do what I was doing, I was going to
die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she walked away from her former life, moved to Texas and got
clean.
</P>
<P>
   And she earned a scholarship to Texas Tech University, the only
four-year college in the country that ignores past academic
performance and pays the tuition of recovering alcoholics and drug
abusers in exchange for staying sober.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. Because you were an addict, you can get
a scholarship? It's incredible,'' said Fitzpatrick, now a
25-year-old senior studying occupational therapy. ``When I came
here, I had no home.
</P>
<P>
   I had very little money. They took me in. They saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fitzpatrick earns her bachelor's degree next spring, she'll
join the ranks of more than 600 recovering addicts to graduate from
Texas Tech with the help of the university's Center for the Study
of Addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old center began as the United States' first
collegiate curriculum specifically designed to train addiction
counselors at a time when Texas had thousands of job openings in
the field. But, as is often the case in addiction counseling, many
students attracted to the program were themselves former addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of them had dropped out of school or been kicked out
or had been in prison, and they were just locked down in the
shallows of life, trapped in minimum wage jobs and not going
anywhere,'' said Carl Andersen, a Texas Tech professor and
recovering alcoholic who started the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we still offer the academic track, but our real business
is working with recovering alcoholics and addicts to help them
become whatever they want to be. ...''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for an initial $500 scholarship, students must first
participate in a 12-step recovery program, such as Alcoholics
Anonymous, and must have at least a year of sobriety. In addition
to their normal studies, they must enroll in Andersen's ``Seminar
in Recovery,'' and attend three on-campus support meetings a week.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the financial aid, they must remain sober and keep their
grades up. A 4.0 grade point average earns them $2,000 per
semester; a 3.5 GPA will get them $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Andersen said, the GPAs of students in the
program have consistently been above the university average. (Last
semester, their average was 3.67, compared with the overall
university GPA of 3.42.) While many of the program's graduates
become addiction counselors, the center counts doctors, lawyers,
teachers and accountants among its alums. And in 13 years, only one
student has quit, Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   David Crosby, 36, entered Texas Tech after drinking for 14 years
and exited with a degree in education. Now a teacher in the Dallas
metroplex, he said he draws on his experience to encourage his
students to stay drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always planned on going places,'' he said. ``I thought I'd
be a doctor or a teacher, maybe an astronaut or an air-sea rescuer
for the Coast Guard. When I was 18, I went to school to be a forest
ranger and lasted six weeks. I tried going back five or six times
after that but I just couldn't make it to class because I was
drinking. This was my chance to go back to school and finally make
it work. It was a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is so well respected on campus that admissions
personnel often rely solely on Andersen's promise that a student
will do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty rare that someone comes in that I don't gamble on
them,'' Andersen said. ``The 12-step programs are great for getting
sober and staying sober, but if you're 20 years old, it's not
enough to just be a recovering alcoholic. You've got to get on
track for your whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our students, life is not AA,'' he said. ``Life is out
there. We try to help them make the transition between the
treatment programs and the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For many students, the center offers a second _ or third or
fourth _ chance to go to college, in many cases, long after other
universities' patience and parents' financial support have dried
up.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Mark Langford, who had started college in
1987 and again in 1992, only to flunk out because of his addiction
to alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three scholastic suspensions, and had been to three
treatment centers,'' said Langford, 31. ``I never thought I'd ever
get back into school.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now a family studies major and A student who arrived at the
center last fall, Langford plans to get his master's degree
eventually so he can counsel adolescents with chemical dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only now that I look back and say, `Look what I just
accomplished,''' he said. ``You just do it. You restructure your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been where we've been and you know how bad it can
get, how bad it did get, you know how to survive that,'' he added.
``You see all the things you couldn't see before.''
</P>
<P>
   And Langford said students in recovery sometimes have an
advantage over their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids, they're here to party,'' he said. ``We're not.
We've done that, and now we know what we want out of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many might think that a college campus is a dangerous
place full of temptation for recovering alcoholics and drug
addicts, students in the program stick together and look out for
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You attract who you are,'' said Chris Upton, a 20-year-old
premed student. ``I have no desire to party anymore so I don't
attract those people anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, when he hears his fellow students bragging in class about
how they got wasted the night before, Upton steers clear and turns
to friends in his recovery group. ``Now that I'm on the other side
of it, I realize how stupid I used to sound,'' he said, drawing
laughter from friends who've been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came in and heard everyone's stories of success,
I thought, `I can't do this. I'm gonna fail,'' he said. ``But I'm
not. I've met good friends I hope to keep for life, and I know they
will be sober.''
</P>
<P>
   That community is key to the program's success, Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, young drug abusers who return home after treatment
have a 95 percent relapse rate; those who create a new environment
and develop new friendships have only a 50 percent relapse rate.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 600 students who have graduated through Texas Tech's
program, fewer than 5 percent have gone back to using drugs or
alcohol, Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into recovery 16 years ago, nobody ever tried to
get me to go back to drinking. My kids didn't say to me, `Dad, we
liked you better when you were drunk. You were more fun then,'''
Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with kids who go through recovery and then go back home to
their friends, their recovery is an indictment on the behavior of
the group.
</P>
<P>
   There is tremendous pressure to get them back into the group _
`Come on, just one beer, just one joint.''' Here, students are
surrounded by people they can identify with, and support groups,
including AA, Gamblers Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous and a group
for the survivors of sexual abuse, meet on campus regularly.
</P>
<P>
   That environment is what brought Jennifer English to Lubbock.
Before getting into treatment, the 26-year-old divorced mother of
two said alcohol was ``my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody was there,'' she said, ``the bottle was there.''
</P>
<P>
   In recovery since last fall, English now has a job as a carhop
at Sonic and plans to start at Texas Tech in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back now and you see all the bridges you burned and
all the bad decisions you made,'' she said. ``Just living paycheck
to paycheck, that's no way to support my children. I met Lori
(Fitzpatrick) and she's a single mother like me, and I think, she
did this, and I can do it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hope.''

LESBIAN COUPLE PLAN UNION SERVICE WITHOUT OFFICIAL OK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Photo available on the NYT database)  
 (Attn: Ill., Neb.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECILE S. HOLMES  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Together for a quarter-century, Linda E. Enger and
Eleanora N. Piombino want to do as many couples do: reaffirm their
mutual commitment at their church, with their friends and family on
hand to help celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   But because United Methodist church law prohibits same-sex union
ceremonies, the lesbian couple plan to literally take theirs to the
street.
</P>
<P>
   They have scheduled a union service in two weeks for the street
outside their church, Bering Memorial United Methodist Church,
which earlier this year decided to hold no more weddings on church
property until all people _ regardless of sexual orientation _
could be married or united in union services there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, United Methodists' highest legislative body adopted a
resolution prohibiting clergy from performing or participating in
same-sex unions. The resolution also forbids church property being
used for those unions.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago was convicted by a
church court of violating Methodist law on the issue. He lost his
job as pastor of a church in Chicago. The year before, the Rev.
Jimmy Creech lost his pulpit in Omaha, Neb., for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Houston women's service, their pastor, the Rev. Marilyn
Meeker-Williams, plans to stand on the steps of the church to
witness the event. Were she to participate, she could be charged
with violating Methodists' Book of Discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Troy Plummer _ who is not a United Methodist but serves
as an associate pastor at Bering _ will officiate. Plummer is
ordained in the Orthodox Catholic Church, an offshoot of Roman
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is perpetuating a very great injustice to all
persons who are gay or lesbian,'' said Meeker-Williams, who is
straight, married and the mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot do it, and it can't be in our church. Therefore the
very next best thing is the street,'' she said. ``As John Wesley
(founder of Methodism) did, he took to the fields when he could not
preach in the Anglican Church. We'll continue to take these
services to the street until we, as pastors, can celebrate them in
the church.''
</P>
<P>
   While she knows the church is attracting attention,
Meeker-Williams insists there is no strategy to force a
confrontation with Methodist clergy who disagree with her.
</P>
<P>
   A Holy Communion service in Bering's sanctuary will follow the
union ceremony on the street, for which Enger and Piombino said
they have obtained a city permit. A reception will be held later at
a local hall.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 guests have been invited to the Aug. 27 ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jim Foster, provost for the Houston-based conference
office, said that although the church doesn't condone ``the
practice of homosexuality,'' gay people are ``persons of sacred
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``We will continue to uphold the law of the
United Methodist Church, and persons who violate that discipline
will be subject to the judicial procedures (which include
dismissal) outlined in the Book of Discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned event has people speaking out on both sides of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which the couple will hold the service is ``a
unique approach to challenging the church's position,'' said Dan
Vera of Chicago, field coordinator for the Reconciling Congregation
Program.
</P>
<P>
   About 160 Methodist churches out of a national total of 36,000
are considered ``reconciling congregations'' that welcome all
members regardless of sexual orientation. Bering, a historic church
of 700 members near downtown, is one of the reconciling churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible speaks about this issue (homosexuality) eight
different times. It never says anything positive about it. Nor does
it say anything neutral,'' said the Rev. Rob Renfroe, executive
pastor of the Westchase campus of First United Methodist Church,
Houston's largest Methodist congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Renfroe also is an executive board member of the local branch of
the Confessing Movement. The movement, an entity independent from
the 9 million-member Methodist denomination, has spoken out on
several issues, including expressing opposition to allowing
same-sex union services in Methodist churches. Renfroe stressed the
need to affirm the official church stance that homosexuals are
``persons of sacred worth.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the careful plans for the ceremony raise questions
in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very pharisaical approach,'' he said. ``You go right
up to the line. You have it outside the church. You ask a minister
on the church staff who is not a United Methodist to perform it.
Then you invite them into the church for Holy Communion to
celebrate what has just occurred.
</P>
<P>
   You clearly break the spirit of Methodist Church law without
breaking the letter of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enger, 46, and Piombino, 55, didn't have a ceremony 25 years ago
when they decided to live together and raise Piombino's four
children from a previous heterosexual marriage. Those kids are
grown now, and Enger and Piombino enjoy the next generation, eight
offspring they call ``our grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   But the couple has always wanted a formal service affirming
their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our 20th anniversary, we exchanged wedding bands,'' said
Piombino, who works in retail. ``That was the first move we ever
made toward saying we were a `couple' because we both felt we were
not worthy of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it privately between the two of us. After we joined
Bering Methodist Church ... we realized we were worthy of Jesus'
love. It's no longer `what man thinks.' Because we know Jesus loves
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Enger and Piombino realize some may respond to their
ceremony with hostility. ``We're not kidding ourselves,'' Piombino
said, acknowledging the service may affect her job and where they
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate there may very well be some protests,'' said
Enger, an information systems training and documentation manager.
``We have hired certified peace officers to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said having the service in the street is the next best
thing to having it in the sanctuary. ``We want to try and extend
God's blessing and God's grace on this ceremony while at the same
time respecting the order and discipline of the United Methodist
Church.''

CULT OR NOT, FALUN GONG IS POPULAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For Alice Yim, Falun Gong has been a
life-changing experience.
</P>
<P>
   She has become less materialistic, more patient and generally
happier with herself since practicing this new variation of qigong,
a traditional Chinese exercise technique.
</P>
<P>
   The main precepts of Falun Gong (``truthfulness, benevolence,
forbearance'') and its belief that a spiritual orb spins in your
lower abdomen, have been like a guide to life for Yim, 22, a
student of fashion design living in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I finished the (Falun Gong) book, I felt like I was
reborn,'' she said. ``Lots of things I have been questioning
through my life _ all of a sudden I just found the answer. It's
hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the Chinese government, Falun Gong is a dangerous cult
and subversive political movement. Alarmed by claims it has
attracted 100 million followers worldwide _ more than the
membership of the Chinese Communist Party _ Beijing has launched a
broad campaign to discredit and ban Falun.
</P>
<P>
   It has denounced the founder of the group, Chinese expatriate Li
Hongzhi, who lives in New York City, and has made a public display
of destroying his books.
</P>
<P>
   Falun practitioners say they are not a sect or even a spiritual
movement but just normal people striving to lead better and
healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   However, even qigong practitioners doubt Falun _ which means
``law wheel'' and was introduced in China in 1992 _ is a legitimate
form of qigong. They question the fervor for the ideology, devotion
to Li and renunciation of all doctors and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, qigong promotes people to be independent and to
take their lives in their own hands, not to be controlled,'' said
Effie Chow, a registered nurse, acupuncturist and president of the
East West Academy of Healing Arts in San Francisco. ``I think it's
hard to embrace a practice that restricts people from freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Qi'' (pronounced ``CHEE'') is considered the vital life force
that can be harnessed externally, as it is for martial arts, or
internally, as it is in qigong. According to Chow, it is a
philosophy for mind, body and spirit that can have powerful health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to yoga, qigong has hundreds of forms, but most combine
breath work, meditation and simple tai chi-like movements. People
practice on their own, in parks with a group or by going to see a
qigong master for treatment. Chow said she had used qigong to help
people recover from accidents, strokes and chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Chih-Ming Hu, a software engineer in Cupertino, has been doing
qigong more than 40 years. After trying six types, he settled on a
form called heqi, which he said had helped cure him of his insomnia
and hay fever after practicing it for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In May, his cousin persuaded him to try Falun. But after six
weeks, he gave up, primarily because his insomnia came back but
also partly because the devotion of its followers to Li made him
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Falun Gong practitioners worship Li Hongzhi too
much,'' Hu said, expressing a sentiment similar to that of the
Communist government in Beijing. ``They think he has superpowers,
like God. Even my cousin said that Li is the greatest person since
the founder of Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't doubt followers' claims that Falun has
improved their health, Hu is also highly skeptical of Li's
writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about physics and the universe,'' said Hu, who has a
doctorate in physics. ``He said the dimension of the universe is
infinite. We know it's four-dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun grew rapidly after Li introduced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People convert very quickly,'' said Nancy Chen, a professor of
medical anthropology at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
``Many people become firm believers in Falun within in a matter of
weeks or even days.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Singer, a Berkeley psychologist and cult specialist,
sees cultlike qualities in Falun, noting particularly Li's book
telling followers they can learn supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   She said 15 to 20 people have called her, concerned that their
relatives who practiced Falun had become peculiarly withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Cult or not, Falun Gong represents an entity China cannot
control, a point driven home in April when more than 10,000
followers suddenly amassed outside Tiananmen Square in Beijing in a
peaceful sit-down protest.
</P>
<P>
   While qigong is popular among many Chinese people, and even
among top Chinese leaders, Falun was viewed as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has a long-standing historical concern
for heterodoxy,'' Chen said. ``They're very concerned about
organizations outside the official views of the state.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exercises are simple. With feet hip-width apart and a tape
of Chinese music playing in the background, the practitioners raise
their arms over their heads and hold the position for several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Like beginning ballet dancers in slow motion, they continue,
holding their arms at various positions.
</P>
<P>
   But the exercises are a small part of Falun Gong. The most
important aspect, practitioners say, is studying Li's book and
applying his teachings to becoming a better person. Followers speak
breathlessly about how it has changed their lives for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read (the books), I knew this was the truth,'' said
Will Barkley, 62, who lives near Fresno. ``It's like Master Li has
been there and done that when it comes to the mystery of the
cosmos.''

unspoiled by high-tech agriculture is a chore without end. Anson

A REPORT ON THE GROWING PHENOMENON OF DAY TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SHANNON BUGGS  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A computer monitor in a north Houston office suite is
lit up with about a dozen open windows. At the center is a box with
stock quotes rapidly scrolling across it.
</P>
<P>
   Matching prices are grouped together and highlighted in neon
colors, such as hot pink, lime green and fluorescent yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away, a century-old Wall Street firm could be
selling 1,000 shares of a hot technology security for a sixteenth
of a dollar less than an online discount brokerage based on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But by simply tapping a ``buy'' or a ``sell'' button on the
computer keyboard, a trader can exploit that tiny price difference
in less than a second. This is how day traders make _ and lose _
large sums of money every day that the markets are open.
</P>
<P>
   Providing them with level II software, which makes such
speed-of-light trading possible, is the niche market that a handful
of Texas companies with Houston connections are trying to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed software that virtually bypasses the broker,''
says Bobby Earthman, president of TradeCast, which bills itself as
the nation's largest provider of day-trading software.
</P>
<P>
   Earthman and partner Jim Howell are building a company based on
the belief that as more people stop counting on annual raises to
increase their wealth and start investing whatever money they can
in the stock market, they are going to want and need the technology
that the professionals use.
</P>
<P>
   They and others in the market predict investors will soon tire
of sending e-mails to their brokers on systems like E-Trade and
instead will take more direct control over their orders and need
immediate access to the markets to do it.
</P>
<P>
   TradeCast, Momentum Securities Management Co. and Gro Corp. all
are based in Houston and all produce Windows-based level II
software. They market their programs directly to the estimated
4,000-5,000 traders in the United States, as well as to the 62
day-trading firms in this country that handle their trades.
Thirteen of those firms are headquartered in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rushmore Financial Group, a Dallas-based holding company for
Internet financial services companies, is trying to buy the
incomplete Windows-based software system that Block Trading of
Houston was developing before it filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The software typically is installed on a home or office computer
using CDs or files downloaded from the Internet. Once it's up and
running, an investor can see what a broker sees _ all the prices
traders around the world are asking for and getting on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators are worried that such software may get the public
too close to the action.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Association of Securities Dealers board
approved a new rule that, if approved by the Securities &AMP; Exchange
Commission, would require day-trading firms to screen customers to
determine if they and their financial portfolios are suited to day
trading.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, the first _ and for some firms, only _
requirement is whether a potential trader has the net worth for
this venture.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a trader can open an account with a day trading firm
with $5,000 to $25,000. But industry watchers say to be successful,
potential traders must have at least $50,000 they can afford to
lose as they learn how to keep pace with second-to-second trading.
</P>
<P>
   And that sum does not include the costs of buying a computer and
running high-speed data lines into a home or renting a similar
set-up in a firm's offices. Nor does it include fees for receiving
real-time market quotes or trade commissions, which are typically
about $20 per trade or $40 for a roundtrip of buying and selling a
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms offer training classes that cost additional thousands
of dollars. These courses teach new clients how to use the trading
software. But after the instructors offer tips on trading
techniques, analyzing stocks and making split-second decisions,
they don't hang around to become their students' financial
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is no safety net for day traders.
</P>
<P>
   When they make large sums of money, they only have themselves to
congratulate. And when they lose money, the blame is also theirs
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the North American Securities Administrators
Association issued a report saying that 70 percent of all day
traders end up losing money. A trade group disputed the report as
the result of a survey they said was too limited and not
representative.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading is just like starting any new business,'' says
Jeff Burke, who trades daily from his Houston home. ``You can't
start any business without a capital contribution. Every company
goes into the red before getting into the black.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the rare person who can afford and bear to lose
substantial portions of his personal wealth. Although investigators
say there are many reasons Mark Barton killed nine people at two
Atlanta day-trading firms July 29, one trigger may have been anger
about losing $105,000 in 15 days of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading is a lot like commodities trading, which is
basically betting on the weather,'' says Kathleen Sindell, author
of ``Investing On-line for Dummies'' (IDG Books Worldwide 1999).
``If you did badly one day, there's no guarantee you'll do better
the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-assisted day trading is a relatively new phenomenon
that grew out of the Nasdaq, a completely electronic stock market.
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, it has no central location or
stock trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   So, when a person buys or sells a Nasdaq stock, typically she
places a limit order with a broker that specifies what price she is
willing to accept or pay for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   If the broker's firm does not make a market in the stock _ which
is to buy and sell securities whenever there is a demand _ then the
broker electronically forwards the order to a market maker that
does.
</P>
<P>
   Now, among all the orders flowing into the market maker, the
firm frequently gets the chance to scoop up stock at low prices and
then sell it to buyers at the prices they requested. The market
maker pockets the difference, which is known as the spread.
</P>
<P>
   Market makers rarely let customers trade inside the spread, even
if a customer's buy price was the same as another's sell price.
They also would let limit orders sit unexecuted until the market
rose or dropped to a point where they could get a spread they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This practice proved so lucrative that market makers would pay
retail brokerages for their ``order flow,'' meaning that for a fee,
a market maker would get to fill all the orders a brokerage
generated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically getting kickbacks at the end of each month
and their clients don't know anything about it,'' says Jim Lee,
Momentum's president, who also leads the Electronic Traders
Association, which is based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD first tried to rein in the power of its voluntary
dealers in 1984, when it established the small order execution
system (SOES). That system pushes orders of 1,000 shares or less to
the front of the execution line, allowing small investors to get
their orders filled at market makers' advertised prices.
</P>
<P>
   But since few investors knew about it, SOES did not even the
playing field as much as the commission had anticipated. So, in
1996, the SEC said market makers were taking advantage of the
public and required them to either fill limit orders or broadcast
them on the Nasdaq trading system to other market makers so they
could fill them.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also allowed private trading systems called electronic
communications networks to tap into the Nasdaq and post their own
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The ECNs try to match buyers and sellers before their orders are
posted on the Nasdaq, which has had the effect of drastically
narrowing the spreads of traditional market makers.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this environment that day trading is thriving and
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Wall Street is not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the ECNs have come into being, the spreads have
lessened,'' says author Sindell, who teaches personal finance at
Johns Hopkins University's MBA program. ``The forecast is that the
ECNs will eventually drive out spreads altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading now accounts for about 15 percent of Nasdaq's
trading volume, with much of the activity targeted on Internet
stocks that have big price swings.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiment in traditional brokerages is that the typical
online investor doesn't like that much volatility or care about
saving pennies on stock purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not interested in getting that extra
sixteenth,'' says Rob Sterling, a digital commerce analyst with
Jupiter Communications in New York. ``They'd like to get it, but
they're not willing to go through such a complicated process to get
it.''

HOMELESS KIDS PROBLEM AT ITS WORST IN LOUISIANA

   NEW ORLEANS _ Shirel Pilot and her 10-year-old son have no place
to go until the Salvation Army shelter reopens for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   They walk. They watch the clock creep toward 3 p.m., the magic
hour.
</P>
<P>
   They walk some more.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, the heat feels like it reaches up from the
shimmering sidewalk with hot, sticky fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walk all day,'' Pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless children are the nation's new outcasts, according to a
recent study by the Better Homes Fund, and Louisiana children are
at higher risk for homelessness than any in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   State and local data indicate as many as 13,000 Louisiana
children are homeless at some point in the year, and it's getting
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot has been widowed for seven years, trying to rear four
children on her dead husband's disability income. But that income
dried up six months ago, she said, about the time she lost her home
in a dispute over repairs with her landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Affordable housing is scarce in New Orleans, and what poor
families can afford to live in is in such deplorable shape that
it's frequently being boarded up and razed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the city's ancient public housing projects,
decaying, multistory brick ovens with prosaic names like Desire,
are being demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot ran out of options in New Orleans. Her family's situation
is mirrored throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Homes Fund puts Louisiana at the top of the list for
children at risk for homelessness based on seven factors it
measured using census, education and social service agency records:
</P>
<P>
   _ Louisiana has one of the highest poverty rates in the country.
In Orleans Parish, 86 percent of the 81,000 public schoolchildren
are poor enough to qualify for the free lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large numbers of children in foster care, which frequently
reflects families in financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children living in households that pay more than 50 percent of
the family's income for rent or living in dilapidated, unsafe
housing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large numbers of female-headed households.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vacancy rates. Families most often become homeless because
they can't find affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homelessness among children in public school. Though half of
all homeless children are under 6, the Stewart B. McKinney Act
requires public schools to count the number of homeless children
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decrease in number of people receiving federal assistance due
to federal welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Homes Fund is a nonprofit charity dedicated to
helping homeless families through research, public education and
support of specific programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that homeless children have more frequent
and severe health problems than other children. They live
emotionally stressful lives, haunted by worries that they will have
no place to live or that something bad will happen to their family.
</P>
<P>
   And 97 percent of homeless children move as many as three times
in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The children experience higher rates of violence, alcohol abuse
and chemical dependency in their families than other children.
</P>
<P>
   This combination effects cognitive and emotional development,
according to the study. Homeless babies develop more slowly than
other children, and homeless children struggle with very high rates
of mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   At a basic level, the constant moving around makes it difficult
for children to keep up in school, academically and emotionally.
One-fifth of homeless children don't go to school at all.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot sent her three older children (ages 12, 14 and 16) to
other relatives when she lost her home, and she and Eureal first
moved into a shelter on Magazine Street. It was just too dirty, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army place is nicer, she said, but they can't stay
there during the day, and it's been hard on Eureal. Her other
children aren't faring well, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my kids have gone wild since I've been here,'' Pilot said.
Nodding at Eureal, a passive-looking, round-faced child sitting at
her side, she said, ``His behavior is real bad since we got here
because we're not allowed to whoop 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Eureal still goes to his old school, within walking distance of
the shelter. He'll be glad when it starts up again in a few weeks,
he says, but none of his friends know he's living at the shelter.
He's too embarrassed to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot and Eureal share a small room at the shelter with another
woman and her baby.
</P>
<P>
   There is a television in a common room at the shelter, but they
don't watch it much since the residents tend to bicker about the
program choices, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly I keep him in the room,'' Pilot said. ``I got him a few
toys. He's got a coloring book.''

   Raisa Gorbachev, the former Soviet first lady, was admitted to
the University Hospital in Muenster, Germany, on July 25 to undergo
chemotherapy for leukemia. Mikhail Gorbachev, who is at his wife's
bedside, has for the first time in nine years been greeted by Boris
Yeltsin, in a telegram to the hospital _ although, indeed, it
arrived after other messages from the Clintons, Margaret Thatcher,
George Bush and scores of world leaders. The New York Times
Syndicate is offering an exclusive report from inside the clinic:
``Gorbachev's Sad Mission,'' slugged BC-RAISA-GORBY-ILLNESS. The
author, Giulietto Chiesa, Moscow bureau chief for La Stampa, has
covered Gorbachev since 1985 and written numerous books about
Russia.

 NEW ORLEANS: x x x a coloring book.

<P>
   In a small office at the Salvation Army shelter, Shirelle Tapp
picks up the phone ringing on her desk and repeats a conversation
she's been having over and over lately: ``Do you have kids?'' she
asks the caller. ``Right now I have no family space available.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging up the phone, she looks up and says, ``Sometimes they're
crying so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, most providers report that they saw an increase in
homelessness in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly cited reason, according to the Louisiana
Interagency Action Council for Homelessness, is the nagging
shortage of low-income housing. But many private agencies also
reported that the impact of recent welfare reform measures was a
contributing factor.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, the first wave of Louisiana welfare recipients
hit the two-year limit on benefits, and as many as 3,000 people
were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Some providers say they haven't yet felt the full impact of
welfare reform. A bigger homeless problem is coming, they say, when
people classified as harder to serve and virtually unemployable
exhaust all the exceptions provided by law and are finally taken
off welfare, as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Tapp says it's happening now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started here three years ago, we had plenty of family
space,'' Tapp said. ``Since welfare reform, I don't have a bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even have them sleeping on the floor,'' Tapp said. ``I
started seeing it before January, before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The people also stay longer, an average of two months, when they
used to stay about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real stressful for the kids. This is a big adjustment,''
Tapp said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of mothers are so fearful of the impact the shelter will
have on their kids that they don't show up until just before
bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness was a problem more commonly experienced by adult
men in decades past, but women and children now make up 40 percent
of the nation's homeless population, studies suggest. Unity for the
Homeless, a consortium of New Orleans agencies, says the number of
children it has helped shelter has tripled in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more homelessness in Orleans Parish than our
numbers indicate,'' said Sabrina Mays-Montana, homeless liaison for
the New Orleans Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana Interagency Council for Homelessness estimates
that perhaps as few as half of all persons experiencing
homelessness stay in public shelters, in part because so few
shelters are located outside large cities and metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Andry, administrator of Catholic Charities' homeless
programs in New Orleans, said the shift in Louisiana's homeless
population occurred in 1984, when the oil economy cratered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you actually started seeing families on the
street,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the theories behind welfare reform is that fewer young
women will have children in their teens if there is no guaranteed
federal program to support them.
</P>
<P>
   But Earline Perique, program director for the Jefferson Parish
Care Center, says it's difficult to serve the population that
decided to have children under the old rules but now have no
welfare and no skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come to our facility, they're starting with the
basics,'' Perique said. Regardless of the choices the women may
have made, their children are being doomed to continue the cycle of
poverty, now compounded by homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana has a laissez-faire attitude,'' said Mays-Montana.
``Most of our money is based on tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about anybody can get a job cooking, or cleaning in a
restaurant or hotel, she said, but you can't raise a family on $3
to $5 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've established is another class of citizens, a
population dealing with extreme poverty,'' Mays-Montana said. The
homeless are coming from the working poor, too, she said, citing as
an example a worker at City Hall who recently needed help with
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Mays-Montana said the effects of homelessness definitely show up
in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they're withdrawn. Developmentally, some of them are
behind,'' she said. Many have constant colds and ear infections,
and asthma is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   The older children frequently get leaned on to make sure the
younger siblings get to and from school, Andry said. ``They can't
focus. They're dropping off the kids at school and then (spending
the rest of the day) worrying about picking them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, it's too much for the older children, and they
rebel.

<P>
   MUENSTER, Germany _ It's a little past 11 at night, and Mikhail
Gorbachev has just appeared on the tree-lined path that leads to
the hotel. He's walking slowly, with his shoulders hunched over and
his arms behind his back. He's wearing a blue T-shirt and a pair of
new blue jeans. A few steps behind him, one of two bodyguards is
carrying the black bag that goes with Gorbachev wherever he goes.
It's a reminder of the famous ``nuclear'' bag, which hasn't been
his for years now. But this bag remains filled with mysterious
things the former Soviet president doesn't want to be without.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember ever having seen Gorbachev so strained. It
makes me think of that photograph of Raisa and him on the mobile
staircase of the airplane that had just landed in Moscow, after
they had been held captive for three days under house arrest during
the August 1991 coup. His wife was visibly shaken, but the eyes of
the president were flashing like those of a tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Now the light is gone in that weary gaze. He's clearly moved and
gives me a quiet hug. ``So good of you to come, let's go get
something to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's tired. He says so: ``The first 10 days were very rough
_ I was alone. Irina (his daughter) came once she'd settled things
in Moscow and brought along the grandchildren (Xenia and Nastia). I
wanted _ and had _ to stay with Raisa Maksimovna all the time. They
were sleepless nights both for her and for me, and I had to help
her change her position every 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   With a melancholy smile, he goes on: ``Now I've got a terrible
back pain that never lets up. You know, it's exactly like that kind
of movement they advise weightlifters to avoid, where you bend over
to lift something. And I did it 40 times a night!''
</P>
<P>
   He eats some salad and a yogurt, but I can see that he wants to
talk. Things are going a little better now. Irina goes to the
clinic early in the morning and stays till 2 p.m. Then it's his
turn until evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot. I don't leave until I see that she is
relatively calm. For the first few days she was so exhausted. She
suffered a lot. The treatment is so violent, so harsh,'' he says,
sighing.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa had learned her diagnosis only a few days earlier. The
family's compassionate attempt to keep her mind free of the bad
news couldn't last for long. It was her questioning that put
Gorbachev up against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never told her a lie in my entire life. She knows that _
so she didn't ask the doctor, she asked me. I told her yes, it was
a form of leukemia, one of the many different ones. She closed her
eyes and remained silent for 40 minutes. I didn't dare to break
into that silence, which seemed to last an eternity. That was the
hardest moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the doctors explained everything _ showed Raisa Gorbachev
the lab reports and told her there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   The internal medicine clinic at the University Hospital in
Muenster is one of the world's finest care centers. The original
diagnosis was made in Moscow on July 21 by Dr. Andrej Vorobiof of
the Central Clinical Hospital. Four days later, Raisa Maksimovna
was in the high-tech room of the transplant department at the
Muenster clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To visit this area you have to remove all your clothing, put on
sterilized clothes and cover your mouth with a mask. The hundreds
of letters and flowers and gifts that keep arriving are not even
allowed into the ward. They are rerouted to the hotel room of Karen
Karagesianz, the press secretary of The Gorbachev Foundation, who
is taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   But how, I wonder, did Raisa get to Muenster so fast? In her
weakened state, she couldn't have taken a commercial flight. Did
the Russian government provide a plane? Gorbachev shakes his head.
He would rather not talk about this. Irina also keeps mum, despite
herself.
</P>
<P>
   They show me a batch of recent well wishes. Two days earlier, a
telegram arrived from Boris Yeltsin (after those from the Clintons,
George Bush, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and countless other world leaders, Nobel Prize winners and
cultural and religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's telegram reads: ``I want to express my deep concern
for the ordeal that your family is going through. I know well how
hard it is to experience the illness of a loved one. More than
ever, in moments like these, mutual support, warmth and caring are
needed. I wish for you, my esteemed Mikhail Sergeivich, strength
and perseverance and, for Raisa Maksimovna, courage in her struggle
against the disease as well as a speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in the last nine years that Yeltsin has
addressed himself directly to Mikhail Gorbachev, and the former
Soviet president clearly doesn't want to stir up any controversy.
He remarks: ``They're kind words, a very nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to look elsewhere to find out what airplane carried the
Gorbachevs from Moscow. It turns out that it departed from a Swiss
airport and was flying the Swiss flag. It may be (although this
remains unconfirmed) that the plane was rented by a Greek
shipowner, a close friend of the Gorbachev family since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So they didn't fly courtesy of the Russian government. Or was it
that they chose to arrange things by themselves? Beyond politics,
it is true, these questions are of little importance in light of
the human drama confronting Gorbachev and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, while Irina takes her turn in the clinic and after
Mikhail Sergeivich finishes updating reporters, we go for a long
walk in the park. People stop and stare at Gorbachev. He is a hero
in Germany. Bicycle brakes screech to a halt on the winding
streets. A woman shakes Gorbachev's hand. A teen-ager simply says,
``Thank you.'' A well-dressed, elderly gentleman says to him, first
in German and then in English: ``You are the Napoleon of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Gorbachev says, in a forceful German _ and then,
snickering to me sotto voce: ``It is not a great compliment. He
ended up on Saint Helena. And besides he was more of a general than
a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   The prior night Raisa slept better, he says, and her high fever
has disappeared. So Gorbachev is in a better mood. He's clearly
happy also with the coverage of Raisa's story in the Russian
newspapers and on the TV stations. It's a kind of moral recompense
that seems to somewhat soothe the wounds of being ignored for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know something?'' he asks. ``I never expected
this from the Russians. I thought it would take a whole generation
before they understood. But I see that not one bad word has been
written against her, or against me. It's as if our pain has broken
through all of that lack of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tears in his eyes, and this time he doesn't try to hide
them. He shakes his head and puts his fingers over his eyes _ then
pulls a newspaper clipping from his pocket. ``Read this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an article from Izvestiya, titled ``Ledi Dostoinstvo,'' the
Lady of Dignity: ``Maybe we Russians are becoming people again. ...
We seem not to have lost the capacity to share the pain of others.
... It may be only this sad occasion, but we are showing great
respect for two people who love each other, Raisa and Mikhail.''
</P>
<P>
   I read on: ``Diminutive and elegant, with sophisticated tastes,
she is not like the others. She has been the symbol of a country
that wanted to free itself from its dreary greyness. People didn't
understand her, or perhaps they didn't want to understand her.
Maybe too much was asked of them when the couple was in power. But
it's also true that no one was able to bend their will and
subordinate them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Raisa read this article? ``Yes, she read it and cried. I
think she has never read so many expressions of tenderness and
admiration for her before.''
</P>
<P>
   Again Gorbachev has the look of somebody ready for battle. ``I
remember,'' he says, ``how they wrote that Raisa went shopping in
London with an American Express card, when we didn't even know what
a credit card was. Or when they spread rumors that Raisa was
spending great sums of capital to compete with Nancy Reagan, when
in fact all of her wardrobe and personal things were made for her
by Tamara Makeeva in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his hotel room, he shows me the telegram sent by Bill
and Hillary Clinton: ``For a long time we have admired your grace
and composure while supporting unprecedented changes throughout the
courageous political activity of your husband. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, after his turn at Raisa's bedside, Gorbachev is
walking in the garden during a light summer rain that sets off a
warm, fragrant mist. His voice comes, as if he is thinking out
loud, but also with the resolute quality of a decision: ``Raisa
said something very important to me today. 'When I recover _ if I
recover _ let's find a little house somewhere, near the sea, where
there's a lot of sunshine, so that we can enjoy these last years we
have.' And I thought to myself: 'Yes, she's really right. It's time
to live out fully, with our feelings, these last years we have.'''

</P>
<P>
   He eats some salad and a yogurt, but I can see that he wants to
talk. Things are going a little better now. Irina goes to the
clinic early in the morning and stays till 2 p.m. Then it's his
turn until evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot. I don't leave until I see that she is
relatively calm. For the first few days she was so exhausted. She
suffered a lot. The treatment is so violent, so harsh,'' he says,
sighing.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa had learned her diagnosis only a few days earlier. The
family's compassionate attempt to keep her mind free of the bad
news couldn't last for long. It was her questioning that put
Gorbachev up against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never told her a lie in my entire life. She knows that _
so she didn't ask the doctor, she asked me. I told her yes, it was
a form of leukemia, one of the many different ones. She closed her
eyes and remained silent for 40 minutes. I didn't dare to break
into that silence, which seemed to last an eternity. That was the
hardest moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the doctors explained everything _ showed Raisa Gorbachev
the lab reports and told her there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   The internal medicine clinic at the University Hospital in
Muenster is one of the world's finest care centers. The original
diagnosis was made in Moscow on July 21 by Dr. Andrej Vorobiof of
the Central Clinical Hospital. Four days later, Raisa Maksimovna
was in the high-tech room of the transplant department at the
Muenster clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To visit this area you have to remove all your clothing, put on
sterilized clothes and cover your mouth with a mask. The hundreds
of letters and flowers and gifts that keep arriving are not even
allowed into the ward. They are rerouted to the hotel room of Karen
Karagesianz, the press secretary of The Gorbachev Foundation, who
is taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   But how, I wonder, did Raisa get to Muenster so fast? In her
weakened state, she couldn't have taken a commercial flight. Did
the Russian government provide a plane? Gorbachev shakes his head.
He would rather not talk about this. Irina also keeps mum, despite
herself.
</P>
<P>
   They show me a batch of recent well wishes. Two days earlier, a
telegram arrived from Boris Yeltsin (after those from the Clintons,
George Bush, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and countless other world leaders, Nobel Prize winners and
cultural and religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's telegram reads: ``I want to express my deep concern
for the ordeal that your family is going through. I know well how
hard it is to experience the illness of a loved one. More than
ever, in moments like these, mutual support, warmth and caring are
needed. I wish for you, my esteemed Mikhail Sergeivich, strength
and perseverance and, for Raisa Maksimovna, courage in her struggle
against the disease as well as a speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in the last nine years that Yeltsin has
addressed himself directly to Mikhail Gorbachev, and the former
Soviet president clearly doesn't want to stir up any controversy.
He remarks: ``They're kind words, a very nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to look elsewhere to find out what airplane carried the
Gorbachevs from Moscow. It turns out that it departed from a Swiss
airport and was flying the Swiss flag. It may be (although this
remains unconfirmed) that the plane was rented by a Greek
shipowner, a close friend of the Gorbachev family since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So they didn't fly courtesy of the Russian government. Or was it
that they chose to arrange things by themselves? Beyond politics,
it is true, these questions are of little importance in light of
the human drama confronting Gorbachev and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, while Irina takes her turn in the clinic and after
Mikhail Sergeivich finishes updating reporters, we go for a long
walk in the park. People stop and stare at Gorbachev. He is a hero
in Germany. Bicycle brakes screech to a halt on the winding
streets. A woman shakes Gorbachev's hand. A teen-ager simply says,
``Thank you.'' A well-dressed, elderly gentleman says to him, first
in German and then in English: ``You are the Napoleon of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Gorbachev says, in a forceful German _ and then,
snickering to me sotto voce: ``It is not a great compliment. He
ended up on Saint Helena. And besides he was more of a general than
a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   The prior night Raisa slept better, he says, and her high fever
has disappeared. So Gorbachev is in a better mood. He's clearly
happy also with the coverage of Raisa's story in the Russian
newspapers and on the TV stations. It's a kind of moral recompense
that seems to somewhat soothe the wounds of being ignored for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know something?'' he asks. ``I never expected
this from the Russians. I thought it would take a whole generation
before they understood. But I see that not one bad word has been
written against her, or against me. It's as if our pain has broken
through all of that lack of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tears in his eyes, and this time he doesn't try to hide
them. He shakes his head and puts his fingers over his eyes _ then
pulls a newspaper clipping from his pocket. ``Read this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an article from Izvestiya, titled ``Ledi Dostoinstvo,'' the
Lady of Dignity: ``Maybe we Russians are becoming people again. ...
We seem not to have lost the capacity to share the pain of others.
... It may be only this sad occasion, but we are showing great
respect for two people who love each other, Raisa and Mikhail.''
</P>
<P>
   I read on: ``Diminutive and elegant, with sophisticated tastes,
she is not like the others. She has been the symbol of a country
that wanted to free itself from its dreary greyness. People didn't
understand her, or perhaps they didn't want to understand her.
Maybe too much was asked of them when the couple was in power. But
it's also true that no one was able to bend their will and
subordinate them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Raisa read this article? ``Yes, she read it and cried. I
think she has never read so many expressions of tenderness and
admiration for her before.''
</P>
<P>
   Again Gorbachev has the look of somebody ready for battle. ``I
remember,'' he says, ``how they wrote that Raisa went shopping in
London with an American Express card, when we didn't even know what
a credit card was. Or when they spread rumors that Raisa was
spending great sums of capital to compete with Nancy Reagan, when
in fact all of her wardrobe and personal things were made for her
by Tamara Makeeva in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his hotel room, he shows me the telegram sent by Bill
and Hillary Clinton: ``For a long time we have admired your grace
and composure while supporting unprecedented changes throughout the
courageous political activity of your husband. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, after his turn at Raisa's bedside, Gorbachev is
walking in the garden during a light summer rain that sets off a
warm, fragrant mist. His voice comes, as if he is thinking out
loud, but also with the resolute quality of a decision: ``Raisa
said something very important to me today. 'When I recover _ if I
recover _ let's find a little house somewhere, near the sea, where
there's a lot of sunshine, so that we can enjoy these last years we
have.' And I thought to myself: 'Yes, she's really right. It's time
to live out fully, with our feelings, these last years we have.'''
</P>

   &UR; (Giulietto Chiesa is the Moscow bureau chief of La Stampa, the
Italian daily newspaper. He covered the career of Mikhail Gorbachev
from his ascendancy in 1985 through his resignation as president in
1991, as well as his post-Cold War vocation as head of The
Gorbachev Foundation. &LR;

SIMMONS ONE OF THE PATRIOTS' GOOD-HANDS PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The ``attaboy'' of the day at Patriots camp
went to Tony Simmons, the second-year receiver out of Wisconsin,
who a year ago would start on a route to Augusta and end up in
Alaska. Not so this year. At his daily press conference, Pete
Carroll pulled an old Bill Parcells trick: He directed the media to
do a story, this time on Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the guys we've set the stage for to be a big
contributor,'' said Carroll. ``Going into the first game I know
(receivers coach Ivan Fears) got on him pretty good. We need this
guy to make plays and be there throughout. He made a big catch on a
fade off (Champ) Bailey. He made a big-time catch with a guy all
over him on the sidelines where he adjusted very well for a first
down. A year ago we didn't think he could make that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Simmons's route-running has improved immensely.
Drew Bledsoe actually knows where Simmons will be now. This had
nothing to do with a poor sense of direction or lack of
intelligence. It's just that Simmons played for a running team in
Wisconsin; throwing the football was an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   A world-class sprinter, Simmons is strong and big (6 feet 1
inch, 210 pounds). Fears and offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese
believe he can be a receiver who can catch the ball in any
situation: long, short, over the middle, sidelines, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the Patriots are feeling that if Terry Glenn gets
injured again, Simmons would be able to step in and become the
go-to receiver. He may be that already.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear how I'm doing better than last year, because
I am,'' said Simmons. ``I feel it. I know a lot more now than I did
last year. I feel much more comfortable with the offense, and the
coordination between Drew and I is there, much better than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home after the season and did all of the things I
needed to do to get ready again. I came back with a much better
mindset to do things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the experience he gained filling in for Glenn last
year went far in teaching Simmons the ropes. But he was often not
ready for prime time. He did make some superb catches downfield _
four of his receptions went for 40 yards or more _ because running
down the field was one thing he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a style that we are appreciating,'' said Carroll. ``He
is a little different out of the break than the other guys and so
physical around the football that guys can be draped all over him
and he still catches the ball. He has tremendously strong hands. A
year ago we noticed that, but we didn't know it would manifest into
the style of play he's showing now. He makes the play with guys all
over him. The evidence was Bailey, who was all over him on the fade
route and he took the ball away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, too many Patriots receivers went down. They had to
use graybeard Henry Ellard and free agent rookie Anthony Ladd
because Glenn, Vincent Brisby, and Troy Brown all missed
appreciable time.
</P>
<P>
   If they stay healthy, the Patriots could have the deepest
receiving corps in the business, and their guys all seem to have a
speciality:
</P>
<P>
   Glenn: Catches the ball underneath coverage, inside, and deep.
Glenn is really the most versatile receiver, which is why he's the
go-to guy who can change the way defenses play.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson: Still an effective deep man, has the knack of
separation from his defender, and he's the most durable. But too
often he's used as a decoy. ``I'd love to be able to get the ball
more,'' said Jefferson. ``I know I can get open. I think I still
offer them a threat deep, but I can catch the ball anywhere, I
think. But we all seem to have our roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown: Still Mr. Clutch. Makes the big play, usually on third
down. One of the better slot receivers in the game, he's healthy
again. He can catch the ball inside and in traffic and eats up
nickel backs.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby: People may often ask why he's still around, but it's
obvious to Zampese. He's a big receiver who can catch the ball over
the middle. He also has experience and can make up in smarts and
route running what he doesn't have in speed. He's a luxury that
most teams don't have.
</P>
<P>
   After Simmons, Sean Morey, Ladd, Sir Mawn Wilson, Mike Sheridan,
and Nafis Karim are all vying for spots that may not exist. Morey
and Ladd have the best chances of sticking in a special teams or
practice squad capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie has a good idea of how he likes to use these guys,''
said Carroll. ``They'll all have their little roles within the
offense so you'll see them go in and out. It's very hard to knock
your way into this group. Morey and Ladd have a real challenge
ahead of them to knock one of these guys out of the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is giving Simmons some kickoff-return duty in an attempt
to take advantage of his speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete wants me out there more, and I appreciate what he's
saying, but I have to earn that,'' said Simmons. ``He wants me to
do that. It's fun because I haven't done it since high school. I
have to get my body to relearn that.''
</P>
<P>
   His body is now learning where it's supposed to go. Now when
Bledsoe says to go to Alaska, Simmons finds his way.

SOX SOAR ON DAUBACH'S MAGIC CARPET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Monday was the 51st anniversary of the death of Babe
Ruth and the 22d anniversary of Elvis Presley's passing. Some of us
prefer to think this is more than coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   And so on the haunting night of Kings and Sultans, it was left
to Boston's mythical new figure of Joe Hardy dimensions to deliver
a pulsating 6-5 victory for the Red Sox over the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Brian Daubach. He's no Mo Vaughn, no Carl
Yastrzemski, no Ted Williams. He's the son of a Belleville, Ill.,
mail carrier and he spent nine long years riding buses in the minor
leagues. He was released by the lowly Florida Marlins last fall,
then rescued by the Red Sox, but in August of 1999, Daubach is
every bit as dangerous as Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, with the bases loaded, two outs, and the Red
Sox trailing, 5-3, in the ninth inning, Daubach came to the plate.
In one of the most dramatic at-bats of this or any year, the aging
(27) rookie worked the count to 3-and-1, fouled off five
consecutive pitches (including one that was inches from being a
grand slam), then drilled a Tim Worrell changeup off the Green
Monster, delivering all three runners and victory as bulging old
Fenway rocked and rolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a magical season,'' said the Belleville Basher, who
is now batting .339 with 19 homers and 68 RBIs in only 77 games.
``I could just as easily still be in the minor leagues. It's hard
to explain, really. It's hard to explain my whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to Nomar Garciaparra, at this hour Daubach is
the man the Sox want at the plate with the game on the line.
Suspicion of a Faustian pact grows each day. In 26 games since the
All-Star break, the Mighty Daubach is batting .408 with 10 homers,
12 doubles, 38 RBIs, and a slugging percentage of .845. He has
knocked in 15 runs in the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis was on third, Butch Huskey on second, and Jose
Offerman on first when Daubach came to the plate in the bottom of
the ninth. Worrell started throwing fastballs. He would throw nine
consecutive heaters before Daubach cranked the 10th pitch, a
changeup, for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   With the count 3-and-1, Daubach drilled a foul ball to the right
of the first base line. The full count enabled the runners to break
on every successive pitch, and Messrs. Lewis, Huskey, and Offerman
would be plenty tired before Daubach was done.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach fouled off four consecutive 3-and-2 pitches. Foul No. 2
of this series could have ended the game for the A's. It was a weak
pop toward the backstop. Oakland catcher A.J. Hinch got a late
break on the pop and wound up sliding toward the padding, missing
the ball by inches as it fell in front of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Daubach thanked the crowd for the new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first thought it was going to be out of play,'' said the
hero. ``Usually the pitcher will help the catcher on that ball, but
it was so loud, he couldn't hear anything. He didn't see it off the
bat and that was a big break.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach broke his bat on the Hinch popup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy (O'Leary) brought me another bat and said it was the
right one,'' said Daubach. ``It was my last bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar was standing in the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' Daubach asked the shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go do your job,'' said a smiling Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   New bat in hand, Daubach hit another harmless foul, then brought
30,957 to their feet with a towering drive down the right-field
line that came hideously close to being a grand slam. A lefthanded
hitter, Daubach had a good view of this ball as it sailed deep into
the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was fair, but I guess not,'' said Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was foul,'' admitted Sox first base coach Dave Jauss.
</P>
<P>
   There's usually a gigantic letdown after such a near-miss.
Baseball history is filled with hard-luck stories of batters who
fanned after almost hitting a home run. Not this time. Not Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell decided to get a little tricky. After nine straight
fastballs, he went with a changeup. Incredibly, Daubach was able to
adjust, hold back, and spank the pitch off the Wall. Ballgame.
Miller time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back and be able to hit the ball the other way, he's a
pretty good hitter to be able to do that,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bases loaded, bottom of the ninth, it's what you dream
about,'' said Daubach. ``I don't even want to try to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   It can't be explained. The man from Belleville is in a zone. The
larger forces are with him. He rode the minor league buses for nine
long summers. Now he walks with Kings and Sultans.

DIVINITY SCHOOL HEAD ROOTED IN FAITH, POLITICAL SAVVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON -- You can almost hear the Rev. J. Bryan Hehir clench
his teeth when asked about his considerable achievements and the
slew of honorary degrees and prizes that have been heaped his way.
He becomes very quiet when queried about his MacArthur ``Genius''
grant.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Hehir to speak about his weaknesses, and he relaxes.
``They're multiple,'' he says, emitting a hearty laugh. ``The list
is too long to contemplate on a Friday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hehir was appointed this month as the first Roman Catholic to
permanently head Harvard's Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   To his friends and colleagues, this modest and approachable
Chelmsford, Mass. native and textile factory worker's son is known
as an incisive scholar of international affairs with a profound
sense of social justice, a passionate commitment to his pastoral
duties, and a deep, abiding faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant, brilliant student of politics _ especially
the geopolitical scene,'' said Thomas Kelly, the archbishop of
Louisville, Ky., and the former general secretary of the US
Catholic Bishops Conference. ``At the same time, he has never lost
touch with his roots as a pastor: His life is ordered around the
service of people, and he doesn't distinguish between the powerful
and the helpless. He's the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders and theologians from around the country have
lauded Hehir's appointment as an important symbol of the changes
that have taken place over the last half-century at the divinity
school, whose roots date back to the founding of Harvard in 1636 by
Puritans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, divinity school students include Jews, Presbyterians, and
Buddhists. Catholics account for 16 percent of the divinity
school's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate Harvard, which has ecumenicity at its heart
these days,'' said peace activist and theologian William Sloane
Coffin. ``This is a marvelous appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hehir replaces dean Ronald Thiemann, who resigned suddenly last
fall after university computer technicians discovered pornography
on his Harvard-owned computer. Unlike his predecessor, Hehir will
not officially be known as a dean. His title will be chair of the
divinity school's executive committee. Because of his obligations
to the church and his pastoral duties, he will share administrative
responsibilities with other divinity school members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a priest,'' said Hehir. ``That's my identity. Once you
take the vows that's the defining identity of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hehir, a graduate of St. John's Seminary in Boston, holds a
divinity degree from Harvard and is best known for his scholarship
and his grasp of the intricacies of arms-control issues. He is
credited with being the chief author of the US Catholic Bishops'
Pastoral Letter, which called for a halt in testing, production,
and deployment of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much more detailed and informative than anything that
had come out of the church before,'' said William O'Brien, a
professor emeritus of government at Georgetown University, where
Hehir was the Joseph P. Kennedy Professor of Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin said, ``He was always one of the most thoughtful members
of the peace movement. He prays more than he pickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hehir cannot be easily pigeonholed. For instance, he
supported the Gulf War on the grounds that it was a war against
Iraqi aggression. The same arguments, he said, can be made to
justify the Clinton administration's actions in Kosovo. Yet, Hehir
has deep concerns about the cruel paradox of modern warfare:
high-tech, pinpointing weapons minimize civilian casualties, yet
wreak indirect havoc on civilian populations by destroying economic
infrastructures, including water purification plants and power
stations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where this policy should come under
a serious moral challenge,'' Hehir said.
</P>
<P>
   With his hectic speaking schedule, Hehir spends much of his life
on airplanes. ``He once flew to South Africa and then back just to
give a talk,'' said Monsignor Daniel Hoye of St. John the
Evangelist in Attleboro, Mass. Hoye studied under Hehir as a
student in the late 1960s and early 1970s at St. John's. At another
speech, Hoye recalls watching with wonderment as Hehir gave a
45-minute lecture without once turning the pages of his prepared
text. Afterward, Hoye asked if Hehir had memorized the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I brought the wrong speech,'' Hehir replied. ``I had to do
it extemporaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Hehir was reluctantly thrust into the role of running the school
last fall after Thiemann's sudden resignation. When the details
surrounding Thiemann's departure were revealed in May, Hehir took
questions in meetings with anguished students, staff and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how permanent Hehir's appointment at the Divinity
School will be. Harvard University President Neil Rudenstine seemed
to wonder the same thing in a letter to faculty that announced
Hehir's appointment. The university, Rudenstine wrote, should be
``realistic about the length of service'' it could reasonably
expect from Hehir.

   OTISFIELD, Maine _ Manal Abbas, 15, slipped into her sleeping
bag, her heart booming deep in her chest. She stared at the
wood-plank roof, scared of what the girls _ the Israelis _ sleeping
next to her might do if she closed her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Manal, a Palestinian, lives in the crowded West Bank, where
Arabs encounter Uzi-toting Israeli soldiers. She had never before
met an Israeli girl. She only knew what family, friends, and Arab
media pounded into her: Israelis are evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if one of them tries to stab me?,'' she thought.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is common the first night at Seeds of Peace, a camp that
brings Jewish and Arab teens from the cauldron of their Middle East
homelands to an idyllic New England camp for a three-week odyssey
of self-discovery and enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   But the next morning when the sun shimmers through the tall
pines here, and they are alive to feel its warmth, they open their
eyes to a jolting reality: Not all Arabs are terrorists. Not all
Israelis want to destroy Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   And through emotional 90-minute ``coexistence sessions'' where
they scream ``You stole my land!'' and ``Your people are
terrorists!'' they begin a process of transformation that directors
here hope lasts a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical coming here to meet Palestinians and Arabs in
general,'' said Yair Rachmani, a 15-year-old Israeli from
Jerusalem. ``But now I understand how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   After letting out their rage the teens eventually figure out
that they cannot make progress without listening.
</P>
<P>
   As they see people they have viewed all their lives as enemies
crying and shaking, they learn to empathize and realize they are
not the only ones who have suffered. Both sides are victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem like a simple thing, but you have to understand
that many of these boys and girls have never heard the other
side,'' said John Wallach, the camp's founder and an American
journalist who covered the Middle East for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach calls the process detoxification. He said the teens are
young enough, 13 to 16, where ``hatred that is learned can be
flushed out of their system.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it is nearly impossible to do the same with adults.
``They have too much baggage,'' he said. Many of the adults who
accompany the teens, serving as chaperones, cling to their own _
Jew with Jew, Arab with Arab. It takes an intensive two-day program
for the adults on Hurricane Island off Maine's coast just to break
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, in 1992, Wallach founded this program centered on
young people who would return to their homelands as ``ambassadors
of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   They arrive from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and
other countries; about 450 teens divided among three sessions this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   On this sprawling camp overlooking Pleasant Lake northwest of
Portland, the teens are full of energy during the day, enjoying the
kinds of activities common to most camps.
</P>
<P>
   They spend their days on tennis, basketball, baseball,
volleyball, archery, canoeing, and swimming. When they are playing,
the only visible difference at this camp is that the Muslim girls
cover their hair and that, in keeping with Islamic custom, the boys
and girls swim separately.
</P>
<P>
   At night, they tumble into their bunks, sometimes giggling as
they recount their day's memories. Other times, they keep debates
alive well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night, as the rest of the girls in their bunk slept,
Manal and her Israeli friend, Adi Fassler, set a flashlight on the
floor, illuminating their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Curled on their beds in their pajamas, they began debating who _
Arabs or Jews _ should get Jerusalem, a question that bitterly
divides the region.
</P>
<P>
   Manal: ``If I had the power, I would take all of Jerusalem,
especially East Jerusalem because it belongs to the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Adi: ``If I had the power I would, too, but that's not going to
make peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just saying that if I. . . .,'' Manal started.
</P>
<P>
   Adi cut in: ``I can't agree with this. East Jerusalem is the
most important place to the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Manal: ``Just because they have holy places there, doesn't mean
they can't come in to pray, just like the Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Manal and Adi never resolved their argument, which they say will
continue for years. But they walk away from Seeds of Peace with a
lesson in great demand back home: the ability to respect each
other's opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agreeing is not the point. Agreeing to disagree is,'' said
Ramy Nagy, a 15-year-old Arab from Egypt who attended the camp for
a second time. ``This year, I am not screaming at all. Last year, I
couldn't stop screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has so impressed agencies in other countries that
Wallach has been asked to create similar pilot programs for Greek
and Turkish Cypriot youths and one for youngsters from Serbia,
Croatia, and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   This year the program cost $1.5 million, or $2,500 a youngster _
all of it donated. Their parents help pay air fare. The program's
success is borne out by its expanding enrollment. The number of
campers has grown tenfold since the 40 teens at the inaugural
summer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the teens leave camp full of hope. When they return
home, however, most will face criticism from those, including
friends, who say they have been brainwashed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, they say they will keep in touch with their
newfound friends via e-mail and will try to visit each other. For
some, that will mean traveling in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Manal says she will keep in touch with her close friend, Adi,
the Israeli girl who lives just a few miles beyond the security
checkpoints of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I could have a close friend like Manal,'' Adi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adi says now she knows why building peace is so difficult. She
believes if adults and government leaders went through the same
camp, they would learn to accept each other.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Carole-Pierce, the director of the program, is realistic
about what the camp can accomplish. No teen, she says, walks away
dramatically altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't change overnight,'' she said. ``But you can get
confused. Confusion is good because it means you're curious, that
you want to know more.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, she says, puts them leaps and bounds ahead of their
governments.

REVOLUTION SEARCHING FOR THAT RIGHT MIX ON THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Revolution have lost five successive games and are
still lacking depth in central defense. But they are hoping the
additions of defensive midfielder Leonel Alvarez and
midfielder/striker Jeff Baicher will give them a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing can happen in Italy, you can buy a player
whenever you want,'' said player-coach Walter Zenga, who will miss
Wednesday's game against Tampa Bay with a strained left knee.
``When you have a chance to get Leonel Alvarez and Jeff Baicher,
you have to consider yourself lucky. Alvarez is a player who is 34
and has caps for the national team, he is experienced, and he is
hungry. We will see what he can give us. Jeff Baicher has scored
three goals and he can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga said he struggled with the trades of Ariel Graziani to
Dallas for Alvarez and Jair to San Jose for Baicher. But he implied
that the Revolution need a change, since they have not earned a
point since a 3-2 win over the MetroStars July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could, I would keep all the players,'' Zenga said,
``because if you send one away, they say there were problems with
him, but there were not. Other teams talk, they want Imad Baba or
Ted Chronopoulos. But I don't want to lose anybody. I believe in
the group. I am trying everything to get to the playoffs. To get
something, you have to sacrifice something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a player is not good in one team, because he has
problems with the city he is in, or the coach. He changes and he
becomes the best player in the league. Sometimes you can change one
player and everything changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to galvanize the team, Zenga convened the
Revolution for dinner in Boston's North End Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have one goal: the playoffs,'' Zenga said. ``We need to
work together on and off the field. This is an unlucky period. From
John Harkes to the last person on the team, everyone wants to win
and stay together and fight together.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes seemed surprised by the trades, but said, ``Maybe we need
some new blood. Leonel Alvarez is a proven, quality player for
Colombia. He sits in midfield and makes tackles. Hopefully we can
pick it up from there. You can't really comment on trades for a
couple of weeks. You have to wait a week or so to see how things
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are questions about Alvarez's role on a team that has
several defensive midfielders, including Harkes. Alvarez is a
holding midfielder who can read the tone of a game and direct his
team from a deep-lying position. But Alvarez is also a high-profile
leader who is expected to reinforce the Revolution's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Walter's decision,'' Harkes said. ``The coach sets the
lineup. It would be nice to have a settled lineup for three games.
We'll see. Everything will work out somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have leaders here, we have veteran players here. Sometimes
they have to be more vocal. We have Dan Calichman, Mike Burns, Ted
Chronopoulos, Ivan McKinley, Joe-Max Moore. We need to have
discussions. We need to have talks about things. If we make a
mistake this week, we just can't do it again next week. We need to
have more from our leaders, for them to stand up and take
responsibility. If you don't work out your problems, they will stay
and linger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution faltered badly in surrendering an early lead
during a 2-1 loss to San Jose last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making the same mistakes,'' Harkes said. ``You look at
the game tape and you see them. We are not working hard for each
other as an 11. Once we get that down, we'll be OK. One win can
lift the team again. When you lose games, you lose sleep, you bring
the problems into your house. It's hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing that has happened to this team is losing games
and the amount of lineup changes we've had. It will be good to have
the same lineup together.''

HE WON'T GET BURNED AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonel Alvarez wants a contract extension. If Alvarez does not
receive it, he will leave the Revolution and return to Dallas muy
pronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can help this team reach its goals, but success depends on
everybody,'' Alvarez said after arriving in Boston Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was acquired from the Dallas Burn in a trade for Ariel
Graziani and is expected to be available for Wednesday's game
against Tampa Bay. But Alvarez rightly feels uncomfortable with the
way the transaction occurred. He had been the focal point of the
Dallas team, its most accomplished and experienced player, but the
relationship ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   And Alvarez understandably wants some security against a
possible repeat of this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen in this league,'' Alvarez said. ``But I
was surprised by this. When you have a group, it's like a family,
with the father and his children. This is like the father throwing
out one of his kids in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's always a learning process and I might end up being a
coach. If a situation like this happens, I will remember this and I
will consult the player before doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pregame show a flop
</P>
<P>
   If the Revolution are serious about having a successful team,
they could follow the example set by Alvarez in the first year of
MLS.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, 1996, Alvarez visited Foxboro Stadium with the Burn.
As he was about to walk onto the field for the pregame
introductions, a Revolution functionary told him to stop and await
the loudspeaker instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez considered the request for about two seconds, then said,
``Let's go!'' Alvarez's teammates followed him toward the center
circle, ready for battle. This was a move that was at once
irreverent toward the local organizers and reverent toward the
spirit of pregame soccer ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn, sufficiently inspired, won the game, 4-1. After one of
the goals, Alvarez enacted a coup de grace by running behind the
net toward the Midnight Riders supporters group, the most
passionate Revolution followers, motioning like he was flourishing
a dagger, then shoving it into his gut. At least, that was what how
many Revolution fans interpreted his action. Alvarez said Monday he
was merely bowing to them, since he had been red-carded and was
departing the field.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Revolution followers were incensed by the
impertinence of Alvarez. But they also wished they had someone who
could rally the team in such a bold fashion.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to underestimate the attitudes of the Revolution,
because that '96 team had some combative elements, as does the
present squad. And the Revolution defeated Dallas three of four
times in '96.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Alvarez's antics provide more a lesson for Revolution
management, which oftens seems more concerned with the
``presentation'' of the game than the game itself. Most of the
pregame buildup is devoured by silly introductions and amplified
music. The national anthem, the traditional rallying point for a
beginning of a soccer game, is treated as surplus; it is performed
before the players even are on the field.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem like a small point, but it robs the home team of
a potential boost, leaving the players more time to be standing
around. This is precisely what Alvarez instinctively attempted to
avoid on his first MLS visit to New England. It is difficult to
maintain dignity, self-respect, and concentration through such a
superfluous pregame ritual, especially when the public address
announcer is telling a relatively sophisticated audience to focus
on activities ``in center field.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this build-up to the methods of D.C. United, the
standard-setting team in the MLS. At RFK Stadium, teams are
introduced in a traditional fashion, with a crescendo toward the
kickoff that is appreciated by both fans and players.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez is expected to bolster the midfield and inject
confidence into the Revolution. The Revolution might also follow
Alvarez's implicit advice by dumping the pregame ceremony, starting
Wednesday. If nothing else, it might improve the team's luck. The
Revolution have earned only two meaningful regulation-time home
wins since May 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful forum
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is a relatively benign symbol of nationalism in Croatia
and Serbia. Croat president Franjo Tudjman declared May 13, 1990,
the beginning of the war between the countries. On that date,
Dynamo Zagreb met Red Star Belgrade in a match that made Zagreb
midfielder Zvonimir Boban the Croats' first battle hero, as he took
on an armed Serb policeman with his best weapon _ his right foot _
in an attempt to defend Croat fans.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamo and Red Star were the major symbols of Croat and Serb
ethnicities, though their players banded together under the same
flag to play for the Yugoslavian national team. Tension underscored
games between the clubs, but the soccer field was the only public
gathering place where ideologies were allowed to be expressed.
</P>
<P>
   And soccer continued to be a forum for peaceful coexistence
after the country split. Croatia's sovereignity was marked by a
friendly match between the nations in 1991. Wednesday, though,
Croatia and Yugoslavia will be playing for high stakes: a place in
the Euro 2000 finals.
</P>
<P>
   The match will be played in Belgrade, and this time the
underlying political theme is intramural. The Milosevic government
has been accused of purchasing more than 20,000 tickets for the
match in an attempt to subvert opposition.

CONTROVERSIES BESET CAMBRIDGE'S LIBERAL REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The official-looking green highway sign
marking entry to this city from Boston read ``People's Republic of
Cambridge'' with ``Passports Please'' inscribed below.
</P>
<P>
   The sign, put up on April Fool's Day 1997, poked fun at this
bastion of progressive politics and widespread political
correctness, a reputation that sets it distinctly apart from its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge City Council was the first anywhere to issue a
municipal booklet on surviving nuclear war, and it boycotted
nonunion-grown lettuce in the 1970s. Over the years, Cambridge has
been a haven for ``causeheads'': anti-smoking, anti-war, and
animal-rights activists as well as rent-control crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the reputation shows signs of tarnish.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor over rent control and other causes has faded, and
grass-roots ire at expansion by Harvard University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology has quieted. In its place:
headlines about sex crimes and racially tinged controversies at the
police department and on school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   As some see it, the news has chipped away at the patina of
think-globally-act-locally righteousness that has come to
characterize this city of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime Cantabrigians say they won't apologize. They note
that the People's Republic is no more immune to conflict, scandal,
and crime than other cities its size, and the controversies cannot
diminish the city's singular reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others will enjoy gloating over Cambridge's embarrassments,
but people here don't lose sleep over it,'' said Glenn Koocher, a
Cantabrigian since 1968, a former School Committee member, and host
of ``Cambridge Inside Out,'' a cable television political talk
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people outside the city grossly overrate the influence of
Harvard and MIT,'' he said. ``And they misunderstand that Cambridge
has large blue-collar neighborhoods that could not care less''
about outsiders' perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Cambridge has always had an easier time acting on
behalf of faraway causes _ such as its support of the
anti-apartheid movement in South Africa or harboring Latin American
refugees _ than tackling thorny issues closer to home:
</P>
<P>
   --Last week, Cambridge police apologized after they admitted
officers are taught that pepper spray, used to subdue suspects, has
less effect on Mexicans, Pakistani Indians, and others who eat
spicy food. Doctors said there is no scientific basis for the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   --The same week, activists picketed the Huron Towers to stop the
removal of a family they say was being evicted to make room for
more upscale tenants. Their plight, observers said, illustrates the
post-rent control tension between affordable housing advocates and
landlords who charge what the market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   --In May, school officials ordered searches of 28 mostly black
and Latino schoolboys suspected of gang involvement. But school
officials have held meetings all summer to try to soothe enraged
parents, and one city official said a federal civil rights
investigation is underway.
</P>
<P>
   --A month earlier, a Cambridge District Court judge angered
local residents and politicians when he allowed an accused rapist
with AIDS who allegedly preyed on runaway teens at the Harvard
Square T stop to await trial under home detention. The defendant's
apartment is just blocks away from the stop.
</P>
<P>
   --Last summer, the black principal of the Agassiz School, who
had just resigned, fled the city when she found a fire burning next
to her car. Police have not concluded whether it was arson.
</P>
<P>
   The city's reputation ``is not my concern,'' said Kenneth
Carson, a lawyer and president of the Cambridge Civic Association.
``My concern is whether these incidents are an indication that
policies in the city need to be changed. The bottom line is that
there are enough of these (race-related) incidents that you cannot
call them a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the city seems to embrace that progressive reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of ethnic sensitivity and inclusion, the School
Committee once tried to change the name of Columbus Day to
``Peoples of the Americas Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge also has been proud of smashing institutional barriers
and stereotypes, including electing a black mayor who is openly gay
as well as gay city councilors. Cambridge was among the first
cities to adopt legislation granting gay and lesbian city workers
the same benefits as married heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   But its handling of affirmative action and other significant
social issues in its own backyard, observers say, just never came
as easily _ especially during the influx of immigrants from Asia,
Latin American and the Caribbean in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As of last March, the city faced 37 pending discrimination
complaints, 21 of which are race-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world may perceive Cambridge as a progressive place, but
black people here do not,'' said Saundra Graham, a lifelong city
resident and one-time housing developer and city councilor from
1971 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism has always been in the background of Cambridge, but it
is coming forward now,'' Graham said. ``Younger, more educated
blacks are saying they will fight this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old-timers in East Cambridge scoff at the city's highly
public efforts to be fair and inclusive. What ultimately drives the
city, they say, is hard economics _ not some soft-hearted City
Council pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids can't live here any more now that they are grown
because they can't afford it,'' said Sergio Salmano, 64, a retired
carpenter who bought his single-family home here more than three
decades ago. ``Is that fair? You tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Overlaying the controversies is the perception that the city's
booming real estate market is dragging it toward what many fought
so hard against: A place of politically disinterested haves and
disenfranchised, subsidized have-nots, with those in between
fleeing to places they can better afford.
</P>
<P>
   Plummeting public school enrollment tells part of the story. One
school, originally built for 445 students, had an enrollment last
year of only 184 children, and at least two other schools are
expected to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambridge is losing a lot of people who were raised here and
want to stay,'' said a Huron Towers tenant paying $1,700 for the
three-bedroom flat she shares with her husband and children. The
Cambridge native asked to remain unidentified for fear of
retaliation from building management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of Section 8 (federally subsidized) friends who
have had to leave,'' she said. ``A lot of elderly and minorities
are moving out. Wealthier people, mostly whites, are moving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes, city leaders say Cambridge is doing more
than most to maintain its sense of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   According to City Manager Robert Healy, Cambridge has spent more
than $20 million in the past five years on affordable housing,
including funding housing vouchers and buying up former
rent-controlled apartments _ among the highest such expenditures in
the country. The school district spends $10,000 a year per student,
about $4,000 more than the state average, according to state data.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge still spends almost $200,000 on both the Peace
Commission _ the only one in Massachusetts _ and the Women's
Commission, one of only three statewide with a paid staff,
according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a strikingly Cambridge effort, those who have profited from
the city's formidable real estate market _ including bankers and
realtors _ are holding a fund-raiser with the city's fair housing
commission in October. The proceeds will help tenants pay security
deposits for rental homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything will change in the People's Republic,''
said Norman McIver, a senior vice president at Cambridge Trust
Company and a board member of the Central Square Business
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always have a very strong liberal group that will be
quick to react to any issue,'' he said, ``whether it's Farm Aid or
Save the Whales.''

THIS IS YOUR FATHER'S STRUNK &AMP; WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First the good news: After 20 years, a revised edition of ``The
Elements of Style,'' William Strunk and E. B. White's classic guide
to writing, has just been published.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bad news: Someone forgot to revise it.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth edition has been a pretty big deal, as usage books
go. The buzz was sufficient to prompt a New York Times essay, even
before publication, and a sniffy Wall Street Journal editorial
deprecating (of course) the book's baby steps toward ``gender
correctness.'' But for better or worse, not much in the new model
is new.
</P>
<P>
   And this book was past due for an overhaul; as I wrote here last
year, the third edition was the same age as the college freshmen
using it. The section on ``Words and Expressions Commonly Misused''
was especially creaky, with its advice to Get up a letterhead
rather than personalize your stationery, its futile resistance to
the verb contact, its handwringing over misspellings of memento.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``commonly misused'' list has changed very little in the
'99 edition, and some of its sillier edicts remain intact.
Offputting and ongoing are still derided as ``inexact and clumsy,''
not to mention ``newfound'' _ but if they were ``newfound'' in
1979, they can hardly be ``newfound'' all over again in 1999. We're
told to avoid ``six people'' _ a construction used by Chaucer _ on
the grounds that you can't call an individual ``one people''; why
not outlaw ``six geese'' because there's no such thing as ``one
geese''? And we learn that clever ``means one thing when applied to
people, another when applied to horses'' _ nice to know in 1918,
when Strunk's first handbook appeared, but a mere historical
footnote in the era of smart cars.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the 1979 edition _ on grammar, composition,
and form _ remain sound and useful in 1999. Strunk's main flaw, as
many writers have noted, was his obsession with conciseness, a
hobbyhorse he whipped into a lather. (White recalls, with
affectionate irony, that Strunk's college lectures were so
stripped-down he had to fill out the hour with repetition: ``Omit
needless words! Omit needless words! Omit needless words!'')
</P>
<P>
   White's own chapter, ``An Approach to Style'' _ always the best
writing in the book _ also holds up well. But the editors do White
no favor by trying to recycle his predictions about slang. In the
last edition, he said that uptight, ripoff, rap, dude, vibes,
copout, and funky were about to become ``the words of yesteryear.''
The new book changes the list of the doomed to psyched, nerd,
ripoff, dude, geek, and funky. But hey, dudes _ didn't anyone
notice how many of those 1979 guesses had missed the mark? If
ripoff was dying in 1979, how come it's not dead yet?
</P>
<P>
   If White were still around (he would have turned 100 last
month), I like to think he would have revised more energetically _
ditching, perhaps, his cutesy, disingenuous judgment on finalize:
``One can't be sure, really, what it means, and one gets the
impression that the person using it doesn't know, either, and
doesn't want to know.'' (I'm no fan of finalize, but obscurity is
not its problem.) He might have explained the difference between
sex and gender to the Journal editors, and taken aim at newer
cliches (say, ``First the bad news'') rather than ``She
headquarters in Newark'' and ``it obsoletes all other ranges'' _
usages never very robust and now all but extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Angell, White's stepson, contributed the preface to the
new edition, but he sounds barely lukewarm toward the enterprise. I
couldn't help wondering if he was flouting one of the usagists'
favorite strictures on purpose, just to be mischievous, when he
wrote about White: ``I sometimes saw him reading his `Comment'
piece over to himself, with only a slightly different expression
than the one he'd worn on the day it went off.'' Different than, of
course, is firmly vetoed on page 44 of Strunk &AMP; White. (And isn't
that ``to himself'' redundant?)
</P>
<P>
   Can an ``Elements'' packed with anachronisms remain vital, or
will it become a treasured fossil, stashed on the shelf next to
early editions of Fowler? While the editors fiddled, other writers
have been burning up the track, hoping to overtake Strunk &AMP; White
in the 21st-century sweepstakes. Next week, we'll look at some of
the hot competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gentle Readers, information, please: Who's
buying all the usage books, aside from college students? If you
have a favorite, let me know what it is and why you chose it _ and
whether you're rooting for it to beat the current champs.

LESSONS FROM IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa &UR;  &LR; _ The strongest message to come out of the
surprisingly well-attended straw vote Saturday in Ames: It might
not hurt to let there be a little campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination, particularly because Republicans seem to
want one.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of state, and simply out as well, chronic
candidate Lamar Alexander had the best analysis. There are two
forces contending within the party, he said. One is to nominate the
president in waiting. The other is to have a campaign first. What
has happened here is that a resistible force has met a moveable
object.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my evidence:
</P>
<P>
   --While Bush's national campaign aides were spinning their way
through the aftermath, his Iowa campaign team was more candidly
grumpy. And while the front-runner crown remains theirs, they
failed by 20 points to get the 50 percent vote total they were
looking for and failed by half to open the 20-point margin over
number two, Steve Forbes. --The extra turnout was at Bush's
expense. He got his supporters to Ames, but a total vote of 24,000
or so, double the expectation, hurt instead of helped. The Bush
crowd gave out roughly 10,000 $25 tickets to the show, but as many
as 2,500 of the recipients may have voted for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   --After the last speech (Alexander's) ended and state party
officials began passing the word that the turnout had approached
25,000, there was one of those priceless moments in politics. For
the next two hours, no one knew what it meant. Real suspense is not
in the front-runner's play book.
</P>
<P>
   What this means here is that Bush escaped with his big-shot
status intact, but the key word is escape. The president in waiting
will benefit from a divided right, but he now has two wild cards to
contend with, in Elizabeth Dole and John McCain. More specifically,
it means:
</P>
<P>
   --His people here want more campaigning days on his schedule
through the fall, as do the Bushies in New Hampshire, which will
clash with the Texas staff's preference for national flag-showing.
</P>
<P>
   --More days will mean more meat. Bush is currently campaigning
with drivel that excites no one. Individual Republicans are happy
to say they like Bush and especially like him if he can win the
presidency. But this is like, not love, and it's a lousy motivator.
</P>
<P>
   --More of a campaign and less of a coronation will mean more
engagement with his rivals. Campaign boss Karl Rove is already
spreading the word that debates will occur. That's another reason
Bush needs to acquire a position on an issue or two.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, however, that what happened here was at worst a
wake-up call, and as Vice President Al Gore has been demonstrating
here and in New Hampshire, the impact of that can be positive.
</P>
<P>
   If not in his own performance, Bush can still take considerable
comfort from the nature of his opposition _ united in its jealousy
of Bill Bradley's ability to play one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   In the jammed hall Saturday night, one handmade sign caught my
eye in Alexander's crowd. Befitting an age of hype and buzz, it
read ``Better than Expected.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end that sentiment belonged to Elizabeth Dole. She
surprised the pols and embarrassed the prognosticating press by
pulling in people who don't ordinarily play this early, if ever. It
was stunning; the noise in the hall for her was exceeded only by
the roars for Pat Buchanan's one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   But she will go nowhere without a campaign that offers more than
her resume and a plea to ``make history.'' Her rhetorical drivel is
as mushy as Bush's and can't expand her excited base.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the only people as grumpy as the Bush locals are
those working for zillionaire Steve Forbes. His solid second
rewarded very hard work in rural Iowa, but he's not showing
strength in the larger communities, which means that if he starts
attacking Bush, the beneficiaries are more likely to be Dole or
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes claim is that he's now the right man. But last
weekend's numbers say: Forbes, 4,921; Gary Bauer plus Bad Boy
Buchanan plus Alan Keyes, 4,934.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the numbers are two points: differences on economic
issues with the free-market Forbes and lingering doubts about his
commitment to social issues. He can't broker or buy his way into
acceptance; his only choice is more of the same _ hard campaigning
and positive ads.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He's now thinking of ditching the caucuses entirely next winter,
but the odds on that gamble paying off later just went way up. The
turnout in Ames destroyed McCain's claim of sham. It was nearly 20
percent of what comes out for the caucuses, and they all had a
good, wholesome time stealing Pat Buchanan's barbecue sauce and
staring at Crystal Gayle's ankle-length hair in the Alexander
corral.
</P>
<P>
   To remain apart, to act as if you're special _ literally, like
McCain, or figuratively, like Bush _ is to court trouble.
</P>

DRIVERS' TURNS ON TRACK RAISE FLAGS FOR INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Neither Wayne Stevens nor his auto insurance company disputes
the basic facts of Oct. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On that autumn day, the 47-year-old Duxbury, Mass. man strapped
on a helmet, harnessed himself behind the wheel of his 1984 Porsche
911 Targa Carrera, and _ after making sure the car was equipped
with a fire extinguisher and stripped of all loose items, including
carpeting and the contents of its glove compartment _ began dashing
around the track at Bridgehampton Motor Speedway, reaching speeds
of up to 100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens knew the New York track well, having driven it at least
50 times before. But on this day, as he rounded a corner at an
estimated 75 miles per hour, the Porsche hit a sandy shoulder and
flipped off the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, which caused $28,000 in damage, Stevens did
what most drivers do when they wreck their cars: He submitted a
claim to his insurance company, which promptly denied it and hauled
him into court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Stevens fights the lawsuit lodged against him by
Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., his legal battle
has attracted considerable attention among other so-called
performance drivers, who insist that their racetrack forays are
training exercises designed to make them better drivers on the open
road.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, another performance driver who allegedly wrecked
his Porsche on a racetrack was charged with fraud by the attorney
general's office for not telling his insurance company how he
really damaged the car. According to investigators, the driver, an
investment banker living in Boston, had submitted back-to-back
claims two weeks apart, both times claiming he had been involved in
single-car accidents with no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' lawsuit in Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court is being
watched with great interest by insurance industry officials, who
maintain that ``performance driving'' is simply a fancy name for
racing _ which isn't covered by standard auto insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many insurers scoff at suggestions that generic
passenger-car insurance should pay for accidents that, as in
Stevens' case, involve sports cars retrofitted for speed and
increased handling, stripped of all movable interior parts, and
driven at high speeds on tracks alongside similarly equipped
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds to me like a smokescreen for older teenagers who
want to go out and do a little hotrodding,'' said Chris Guidette of
the Insurance Services Office, a private organization that sells
pricing and rating information to insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wannabe Mario Andrettis out there, and they
want to have it both ways,'' he added. ``They don't want to get
arrested by the cops and lose their license, but they still want to
have fun and get insured.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens and other performance drivers, as well as the car
clubs and auto organizations that sponsor performance driving
events, vehemently deny that racing is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Performance drivers, they note, may not pass other drivers
without first receiving a hand signal. Furthermore, anyone caught
racing in a performance-driving event is typically ejected from the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, these are not speed events,'' said
Wynne Smith, executive director of the BMW Car Club of America,
whose world headquarters is in Cambridge, Mass. ``Driving schools
are not timed and they're not any kind of racing event. It's truly
driver education.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance-driving supporters point out that many insurance
companies encourage their customers to enroll in ``advanced driver
education'' classes, which teach drivers how to brake on a wet
surface and how to react if a vehicle in front of them stops
suddenly. But some performance-driving courses go further, teaching
skills needed to handle a car at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the racetrack setting allows drivers to hone
valuable skills without worrying about road rage, police speed
traps, drivers who run red lights, and cars that pull out or stop
short in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   While all types of cars are allowed on the tracks, sports cars
such as Porsches and BMWs predominate.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies ``make the assumption that if you go on
the track, you must be racing,'' said Stevens, who also owns a 1964
Buick Riviera, a 1989 Chevy Blazer, and a 1997 Ford Taurus SHO,
short for super high output.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is education, not racing,'' he said. ``It's no
different, in my opinion, from a 16-year-old getting behind the
wheel for the first time. It's just a different level.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Smith, of the BMW Club, ``Yes, there are probably some
people who do some foolish things at our driving schools, but there
are also claimants who are absolutely justified. It's really up to
claims adjusters and people placing claims to decide that, because
every incident is different.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stevens' case, Metropolitan was prepared to pay his claim
until he mentioned he had made ``improvements'' to the car that
might merit a larger payment. That sparked a deeper investigation
of the accident, which company officials discovered took place on a
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan maintains that Stevens lied on his claim form by
stating that the wreck occurred on a ``private way.'' Stevens
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I come barreling forward and tell them everything? Not
exactly,'' he said. ``But I was never racing, and I never told a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the case, Stevens, a corporate headhunter, said he
asked his insurance agent if performance driving was covered and
was told it was not, but never received a written confirmation.
According to court documents, Metropolitan contends that Stevens
was notified that performance driving was not covered, but that he
submitted a claim anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company denied his claim and re-investigated a
previous accident, in which Stevens was paid about $4,000 after
reporting that he had hit a deer, also on a ``private way.'' When
Metropolitan learned that that accident had also happened on a
racetrack, the company sued, seeking reimbursement for the earlier
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, in turn, has sued the company for consumer fraud and
breach of contract.

SUSPECTS BATTLE TO STAY OFF SEX OFFENDER LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts sex offender registry, established
to protect the public, has so frightened those accused of sex
crimes they are vigorously fighting, and in some cases beating, the
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and probation officials say
defendants' fears of being publicly branded a sexual criminal have
caused a jump in the number of jury trials since October 1996, when
the registry law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants accused of sex crimes now often refuse to plead
guilty in hopes of a light jail sentence, as many did in the past.
A desire to avoid inclusion on the sex offender registry _ which
requires convicted offenders to notify police of their whereabouts
for 20 years _ has also spurred defendants to try to have charges
reduced to non-sexual offenses, such as assault and battery. The
trend means that some sex offenders who need treatment are not
receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unintended result (of the registry) is that it's causing
more people to fight the charges,'' said Kevin Ryle, assistant
Middlesex district attorney. ``We have seen an incredible reduction
in the number of guilty pleas, and increases in trials and not
guilties after trials.''
</P>
<P>
   State Criminal History Systems Board records show the percentage
of sex offenses reaching jury trials in district courts statewide
jumped 22 percent from the first six months in 1996 to the first
six months in 1998. In Superior Courts, prosecutors report an
increase in the number of sex offenses reaching trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of pleading guilty to a sexual offense is hard enough
as it is,'' said David Deakin, chief of the child abuse unit for
the Suffolk district attorney's office. ``Layer on top of that they
are going to have to register as a sex offender for the next 20
years, and that is the straw that breaks the camel's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Contesting the charges at trial appears to be a successful
strategy for some defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-assisted analysis of state records by the Boston
Globe shows the rate of convictions for sex crimes statewide slid
from 33 percent in the first six months of 1996 to 28 percent in
the first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the volume of trials, combined with juries'
growing skepticism about child sexual abuse charges, is driving
down the number of convictions. ``Lately, we've been getting our
butts kicked,'' said Ryle, who heads the Middlesex child abuse
unit.
</P>
<P>
   But those who helped draft the law challenge the idea that the
registry is changing how sex crimes are tried and decided in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the premise that maybe the registry is forcing
people to fight harder in court,'' said Representative Stephen A.
Tobin, a Democrat and House chair of the Legislature's criminal
justice committee. ``I find it rather pathetic that someone
wouldn't exercise to the fullest their constitutional rights,
regardless of whether the registry was in effect or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he would like to examine the data regarding the rate
of jury trials and convictions for sex offenses. He and other
supporters of the registry say it is an important tool for alerting
the public to the presence of dangerous predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the information out to the public about these
serious offenders,'' said William Stewart, assistant chief of
probation for Dorchester District Court and a member of the
registry panel that assigns sex offenders a rank according to their
dangerousness.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, however, said he would be concerned if fewer sex
offenders were getting psychological treatment as a result of the
registry's creation. Research shows that, overall, recidivism for
sex offenders drops after treatment, which is often part of the
sentence for those who plead guilty or are convicted at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the current system imperfect? Yes,'' Stewart said. ``Does
it need to be improved? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The registry law, among the strictest in the nation, established
a central state databank for the listing of juveniles and adults
convicted of almost all sex-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The offenses covered include everything from flashing and
masturbating in public to rape and child abuse. The law is
retroactive, requiring all those convicted since 1981 to sign up
with the state registry and local police for 20 years after
completion of their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 11,167 offenders registered.
</P>
<P>
   What scares accused offenders is not the law's requirement that
they enter their names into the state databank and with local
police. It's seeing their names, pictures, and addresses published
on posters and fliers and in local newspapers _ all permitted under
the public notification provisions of the registry law.
</P>
<P>
   David, a 32-year-old married man who works in the computer
industry, was convicted in Fitchburg District Court of molesting
the child of a family friend in 1998. His local newspaper The
Fitchburg Sentinel &AMP; Enterprise published his name, the details of
his crime, and his address, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had many hate things thrown at my window _ eggs, beer,
trash, you name it,'' said David, who asked that his last name not
be used. ``My cars were urinated on. If I had fought (the charges),
I could have avoided all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the registry law are now being revamped by the
Legislature as a result of legal challenges. Last summer, the
Supreme Judicial Court ruled that sex offenders must be given a
hearing before their degree of dangerousness is determined,
creating a backlog of cases at the state board. Last week, the same
court ruled that every sex offender was entitled to a separate
hearing before they are listed on the registry.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is now rewriting the law to strengthen its
due-process provisions. The new version is due for a final vote in
the next few weeks. But it is not expected to change the broad
scope of the law or the notification provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad disclosure is counterproductive,'' said Joseph Rak
Jr., a social worker who works with sex offenders in Central
Massachusetts. ``What's happening is that guys at lower risk are
being allowed to plead off the registry, and they're not getting
the treatment they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapists say that defendants who plead guilty to non-sexual
offenses are less likely to examine whether they have unhealthy
compulsive urges, and to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are real headaches for us _ they're not interested
in digging deep into their personal issues,'' Rak said. ``They
haven't labeled themselves as sex offenders and if the courts don't
label them, it's that much easier for them to stay in denial.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What health precautions are taken here? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. The studio itself is licensed by the Board of Health, and every
individual artist is independently licensed. There is a test; every
artist has to prove their competency in applying a tattoo, and
maintaining a sterile field, in front of a representative of the
Board of Health. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Is there a risk of AIDS or hepatitis from the needles you use? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. No, there is no risk in a properly run and regulated studio.
None of the equipment used on clients _ needles and inks _ nothing
is reused. Needles aren't resterilized. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Couldn't there be bacteria in the ink? &QL;

Alcohol is going to eliminate not all but a great many of the

<P>
   Q. Do you remeber your first tattoo? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Yeah, I did it myself. I always believe that if you're gonna
hurt people, you should know what it feels like. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does getting a tattoo hurt?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course it hurts. You stick needles in yourself, it's gonna
hurt. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any place you won't do tattoos? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. We won't do hands, heads, feet, faces, or genitals.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old tradition in tattooing not to tattoo public
areas. If you get a tattoo on your face or neck, you have to live
with the fact that nobody's ever going to look you in the eye ever
again; they're going to look at the tattoo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mean there's such a thing as tattoo ethics? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. To a certain degree. If they want swastikas and SS lightning, I
ain't doin' it. Or a woman will want a teardrop on her face, and
they don't realize there's a lot of gang significance to tattoos.
You can very unwittingly get in a significant amount of trouble. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's say an 18-year-old woman comes in and wants her
boyfriend's name tattooed on her. Do you do it? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I give her my standard tattoo rap: Tattoos are notorious for
outlasting relationships. Half of the names we tattoo, the people
come back to get 'em covered up. It's like getting a guarantee
you'll be coming back to get another one to cover it up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you consider tattoos to be art? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. It's an ancient and revered art. Tattoing is one of the few
things that people have been doing to and amongst themselves as
long as there have been people. As old as they could find skin
tissues on mummies, they've got tattoos. The body is a temple;
we're just painting the walls. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There's a stereotype about tattoos, that it's just a biker
and prisoner thing. Is that inaccurate?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh yeah. We get doctors, lawyers, dope fiends, whores, pimps,
white-collar salesman, even a judge from Massachusetts _ one of the
Boston Traffic Court judges; he's a Deadhead. I did some Grateful
Dead tattoos on him. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of women get tattoos in private places. Is that awkward
for you? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Nobody's getting their jollies. A lot of times people come up
with this stupid Beavis and Butthead idea like, ``Ha ha, you're
going to tattoo a breast . . . boy oh boy.'' Trying to tattoo them
is not a lot of fun. We would rather do arms and wrists than
breasts and bums, I tell you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why? Is fatty tissue hard to tattoo? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Yeah, exactly. There's not as much muscle and its hard to get
penetration. A good rule of thumb is that anyplace that feels good
to be touched is going to suck to be tattooed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In Massachusetts tattoo parlors are illegal, but some artists
work at parties or out of their homes. Is this safe? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. In the business we call them scratchers. It's a derogatory term
for someone inexperienced, unqualified . . . for someone trying to
pass themselves off as a tattoo artist.
</P>
<P>
   They're working without proper sterilization in unsanitary
conditions. They are cutting our throats by undercutting our
prices. So we've got no love lost between us and the scratchers. &QL; 
 &QL;

 &QL; 
PAT STEWART, RUMFORD, R.I., A CUSTOMER &QL; 
Q. Why did you get a tattoo? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I wanted one since I was 15. My mom doesn't really care and my
girlfriend likes it. The people that I know, they all got them. The
people that think it's ugly, I don't talk to them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's illegal in Massachusetts except if performed by a
physician? What do you think aboout that? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. It's stupid. Why can't you let somebody put something on your
body that they really want. It's your body and your right. &QL;

   NICK PELLETIER, PAWTUCKET, R.I., A CUSTOMER &QL; 
Q. Would you put your girlfriend's name on your arm? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. No way. Bad luck. Then you gotta go find another girlfriend with
the same name. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the main reason for getting a tattoo?
</P>
<P>
   A. They look good. That's about it. &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   HEATHER TAYLOR, A CUSTOMER &QL; 
Q. When did you get your first tattoo? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I have one my cousin did at 14. It's really crappy. I don't want
to show it; it's distorted, a heart. My cousin used a real needle
and wrapped a string around it and sterilized it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aren't you worried about getting AIDS? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I don't know; I trust her. &QL;

 &QL; 
JOHN MONIZ, CRANSTON, R.I., A TATTOO ARTIST &QL; 
Q. Did you ever get a tattoo you regretted? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I got my name on my upper arm and later put an eagle there. It
was not so much the tattoo but the real estate I regretted; I used
up valuable space. Then in my haste to get a bigger tattoo I put on
something I wasn't happy with.
</P>
<P>
   I eventually decided to have some laser treatment to lighten it.
I went to UMass Worcester and had a dermatologist laser it off, and
I'm hoping to lighten it to where I can tattoo on something I like.
I've already spent $500. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the laser treatment hurt? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. It hurts a lot more than the tattoo, and it hurts after the
process, too, because it's a burn. A tattoo hurts while the needle
is in the skin but the laser hurts because it burns your skin. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (Gesturing to items on Moniz's work table) Are these two
human skulls? What are they doing here? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. They're for decoration and reference. There's no substitute for
a real human skull. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where did you get them from? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. If I told you, I'd have to kill you, and then there'd be three
skulls (laughs). I never use skulls as props and gimmicks. I never
have hats or hang sunglasses on them or have cigarettes dangling
from their mouths. &QL;

ERIN HOLMES, PLYMOUTH, MASS., WITH HER BOYFRIEND, HENRY FOLSOM, WHO
ACCOMPANIED HER AS SHE RECEIVED HER FIRST TATTOO. &QL; 
Q. Are you going to tell your parents about this tonight?
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably not. It doesn't matter anyway. What are they gonna
do? I'm 18. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aren't they going to see it eventually?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah, definitely. But I'm not going to go home and say, ``Mom
look what I've got.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you feel? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I'm relieved that it's over. 'Cause every time he went near the
bone, I would go off the wall. Oh my gosh, it vibrates throughout
the body. I was embarrassed; I didn't think I did very well. &QL;

ERIC SILVA, BROCKTON, MASS., A CUSTOMER &QL; 
Q. What's under the bandage?
</P>
<P>
   A. They drew a nice Jesus. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why Jesus? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. First of all, I'm Catholic. I believe in God, and Jesus suffered
for us, so I just decided to put a Jesus on my arm. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you suffer for Jesus? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Yes, I did. I think about him and the way he suffered and died
for us. So a little pain for him is not that much. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any second thoughts about getting a tattoo? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Supposedly, if you have a tattoo you cannot be a blood donor, so
you think about that. If we all have tattoos, how can we save
somebody's life? (Red Cross policy is that donors may not give
blood within one year of getting a tattoo.)) &QL;

<P>
   ANNA FERANANDES, BROCKTON, A CUSTOMER &QL; 
Q. Why did you get a tattoo? Is it a style thing, like earrings? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Yeah. I'm not going to have my body full of tattoos, but
something small, simple. I don't see any harm done with a little
rose. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are tattoos sexy?
</P>
<P>
   A. For me, yes. It's my body. I like to think that I'm sexy. I
don't give a damn about what anybody else thinks.
</P>
<P>
   (It would not be sexy to have tattoos) all over your hands, or
all over your body. No. But to have something small, simple;
nothing provocative. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You just got a tattoo on your thigh. Why there? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I think it's sexy for somebody who is going to love me. That
will be what he sees. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if your boyfriend says, ``Hey, I want my name''? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. I wouldn't do it. The only name I would put on there is my son.
No man out there is worth it. They'll tell you they love you today,
and tomorrow it's a different story. My son, my baby, now that's my
life.

DRIVERS' TURNS ON TRACK RAISE FLAGS FOR INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Neither Wayne Stevens nor his auto insurance company disputes
the basic facts of Oct. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On that autumn day, the 47-year-old Duxbury, Mass. man strapped
on a helmet, harnessed himself behind the wheel of his 1984 Porsche
911 Targa Carrera, and _ after making sure the car was equipped
with a fire extinguisher and stripped of all loose items, including
carpeting and the contents of its glove compartment _ began dashing
around the track at Bridgehampton Motor Speedway, reaching speeds
of up to 100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens knew the New York track well, having driven it at least
50 times before. But on this day, as he rounded a corner at an
estimated 75 miles per hour, the Porsche hit a sandy shoulder and
flipped off the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, which caused $28,000 in damage, Stevens did
what most drivers do when they wreck their cars: He submitted a
claim to his insurance company, which promptly denied it and hauled
him into court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Stevens fights the lawsuit lodged against him by
Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., his legal battle
has attracted considerable attention among other so-called
performance drivers, who insist that their racetrack forays are
training exercises designed to make them better drivers on the open
road.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, another performance driver who allegedly wrecked
his Porsche on a racetrack was charged with fraud by the attorney
general's office for not telling his insurance company how he
really damaged the car. According to investigators, the driver, an
investment banker living in Boston, had submitted back-to-back
claims two weeks apart, both times claiming he had been involved in
single-car accidents with no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' lawsuit in Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court is being
watched with great interest by insurance industry officials, who
maintain that ``performance driving'' is simply a fancy name for
racing _ which isn't covered by standard auto insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many insurers scoff at suggestions that generic
passenger-car insurance should pay for accidents that, as in
Stevens' case, involve sports cars retrofitted for speed and
increased handling, stripped of all movable interior parts, and
driven at high speeds on tracks alongside similarly equipped
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds to me like a smokescreen for older teenagers who
want to go out and do a little hotrodding,'' said Chris Guidette of
the Insurance Services Office, a private organization that sells
pricing and rating information to insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wannabe Mario Andrettis out there, and they
want to have it both ways,'' he added. ``They don't want to get
arrested by the cops and lose their license, but they still want to
have fun and get insured.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens and other performance drivers, as well as the car
clubs and auto organizations that sponsor performance driving
events, vehemently deny that racing is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Performance drivers, they note, may not pass other drivers
without first receiving a hand signal. Furthermore, anyone caught
racing in a performance-driving event is typically ejected from the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, these are not speed events,'' said
Wynne Smith, executive director of the BMW Car Club of America,
whose world headquarters is in Cambridge, Mass. ``Driving schools
are not timed and they're not any kind of racing event. It's truly
driver education.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance-driving supporters point out that many insurance
companies encourage their customers to enroll in ``advanced driver
education'' classes, which teach drivers how to brake on a wet
surface and how to react if a vehicle in front of them stops
suddenly. But some performance-driving courses go further, teaching
skills needed to handle a car at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the racetrack setting allows drivers to hone
valuable skills without worrying about road rage, police speed
traps, drivers who run red lights, and cars that pull out or stop
short in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   While all types of cars are allowed on the tracks, sports cars
such as Porsches and BMWs predominate.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies ``make the assumption that if you go on
the track, you must be racing,'' said Stevens, who also owns a 1964
Buick Riviera, a 1989 Chevy Blazer, and a 1997 Ford Taurus SHO,
short for super high output.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is education, not racing,'' he said. ``It's no
different, in my opinion, from a 16-year-old getting behind the
wheel for the first time. It's just a different level.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Smith, of the BMW Club, ``Yes, there are probably some
people who do some foolish things at our driving schools, but there
are also claimants who are absolutely justified. It's really up to
claims adjusters and people placing claims to decide that, because
every incident is different.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stevens' case, Metropolitan was prepared to pay his claim
until he mentioned he had made ``improvements'' to the car that
might merit a larger payment. That sparked a deeper investigation
of the accident, which company officials discovered took place on a
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan maintains that Stevens lied on his claim form by
stating that the wreck occurred on a ``private way.'' Stevens
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I come barreling forward and tell them everything? Not
exactly,'' he said. ``But I was never racing, and I never told a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the case, Stevens, a corporate headhunter, said he
asked his insurance agent if performance driving was covered and
was told it was not, but never received a written confirmation.
According to court documents, Metropolitan contends that Stevens
was notified that performance driving was not covered, but that he
submitted a claim anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company denied his claim and re-investigated a
previous accident, in which Stevens was paid about $4,000 after
reporting that he had hit a deer, also on a ``private way.'' When
Metropolitan learned that that accident had also happened on a
racetrack, the company sued, seeking reimbursement for the earlier
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, in turn, has sued the company for consumer fraud and
breach of contract.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OTISFIELD, Maine _ Manal Abbas, 15, slipped into her sleeping
bag, her heart booming deep in her chest. She stared at the
wood-plank roof, scared of what the girls _ the Israelis _ sleeping
next to her might do if she closed her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Manal, a Palestinian, lives in the crowded West Bank, where
Arabs encounter Uzi-toting Israeli soldiers. She had never before
met an Israeli girl. She only knew what family, friends, and Arab
media pounded into her: Israelis are evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if one of them tries to stab me?,'' she thought.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is common the first night at Seeds of Peace, a camp that
brings Jewish and Arab teens from the cauldron of their Middle East
homelands to an idyllic New England camp for a three-week odyssey
of self-discovery and enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   But the next morning when the sun shimmers through the tall
pines here, and they are alive to feel its warmth, they open their
eyes to a jolting reality: Not all Arabs are terrorists. Not all
Israelis want to destroy Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   And through emotional 90-minute ``coexistence sessions'' where
they scream ``You stole my land!'' and ``Your people are
terrorists!'' they begin a process of transformation that directors
here hope lasts a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical coming here to meet Palestinians and Arabs in
general,'' said Yair Rachmani, a 15-year-old Israeli from
Jerusalem. ``But now I understand how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   After letting out their rage the teens eventually figure out
that they cannot make progress without listening.
</P>
<P>
   As they see people they have viewed all their lives as enemies
crying and shaking, they learn to empathize and realize they are
not the only ones who have suffered. Both sides are victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem like a simple thing, but you have to understand
that many of these boys and girls have never heard the other
side,'' said John Wallach, the camp's founder and an American
journalist who covered the Middle East for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach calls the process detoxification. He said the teens are
young enough, 13 to 16, where ``hatred that is learned can be
flushed out of their system.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it is nearly impossible to do the same with adults.
``They have too much baggage,'' he said. Many of the adults who
accompany the teens, serving as chaperones, cling to their own _
Jew with Jew, Arab with Arab. It takes an intensive two-day program
for the adults on Hurricane Island off Maine's coast just to break
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, in 1992, Wallach founded this program centered on
young people who would return to their homelands as ``ambassadors
of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   They arrive from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and
other countries; about 450 teens divided among three sessions this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   On this sprawling camp overlooking Pleasant Lake northwest of
Portland, the teens are full of energy during the day, enjoying the
kinds of activities common to most camps.
</P>
<P>
   They spend their days on tennis, basketball, baseball,
volleyball, archery, canoeing, and swimming. When they are playing,
the only visible difference at this camp is that the Muslim girls
cover their hair and that, in keeping with Islamic custom, the boys
and girls swim separately.
</P>
<P>
   At night, they tumble into their bunks, sometimes giggling as
they recount their day's memories. Other times, they keep debates
alive well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night, as the rest of the girls in their bunk slept,
Manal and her Israeli friend, Adi Fassler, set a flashlight on the
floor, illuminating their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Curled on their beds in their pajamas, they began debating who _
Arabs or Jews _ should get Jerusalem, a question that bitterly
divides the region.
</P>
<P>
   Manal: ``If I had the power, I would take all of Jerusalem,
especially East Jerusalem because it belongs to the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Adi: ``If I had the power I would, too, but that's not going to
make peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just saying that if I. . . .,'' Manal started.
</P>
<P>
   Adi cut in: ``I can't agree with this. East Jerusalem is the
most important place to the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Manal: ``Just because they have holy places there, doesn't mean
they can't come in to pray, just like the Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Manal and Adi never resolved their argument, which they say will
continue for years. But they walk away from Seeds of Peace with a
lesson in great demand back home: the ability to respect each
other's opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agreeing is not the point. Agreeing to disagree is,'' said
Ramy Nagy, a 15-year-old Arab from Egypt who attended the camp for
a second time. ``This year, I am not screaming at all. Last year, I
couldn't stop screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has so impressed agencies in other countries that
Wallach has been asked to create similar pilot programs for Greek
and Turkish Cypriot youths and one for youngsters from Serbia,
Croatia, and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   This year the program cost $1.5 million, or $2,500 a youngster _
all of it donated. Their parents help pay air fare. The program's
success is borne out by its expanding enrollment. The number of
campers has grown tenfold since the 40 teens at the inaugural
summer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the teens leave camp full of hope. When they return
home, however, most will face criticism from those, including
friends, who say they have been brainwashed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, they say they will keep in touch with their
newfound friends via e-mail and will try to visit each other. For
some, that will mean traveling in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Manal says she will keep in touch with her close friend, Adi,
the Israeli girl who lives just a few miles beyond the security
checkpoints of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I could have a close friend like Manal,'' Adi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adi says now she knows why building peace is so difficult. She
believes if adults and government leaders went through the same
camp, they would learn to accept each other.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Carole-Pierce, the director of the program, is realistic
about what the camp can accomplish. No teen, she says, walks away
dramatically altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't change overnight,'' she said. ``But you can get
confused. Confusion is good because it means you're curious, that
you want to know more.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, she says, puts them leaps and bounds ahead of their
governments.

   Do you need a passport to visit Jamaica? A recent story in the
travel section told of a family racing to the airport only to
realize they had left their passports at home. ``No problem,'' the
taxi driver said. ``Jamaica doesn't require them.'' At the airport,
however, the airline said there was indeed a problem. No passport,
no flight. Fortunately, a neighbor was able to rescue the family by
bringing the passports to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   So, who was right: the taxi driver or the airline personnel? The
taxi driver was correct, but the airline won the day.
</P>
<P>
   The real answer is that anytime you leave the country, a
passport is your best identification not only when another country
but when returning home, too.
</P>
<P>
   US citizens are not legally required to have a passport to
travel to the contiguous Western Hemisphere; however, they do need
valid evidence of US citizenship to reenter the United States. In
many cases, the Department of State reports, the evidence of US
citizenship that people take with them in departing the country is
not legally sufficient to permit them to return to this country
because it does not adequately establish US citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Even Canada, which requires no passport for Americans to enter,
recommends a passport as the ``ideal identification.''
</P>
<P>
   While the best document is a valid passport, other documents of
US citizenship include an expired US passport, a certified copy of
your birth certificate, a certificate of naturalization, a
certificate of citizenship, or a consular report of birth abroad of
a US citizen. To prove your identity, a valid driver's license is
acceptable. Photocopies of a birth certificate or a driver's
license are not evidence of US citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Passports are fairly easy to obtain. A certified birth
certificate, a couple of photos, and $65 are needed. Applications
and information can be obtained a many post offices, some
courthouses, and, of course, the passport agency. The entire
process can be done by mail. Allow two weeks or more, depending on
the time of year, for the processing. Passports for those 18 and
older are valid for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to travel outside the country this year or in the
near future, obtain a passport now.

Vermont maze
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's newest attraction is the Maize Maze, a four-acre
cornfield maze that is designed to challenge puzzle fans of all
ages as they seek pirate treasure hidden in the center. Hidden
among the corn stalks are 3 miles of walking trails. The maze,
designed by the British originator of the cornfield maze attraction
concept, is located at the Vermont Teddy Bear factory. Admission is
$6 for adults, $4 for children, and free for the under-5 set.
Tickets include a tour of the bear factory. The site is a half mile
south of the Shelburne Museum on Route 7.

THANKS FOR FLYING AIR SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airline attendants and pilots must get tired of making the same
old announcements, so occasionally they try to spice them up.
Currently making the e-mail rounds are comments that have been
heard or reported:
</P>
<P>
   --``Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken
clouds, but we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from
the overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and
nose before assisting children or other adults acting like
children.''
</P>
<P>
   --``That was quite a bump (upon landing), and I know what y'all
are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault,
it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants'
fault. . . . It was the asphalt!''
</P>
<P>
   --``As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your
belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among
the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   --``We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And
the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the
skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: How many countries require US citizens to obtain
visas for travel across their borders: 14, 34, 54, or 84? (Answer
at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Sportsworld in Kitchener, Ontario, calls its waterpark
``Hawaii H20.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Air travel has its ups and downs.'' _ Professor Irwin
Corey. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sign of the times: In a hospital parking lot in Kitakyushu, Japan:
``Anyone found parking without a permit will be given an
injection.'' (With thanks to faithful contributor Mike Schuster of
Foxborough, Mass.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: A museum dedicated to the Hoover vacuum
cleaner says that it is sucking in visitors. The newly refurbished
Hoover Historical Center in North Canton, Ohio, chronicles the
growth of the Hoover Co. through artifacts, pictures, and products.
Some of those older vacuum cleaners look pretty strange today: The
Leasure sweeper, for instance, resembled a baby carriage. The
museum, at 1875 Easton St., is free. Hours are 1-5 p.m., Tuesdays
through Sundays. For more information, call 330-499-0287. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel products: When you're traveling you're not always in a
position to brush your teeth, and airline food, including wines and
coffee, can dim your brilliant smile if it's left unattended.
Trident Advantage with Baking Soda gum says it will reduce plaque
and whiten teeth. Breath Assure gum and Arm and Hammer Baking Soda
gum make some of the same claims. In any event, all taste good.
Other useful products for the traveler: Curel moisturizer, which
adds a sun protection factor of 15, and Shout Wipes, towelettes
that remove stains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ahhhh: On long-distance flights, Korean Air provides first-class
passengers with bamboo bark to relax their feet. Passengers place
the bark under their feet, then walk on it to provide pressure to
the soles. Doing so is said to work wonders. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The view is fine: The ANA Hotel Sydney, one of Australia's premier
hotels, offers excellent views of Sydney Harbour, but not only from
the hotel windows. A camera atop the building allows you to see
what is happening in and around the harbor. Go to
www.anahotelsyd.com.au and click on the ``Live Video'' area. &QL; 
 &QL; 
That's a lotta hiking: Hiking the entire 2,143-mile Appalachian
Trail takes an average of 5 million steps. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? An amazing 84. Some of the perhaps lesser-known
ones are Benin, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Kiribati,
Norfolk Island, and Turkmenistan. (With thanks to Travel Weekly via
frequent contributor Dave Smith of El Al New England, who also
notes that Israel does not require a visa.)

STEAMBOAT EVENT TOPS THE LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steamboating, an era that introduced Americans to one of the
grandest ways to travel, will be celebrated Oct. 13-17 during Tall
Stacks '99 along the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   The cities of Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington and Newport,
Kentucky will join in welcoming 19 riverboats from 10 states and 14
cities for this once in four years event. The American Bus
Association which annually names the top 100 events in North
America, named Tall Stacks the nation's top event in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among the riverboats participating will be America's only
overnight passenger boats _ the Delta Queen, a national historic
landmark; the Mississippi Queen, and the American Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Steamboating intoduced Americans to a lavish way to travel.
There was fine dining, grand entertainment, music, dancing, and
comfortable ``staterooms'', a term that came when a captain named
each cabin aboard his boat for a state. Even when larger steamboats
came along with more cabins than states, the term stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tall Stacks is a celebration like no other,'' said Leonard
Weakley, chairman of the Greater Cincinnati Tall Stacks Commission.
``The adventure and romance of life on the river are recreated for
five days. Mark Twain himself would be impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration includes continuous on-shore entertainment with
local and nationally known artists performing music from country to
Cajun and Dixieland. There will be activities for children
including crafts and sack races. Military life along the river in
the 1800s can be experienced at Newport Barracks. And there will be
tours of the riverboats.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no visit is complete without a cruise on one of the
boats and there will be dinner, lunch, moonlight and river cruises.
Cruise tickets range from $17.50 to $60. Tickets are on sale
through Ticketmaster Charge-By-Phone.
</P>
<P>
   For general information, call toll-free 877-421 TALL (8255).
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Queen and Mississippi Queen will not be available for
tours or cruises, however, three-night cruises aboard these vessels
are being offered through AAA Cincinnati (513-762-3390).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bermuda cruises
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises has announced that the original Love Boat, the
Pacific Princess, will begin sailing from New York to Bermuda next
year. The weekly cruises begin May 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hawaii cruises
</P>
<P>
   American Classic Voyages, which operates the Independence on
seven-day cruises around the Hawaiian islands, said it has reached
an agreement with Holland America Line to purchase the Nieuw
Amsterdam and reflag it as a United States vessel with a US crew.
By law only American vessels can sail between American ports. While
the purchase is contingent on a number of conditions, the line
expects it will be able complete the purchase by fall and expand
its cruising opportunities in Hawaii by the fall of 2000. American
Classic Voyages is planning two US built vessels carrying 1,900
passengers to enter service in early 2003 and 2004. The purchase of
the 1,214 passenger Nieuw Amsterdam is part of American Classic
Voyage's Project America which is designed to revitalize the
American cruise ship fleet and shipbuilding. The new vessels will
be built in Mississippi at Ingalls Shipbuilding. At present the
only large cruise ship afloat flying the American flag is the
Independence, which was built in Quincy, Mass. in the early 50s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Freigher cruises
</P>
<P>
   A different way to cruise is aboard a freighter. Many freighters
offer cabins for four to 24 passengers, and often have cabins for
solo travelers. While the daily rate is lower than on a cruise
ship, the trips are generally longer, and therefore add up to a
higher price than a cruise. The experience is also different, a
freighter offers a more relaxed journey, and offers no
entertainment. Port calls are often limited as the ship caters to
freight, passengers come second. While freighter have appeal to
retirees, there generally is no medical care aboard and passengers
must supply a certificate of good health. Most freighters also have
age limits of 70 to 79. One source of information and bookings is
through Maris Freighter Cruises (215 Main St., Westport, CT 06880;
telephone 800-996-2747), which publishes a monthly newsletter
($19.95 a year).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
No children allowed
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Cruises has adopted an adults only (18 and up)
policy aboard its smoke-free ships. ``Renaissance Cruises has
always had limited facilities for children, and the policy is
consistent with all our existing programs,'' said Franck Del Rio, a
Renaissance vice president. The line is also unusual in that it
sells its cruises directly to travelers, rather than through travel
agents. The cruises also offer great value. For example, a Greek
island cruise (January through March) is priced from $1,499 a
person for an inside cabin, and includes round-trip air fare from
New York, a five-day cruise, and a four-night hotel package;
balcony cabins begin at $1,799. There are also discounts for those
booking through AARP. For information, call 800-525-5350 or
www.RenaissanceCruises.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cruises of interest
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line's Norway will be the scene of the 17th
annual Jazz Festival on back to back cruises Oct. 16-23 and Oct.
23-30. Top names, including Ernestine Anderson and Ahmad Jamal,
will be performing, and guests may also jam together or join in the
late night jam sessions. Cruise only fares begin at $1,169 a person
and include port charges.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor, a magazine filled with investment advice,
will hold a seven-day Seminar at Sea departing Jan. 30 from Fort
Lauderdale aboard the Grand Princess. Investment advisors will
discuss everything from how to invest to analzing companies for
investment potential. For information, call 877-562-2493.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cruises is offering savings of up to 50 percent on its
Christmas cruises. Since many passengers who normally book the
holiday cruise are booking millennium cruises, space is available
on the Crystal Harmony South America holiday cruise. The Crystal
Symphony is offering a $1,000 a couple savings on its Australia/New
Zealand

HAVE YOU SEEN THE GLOBE TODAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Paul Shelley crashed to the stage in a swirl of knives,
and Julius Caesar was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Again. How many times has he expired over the 400 years since a
scribbler named Shakespeare memorialized the Roman emperor's
assassination of 44 BC in a play called ``Julius Caesar''?
Countless-plus. It's hardly an exclusive club that leading man
Shelley has joined. He's but one more of myriad thespians in the
role, another startled Caesar who recognizes pal Brutus (``You,
too, old buddy!'') as one of the culprits before his lines and time
run out.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Shelley knows he isn't just another Caesar. He's a
member of the Red Company of actors presenting ``JC'' this summer
where it began _ sort of _ at the Globe Theatre on London's south
bank of the Thames. Located nearby long ago was the original Globe,
boasting William Shakspeare as a house playwright and actor (and
shareholder). It met death by fire in 1613.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Globe, an ampitheatre actually, is a two-year-old,
faithfully reproduced double for its namesake: thatched roof,
plaster-and-timbered walls accompanied by Elizabethan music. Live,
not taped. Is this what's called virtual reality? Catching up with
Shakespeare in (almost) his old haunt?
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Great Fire of 1666 had a London roofer been
permitted to top off a building with thatching of straw or water
reed. Only because strict fire precautions were taken, such as the
installation of a powerful sprinkler system, was the new Globe
given clearance to revive an old coverup in reeds from the Norfolk
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it's a mecca for Shakespearean actors, feeling, as they
tread the boards, spiritually linked to their great god Bard.
Playing the Globe must be as heady as a ballplayer cavorting at
Fenway Park, a tennis player booked into Wimbledon's Centre Court,
or a carpenter visiting Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   It is an Elizabethan experience for the customers, too, because
the place is open to the elements, and the cheap seats aren't seats
at all. Packed together on the ground floor are the
``groundlings.'' They've purchased standing room in a courtyard,
and are gathered in a semicircle radiating from the stage, below
the pricier, genuine seats in two covered balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Front-row groundlings seem to have more fun. They can at least
rest their chins and elbows on the stage that is roofed and
cornered by colorfully painted pillars. Caesar's demise is an
in-your-face offing. Theirs is a good position to whisper ad-libs
to the actors. Or shout them, as often happened in Shakespeare's
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy legs and a one-penny admission were the requirements for
those dauntless groundlings _ were they Will's Willingfolk? _ who
jammed and crammed while actors sometimes hammed. The atmosphere
was and is great, though not so aromatic in this descendant Globe.
Cleanliness wasn't remotely in the same neighborhood with godliness
in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   A writer of the period, Thomas Dekker, referred to Shakespeare's
clientele as ``stinkards'' _ flushed and hot, drinking and eating
throughout the performance. ``They were so glued together in crowds
with the steam of strong breath that when they came forth their
faces looked parboiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the groundlings' emanations asphyxiated many a Caesar
before the knives got to him.
</P>
<P>
   Witnessing this performance of ``JC,'' you feel a kinship with
an earlier tourist, a Swiss named Thomas Platter, who in 1599
attended that brand-new Globe, and a freshly-staged version of what
would be a rather long-running hit. Platter wrote: ``On Sept. 21,
after lunch, I and my party crossed the water, and there in the
house with the thatched roof witnessed an excellent performance of
the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   From downtown London back then, theatergoing was an excursion
over the Thames by wherry, rowed by a boatman. Playhouses had to be
situated beyond the city limits to avoid closure by mayors who were
not devotees of the stage. The theater was considered an evil
influence _ the TV of its day? _ if only from the practical
standpoint that it lured workers from the job. Performances were
matinees.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays an easier way to get there is by subway. Alighting at
Blackfriars, we had a pleasant stroll across the Southwark Bridge
for an evening performance that began in twilight and concluded in
electric light, an innovation that would have made Shakespeare even
wealthier than he was from his take of the daytime gates.
</P>
<P>
   The day after, presuming that Caesar would enjoy interminable
resurrections throughout the world during the next century, we
decide to travel as his legions had across Britain _ by foot. David
Kahn, our English host in Barnet, on the northern fringe of London,
says, ``We could have walked all the way from here to the Globe in
London, given enough time. But it's a pretty good hike.'' About 15
crow-flapping miles. ``But it would be a very nice walk mostly
through country that _ despite urbanization _ hasn't changed too
much since Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you could follow the motor roads. But the system of
public footpaths, with not a lot of foot traffic, winds through
carefully preserved strips of land, some of it bucolic, even though
so close to the city,'' David says. Shortly you'll be able to
circle London on secluded earthen trails, a walk of about 150
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Boadicea, his good-natured, butterscotch-coated
Labrador, we cut across peaceful, verdant Hadley Common, scene of
the last battle on British soil, 1471, near the end of the War of
the Roses. Tramping lanes edged in tall grass and reeds, we
penetrate the gloom of aged forests, pass a small lake populated by
ducks and fishermen, and move into farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Blackheaded sheep and paint-splatters of wildflowers are the
residents of a sloping meadow. Another meadow belongs to Frisian
cattle whose black-on-white markings seem maps of continents and
archipelagos.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat marches up a rise like files of infantry while an
adjoining field of timothy is a mauve canvas. With a joyful bark,
Boadicea vanishes, scrunching through a hedge and into a refreshing
creek, reappearing to shake and shower her companions. This Bo
knows mischief.
</P>
<P>
   His dog, says David, ``was named for Queen Boadicea of an
ancient British tribe, the Iceni. You can see her statue across
from Big Ben in London. She was one of our first heroines, a
militant lady who led a revolt against the Roman rulers in about 60
AD.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the previous century Britain had been colonized by none
other than Julius Caesar, who, as we saw, is perishing regularly at
the Globe. Boadicea won some battles, but was put down by the
military descendants of Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt she would have relished Shakespeare's treatment of his
last moments.

THE WAR BETWEEN THE SEXES . . .   IS ON THE AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time for a word with the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   I know a lot of you are feeling pretty used and abused these
days. Television programmers barely know you exist, mistrustful
shopkeepers eyeball your every move, and far too many law
enforcement types think any black man in a car or on a street
corner is a born suspect.
</P>
<P>
   I feel your pain, my brothers.
</P>
<P>
   I know there's nothing more trying than being a black man in
America _ although being a black woman having to constantly hear
about how trying it is to be a black man in America rates a very
close second. So, I know the last thing you need is a war raging
close to home, deep within the trenches of your community with some
sisters who just aren't showing the ne'er-do-wells among you any
love.
</P>
<P>
   Seems these days that whenever you turn on the radio, MTV, or
BET, there's a ready earful from women who are mad as hell and
aren't going to take it anymore. Instead of protecting and
respecting, they're dissing and dismissing those of you who just
can't seem to get it together.
</P>
<P>
   A while back it was TLC's T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli getting
under the skin of the smack-talking Lotharios. In their hit, ``No
Scrubs,'' they took to task absentee fathers _ men who still live
with their mothers, don't have cars, and seem to get a paycheck as
often as the Sox win a World Series. Say the ladies:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't want your number
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't want to give you mine
</P>
<P>
   And no, I don't want to meet you nowhere
</P>
<P>
   And no, I don't want none of your time
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A scrub refers to any man who doesn't have what it takes to get
in the game _ especially when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, you deeply offended brothers were dogging TLC
as if there weren't actually men out there cruising through the
world on the fumes of their specious charms. None seemed more
offended than Sporty Theivz, a New York-based rap group. In the
grand 1980s tradition of Roxanne Shante's ``Roxanne's Revenge,'' a
response to U.T.F.O.'s ``Roxanne, Roxanne,'' Sporty Thievz sampled
``No Scrubs'' and released an answer song, ``No Pigeons.'' They
rudely and crudely denounced women as money-grubbing shade-throwing
poseurs with dirty underwear, fake nails, and fuzzy upper lips.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the ladies of Destiny's Child recently fired
the latest shot in this ongoing urban battle-of-the-sexes with
their biting blockbuster hit, ``Bills, Bills, Bills.'' It's the
all-too-familiar tale about lovers-turned-losers, where
once-generous men devolve into car-borrowing, no-bill-paying
slackers _ the kind of man who buys his girlfriend expensive gifts
using her own credit card. Or as Destiny's Child succinctly puts
it, ``You're a trifling, good-for-nothing type of brother.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amazon.com's customer comments section, a Kansas City, Mo.,
man gives the song one out of five stars, and denounces it as a ``a
flavor of the week man-slam.'' He writes, ``No wonder male/female
relationships are in disarray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bills, Bills, Bills,'' is currently No. 2, and the album,
``The Writing's on the Wall'' is No. 10. As with ``No Scrubs,''
there's already an angry response _ ``Pay Your Own Bills,'' by
Blackcats. Brothers haven't been this ticked off since Alice Walker
wrote her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``The Color Purple,'' and
was accused of bashing black men and portraying them as callow and
cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, my brothers, I know how you're feeling. Disrespected
disregarded, and read like a cheap novel. But I have to give it up
for the sisters who are no longer biting their tongues, and are
taking on men who won't treat women right.
</P>
<P>
   See, fellas, we're a long way from Billie Holiday singing that
she'd rather have her man hit her than quit her, as she did in
``Ain't Nobody's Business'' And for decades women have endured all
kinds of musical gruff, from the Rolling Stones' catchy but sexist
``Under My Thumb'' to any number of unprintable terms flung by more
than a few men of hip-hop. So there's absolutely nothing wrong with
the ladies having their say, and letting men know exactly what time
it is.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when some popular music is tainted by misogyny _ just
look at the riot that was Woodstock '99, where several women were
reportedly raped _ it's not only refreshing, but necessary for
women to make themselves defiantly heard. And if that bristles a
few feathers, well, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   So while I understand, my brothers, why some of you may be
upset, perhaps your energies would be better spent trying to get
those trifling men to straighten up rather than lambasting the
women who raise their voices in song to expose this nonsense.

MUSIC SUPERSTORE HOPES TO PLAY WELL WITH MUSICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Need to equip every rock band that played at the recent
Woodstock reunion? No problem, says Mark Begelman, founder of Mars,
a music superstore chain that is opening a huge box of a store this
week in Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By Begelman's count, each of his 25 Mars stores stocks more than
1,300 varieties of guitars. Stores formally known as Mars, the
Musician's Planet, also have enough tubas, trombones, and cymbals
to keep the Ohio State marching band happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to come in here and say, `Wow,' '' said
Begelman, who dabbled in amateur rock 'n' roll bands before leaving
a top job at Office Depot to start the Mars chain.
</P>
<P>
   The superstore concept has worked well for pet food and paper
clips. As Home Depot and Circuit City can attest, it's done wonders
for hardware and TV sets. But can it work for guitars, drums, and
rock 'n' roll?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is as bullish on the concept as Begelman.
</P>
<P>
   Most stores in which musicians buy their instruments are small
mom-and-pop operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mars store in Somerville will have its own concert
hall-size stage for live performances and clinics. Besides selling
instruments, Mars has employees known as Martians who will teach a
rookie how to play a brand-new guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever tried to sell musical instruments in a store so
large before, said Don Johnson, editor of the Musical Merchandise
Review, a trade monthly published in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, entrepreneurs began experimenting with
superstores in a number of retail categories. By buying in volume
and by operating large stores, these chains could offer lower
prices and more choices than mom-and-pop rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot proved that the formula could work for hardware.
Office Depot and Staples had success applying the formula to office
supplies and stationery.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, several entrepreneurs had concluded that the
estimated $6.5 billion music-instrument business might also be ripe
for superstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Florida-based Mars, there's a California-based chain
called Guitar Center that operates a store format that is much
smaller than the one used by Mars. There's another chain called Sam
Ash.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's hard to say what impact the superstore chains are
having on mom-and-pop rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The number of US stores selling musical instruments, about
8,400, has remained about the same, suggesting the superstores
haven't put many mom-and-pops out of business yet, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Guitar Center, the industry leader with $392 million
in 1998 sales, has experienced some recent difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The only publicly traded music superstore chain, Guitar Center
has seen the price of its stock tumble from about 30 a share in
January to about 8.
</P>
<P>
   But Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull analysts Richard H. Davis Jr. and
Mark K. Montagna wrote in a recent report that Guitar Center's
current problems are most likely temporary growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Begelman predicts Mars should turn a quarterly profit
by the end of the year. He pegs 1999 sales at about $200 million,
and he hopes to take the chain public some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a music store built and run by musicians,'' he said.
``It's a place where a rock star like Eddie Van Halen can be
comfortable, and where an amateur like my 15-year-old son can be
comfortable, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At Office Depot, Begelman once sold pencils and paper clips.
</P>
<P>
   At Mars, he said: ``We sell dreams.''

CALIFORNIA PENSION FUND EARNS 12.5 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Public Employees' Retirement
System earned a 12.5 percent return on its investments for the year
ended June 30, down from 19.5 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS said Monday that the return put the multibillion-dollar
retirement trust in the top 25 percent of public pension funds
tracked by the Trust Universe Comparison Service.
</P>
<P>
   While this was the fifth straight year of double-digit returns
for CalPERS, the performance compared with a growth of 16.5 percent
for the S&AMP;P 500 stock index for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``CalPERS earned double-digit returns because we achieved
superior investment results while carefully managing our risk,''
Charles P. Valdes, chairman of the CalPERS Investment Committee,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS, the nation's largest pension fund, valued its assets at
nearly $160 billion. About 65 percent of the fund's assets are
invested in publicly traded equities. Those equities returned 20.7
percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fund's other investments, CalPERS's private equity
investments posted a 14.3 percent return, while the system's U.S.
and international bonds earned returns of 1.6 percent and 2.6
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, according to CalPERS, the pension fund
held approximately $104 billion in U.S. and international stocks,
$43 billion in U.S. and international bonds, $7 billion in real
estate and $5 billion in private equity investments.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS manages pension and health benefits for more than 1.1
million California public employees, retirees and their families.

VENTURE PARTNERS LAUNCH TWO-TRACK INVESTING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Softbank Corp. chief Masayoshi Son became famous around the
world as the Internet's biggest and most daring investor by
purchasing stakes in more than 100 young Web companies.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Son and his Japanese company get their ideas for the
mostly American companies that would become spectacular Softbank
investments? More often than not, they came out of Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Son's lower-profile American venture capital partners, Ron
Fisher and Charles Lax, have scoured the Web since 1995 for
companies that would become investments in three Softbank
Technology Venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Lax, who work out of a converted church in Newton
Centre, were joined later by other West Coast principals. Over
time, they put nearly $550 million from Softbank and outside
investors to work.
</P>
<P>
   But Softbank made its real killing with big later-stage
investments in companies that were already part of the venture
portfolio, this time exclusively using its own money.
</P>
<P>
   A placement of $103 million in Yahoo, a later $50 million in
GeoCities, and another $400 million in E-Trade became huge
investment hits.
</P>
<P>
   The recent slump of the Internet stock market has certainly
trimmed returns among Softbank's blockbuster investments, which
were worth about 13 times their original cost on April 30, near the
peak.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is crying for Softbank. Its investment in E-Trade,
for example, has been hammered in the past few months but is still
worth about $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now Softbank has launched a two-track venture capital plan, with
one new $650 million fund continuing to back very young companies
and a separate, new $1.25 billion Softbank Capital Partners fund to
invest in more seasoned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Lax have joined Son as general partners of Softbank
Capital Partners, which includes $600 million from Softbank and
$650 million more from other investors. They have just lured
influential Internet stock analyst Bill Burnham away from Credit
Suisse First Boston to become their fourth general partner.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank executives ``have been using (the early stage) Softbank
Technology Ventures as the scout to find investments,'' said Lax.
``There was a lot of clamor from people who wanted to invest on a
later-stage basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Softbank Capital Partners fund, which closed five weeks
ago, has already been writing lots of checks with big numbers. It
sunk $125 million into on-line grocer Webvan Group Inc.; invested
$100 million in OptiMark Technologies Inc.; sunk $80 million into
Global Sports Inc.; put $40 million into 1-800-Flowers.com Inc.;
and invested $30 million in Webhire Inc. of Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that we'll effectively have about a third (of
the fund) committed by the end of the summer,'' said Lax. He
expects to be pitching a second new venture fund before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lax insists Softbank Capital Partners can acquire large stakes
in the Web's most promising companies because it offers more than
money, even though its willingness to invest huge sums is an
obvious draw.
</P>
<P>
   What's better than money? Cash plus the opportunity for
relationships with Softbank's other portfolio companies, most
importantly Yahoo. Just like CMGI Inc., the Andover-based Internet
investing company, it offers new ventures a better chance to strike
alliances with other important Web businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is going to do whatever it pleases,'' said Lax. ``We
have a voice at the board level, but we don't exert control-level
management. We put people together and hope they can work out the
best business deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Webhire, a public company that works the Internet for
corporate recruiters. Through a private stock placement and another
transaction, Softbank Capital Partners became a 40 percent
stockholder in a deal announced July 21. One week later, Yahoo said
it would invest money in the company and use Webhire's resume
service on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Lax and Webhire president Martin Fahey said talks about a
possible Yahoo alliance were already in the works, but both agree
the Softbank relationship helped move the deal forward.
</P>
<P>
   Another Softbank draw: the chance to move the same Internet
business into overseas markets with established partners.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank has already helped a series of American Web companies
launch new versions of their services in Asia, including Yahoo
Japan, GeoCities Japan, and E-Trade Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Softbank created two partnerships to help it do the
same thing in Europe for its investment-portfolio companies.
</P>
<P>
   It formed eVentures, a joint venture with a News Corp. unit, to
help portfolio companies crack markets in the United Kingdom and
elsewhere. It formed a second joint venture called AtViso with
Vivendi S.A. of Paris to help move the same companies into
continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people with a checkbook; money isn't the
problem,'' said Burnham. ``The hard part is adding value to the
money, to convince companies they're getting more than money.
That's why this is attractive to me.''

WAVE OF MERGERS MEANS FEWER JOBS IN BANKING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As banks and other financial companies continue
to merge, cut costs and adopt new technology, they also continue to
chop thousands of jobs through layoffs and attrition.
</P>
<P>
   As merger fever has swept the financial industry over the past
decade, the number of bank workers in California has fallen from
161,000 in 1992 to about 150,000 last year, according to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Recent mergers of California-based banks show the job-cutting
trend isn't slowing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Union Bank of California, owned by San Francisco-based
UnionBanCal Corp., said Monday it would cut 1,400 jobs over the
next 18 months. That is 15 percent of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. executives plan to cut 4,000 to 5,000 jobs,
or 5 percent of the 102,000 work force, as a result of the merger
last year with Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp. Wells Fargo already
had cut 12,000 jobs after its 1996 acquisition of First Interstate
Bancorp in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   _ BankAmerica Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., will slash 18,000 jobs,
or 10 percent of its work force, over the next four years.
BankAmerica and NationsBank Corp. merged last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the job cuts are needed to streamline
operations and boost financial performance. The cost-cutting
efforts can add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in stock
market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get cost savings from the staff reductions,'' said
Campbell Chaney, a bank industry analyst at Sutro &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco, ``but you also get enhancements to revenues by making
the people you keep more productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Bank, for instance, is one of the industry's most
inefficient companies, Chaney said. It costs Union Bank 63 cents to
generate one dollar in revenue, he said. By comparison, it costs
Wells Fargo and BankAmerica 54 to 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   A convergence of market forces is leading the banks and
financial companies to trim their costs and wipe out jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, a frenzy of mergers has swept the
financial services industry. Banks, brokerage houses, mutual fund
companies, insurance companies and mortgage lenders have been
buying each other at record prices, as the rising stock market
created billions of dollars in capital for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger boom, banks typically were bought at twice
their book value (their total assets minus all debts). Today, banks
are acquired for three to five times their book value, according to
Wall Street analysts.

<P>
   Industry competition and Internet technology also are prompting
the financial companies to trash old practices and plunge into the
future. Long criticized as dinosaurs, bankers and financial
executives are pleasing millions of consumers by rolling out
convenient new services, such as on-line banking products and
supermarket branches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wall Street investors are demanding higher
stock prices and investment returns on financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is forcing this to happen,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Falling legal barriers also have helped the merger crowd. In
recent years, strict federal laws have been loosened to allow banks
to do business across state lines and to seek higher revenue from
securities underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade comes to a close, financial mergers still are
steaming ahead. In the first six months of this year, acquisitions
totaled $888 billion, a drop-off from the record $936 billion in
the first half of 1998, according to Thomson Financial Securities
Data. About 20 percent of the merger deals this year have been in
banking and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial companies are riding the big wave of strong
mergers,'' said Jeff Tarbell, vice president of the San Francisco
office of Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an investment bank based
in Los Angeles. ``Last year was great, and this year may be even
better.''

</P>
<P>
   Industry specialists say the mergers are good for the financial
sector. There's too much fat in the U.S. banking system, and the
free market is getting rid of weaker players. In the long run,
shareholders, consumers and workers will benefit with sleek,
well-run companies and a more productive financial sector, these
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question there's overcapacity in the banking industry,''
said John Stafford, a spokesman for the California Bankers
Association in San Francisco. ``Ultimately, the consolidation is
good for the health of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, critics argue. Recent studies by academics and
consulting firms suggest that most mergers are financial failures
that stumble in the stock market and fall short of promised cost
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they say, talk to an unemployed worker with children to
feed about ``cost savings'' and ``inefficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a joint banking committee of House and Senate
members is hammering out a new financial modernization bill. If the
bill passes intact, it will loosen federal laws and allow banks and
brokerage houses to sell all kinds of financial products, from
insurance policies to stocks, bonds and mutual funds.

   MEXICO-BRACEROS _ IRAPUATO, Mexico _ Mexicans who worked in
American agriculture during World War II and for some time after
are demanding the Mexican government return an estimated $3 billion
in pension funds. The workers, known as the ``braceros,'' or
``pairs of arms,'' where recruited as legal substitute workers when
Americans went off to war. The bracero program lasted from 1942 to
1964. For at least the first eight years the workers saw 10 percent
of their wages deducted by the Mexican government for a pension
fund. Today, a union of

to it. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS and locator map

 UNDATED: peptides emselves.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If yellow jackets seem more frankly aggressive than bees or
hornets, more apt to assault the innocent, they have reason for
their paranoia. They are the only wasps in North America that
produce large quantities of brood, and so a yellow jacket nest
offers an extraordinary nutritional jackpot, as much as two pounds
of protein, to potential predators like raccoons, skunks and bears.
Thus, they sting at the slightest sign of danger, though their
efforts may be in vain. Bears have been seen to continue raiding
nests even as they were being repeatedly attacked, and one
scientist said he found hundreds of consumed yellow jackets in the
belly of a raccoon he had shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets also grow increasingly aggressive as summer turns
into fall, when they start running out of prey caterpillars or
maggots and must rely on scavenged goodies, which people amply if
unwillingly supply. Some yellow jacket species, particularly the
German yellow jacket, which was introduced onto this continent in
the 19th century and lately has spread throughout the country, are
pure scavengers to begin with, and so really like hanging around
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow jackets have a capacity to learn,'' Schmidt said.
``They learn not only where the places are that have good food,
like picnic tables, but they also learn what time the food will be
there. They won't be flying around the tables at 8 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick up on our timetables,'' he said, and so will emerge
at lunchtime and scout a favored picnic area even when it is empty.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jackets are hunting for two food sources: meat, to
feed the larvae back at the nest, and sweets, to give themselves
energy as they scavenge. The adults also get some sugar from their
young charges. Upon bringing back some masticated protein and
feeding these so-called meatballs to the larvae, the larvae
regurgitate sugar water that the adults then drink.
</P>
<P>
   The workers truly work themselves to death, with their tasks
changing as their lives progress, from safe to dangerous. Young
workers stay home tending the nest, feeding the larvae or building
new cells. Only as they approach the end of their 30-day life span
do workers assume treacherous foreign assignments like foraging.
Yellow jackets are also adept at switching roles when need be.
Workers operate by the clock: if somebody on the assembly line
fails to show up for duty, after a certain point the worker next in
line assumes her comrade is dead, and does the job herself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the queen is capable of getting down on her hands and knees
(and knees), and doing whatever needs doing. When a queen emerges
from hibernation in the spring, she must do everything herself:
find an abandoned rodent hole in which to start building a nest,
lay eggs and hunt for food to feed the first larvae. Only after she
has reared enough workers to take over the mundane housekeeping
chores does she retreat permanently into the nest and spend the
rest of the season laying eggs, as she alone is capable of doing.
By late summer or early fall, her colony may consist of several
thousand workers.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather cools, the queen starts generating eggs with a
new destiny before them: some will be born potential queens, and a
scattering of others will emerge as drones, males fit only to
inseminate those queens. The virgin queens and males fly up and
mate in an autumnal frenzy. Afterward, the males die, soon to be
followed by the queen mother and her workers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the newly fertilized queens seek shelter for the
cold weather to come, and they have a genius for persistence.
Studying how yellow jackets survive the harshness of an Alaskan
winter, Brian M. Barnes, a professor of zoophysiology with the
Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska in
Fairbanks, and his students tracked yellow jackets in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that a new queen will dig into leaf litter left
from the previous autumn. In that way, when the new leaves fall,
the queens are under a double layer of protection from cold and
moisture. As the snow falls, it covers the leaves, offering yet
another insulating blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the temperature within the leafy shelter, the
researchers found that it never fell below about 15 degrees
Fahrenheit, compared with an outside temperature of, say, 40 below.
They also learned that the queen was able to ``supercool'' herself,
her body tissues falling below freezing without forming deadly ice
crystals, partly the result of her being sheltered from any water
or ice particles that would set the crystallization process in
motion. She subsists in a state of cryogenic preservation, hanging
under the leaves, Barnes said, ``like a mummy.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not take much to arouse her, though. When the
researchers brought wintering queens into the lab and thawed them
out, the queens rapidly reanimated and, Barnes said, ``started
trying to sting us.''

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was

Marriage,'' by Christopher Anderson _ is available for oneshot
purchase from The New York Times Syndicate. For purchase
information, contact sales executive Debra Weydert by phone, (732)

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see
how a person could be `addicted' to sex. But then when I asked why
he felt compelled to have sex, if sometimes he wanted to get away
from his partner right after having sex, if his extramarital sex
was affecting his sex life with `The Warden,' if sex was in any way
jeopardizing his career _ then he understood.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it was that last question concerning the
impact on his career that Bill found most intriguing. When he told
Dolly that he was being pressured to run for president, she
cautioned him that a run against Republican Vice-President George
Bush could be ``suicide.'' She added, ``There's entirely too much
trash in your recent past.''
 &HT;    ``Like what?'' he answered without hesitating.
 &HT;    ``Bill, please,'' she said. ``Be serious. Look where you are
right now ... Get real.''
 &HT;    According to Dick Morris, the political demise of Gary Hart had
filled Bill with ``a tremendous terror.'' That spring and early
summer, Clinton contacted a number of friends and political
contacts throughout the country and casually brought up sex as a
campaign issue. What was the American public willing to tolerate?
Was adultery, if proven, an insurmountable obstacle to getting
elected?
 &HT;    At one point, he even grilled Arkansas Gazette editor John
Robert Starr _ the man who popularized the term ``Slick Willie'' _
on the ``Gary Hart Factor.''
 &HT;    ``Well, you haven't done anything like that, have you?'' Starr
asked Bill.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have.''
 &HT;    Starr was stunned. ``You mean,'' he said, ``since you've been
married to Hillary?''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Bill replied. ``Do you want to know about it?''
 &HT;    ``It,'' Starr thought. ``Do you want to know about it? And I,''
he recalled, ``to my eternal regret, said no.''
 &HT;    Betsey Wright wasn't hopeful about Bill's chances for surviving
a presidential run in 1988. She conducted an investigation of her
own, ferreting out the names of the women Bill was alleged to have
been involved with.
 &HT;    Once she had assembled a dossier on Bill's rumored affairs,
Wright sat him down in her living room. Before they went over each
name, she begged him to tell her the whole truth _ ``I've got to
know the truth, Bill'' _ about his relationship with each woman.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen women on the list, including
Gennifer Flowers, Dolly Kyle Browning, Juanita Broaddrick, Susan
McDougal, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Deborah Mathis and former
Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. He did not tell Wright about
the countless one-night stands or the hookers.
 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As she approached her 40th birthday, Hillary took stock of her
life with Bill.
 &HT;    ``She felt totally humiliated and betrayed,'' said a friend who
got to know the Clintons during Bill's first term as governor.
``... As far as I know, she really didn't discuss Bill's
girlfriends with anybody. But when they had to pull out of the race
in 1988, she was forced to face up to his womanizing for the first
time and it hurt her very deeply.''
 &HT;    Immediately following the surprise July 15, 1988, announcement,
when Bill declined to run for president, the fights between Bill
and Hillary escalated in number and intensity. For the first time,
Hillary was learning that her husband was sleeping not with just
one or two women but perhaps a dozen or more. And she, better than
anyone, knew of his steadfast refusal to wear a condom.
 &HT;    ``Well, of course,'' a lawyer friend said, ``she must have been
terrified at the prospect of contracting venereal disease, or AIDS.
That he would gamble with her health like that just added to the
overall sense of betrayal.''
 &HT;    At about that time, Hillary demanded that her husband be tested
for HIV. When the results of his test came back negative, Hillary
breathed a sigh of relief. So did Bill, whose dual addiction to
risk-taking and denial blinded him to the possibility that he could
become infected with the AIDS virus or another sexually transmitted
disease.
 &HT;    But Hillary would not easily forgive her husband. At one point
when two Clinton staff members were waiting in the living room of
the Governor's Mansion, the sounds of shouting and slamming doors
reverberated upstairs. Above the din, Hillary's voice could be
heard clearly: ``I am only staying, you bastard, FOR CHELSEA'S
SAKE!''
 &HT;    Hillary was fond of quoting John F. Kennedy's famous bit of
advice concerning the handling of one's enemies. ``Don't get mad,''
JFK said, ``get even.'' There were ways to accomplish this short of
divorce, and one was to have an affair of her own.
 &HT;    Ever since Hillary joined the Rose Law Firm back in 1977, she
and Vince Foster had behaved, said a secretary at the firm, ``like
two people in love.'' She would saunter over to his office every
afternoon to snack on the pistachio nuts he kept in his desk
drawer. ``She wanted him to keep them in his office,'' said their
fellow law partner Amy Stewart, ``so she wouldn't get fat.''
 &HT;    Over the years, friends, legal colleagues and assorted aides and
staffers would witness Vince and Hillary's unfolding affair.
 &HT;    L.D. Brown, Larry Patterson, and the other state troopers
assigned to guard the Clintons claimed that whenever Bill left the
mansion, Foster showed up ``like clockwork'' to comfort Hillary.
Often, he would not depart the mansion until the next morning.
 &HT;    ``Hillary and Vince were deeply in love,'' Brown said. ``I saw
them, locked in each other's arms, deep-kissing, nuzzling _ you
have it.''
 &HT;    Foster was often seen fondling Hillary in public _ even at her
own birthday party with Bill very much in attendance.
 &HT;    During the party, held at a Little Rock restaurant called
Alouette, Patterson was seated at the bar when Hillary and her Rose
Law Firm colleague Carolyn Huber meandered out to the bar to talk
in private.
 &HT;    On the way to the rest room, Foster ``came up behind Hillary and
squeezed her rear end with both his hands,'' Patterson said. ``Then
he winked and gave me the `OK' sign. On the way back, Huber was
turned away, and Vince put his hand over one of Hillary's breasts
and made the same `OK' sign to me.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, Vince,'' Hillary giggled. ``Oh, Vince ...''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ....
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hillary, Chelsea and the first lady's entourage had stopped off
in Little Rock to visit Hillary's widowed mother when the phone
rang at 9:25 p.m. on July 20, 1993.
 &HT;    On the other end was Mack McLarty, the president's first chief
of staff and his special envoy for the Americas. His voice was
cracking with emotion. ``Hillary, I have terrible news. Vince is
dead.''
 &HT;    ``What?''
 &HT;    ``Vince committed suicide. We just got the news. They found him
...''
 &HT;    Hillary, in the words of a staff member, ``Just lost it _
screaming, crying. She was clearly devastated by the news.''
 &HT;    Based on Hillary's reaction, her press secretary Lisa Caputo
immediately assumed that the president had been assassinated.
 &HT;    Once he had told Hillary what little he knew about Vince's
death, McLarty hung up the phone and walked across the hall to the
West Wing library where President Clinton was winding up a live
interview with CNN's Larry King.
 &HT;    At the commercial break, McLarty signaled Bill to say his
goodbyes to King and then, on the way to the elevator, told his
boss the terrible news. The president's chin dropped to his chest,
and for a brief moment it looked as if he might collapse.
 &HT;    Bill's first call was to Hillary. He had been well aware of the
rumors that had been circulating for years about his wife and her
law partner. But he had known Vince his entire life _ as small
children they had lived next door to each other in Hope _ and he
felt the loss almost as keenly.
 &HT;    Hillary was sobbing uncontrollably, blaming herself for Vince's
suicide. Bill, struggling to control his own emotions, told her it
was not anyone's fault. Immediately after hanging up, Bill left to
console Vince's wife, Lisa.
 &HT;    Conversely, the first lady did not call Vince's wife that night
to express her condolences as might have been expected. Nor did she
call Lisa Foster the next day. In fact, phone records indicate that
Hillary never phoned Vince Foster's widow following his death.
 &HT;    For all their shared sorrow, White House staffers moved quickly,
rifling through Foster's office in search of anything that might be
incriminating to the president or the first lady. Or both.
 &HT;    At 10:13, just 45 minutes after first hearing the news, Hillary
phoned her chief of staff Maggie Williams.
 &HT;    As soon as she hung up, Williams rushed to Vince's White House
office to look for a potentially embarrassing suicide note before
police arrived _ only to find another White House official, Patsy
Thomasson, there on the same sensitive mission.
 &HT;    With Hillary away, White House logs showed that Bill spent the
night of Vince's death in the family quarters with his
self-described ``old hippie girlfriend'' Marsha Scott. Her first
official act as $98,000-a-year director of correspondence at the
White House was to fire 20 longtime staffers and watch more than 1
million letters pile up in a matter of weeks.
 &HT;    The morning of Vince's funeral, Scott told her friend Ileene
Watkins that she had slept with the president the night before to
comfort him.
 &HT;    ``I spent the night with Bill in his bed,'' she blurted out to
Watkins. ``I had my head in his lap and we reminisced all night
long. I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday and I'm going to
have to wear them the whole day again.''
 &HT;    In June 1996, Scott would state in a sworn deposition to a House
committee that she remembered going to the White House those nights
but that the rest was ``a blur.''
 &HT;    At Vince's funeral, mourners took note of the curious way
Foster's family was treating the first couple. While Bill embraced
the widow and Vince's children, a heartbroken Hillary was kept at
arm's length, Watkins said, ``because the Foster family knew all
about Hillary's involvement with Vince.''

 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see
how a person could be `addicted' to sex. But then when I asked why
he felt compelled to have sex, if sometimes he wanted to get away
from his partner right after having sex, if his extramarital sex
was affecting his sex life with `The Warden,' if sex was in any way
jeopardizing his career _ then he understood.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it was that last question concerning the
impact on his career that Bill found most intriguing. When he told
Dolly that he was being pressured to run for president, she
cautioned him that a run against Republican Vice-President George
Bush could be ``suicide.'' She added, ``There's entirely too much
trash in your recent past.''
 &HT;    ``Like what?'' he answered without hesitating.
 &HT;    ``Bill, please,'' she said. ``Be serious. Look where you are
right now ... Get real.''
 &HT;    According to Dick Morris, the political demise of Gary Hart had
filled Bill with ``a tremendous terror.'' That spring and early
summer, Clinton contacted a number of friends and political
contacts throughout the country and casually brought up sex as a
campaign issue. What was the American public willing to tolerate?
Was adultery, if proven, an insurmountable obstacle to getting
elected?
 &HT;    At one point, he even grilled Arkansas Gazette editor John
Robert Starr _ the man who popularized the term ``Slick Willie'' _
on the ``Gary Hart Factor.''
 &HT;    ``Well, you haven't done anything like that, have you?'' Starr
asked Bill.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have.''
 &HT;    Starr was stunned. ``You mean,'' he said, ``since you've been
married to Hillary?''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Bill replied. ``Do you want to know about it?''
 &HT;    ``It,'' Starr thought. ``Do you want to know about it? And I,''
he recalled, ``to my eternal regret, said no.''
 &HT;    Betsey Wright wasn't hopeful about Bill's chances for surviving
a presidential run in 1988. She conducted an investigation of her
own, ferreting out the names of the women Bill was alleged to have
been involved with.
 &HT;    Once she had assembled a dossier on Bill's rumored affairs,
Wright sat him down in her living room. Before they went over each
name, she begged him to tell her the whole truth _ ``I've got to
know the truth, Bill'' _ about his relationship with each woman.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen women on the list, including
Gennifer Flowers, Dolly Kyle Browning, Juanita Broaddrick, Susan
McDougal, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Deborah Mathis and former
Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. He did not tell Wright about
the countless one-night stands or the hookers.
 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

Marriage,'' by Christopher Anderson _ is available for oneshot

information, contact sales executive Debra Weydert by phone, (732)

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As she approached her 40th birthday, Hillary took stock of her
life with Bill.
 &HT;    ``She felt totally humiliated and betrayed,'' said a friend who
got to know the Clintons during Bill's first term as governor.
``... As far as I know, she really didn't discuss Bill's
girlfriends with anybody. But when they had to pull out of the race
in 1988, she was forced to face up to his womanizing for the first
time and it hurt her very deeply.''
 &HT;    Immediately following the surprise July 15, 1988, announcement,
when Bill declined to run for president, the fights between Bill
and Hillary escalated in number and intensity. For the first time,
Hillary was learning that her husband was sleeping not with just
one or two women but perhaps a dozen or more. And she, better than
anyone, knew of his steadfast refusal to wear a condom.
 &HT;    ``Well, of course,'' a lawyer friend said, ``she must have been
terrified at the prospect of contracting venereal disease, or AIDS.
That he would gamble with her health like that just added to the
overall sense of betrayal.''
 &HT;    At about that time, Hillary demanded that her husband be tested
for HIV. When the results of his test came back negative, Hillary
breathed a sigh of relief. So did Bill, whose dual addiction to
risk-taking and denial blinded him to the possibility that he could
become infected with the AIDS virus or another sexually transmitted
disease.
 &HT;    But Hillary would not easily forgive her husband. At one point
when two Clinton staff members were waiting in the living room of
the Governor's Mansion, the sounds of shouting and slamming doors
reverberated upstairs. Above the din, Hillary's voice could be
heard clearly: ``I am only staying, you bastard, FOR CHELSEA'S
SAKE!''
 &HT;    Hillary was fond of quoting John F. Kennedy's famous bit of
advice concerning the handling of one's enemies. ``Don't get mad,''
JFK said, ``get even.'' There were ways to accomplish this short of
divorce, and one was to have an affair of her own.
 &HT;    Ever since Hillary joined the Rose Law Firm back in 1977, she
and Vince Foster had behaved, said a secretary at the firm, ``like
two people in love.'' She would saunter over to his office every
afternoon to snack on the pistachio nuts he kept in his desk
drawer. ``She wanted him to keep them in his office,'' said their
fellow law partner Amy Stewart, ``so she wouldn't get fat.''
 &HT;    Over the years, friends, legal colleagues and assorted aides and
staffers would witness Vince and Hillary's unfolding affair.
 &HT;    L.D. Brown, Larry Patterson, and the other state troopers
assigned to guard the Clintons claimed that whenever Bill left the
mansion, Foster showed up ``like clockwork'' to comfort Hillary.
Often, he would not depart the mansion until the next morning.
 &HT;    ``Hillary and Vince were deeply in love,'' Brown said. ``I saw
them, locked in each other's arms, deep-kissing, nuzzling _ you
have it.''
 &HT;    Foster was often seen fondling Hillary in public _ even at her
own birthday party with Bill very much in attendance.
 &HT;    During the party, held at a Little Rock restaurant called
Alouette, Patterson was seated at the bar when Hillary and her Rose
Law Firm colleague Carolyn Huber meandered out to the bar to talk
in private.
 &HT;    On the way to the rest room, Foster ``came up behind Hillary and
squeezed her rear end with both his hands,'' Patterson said. ``Then
he winked and gave me the `OK' sign. On the way back, Huber was
turned away, and Vince put his hand over one of Hillary's breasts
and made the same `OK' sign to me.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, Vince,'' Hillary giggled. ``Oh, Vince ...''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ....
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hillary, Chelsea and the first lady's entourage had stopped off
in Little Rock to visit Hillary's widowed mother when the phone
rang at 9:25 p.m. on July 20, 1993.
 &HT;    On the other end was Mack McLarty, the president's first chief
of staff and his special envoy for the Americas. His voice was
cracking with emotion. ``Hillary, I have terrible news. Vince is
dead.''
 &HT;    ``What?''
 &HT;    ``Vince committed suicide. We just got the news. They found him
...''
 &HT;    Hillary, in the words of a staff member, ``Just lost it _
screaming, crying. She was clearly devastated by the news.''
 &HT;    Based on Hillary's reaction, her press secretary Lisa Caputo
immediately assumed that the president had been assassinated.
 &HT;    Once he had told Hillary what little he knew about Vince's
death, McLarty hung up the phone and walked across the hall to the
West Wing library where President Clinton was winding up a live
interview with CNN's Larry King.
 &HT;    At the commercial break, McLarty signaled Bill to say his
goodbyes to King and then, on the way to the elevator, told his
boss the terrible news. The president's chin dropped to his chest,
and for a brief moment it looked as if he might collapse.
 &HT;    Bill's first call was to Hillary. He had been well aware of the
rumors that had been circulating for years about his wife and her
law partner. But he had known Vince his entire life _ as small
children they had lived next door to each other in Hope _ and he
felt the loss almost as keenly.
 &HT;    Hillary was sobbing uncontrollably, blaming herself for Vince's
suicide. Bill, struggling to control his own emotions, told her it
was not anyone's fault. Immediately after hanging up, Bill left to
console Vince's wife, Lisa.
 &HT;    Conversely, the first lady did not call Vince's wife that night
to express her condolences as might have been expected. Nor did she
call Lisa Foster the next day. In fact, phone records indicate that
Hillary never phoned Vince Foster's widow following his death.
 &HT;    For all their shared sorrow, White House staffers moved quickly,
rifling through Foster's office in search of anything that might be
incriminating to the president or the first lady. Or both.
 &HT;    At 10:13, just 45 minutes after first hearing the news, Hillary
phoned her chief of staff Maggie Williams.
 &HT;    As soon as she hung up, Williams rushed to Vince's White House
office to look for a potentially embarrassing suicide note before
police arrived _ only to find another White House official, Patsy
Thomasson, there on the same sensitive mission.
 &HT;    With Hillary away, White House logs showed that Bill spent the
night of Vince's death in the family quarters with his
self-described ``old hippie girlfriend'' Marsha Scott. Her first
official act as $98,000-a-year director of correspondence at the
White House was to fire 20 longtime staffers and watch more than 1
million letters pile up in a matter of weeks.
 &HT;    The morning of Vince's funeral, Scott told her friend Ileene
Watkins that she had slept with the president the night before to
comfort him.
 &HT;    ``I spent the night with Bill in his bed,'' she blurted out to
Watkins. ``I had my head in his lap and we reminisced all night
long. I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday and I'm going to
have to wear them the whole day again.''
 &HT;    In June 1996, Scott would state in a sworn deposition to a House
committee that she remembered going to the White House those nights
but that the rest was ``a blur.''
 &HT;    At Vince's funeral, mourners took note of the curious way
Foster's family was treating the first couple. While Bill embraced
the widow and Vince's children, a heartbroken Hillary was kept at
arm's length, Watkins said, ``because the Foster family knew all
about Hillary's involvement with Vince.''

 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As she approached her 40th birthday, Hillary took stock of her
life with Bill.
 &HT;    ``She felt totally humiliated and betrayed,'' said a friend who
got to know the Clintons during Bill's first term as governor.
``... As far as I know, she really didn't discuss Bill's
girlfriends with anybody. But when they had to pull out of the race
in 1988, she was forced to face up to his womanizing for the first
time and it hurt her very deeply.''
 &HT;    Immediately following the surprise July 15, 1988, announcement,
when Bill declined to run for president, the fights between Bill
and Hillary escalated in number and intensity. For the first time,
Hillary was learning that her husband was sleeping not with just
one or two women but perhaps a dozen or more. And she, better than
anyone, knew of his steadfast refusal to wear a condom.
 &HT;    ``Well, of course,'' a lawyer friend said, ``she must have been
terrified at the prospect of contracting venereal disease, or AIDS.
That he would gamble with her health like that just added to the
overall sense of betrayal.''
 &HT;    At about that time, Hillary demanded that her husband be tested
for HIV. When the results of his test came back negative, Hillary
breathed a sigh of relief. So did Bill, whose dual addiction to
risk-taking and denial blinded him to the possibility that he could
become infected with the AIDS virus or another sexually transmitted
disease.
 &HT;    But Hillary would not easily forgive her husband. At one point
when two Clinton staff members were waiting in the living room of
the Governor's Mansion, the sounds of shouting and slamming doors
reverberated upstairs. Above the din, Hillary's voice could be
heard clearly: ``I am only staying, you bastard, FOR CHELSEA'S

 &HT;    Hillary was fond of quoting John F. Kennedy's famous bit of

   WEST BARNSTABLE, Mass. _ From the high pulpit, the Rev. Reed
Baer gazes down upon a congregation with a lineage beginning before
the Pilgrims landed.
</P>
<P>
   From the hard wooden benches and ancient family pews known as
``sheep pens,'' the West Parish flock listens as the spiritual
shepherd challenges the faithful to ``live up to the vision of our
founders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a very personal feeling in this old church. The way
it's laid out. The sense that the congregation is a caring
community. The connection to history,'' observes Gary Morris, a
young businessman sitting near the back with his wife, Meg, and
their infant son, Ian. ``You can't help thinking back to a time
when church was a much bigger part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are Sundays in the oldest continuously operating
Congregational Church in America, where the Sabbath is heralded by
the pealing of a bell made by Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1717, worshippers have assembled in this steepled, wooden
meeting house on Cape Cod. The congregation traces its roots back a
century more, however, to a group of religious reformers led by
Henry Jacob. These so-called Separatists first met secretly outside
London in 1616, four years before the Pilgrims came to the New
World and settled in nearby Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jacob called his new church ``Congregational.'' While
Puritans wanted to reform or ``purify'' the Church of England,
Separatists wanted to break away completely. Believing that each
congregation could perform all church functions and choose its own
leaders, the Congregationalists were among the Separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Jacob died in 1624, about 30 of his followers
came to Massachusetts with their new pastor, the Rev. John Lothrop.
Lothrop led the Congregationalists to found Barnstable in 1639. The
settlement grew and divided into East and West Parishes as the
1700s began. The West Parish Meeting House opened its doors in
1717.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed over the centuries in this historic church. The
``tithingman'' no longer sits beneath the high pulpit wielding a
long pole with a feather on one end and an iron ball on the other.
If a man dozed off during the service, the tithingman would rap his
head with the ball. A sleepy woman would be tickled under the nose
with the feather.
</P>
<P>
   Sermons lasted two hours back then, pointed out Baer, compared
to about 15 minutes nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining West Parish, pioneer members had to credibly
testify to their redemption. Testimony of a conversion experience
is no longer required for admission. The ``sheep pens'' are no
longer deeded to prominent families; anyone can now sit in these
family pews. While early members sang psalms without musical
instrumentation, today's congregation is accompanied on hymns by a
pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   However, the church clings to a heritage of independence. West
Parish still has its own covenant, promising not only ``to walk
together in Christian love'' but also to ``forswear all pettiness,
gossip and slander,'' and members agree to abide by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are still elected. Before being hired about a
year ago, Rev. Baer was required to preach a trial sermon and then
leave the church while the congregation voted.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The parish has about 280 members, plus another 110 children who
aren't counted until their confirmation in about the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for many different reasons,'' said Baer. Some are
following a family tradition. Others are on a spiritual search.
Many come for their children, he said. They grew up in the church,
drifted away as young adults, then returned to give their offspring
the same religious grounding their parents gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precious few come for the preaching,'' said the minister
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps personifying how the Lord works in mysterious ways, the
reverend himself took a roundabout route to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering lawyer,'' he explained. ``This is my first
church.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing attorney for 12 years near Boston, Baer was a
deacon and Sunday school teacher in a Congregational church and the
father of two young children when his wife was diagnosed with
breast cancer. The crisis caused both to examine their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After considering teaching, ``I began to realize that I was
called to the ordained ministry,'' said Baer. ``I believe there is
more need in the world for my work in the church than there was for
my work as a lawyer. It seems there are plenty of lawyers to make
the world go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wife died, he graduated from theological school. He
has since remarried, and his second wife had a son several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a visitor, he reflected on history and religion
in this historic community he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Separatists and Puritans viewed themselves as living
in exile, as conducting an experiment in the wilderness _ which it
was, literally,'' he explained. ``Some would view the church today
as also in a time of exile. We are no longer in a churched society.
While as recently as the '50s, being a church member was part and
parcel of the American experience, today church is increasingly an
option that many in our society don't take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church no longer has the power and influence it once
wielded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   On page 365 of the Pilgrim Hymnal is the song ``Faith of Our
Fathers,'' with its stirring chorus, ``Faith of our fathers, Holy
Faith. We will be true to thee 'til death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the founding fathers of West Parish might be surprised at
the wide-ranging faith of their spiritual heirs on Meeting House
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worship doesn't have to be pious _ as long as you believe in
the basics,'' said Faith Chapman, who defined the basics as belief
in Jesus Christ as Savior. ``God is either male or female, if we
are created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Chapman and her husband, Sid, are a retired couple from
Connecticut and regular church-goers since their marriage in 1955.
They like the liberal leanings of Congregational theology.
</P>
<P>
   So does Meg Morris, who was raised a Catholic but grew to
dislike the religion's formality and structure and rules regarding
women. During their courtship, she and Gary often rode a tandem
bicycle past the historic church while training for a race. They
decided to get married there and continued to come to services
after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I look forward to Sundays,'' said Meg. ``And for our son,
I think it's important that he grow up with that connection with
church and God and for him to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Diamond grew up Jewish, and says he still ``doesn't
believe in Jesus the way others in the congregation do.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing himself as ``not the most religious person in
the world,'' the young dentist said he believes it's important that
his children grow up with values and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to church for the family time together,'' he said. ``And
I enjoy the sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Trisha, was raised as a Lutheran. She said she came to
West Parish after seeing other Cape Cod churches spurn a young
woman who was eight months pregnant with twins and wanted to stand
before an altar to marry the father. West Parish did not spurn
them, and the couple were wed in the historic Congregational
meeting house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn sinners away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a caring church _ a friendly church _

a member for 21 years.

   ``Each minister comes in and cooperates with the congregation,

joined West Parish in 1957. ``Each leaves his own mark, and with
each we've learned and grown.''

</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cross, a gilded rooster on a weather vane sits atop
the steeple of the West Parish Meeting House. Brought over from
England in 1723, the rooster is a symbol dating back to the Last
Supper, according to parish historian Bob Russell.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus told his disciples that they would soon desert him,
Peter protested. Jesus said, ``Truly I tell you, this very night
before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.'' When
the prediction came to pass, Peter heard a cock crow and broke down
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Russell explained, the crowing rooster has been a
reminder for Christians to stand up for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crowing rooster, the covenant has been part of West
Parish longer than any current member can recall. Although
associated with the United Church of Christ, each Congregational
parish has its own such set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   The covenant provides clues to what the congregation was
concerned about at the time of adoption, said Baer. Thus West
Parish decided ``pettiness, gossip and slander'' were of such
magnitude that the covenant should require members to agree to give
up such actions ``in our dealings with one another and with all
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly when this covenant was adopted, said Baer,
and time may be nearing for the congregation to consider revisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process even older than this historic meeting house,
dating back to Henry Jacob, who decreed Congregational churches are
constituted ``by a free mutual consent of believers joining and
covenanting to live as members of a holy society together in all
religious and virtuous duties as Christ and his Apostles did
institute and practice in the Gospel.''

   WEST BARNSTABLE, Mass. _ From the high pulpit, the Rev. Reed
Baer gazes down upon a congregation with a lineage beginning before
the Pilgrims landed.
</P>
<P>
   From the hard wooden benches and ancient family pews known as
``sheep pens,'' the West Parish flock listens as the spiritual
shepherd challenges the faithful to ``live up to the vision of our
founders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a very personal feeling in this old church. The way
it's laid out. The sense that the congregation is a caring
community. The connection to history,'' observes Gary Morris, a
young businessman sitting near the back with his wife, Meg, and
their infant son, Ian. ``You can't help thinking back to a time
when church was a much bigger part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are Sundays in the oldest continuously operating
Congregational Church in America, where the Sabbath is heralded by
the pealing of a bell made by Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1717, worshippers have assembled in this steepled, wooden
meeting house on Cape Cod. The congregation traces its roots back a
century more, however, to a group of religious reformers led by
Henry Jacob. These so-called Separatists first met secretly outside
London in 1616, four years before the Pilgrims came to the New
World and settled in nearby Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jacob called his new church ``Congregational.'' While
Puritans wanted to reform or ``purify'' the Church of England,
Separatists wanted to break away completely. Believing that each
congregation could perform all church functions and choose its own
leaders, the Congregationalists were among the Separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Jacob died in 1624, about 30 of his followers
came to Massachusetts with their new pastor, the Rev. John Lothrop.
Lothrop led the Congregationalists to found Barnstable in 1639. The
settlement grew and divided into East and West Parishes as the
1700s began. The West Parish Meeting House opened its doors in
1717.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed over the centuries in this historic church. The
``tithingman'' no longer sits beneath the high pulpit wielding a
long pole with a feather on one end and an iron ball on the other.
If a man dozed off during the service, the tithingman would rap his
head with the ball. A sleepy woman would be tickled under the nose
with the feather.
</P>
<P>
   Sermons lasted two hours back then, pointed out Baer, compared
to about 15 minutes nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining West Parish, pioneer members had to credibly
testify to their redemption. Testimony of a conversion experience
is no longer required for admission. The ``sheep pens'' are no
longer deeded to prominent families; anyone can now sit in these
family pews. While early members sang psalms without musical
instrumentation, today's congregation is accompanied on hymns by a
pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   However, the church clings to a heritage of independence. West
Parish still has its own covenant, promising not only ``to walk
together in Christian love'' but also to ``forswear all pettiness,
gossip and slander,'' and members agree to abide by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are still elected. Before being hired about a
year ago, Rev. Baer was required to preach a trial sermon and then
leave the church while the congregation voted.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The parish has about 280 members, plus another 110 children who
aren't counted until their confirmation in about the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for many different reasons,'' said Baer. Some are
following a family tradition. Others are on a spiritual search.
Many come for their children, he said. They grew up in the church,
drifted away as young adults, then returned to give their offspring
the same religious grounding their parents gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precious few come for the preaching,'' said the minister
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps personifying how the Lord works in mysterious ways, the
reverend himself took a roundabout route to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering lawyer,'' he explained. ``This is my first
church.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing attorney for 12 years near Boston, Baer was a
deacon and Sunday school teacher in a Congregational church and the
father of two young children when his wife was diagnosed with
breast cancer. The crisis caused both to examine their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After considering teaching, ``I began to realize that I was
called to the ordained ministry,'' said Baer. ``I believe there is
more need in the world for my work in the church than there was for
my work as a lawyer. It seems there are plenty of lawyers to make
the world go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wife died, he graduated from theological school. He
has since remarried, and his second wife had a son several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a visitor, he reflected on history and religion
in this historic community he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Separatists and Puritans viewed themselves as living
in exile, as conducting an experiment in the wilderness _ which it
was, literally,'' he explained. ``Some would view the church today
as also in a time of exile. We are no longer in a churched society.
While as recently as the '50s, being a church member was part and
parcel of the American experience, today church is increasingly an
option that many in our society don't take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church no longer has the power and influence it once
wielded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   On page 365 of the Pilgrim Hymnal is the song ``Faith of Our
Fathers,'' with its stirring chorus, ``Faith of our fathers, Holy
Faith. We will be true to thee 'til death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the founding fathers of West Parish might be surprised at
the wide-ranging faith of their spiritual heirs on Meeting House
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worship doesn't have to be pious _ as long as you believe in
the basics,'' said Faith Chapman, who defined the basics as belief
in Jesus Christ as Savior. ``God is either male or female, if we
are created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Chapman and her husband, Sid, are a retired couple from
Connecticut and regular church-goers since their marriage in 1955.
They like the liberal leanings of Congregational theology.
</P>
<P>
   So does Meg Morris, who was raised a Catholic but grew to
dislike the religion's formality and structure and rules regarding
women. During their courtship, she and Gary often rode a tandem
bicycle past the historic church while training for a race. They
decided to get married there and continued to come to services
after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I look forward to Sundays,'' said Meg. ``And for our son,
I think it's important that he grow up with that connection with
church and God and for him to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Diamond grew up Jewish, and says he still ``doesn't
believe in Jesus the way others in the congregation do.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing himself as ``not the most religious person in
the world,'' the young dentist said he believes it's important that
his children grow up with values and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to church for the family time together,'' he said. ``And
I enjoy the sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Trisha, was raised as a Lutheran. She said she came to
West Parish after seeing other Cape Cod churches spurn a young
woman who was eight months pregnant with twins and wanted to stand
before an altar to marry the father. West Parish did not spurn
them, and the couple were wed in the historic Congregational
meeting house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn sinners away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a caring church _ a friendly church _
regardless of who ministers it,'' said Jane Clingham, who has been
a member for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister comes in and cooperates with the congregation,
but each has his own ideas and goals, too,'' said Silja Emrich, who
joined West Parish in 1957. ``Each leaves his own mark, and with
each we've learned and grown.''

   NY-PICNIC (New York) _ For me, picnics involve packing up a
meal, hiking a trail of sidewalks to Central Park and hunkering
down to a meal on grass, nestled among ranges of buildings in one
of America's most densely populated restaurant cities. But they are
a form of escape _ from reservations, from a cramped city kitchen,
from the madness of supermarkets. With all this in mind, I recently
set out to plan a picnic in the park. Not just any picnic. But a
meal that brought together all that I like about a picnic and all
that I like about eating in New York. By Amanda Hesser.

   TADICH-ANNIVERSARY (San Francisco) _ For those among the
fortune-seeking forty-niners who survived scurvy and shipwreck on
the voyage around Cape Horn, and for those who survived snow and
starvation traveling overland, San Francisco presented a gaudy
spectacle of freedom, where the restraints of the East fell away.
You could grab a cup of coffee at a little tent on Long Wharf,
where three Croatian immigrants set up shop in the very first year
of the gold rush, 1849, the year before California joined the
union. Landfill projects, earthquakes and commercial exigency have
forced repeated moves since, but the business has prospered under a
succession of Croatian-American owners. It still does. It is now
called the Tadich Grill, after a former proprietor who went to work
there in 1876. It is one of the state's oldest businesses, still a
favorite of visitors and locals. By R.W. Apple Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to devalued Asian currencies, we've been getting TVs,
microwave ovens, and computer chips at bargain prices, so our
consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

<P>
   Between Jan. 15 and April 15, Mexico's IPC index, or Bolsa,
jumped about 65 percent, the best performance by a major stock
index this year.
</P>
<P>
   Had you been brave enough to buy Mexican stocks in mid-September
last year, while Brazil, Russia, and Long-Term Capital Management
were turning wealth into waste, you would have nearly doubled your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us were so brave, however: The pundits were warning us
that Brazil _ as the next domino after Thailand, Malaysia, and
Indonesia _ would soon topple the rest of Latin America, including
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But economists underestimated the confidence and resilience of
U.S. consumers, who bought more than 85 percent of Mexico's
exports. As long as American families kept shopping, Mexican
factories ought to keep humming to meet our demand for cars,
clothes, and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mexico exports hardly anything to Brazil, a
key point overlooked during the frenzied sell-off last year in
Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Mexicans speak Spanish does not mean their economy
is linked more closely to Latin America than to North America.
Indeed, our 6 percent gain in gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter of 1998, despite tumbles in the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq, was an excellent signal that Mexico would not collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As American consumers swiped their credit cards, Mexican
businessmen wiped their brows with relief. The several thousand
factories just south of the U.S. border _ in an area known as
Maquiladora _ have continued to thrive in 1999, with overall
exports increasing at a 7.7 percent pace in February.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of watching their economy shrink in 1999, as
Brazilians, Argentines, and Venezuelans will, Mexicans will see
their GDP rise by 2 to 3 percent. (In further tribute to the
country's resilience, the jobless rate fell to just 2.7 percent in
March.)
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind the Bolsa's bounce is the rise in the
price of oil. Crude jumped from about $11 per barrel in December to
$18 by mid-April, thanks to an OPEC deal to cut production,
stronger economic prospects in Asia, and the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico exports oil, higher prices improve Mexico's
expected trade balance and its budget revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the Bolsa hitting 5430 in the second half of April,
investors in Mexico might want to book some profits now, because
there are a couple of dangers looming.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mexicans will head to the voting booths to elect a new
president in July 2000. Months before the 1994 election, wealthy
Mexicans began sneaking their funds out of the country to the
safety of U.S. banks in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They may get antsy again, recalling that the last presidential
election was marred by the assassination of the leading candidate,
rising inflation, and ultimately a collapse of the peso, which
triggered a deep recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the reigning PRI party, which has dominated Mexican
politics for 70 years, has been bloodied in recent years and even
been forced to share power with its rivals on the right (PAN) and
the left (PRD).
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo's interior minister, Francisco Labastida, is a
candidate, but other cabinet ministers may challenge him for the
PRI's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A second possible trouble spot is the peso. It looked awfully
strong earlier this year, actually rising by more than 5 percent
against the U.S. dollar through mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexican exporters start bellyaching about how a stronger peso
hurts their ability to compete with other countries, investors
should head for the exits with their profits in tow. &QL;

HBO FILM PAYS OVERLOOKED BLACK ACTRESS HER DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dorothy Dandridge was the first African-American
to receive a best actress Oscar nomination, for 1954's ``Carmen
Jones,'' as well as the first to present an award at the ceremony.
These achievements have been both officially and unofficially
shrugged off by historians _ they go unmentioned in ``70 Years of
Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards'' and ``Inside
Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards,'' both
considered definitive books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,'' executive-produced by and
starring Halle Berry, seeks, somewhat belatedly, to give the woman
her due. The HBO biopic, premiering Saturday, charts her rise from
nightclub singer to sultry sex symbol, until she hit a glass
ceiling doubly reinforced by racism and sexism. Even after her
Oscar nomination for her torrid performance in ``Carmen Jones,''
Hollywood was reluctant to create compelling or romantic roles for
the actress.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the injustices her industry forced upon her, not to
mention the bad decisions and worse luck that defined her personal
life, Dandridge spiraled into a despair that eventually claimed her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What initially inspired me was the fact that Dorothy had been
so forgotten, and that her contribution was so great and so
meaningful, not only to me but also to an entire community of
people,'' Berry says. ``And her peers have become larger in their
death than even in their lives, and people still don't remember who
Dorothy Dandridge was. That was just sort of my social awareness
that made me feel a responsibility to bring her legacy to the
screen and let it live in a way in which, I believe, she deserves
to have it live.
</P>
<P>
   ``My struggle has been very much hers, trying to carve a niche
for myself as a leading lady,'' opines Berry, who has given gritty
performances in films like ``Losing Isaiah'' and ``Bulworth'' but
whose most-seen performance has been as a cartoonish femme fatale
in ``The Flintstones'' (she returns to the comic-book motif in her
next film, ``The X-Men''). After 10 years of struggling in this
industry, Berry says playing Dandridge gave her her opportunity to
be a leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself, why isn't Dorothy Dandridge the
household word that Marilyn Monroe is?'' says Martha Coolidge, who
directed ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.'' ``I'm not saying
they're the same. I think Dorothy Dandridge has, in so many ways,
more social significance though she may not be as known culturally.
There's a simple reason: Because she was black and because her
roles were limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Geri Branton, one of Dandridge's close friends, says the actress
could never accept racism. For a while, Branton and Dandridge were
sisters-in-law: Geri was married to hoofer Fayard Nicholas, while
Dandrige married his brother and collaborator, Harold. ``That was
one of her tragedies _ she couldn't come to grips with that. And
when exceptions were made with her _ she couldn't accept that,
either. She was allowed to go through the casino (in Las Vegas);
others couldn't. That really embarrassed her and caused her great
guilt _ she really tortured herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became a masochist; she couldn't do anything,'' Branton
continued. ``She resented the fact that she was an object of white
man's lust and recognized that (any relationship) would end with a
bed or whatever they wanted to achieve, but she wouldn't get proper
respect as a woman. (And because she was a light-skinned black),
she was not as desirable to black men as to white men.''
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge's penchant for self-flagellation was manifest in her
brief, contentious relationship with Jack Dennison, a white
nightclub impresario and all-around thug. (Dandridge also had a
five-year relationship with Otto Preminger, the man who directed
her in ``Carmen Jones,'' and was said to have had a fling with
Peter Lawford.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She would spend hours telling me all the reasons she shouldn't
be involved with Jack _ he was wrong for her, he was a bad man in
society, and so on, and then the next day she'd say she was going
to marry him,'' Branton recalls. ``She was so self-punishing. She
couldn't face reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Branton declares herself satisfied with HBO's take on her late
friend, but points out a couple of significant, albeit less
glamorous, contributions on Dandridge's behalf that she wishes the
film could've hit upon. Dandridge helped put Confidential, a
tabloid-style celebrity gossip magazine of the '50s, out of
business with a lawsuit after the magazine reported she had had sex
on the front lawn of a posh hotel. The argument was shockingly
simple _ if she had to enter through the back doors of the hotel,
what was she doing out front?
</P>
<P>
   ``That court scene would have been fabulous,'' Branton says,
adding that until Dandridge's success opened the floodgates for
more lawsuits against the magazine, ``there were so many important
stars who had been turned down in court.'' Dandridge's efforts also
helped result in a court ruling that minorities be granted easy
access to property insurance _ the inability to secure insurance
was used as an excuse to keep blacks out of certain neighborhoods _
though she lost money in a land deal before the law was handed
down.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dandridge's life was filled with hardships, Branton says
that her friend was ``happiest when building (her career) and
clawing and scratching to become Carmen.'' Dandridge never expected
to win the Oscar for her performance, but she had hoped that Judy
Garland, who was the odds-on favorite, would win that year, for ``A
Star Is Born.'' In fact, Grace Kelly won, controversially, for
``The Country Girl.'' ``It was ludicrous,'' hisses Branton,
incredulous still today.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge died in 1965 at age 42 of an overdose of prescription
medication _ whether it was an accident or intentional remains
unresolved. But Berry notes, ``Anytime somebody's life ends by
their own hand, I don't think that's accidental. It was such a
mystery, her death. I believe she killed herself. I'm not saying
that on the night she died, she took pills and said, `OK, I'm going
to lie down and die right now.' It was a slow process.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Coolidge observes, ``It's important to understand that
she wasn't in the place that Marilyn Monroe was at or Judy Garland
was at, and that her life has a different meaning, and there were
different causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think she was slowly killing herself over a long period.
Not just because she was a black woman, but because she was a woman
and some women's response to having a lot of limits imposed upon
them is frequently masochistic _ another very important issue in
this particular story.''
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge had tried suicide before, Branton reveals. ``She was
taking anti-depressants and drinking champagne _ you can't do that,
she knew full well. Four days before she died, she told me, `Geri,
you'll understand more than anyone. I'm just tired, I can't fight
anymore.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she sang a song to me _ I'm sorry now that I didn't tape
it _ `People (Who Need People).' She had been disappointed in

MAVERICK ART REARS ITS TUSKS IN OLD TUSCAN TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CASCIANO DEI BAGNI, Italy _ It isn't often that a
68-year-old retired produce vendor beats out world-class artists to
win first prize in an international art competition. It also isn't
often that world-class artists find themselves vying for prizes in
a small Tuscan town better known for thermal baths than for
contemporary art. But then it isn't often that medieval towns
become maverick centers of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what has happened to San Casciano dei Bagni, a
town of 650 south of Siena, since an independent curator, Cornelia
Lauf, opened Camera Oscura, an avant-garde micro-gallery, three
years ago. Since then, such widely respected Conceptual and
installation artists as Haim Steinbach, Ken Lum and Peter Nagy, and
the Italian abstract painter Carla Accardi have shown at the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, however, the Old World won out when Sergio
Paggetti, owner of a local fruit and vegetable shop, won the first
Wild Boar in Its Habitat competition, sponsored by Camera Oscura
and the local administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called out my name, I felt my heart start
pounding,'' Paggetti said soon after he was proclaimed the winner.
``I put my hands over my head, and I began clapping madly. This is
the most satisfaction I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Paggetti's daughter, Laura, had entered her father's painting,
which depicts a group of local hunters chasing and being chased by
a wild boar, without his knowledge. ``I am not a professional,''
Paggetti continued, his eyes brightening, ``I'm not even an
amateur. This is just a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Paggetti, who has been drawing since he was a child, suspects
that his painting won first prize because it depicts a locally
infamous event that took place 20 years ago when he went boar
hunting in the woods with a group of friends. ``The entire town
knows who the people in the painting are,'' he said. ``The guy
running from the boar was so afraid of being gored that he got a
fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting beat out works by professional artists, including a
small drawing on canvas by Steinbach, because the judges thought it
best captured the spirit of the competition. Formally, it was
deemed the most thought out. It was also the most expressive and
the most ironic, because the theme lent itself to irony, said Lia
Rumma, a judge and the owner of galleries in Naples and Milan.
First prize was a million lire, roughly $540, and a stuffed gray
boar.
</P>
<P>
   The wild boar competition is emblematic of just what Camera
Oscura is about, merging new art, local traditions and the
environment to end up with nontraditional results, at least for
this part of the world, steeped as it is in its Renaissance past.
Joseph Kosuth, a Conceptual artist who is married to Ms. Lauf and
who served on the competition jury, explained that the wild boar
theme had been chosen for its links to the Tuscan countryside,
noting that there is a mythic, epic aspect to the wild boar that
fascinates people here.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the small Tuscan wild boar is at risk because it is
threatened by the larger northern European boars that have been
imported into the region for the sport of hunters. (Not
accidentally, Italian environmental officials were part of the
jury.)
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the walls of Camera Oscura, a ground-floor room
nestled inside the city ramparts, have been decorated with
everything from coat hangers to 19th-century lace to hot water
bottles. At different times, the gallery has transformed itself
into a greenhouse filled with wild grasses, a stage set for film
costumes and even a sort of chapel for a rediscovered 15th-century
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   When it first opened, not everyone liked the art. People were
not quite sure what to do with Camera Oscura and what was being
shown, said Nazzareno Macchiesi, the town's retired stationmaster,
who helps curate exhibits. But slowly people began to appreciate
it. Ms. Lauf recalls a couple of occasions when the local
population was so baffled by the most obscure works of
post-Conceptual art that someone actually scribbled on them. But
that does not happen very often. One local resident was so taken
with a sculpture of a sheep by the Italian sculptor Marco Papa that
he traded a live sheep for it, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery was born in response to an appeal from Fabiola
Ambrogi, the Mayor of San Casciano dei Bagni, who was concerned
that the town was slowly dying as young people left to seek jobs in
bigger cities, leaving an older, mostly retired populace behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything began when we realized that if we didn't get help
from the citizens, the town risked not surviving,'' Ms. Ambrogi
explained. ``We tried to involve as many people as possible, asking
everyone to do something to bring people to San Casciano and to
enrich the local population.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauf, who owns a vacation farmhouse a few miles from town,
came up with the idea for Camera Oscura. The principle resource of
San Casciano is the bagni, or baths, which give the town its name
and which have been popular since Roman times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the baths were partly privatized and completely
restored, reopening two years ago. So far this year, 10,000 people
have dipped in the springs, which promise to cure everything from
skin diseases to arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   While the upgraded baths have been a small boon, they are not
enough to sustain the local economy, said Ms. Ambrogi, which is why
Camera Oscura is so important and why she hopes that financing its
shows will not become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   For the wild boar competition, the jury had to chose among 90
entries. The preferred medium was painting, and the pieces were
divided into various categories, all showing wild boars _ single
portraits, group portraits, the boar in the woods, abstract works _
but there was also a sizable representation of sculptures,
ready-mades and even conceptual portraits of boars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the participants were local artists, both professional
and amateur, but entries came from as far away as Malta and New
York. Second prize went to a ready-made piece, a battered tricycle
tilted to suggest a boar, by Rike Bartels, a German goldsmith.
Third prize was won by Zlatan Vrkljan, an artist representing his
native Croatia at this year's Venice Biennale who entered a
handmade book about the wild boar and its habitat, including
recipes for boar stew.

OUTFIT SELLING HEART OF TEXAS A BIT AT A TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas is for sale one square inch at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of it, just a plot between Brownwood and Brady. The land
is adjacent to a roadside park, and developers consider that one of
its biggest values. The Heart of Texas roadside park, pretty much
in the middle of nowhere on U.S. 377, has a marker claiming the
location as the official geographic center of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It also says the real center is about five miles away on private
land and inaccessible to the public. The roadside park is as close
as you can get to a sure-enough, semiofficial, center-of-the-state
site.
</P>
<P>
   The park isn't for sale, but Chuck Dodds, an independent
insurance adjuster from Brownwood, has purchased an acre and a half
next to the park and is offering it one square inch at a time on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been told all my life that about 99 percent of our
greatest ideas are hidden away in cemeteries, because people
generally don't follow up on their dreams,'' Dodds said. ``There
have been numerous times in the past whereby someone has taken a
small parcel of land, broke it up in small pieces and sold it as a
novelty. This particular piece of land does not fall into the
novelty category. This tract is one of our dearest treasures, the
very `Heart of Texas.'''
</P>
<P>
   So that's the deal. Buyers pay $69.95, plus the customary
shipping and handling, and they get ownership of a square inch of
Texas and a ``full color, special warranty deed,'' recorded in
McCulloch County.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds and his co-developers believe that there is a universal
thirst for Texas property. They believe that with the worldwide
reach of the Internet, thousands of people will want to own a piece
of the state's very core.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds and his investors are so sure that they've acquired an
additional 200 acres next to the original acre and a half.
</P>
<P>
   This thing is so big, they believe, there might even be a gift
shop built on the property. There could be an RV park, an art
gallery, a golf course, and, if things go really well, a barbecue
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to erect an enormously large Texas flag in the
park area,'' Dodds said. ``The group plans on reinvesting in the
immediate area, to create a place that everyone can enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   But like with every real estate transaction, there is fine
print. Quite a bit of it.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, you don't get the mineral rights to your square
inch. If someone were to sink a quarter-inch well and hit a squirt
of oil, you don't get the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you are forbidden _ by contract _ to ``construct a road,
structure, building of any kind.'' You can't store your boat or
camp trailer on your square inch. There is no camping, hunting or
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   You can think of your square inch as your own Texas ranch, but
the fine print says ``grazing, feeding or pasturage of animals,
fowl, reptiles, fish or other creatures whatsoever,'' is
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   And in what seems to be a rather un-Texan prohibition, you
aren't allowed to stand right in the middle of your square inch in
the ``Heart of Texas'' and discharge a weapon.
</P>

LOVE OF RECEIVING E-MAIL DAMPENED BY SATURATED INBOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's only 8 a.m., and I am already tired. I have been working
hard for the past hour doing something that I used to enjoy but now
almost dread.
</P>
<P>
   I have struggled with this decision for months. I have tried to
think of a delicate, diplomatic, kind way to say this, but there
isn't one. So here it is: Dear friends, relatives and freaky people
I don't even know, please stop sending me all this e-mail!
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the jokes are funny and the cartoons make me smile. Truly,
I have received some wonderful prayers and profound messages.
However, I am overwhelmed with the sheer volume of e-mail that I
get each day. I have considered changing my e-mail address to an
unlisted number, but it is so difficult to come up with a cute new
screen name that isn't already in use. I like my screen name,
although goodness knows I'm not about to reveal it here, as much as
I love each and every one of you.
</P>
<P>
   See, it's like learning to drive. Remember when you first got
your license to drive alone and your parents started sending you on
errands? Run to the store and pick up some bread and milk. Drop
your brother off at band practice. Take a cake over to Mrs.
Shepherd's house because her cat died. It was fun, wasn't it? It
was a marvelous opportunity to log some miles while driving up and
down every neighborhood street hoping your friends might be outside
to witness the event.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was when I first got e-mail many years ago. I was
one of Prodigy's first customers. It took so long to log on and get
mail that I could leave home and go buy groceries while I waited,
but the anticipation gave me a certain euphoria. Even more
recently, the first time I heard, ``You've got mail,'' it sent
chills up my spine.
</P>
<P>
   But then the thrill wore off. Around the 100th time Mom sent me
for a loaf of bread, I suggested that we have crackers with our
pork chops. I even suggested that my sister could ride her bike to
the store, even though she was only 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do need e-mail. I need e-mail from my friends far and
near that tells me about their joys and sorrows. I need e-mail
about events that I might actually want to attend, unlike the one
on hiking in the Sahara that I got today. I even like to get a few
jokes now and then. I just don't want 20 e-mail messages from the
same person every day. I can't even read that fast. If I skip a day
or two, I end up with almost 50 e-mail messages. I don't have time
to read and savor 50 e-mail messages. In fact, I just read a line
or two of those chain e-mail messages, and if I'm not engrossed by
then, I delete it. I'm not proud of that, but it's true.
</P>
<P>
   If the e-mail doesn't make you shed two tears or if it doesn't
make you laugh out loud in a big guffaw, not just a smile or a
tee-hee, please don't forward it to me. All original e-mail
composed expressly for me, or e-mail that meets the above criteria,
are welcome. Otherwise, for the sake of my waning sanity and others
like me, can we skip the icing and just have the cake?

 &HT;    ELDERLY MIGRANT WORKERS CLAIM MEXICAN GOVERNMENT OWES THEM $3
BILLION
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRAPUATO, Mexico _ They gathered by the hundreds here for a
protest, some hobbling on canes, others peering through thick
glasses, all with faces scored by wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``braceros,'' just a handful of the 4.5 million
Mexican guest workers who were recruited to work on American farms
for 22 years, beginning during World War II. Decades later, they
have formed a movement and are claiming the Mexican government owes
them as much as $3 billion, money that was deducted from their
paychecks and deposited into Mexican bank accounts that have
mysteriously disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because my husband can't walk anymore,'' said
Irene Sanchez Lopez, 74, the stooped, shawl-draped wife of
Margarito(CQ) Romero Troncos, 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went up there five years. I was left at home with two
little ones, suffering and wondering if he'd ever come back. We're
still poor now,'' said Sanchez Lopez, who attended a rally for the
former guest workers and their families Monday in this city in
Guanajuato, a state with a long history of migrant labor.
</P>
<P>
   The lost savings accounts, which the Mexican government admits
existed, date back to 1942, when men in the United States went off
to battle and Mexico agreed to send contract workers north to
Texas, California, Arizona, Arkansas and other states to pick
seasonal crops.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were known as ``braceros,'' literally, a pair of
arms, and American farmers became so hooked on their cheap labor
that they pushed Congress to extend the U.S. Labor
Department-supervised program until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   For some if not all of that time, the Mexican government
deducted 10 percent of the men's wages as part of the Farm Worker
Savings Fund, a program designed to ensure that the men would not
return empty-handed from their work abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that no more than 1 percent of our affiliates ever
received their money back,'' said Ventura Mendez Gutierrez of the
Union of Mexican Farm Workers and Emigrants, the group that
organized Monday's rally to demand the Mexican government locate
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The union has registered 15,000 former braceros in Guanajuato
and seven other Mexican states and is trying to contact more
workers or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez said his organization, which represents the interests of
migrant workers, began researching the whereabouts of the fund when
elderly ex-braceros first came to him with inquiries about a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bosses said that money was taken out by the Mexican
government and that we would get it when we got back to Mexico,''
said Panfilo Soria Garcia, one of those workers.
</P>
<P>
   Now 77, Soria picked cotton in La Mesa, Texas, among other
seasonal jobs north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally in front of Irapuato's town hall, Soria carried a
little plastic bag filled with yellowed documents, including a
laminated guest worker card issued to him in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds of men and widows of braceros gathered at
the rally clutched similar documents -- precious bits of history
proving they worked in the United States and might be entitled to
the savings.
</P>
<P>
   They swapped stories about the back-breaking work they
performed, picking cotton, lettuce, oranges and other crops. The
braceros were usually housed in barracks, and were not allowed to
bring their families or join unions.
</P>
<P>
   Consuelo Delgado, a frail 70-year-old widow, said her husband
died 15 years ago, but had talked about a savings fund. ``He went
to Arizona many times,'' she said, leaning on her granddaughter.
``He was strong then.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Morelos Gutierrez, 81, who picked cotton in Texas and
fruit and vegetables in California, said, ``We sure could use a
little of that 10 percent they took out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the workers said they attempted to find out about the
savings years ago, but never had any success.
</P>
<P>
   ``One needs help sometimes figuring out how to track things
down,'' said Nicolas Galvan, 66, who harvested cotton in Texas for
three years in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last Friday in Mexico City, a
representative of Mexico's Foreign Ministry acknowledged the fund's
existence, but said the government stopped taking out deductions
from braceros' checks after 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means the period we are talking about is between 1942 and
1950,'' said Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, a legal consultant with
Mexico's Foreign Ministry, which is investigating the savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The deductions may have been deposited in three banks that later
merged into one institution called Banrural, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't know,'' he added, ``is what amount was in the
fund, how it operated -- if there were individual or group accounts
-- and what became of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez said that the union doesn't yet accept the government's
claim that deductions stopped in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27, he said, the government is supposed to disclose the
findings of its investigation so far.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government proves it didn't deduct money after 1950,
Mendez said, his union's position is that the Mexican government
should give the other workers credits to use for Mexico's social
security system or some other compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion figure the union claims is owed is based on how
much several million braceros would be entitled to if deductions
were taken out over the duration of the guest-worker program -- and
interest were added. If the government proves it stopped deducting
money after 1950, the actual amount of the claim might be smaller
but still substantial, Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Bustamante, an immigrant expert at Mexico's College of the
Northern Border in Tijuana, said he confirmed the fund's existence
more than 20 years ago when he served on Mexico's National
Commission on Migratory Labor.
</P>
<P>
   He said a Banrural official told him that the bank had issued an
advertisement years earlier warning that braceros who didn't pick
up their savings would lose them. Bustamante said he researched the
claim, and found that the bank couldn't legally strip the men of
their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice of the government taking out deductions continued
beyond 1950,'' Bustamante added, but he wasn't sure for what
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Carlota Botey, a Mexican housing activist who also served on the
commission, said that she suspected that Banrural may have
erroneously used some of the money for rural development projects,
including loans to big farms.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez's union is also urging that the government help find out
what happened to deductions from the checks of 100,000 Mexicans who
were recruited to work on American railroads during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The men paid dues to American unions, Mendez said, and also had
deductions taken out by the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered what happened to that money,'' said Jose
Avila Munoz, 74, who worked for 14 months in Arizona building
railways.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ For those among the fortune-seeking forty-niners
who survived scurvy and shipwreck on the voyage around Cape Horn,
and for those who survived snow and starvation traveling overland,
San Francisco presented a gaudy spectacle of freedom, where the
restraints of the East fell away.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Parker House or the El Dorado, women dealt the cards, a
brass band or banjo music played and gold nuggets were piled high
on the tables,'' wrote the historian Kevin Starr in his history of
California.
</P>
<P>
   One could eat at the Fly Trap or Monkey Warner's Cobweb Palace,
decorated with whales' teeth, or the Poule d'Or. Or one could grab
a cup of coffee at a little tent on Long Wharf, where three
Croatian immigrants set up shop in the very first year of the gold
rush, 1849, the year before California joined the union.
</P>
<P>
   Landfill projects, earthquakes and commercial exigency have
forced repeated moves since, but the business has prospered under a
succession of Croatian-American owners.
</P>
<P>
   It still does. It is now called the Tadich Grill, after a former
proprietor who went to work there in 1876. It is one of the state's
oldest businesses, still a favorite of visitors and locals,
including Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   So this, you will have gathered by now, is Tadich's
sesquicentennial year. Few restaurants last 50 years, let alone
150. Tadich's is older than Gage &AMP; Tollner and Peter Luger in
Brooklyn, almost as old as Antoine's in olde New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In a city known for cutting-edge restaurants, Tadich's is
old-fashioned, a nostalgic shrine to local piscine tradition. The
fishing fleets are gone, for the most part, and the places on
Fisherman's Wharf serve tourists, mostly. Aqua, a chic and costly
restaurant next door to Tadich's, roasts and sears fish superbly in
the modern manner, or serves it not cooked at all, but Tadich's
still grills and pan-fries it to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   This is an understated kind of place, where you go to eat, not
to dine, which can be a relief after all the edible architecture
and confusion cooking you have to deal with around town. The time
to go is lunch, and the thing to eat is fish, though Robert T.
Buich, the current head of a family from Dubrovnik on the Dalmatian
coast that has owned Tadich's since 1929, sticks in a word of
praise for dinner and for his meat dishes.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to be said for going in the evening, I suppose
_ the suits from Montgomery Street, San Francisco's mini-Wall
Street, crowd into the place at lunchtime _ but I'd no more order
breaded veal cutlet or boiled brisket of corned beef at Tadich's
than Dover sole at the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't claim to be the best,'' said Bob Buich, who
pronounces the family name BEW-itch. ``But we believe in what we do
and the way we do it, and we're not about to change. This is our
life, not an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pretend. You're not buying a Mercedes for $80,000
when you come in here. You come for a meal, a drink, a good time, a
good talk, so we try to keep the prices down. Some of the
stockbrokers say we're too cheap, but we get all walks in here, and
I'd like to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   A piece of prime fish will cost you $12.25 (for a boned rainbow
trout) to $14.95 (for a filet of petrale sole). Sides and drinks
extra.
</P>
<P>
   I learned about San Francisco fish on my first trip to the city
in 1964, covering one of Nelson Rockefeller's futile presidential
campaigns. The instructor was my friend George Murphy, from The San
Francisco Chronicle _ the real George Murphy, as we always called
him, to distinguish him from the hoofer-turned-senator. He took me
to Sam's, Tadich's great rival, also owned by Croatian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sauces,'' George lectured me. ``The French do sauces.'' He
also told me to forget the salmon and swordfish and go for
Dungeness crab, bay shrimp, sand dabs, petrale sole and hash
browns, that kind of stuff _ and drink Wente Brothers gray
riesling.
</P>
<P>
   After he died, I gave up Sam's, and gray riesling, too. I moved
over to Tadich's, but I found that George's fish advice worked just
as well there. For decades now, I have been sitting down at
Tadich's counter, usually about 2 p.m., when the crowds have
thinned, and ordering a fillet of pan-fried petrale sole (a kind of
Pacific flounder).
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Betsey, usually opts for the delicate, diminutive sand
dabs, boned, also pan-fried. Both dishes are invariably crisp,
golden and buttery outside, moist and and sweet inside.
</P>
<P>
   Usually crab or bay shrimp to start with, always the chewy hash
browns, and, most recently, a bottle of the fine Hanzell chardonnay
from the Sonoma Valley. We've never managed dessert, but people say
the rice pudding is middling or better.
</P>
<P>
   Other strokes for other folks. Michael Buich, Bob's nephew, told
me that the biggest seller is probably cioppino, the tomato-based
seafood stew devised eons ago by the city's Italian-American
fishermen. It's ordered at least 200 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Tadich's version is not, in fact, a stew. Some years ago, the
chef at the time, John Canepa, who came from Genoa, decided that
with the pot bubbling away on the back of the stove the fish was
always overcooked by midafternoon. So now the fish, clams, prawns,
scallops, bay shrimp and crab meat are cooked separately, and the
sauce is poured over them at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The most regular of Tadich regulars, at least in the modern era,
was Joe Cimino, a real estate man who had lunch there five days a
week for decades and took his wife to dinner on Friday nights. He
always ordered skirt steak. After he died, someone figured that
over the years he must have eaten 23 miles of skirt steak.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Caen, the nonpareil columnist of The Chronicle for half a
century, was partial to the Hangtown Fry, an improbable but
delectable blend of scrambled eggs, bacon and oysters. He wrote of
eating one on a cold March day in 1982 and feeling as if time stood
still at Tadich's.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite, but close. On May 1, 1990, after 141 years of
demanding cash on the barrel head, Tadich's started taking credit
cards. ``We are moving reluctantly into the 20th century,'' Bob
Buich said, a decade before the start of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Other things have changed, too, mostly for the better. The wine
list is stronger than it used to be. The most expensive bottle is
$60, which would embarrass a lot of San Francisco's grander
restaurateurs and saloonkeepers. But there is plenty of good
drinking, including the best of Chalone, Jordan, Trefethen and
Grgich, and the house's own crisp, well-balanced chardonnay at only
$18.50, a product of the Redwood Valley north of Ukiah.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A lot more people order their fish sauteed with white wine now,
rather than fried in butter, Mike Buich said, because they count
the calories the way the old-timers never did. Fish come not only
from this area but from Chile, New Zealand, Southern California,
Alaska and fish farms _ always on ice, never frozen, except the
prawns, which is a huge change from the '60s. You find thresher
shark and albacore and bluenose sea bass on the list of daily
specials these days.
</P>
<P>
   You even find a fair number of women at the brass doors when
they open for lunch at 11 a.m. Montgomery Street has changed. But
the atmosphere of Tadich's remains resolutely masculine, if by no
means aggressively or exclusively so. The waiters, in short
starched white coats, could work as extras in ``Grumpy Old Men,''
Part 3, but they know their trade, and to me, at least, it's a
pleasure to know that they do this for a living and always have.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still no reservations to be had for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tadich's last move came in 1967, when it had to vacate its
premises at the corner of Leidesdorff Alley and Clay Street to make
way for an annex to the Wells Fargo Bank. (There's another echo of
the Gold Rush; Wells Fargo and Levi Strauss are two of the other
companies whose early customers were the pioneer gold miners.)
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of business at the old stand, the restaurant
rolled back the prices to those of 1912, when it had moved there.
Broiled lobster was $1. Doris Muscatine, a Berkeley food writer,
started lunch at 3 o'clock that afternoon, and she and a friend
worked their way through clam broth, clam chowder, crab Louie, sea
bass, a deep-fried shellfish combo, jumbo asparagus, dessert and
coffee. Not counting wine, the tab came to $3.15.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Tadich's, at 240 California Street, contains most of
the furnishings and all of the clamor of the old one. Dark
wainscoting circles the rectangular room, nine Art Deco chandeliers
give it a period feel and a long J-shaped bar accommodates
unaccompanied trenchermen. A series of booths, divided by
seven-foot partitions, runs down one side, and tables fill the rest
of the available space.
</P>
<P>
   But the sawdust is missing, sadly, from the tiled floor.
</P>
<P>
   In an open kitchen at the back, the head chef, Fritz Braker,
starts work every day at 5:30 a.m. He fields telephone calls from
purveyors between 6 and 7, and by 8:30 the fish has arrived. Once a
week or so, some of it goes straight back, having failed to meet
the restaurant's standards _ ``mostly mushy sand dabs,'' Bob Buich
said, ``100 pounds out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days, both Buiches, clad in the same white coats as their
waiters, work the floor. Mike Buich tries to persuade people to try
something new, like sturgeon or tuna, and both spend time educating
young customers about local fish, which aren't cooked much at home
in this modern era.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the restaurant's birthday, the menu, usually
printed in red and black on a single sheet of heavy stock, folded
in half, is being printed in green and white. A modest catalog of
souvenirs and sauces has been produced. But no banner hangs in the
window, and so far there has been no gala banquet, although the
mayor talks about a block party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing much,'' Bob Buich said. ``We keep our heads
down and keep doing what we do. We're not really much of a PR
place.'' &QL;

   MEXICO-BRACEROS _ IRAPUATO, Mexico _ Mexicans who worked in
American agriculture during World War II and for some time after
are demanding the Mexican government return an estimated $3 billion
in pension funds. The workers, known as the ``braceros,'' or
``pairs of arms,'' where recruited as legal substitute workers when
Americans went off to war. The bracero program lasted from 1942 to
1964. For at least the first eight years the workers saw 10 percent
of their wages deducted by the Mexican government for a pension
fund. Today, a union of
</P>
<P>
   these workers and their survivors say about 15,000 men have been
identified who never received that money. The estimate of $3
billion may be much too high, but the Mexican government confirms
that such a fund existed. It admits it doesn't know what happened
to it. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS and locator map

   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul) _ The worst recorded earthquake to hit
western Turkey killed at least 1,100 people and injured thousands
today, destroying buildings and cutting off power and water to
millions living along the heavily populated Bosporus Strait. By
late Tuesday afternoon, the crisis center at the prime minister's
office had tallied 1,169 dead and 5,550 injured. The death toll,
based on the number of bodies that have reached hospital morgues,
was expected to rise. (Summary from wires.) By Edmund L. Andrews.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Three months after he was kicked out

Primakov on Tuesday made a dramatic reentry into Russian politics,
this time as head of a powerful new electoral alliance that could
become the launchpad for a presidential bid next year. The
long-awaited decision by the cautious and enigmatic Primakov, whose
popularity has thrived during a three-month-long silence, has
already recast the shape of Russian public life as the country

   YUGOSLAVIA-POLITICS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ In a severe blow to

withdrew on Tuesday from a major anti-Milosevic rally scheduled for
Thursday. Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement

   ANIMAL-RIGHTS-LAW (Undated) _ More than a generation after civil
rights and environmental lawyers took their battles to the courts,
a new group of lawyers say they are following in those footsteps on
behalf of clients with names like Freckles and Rainbow. Fighting
for creatures like performing orangutans and dogs used in
experimentation, the lawyers are creating a new field of animal law
with far more ambitious goals than traditionally weak anti-cruelty
laws. They are filing novel lawsuits and producing new legal

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The U.S. economy may be rocking and

the main message from a fresh batch of government data on consumer
prices, industrial activity and home building released on Tuesday.
The new evidence soothed investors who have been worrying lately
that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates more
than a quarter-point next week. Bonds rallied strongly while stocks
edged up slightly. The consumer price index rose just 0.3 percent
last month after registering no increase at all in May and June.
Better still, most of the increase reflected higher energy costs _
which were widely anticipated and boosted everything from gasoline
prices to airline fares-as well as another big hike in cigarette
prices. By Sylvia Nasar.

   BUSH-CRIME (Austin, Texas) _ Law and order has always been part
of George W. Bush's politics. Bush ran for governor of Texas in
1994 with a series of grainy black-and-white commercials depicting
a man abducting a woman at gun point in a parking garage and, a
moment later, a police officer draping a blanket over the woman's
body. Charging that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann Richards, was
soft on crime, Bush promised to get tougher with criminals. That
stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the
five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent in
pressing a law-and-order agenda. But how Bush's record on criminal
justice will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested
as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. By Fox
Butterfield.

   DEMS-VALUES (Washington) _ Democrats are still drawing low marks
from the public on values, causing nervousness about the upcoming
elections in which the party enjoys advantages on many other
issues, according to recent polls. By Alison Mitchell.

   Despite the best efforts of biographers, in the public mind a
life is too often just a caricature, an identifying line or two.
And the most common lines that T.S. Eliot has been reduced to are
great poet but miserable man; anti-Semitic, coldhearted author of
immortal verse; a man who committed his troubled first wife to an
asylum and then abandoned her there forever.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndall Gordon, the South African-born literary biographer who
had already published two volumes on Eliot, has done her best in
``T.S. Eliot: An Imperfect Life'' to rescue both the poet and the
man from the simplifying abstractions that have always been applied
to him. She has written an intellectually demanding, sophisticated
and distinguished book.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting Eliot as a flawed and tireless searcher for
perfection, Ms. Gordon seems kinder to him than some recent
writers, like Cynthia Ozick and Anthony Julius, who have
compellingly brought to light his undeniable prejudices, especially
his dislike of Jews. Gordon does not turn away from these faults;
indeed, she argues that in one way Eliot was even worse than his
critics believe, because his misogyny was as strong as his
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the overall effect of her probing and extremely
thoughtful study is partly to redeem Eliot, at the very least by
picturing him in all of his complex dimensions. ``Eliot's admirers
played up his mask, while detractors stripped it only to find the
flaws,'' Ms. Gordon writes on her very first page. ``Both
overlooked a man of extremes whose deep flaws and high virtues were
interfused.'' Ms. Gordon's book is an attempt to fathom the ways in
which this interfusing took place, her theory being that ``the
`impersonal' facade of his poetry _ the multiple faces and voices _
masks an often quite literal reworking of personal experience.''
</P>
<P>
   To advance her theory, Ms. Gordon, who has also written
biographies of Charlotte Bronte, Virginia Woolf and Henry James,
takes her readers on a tortuous journey. She tracks the difficult
man and his poems from his blue-blood origins in St. Louis to his
death in London in 1965, when he was widely proclaimed not just the
greatest poet of the century but its literary prophet as well. The
consistent theme that emerges is that of a tortured, fastidious
figure of puritanical self-denial, horrified by the spectacle of
ordinary life in a relativistic and secular age, who strove
mightily, as he put it, to sense ``vibrations beyond the range of
ordinary men.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Eliot was born in St. Louis in 1888, his ancestors were
from the priestly elite of Boston. (One of his ancestors was a
judge in the Salem witch trials.) His father was a brick
manufacturer, his mother a minor poet, his other close forebears
ministers in the generally optimistic, upbeat Unitarian church,
very different from the sin-obsessed theology that Eliot, who
converted to Anglicanism, developed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon traces a complicated set of influences on Eliot, from
French Symbolist poetry to the domineering role played by the
expatriate American Ezra Pound, to the Ballets Russes. But Eliot's
grounding in New England Puritanism and in the sense of the artist
as a solitary voyager, a kind of moral and esthetic lone wolf, are
perhaps dominant in Ms. Gordon's portrayal. At least, it is this
feature of Eliot that seems to explain his aversion to sensuality
and his strangely coldblooded relations with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot's commitment to the solitary burden of the soul is not
out of line with an American plot where the Jamesian New Englander,
awakening to life, renounces love out of a finer moral passion `to
be right,''' she writes. The sudden poetic eruption of what Ms.
Gordon calls ``the stern voice of denial'' _ she is writing here
specifically of the ``Four Quartets'' _ is Eliot's hatred of
humanity speaking, his powerful sense of ``the disorder, the
futility, the meaninglessness, the mystery of life and suffering.''
His goal was to transcend that corruption and the dross of
quotidian relationships by the creation of timeless art.
</P>
<P>
   This brought him into painfully inconclusive relationships,
notably with his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, and with Emily
Hale, the Bostonian companion of his middle years, whom he never
married. At the emotional center was Vivienne, who has generally
been portrayed as a victim of Eliot's cruelty and his sexual
aversions (especially in the film ``Tom and Viv,'' adapted from the
play of a decade or so ago). Ms. Gordon's account of their
relationship is far from sympathetic toward Vivienne, who emerges
as manipulative, weak, depressive and demanding, the person whom
Virginia Woolf called a ``bag of ferrets'' around Eliot's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon's close readings of the poems, which are complex,
intellectually demanding and richly suggestive, are at their most
interesting when delineating the links between Eliot's tortured
sentimental life and his work. Vivienne, for example, she finds
oppressively present in ``The Waste Land,'' the powerful evocation
of urban despair and death of the spirit that made Eliot
world-famous at the age of 40. Her lengthy and deep analysis of
this poem is one of the most arresting parts of her book. She links
Eliot's mocking disillusionment, his dislike of women and Jews, his
yearnings for a religious awakening, to the specific anguish he was
experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the satirist, Eliot does not criticize an actual world
but creates a `phantasmal' world of lust, filth, boredom and malice
on which he gazes in fascinated horror,'' she writes. Ms. Gordon
also argues that the work has been largely misread. Critics have
``fastened on his despair and erudition,'' she argues, and in so
doing they have missed the ``visionary alternative'' that Eliot
presented in the poem, the ``possibility of regeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme throughout is a kind of moral agony. It does not
excuse the horrible flaws in the man, and, indeed, Ms. Gordon makes
no attempt to excuse them. It is perhaps Eliot's signal flaw that
he forced others to share his moral agony. But moral agony also
suggests a bitter, lifelong struggle and an overweening seriousness
of purpose, and while these qualities do not make a portrait of
virtuousness, they need to be remembered as parts of a complicated
and troubling whole.

SPARE PARTS FOR OLD BLENDERS SUPPLIED ON THE WEB

   As anyone who uses a blender or food processor comes to realize
sooner or later, the motor outlasts everything else _ blender jars,
gaskets, feed tubes, slicing disks, shredding disks, dough blades.
But don't throw that appliance away when the parts go. Just click
on www.culinaryparts.com for replacements.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Web site of Culinary Parts Unlimited of Pachego,
Calif., which has been supplying kitchen gizmos since 1976,
beginning with the Cuisinart Robot Coupe, for which it still has
parts. All of the parts are factory-fresh, no matter how old the
model may be.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cuisinart, some of the appliance makers whose parts are
stocked and in demand are Kitchen Aid, Krups, Braun, Oster,
Hamilton Beach, Farberware, Coffee, Sunbeam, Protor-Silex and
Waring.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have an unfortunate tendency to drop anything made of
glass will understand where the sales of Culinary Parts Unlimited
are concentrated. All coffee pots are big sellers, said Monica
Girvan, the company's marketing coordinator, and on Cuisinart, the
work bowl is in greatest demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Girvan, who cheerfully describes herself as a kitchen klutz,
is sympathetic. But, she explained, there are other reasons to buy
multiple bowls. For instance, if both your main course and dessert
are made in the food processor, you don't have to scramble to
finish one and clean everything before starting the other.
</P>
<P>
   The site gives diagrams of some devices, identifying the parts,
as well as pictures of each part in stock. The parts are in the
same price range as those sold by stores that carry them. The
25-year-old Robot Coupe parts are available nowhere else in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a subsidiary of the Brady Marketing Co., was
founded by Frank Brady, a manufacturers' representative. Brady, who
still heads the company, discovered that customers didn't stop
looking for replacement parts after the 5 to 10 years that
manufacturers kept them in stock. He picked up that observation and
ran with it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Home cooks ready for challenging recipes might want to try
cheftalk.com. The site was founded by Christopher Koetke a chef,
and Nicko Sahlas, a Web site designer, as a place where chefs could
talk shop and interested parties could eavesdrop. Here may be
found, for instance, a recipe from Joe George, who teaches cooking
at Erie Community College near Buffalo, for pan-roasted portobello
mushrooms with Dijon vinaigrette and asiago cheese, along with a
discussion among two dozen chefs on how they prefer to prepare
mushrooms. The site also offers book reviews and restaurant
recommendations, mostly in or near Chicago, where it is based. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greatfood.com sells specialty foods from more than 80 companies,
with a strong selection of West Coast products that Easterners
don't often see. Among these is a seafood ravioli sampler from the
Monterey Pasta Co. with shrimp scampi ravioli with garlic and herbs
(9 ounces) and snow crab ravioli with dill (9 ounces) and Alfredo
sauce with herbs (10 ounces), for $19.95. (It must be sent by
second day or overnight service because it is perishable.)
</P>
<P>
   Other West Coast specialties include preserves from Graysmarsh
Farm in Sequim, Wash., granolas like Mountain Madness and Moonkist
Maple Magic from the Reward Specialty Food Co. in Seattle and fig
balsamic vinegar from Restaurant LuLu in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the site offers more, for instance, a lobster dinner for two
by Lobster Gram of Chicago sent overnight. A lobster packed in dry
ice, and all the ingredients and directions for cooking and eating
it, including a cooking pot, candles, bibs and forks, starts at $99
plus shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Greatfoods is also working on dinners for Thanksgiving and
Christmas. If you want to send food gifts, the site has dozens of
appealing choices in price ranges from $15 and under to $100 and
up.

`ON THE ROPES': FOR THREE ASPIRING PRIZEFIGHTERS, THE PRIZE IS
HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bed-Stuy Boxing Center, the Brooklyn gym that is the center
of Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen's wrenching documentary ``On
the Ropes,'' is much more than a neighborhood training facility for
aspiring prizefighters. For the three eager young boxers whose
lives are examined by the film, it is a starting point, both real
and symbolic, for them to begin taking control of their lives and
avoiding the self-destructive temptations of the street.
</P>
<P>
   The more deeply the film delves into the worlds of Tyrene
Manson, Noel Santiago and George Walton, the more acutely you
empathize with the struggle of these people to transcend their
grindingly difficult circumstances and achieve a hard-won
self-esteem and sense of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling of the three is Ms. Manson, a feisty,
determined young woman who took up the sport after learning that
amateur boxing officials had sanctioned women's boxing. Like many
members of her family, she has a history of drug abuse, but as she
rigorously trains for the 1997 Golden Gloves tournament in Madison
Square Garden, she appears to have turned her life around. As the
movie goes along, you root for her to stay clean, sober and focused
on her dream.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as things seem to be going well, she is arrested for
crack possession in a police raid on the house she shares with
relatives, some of whom still use drugs. At her trial, she is
defended by a court-appointed lawyer who has no strategy for
helping her. It is simply her word against that of the police, he
advises. The scheduling of the trial ultimately prevents Ms. Manson
from fighting her Golden Gloves match. And the trial and its
outcome offer a sickening case study of the mechanical and
impersonal (bordering on inhumane) treatment of the poor by a
criminal justice system that herds them through the courts and into
prison like cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, a teen-ager whose father died of AIDS and whose mother
was a crack addict during his childhood, is a bright, attractive
youth who becomes a protege of the club's resident trainer, Harry
Keitt. The movie suggests that Keitt may be the only adult who has
ever offered advice and encouragement to a young man whose
streetwise bravado conceals a profound insecurity and self-doubt.
Those qualities reveal themselves glaringly when he enters the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, the most gifted fighter of the three, has won several
major competitions and has the most secure footing in life. And as
Keitt watches his ascendance, he entertains fleeting hopes of
remaining his trainer. But he also knows how the boxing world
operates. No sooner has Walton achieved some success than
high-powered boxing professionals swoop down on him and take over
his career. But even in Walton's case, there are no million-dollar
pots at the end of the rainbow. Eventually he faces the bitter,
unglamorous reality of being a salaried athlete who must adhere to
a grueling tour schedule to earn his keep.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Keitt himself, the stolid, no-nonsense trainer
who has his own troubled personal history and sad knowledge of the
world. After a promising boxing career during which he worked for
several months as Muhammad Ali's sparring partner, he fell into a
life of drug addiction and petty crime that landed him a four-year
prison sentence. The Bed-Stuy Boxing Club is his personal rock and
anchor, the thing that keeps him together.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Ropes'' is certainly not the first movie to portray
boxing as the ultimate Darwinian metaphor for survival in a
dog-eat-dog world. But instead of concentrating on the
blood-sweat-and-guts aspects of the sport, it recognizes the
potentially life-redeeming spiritual component in the stamina,
discipline and courage it takes to train for the ring.

adjacent to a roadside park, and developers consider that one of
its biggest values. The Heart of Texas roadside park, pretty much
in the middle of nowhere on U.S. 377, has a marker claiming the
location as the official geographic center of Texas. It also says
the real center is about five miles away on private land and
inaccessible to the public. The roadside park is as close as you
can get to a sure-enough, semiofficial, center-of-the-state site.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of a cooler, less humid air mass will stretch
from Maine to eastern Colorado. As the more pleasant weather pushes
slowly southward, clouds and patches of thunderstorms will develop,
especially across central and northern New England. Some rain may
reach parts of the Northeast Coast later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A jet stream disturbance over the Middle West will induce low
pressure in eastern Iowa. The merging of two streams of moist air
along the cold front will lead to a cluster of thunderstorms mainly
from Minnesota to Wisconsin and Iowa. A few thundershowers will
spread into Illinois and western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The advance of more seasonable air into the central Plains will
trigger a broken line of strong thunderstorms in Kansas and eastern
Colorado. Moisture circulating northward through the Rockies will
combine with the front causing afternoon storms in Arizona and
western New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in eastern Oklahoma marks the center of a dome of
very hot air over the South. Exceptionally warm air aloft, above
15,000 feet, will suppress the formation of cumulus clouds, leading
to near record heat again in Texas and Louisiana. Sea breezes along
the Gulf and Southeast Coasts will promote a few late storms.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably cooler air will occupy the northwest Plains and the
upper Great Lakes. Much of the West will be hotter with ample
sunshine. Jet stream winds from the South will supply enough
moisture aloft to produce a few thundershowers in the Cascades and
northern Sierra. The Southwest will stay hot and mostly sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Surf's Up
</P>
<P>
   Summer usually brings several periods of high surf along
Hawaii's south shores. Monday saw large swells, over 17 feet high,
along the southeast coast of the Big Island as Hurricane Dora
passed well south of the region. By midday Tuesday, the seas had
subsided to 8 feet and surf advisories were lifted. While distant
hurricanes are the most common cause of rough seas in Hawaii during
August, occasionally, fierce winter storms in the south Pacific can
send large swells thousands of miles reaching the south beaches of
Hawaii long after the storm has dissipated.

STUDY SAYS CANDIDATES IGNORE KEY GROUP OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 10 million women who vote only occasionally
remain up for grabs in the 2000 election because they believe
candidates in both parties have ignored their concerns about
education and health care coverage, the Women's Vote Project said
in a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates who can galvanize these voters will win,'' said
Irene Natividad, chairwoman of the Women's Vote Project, a
nonpartisan, Washington-based coalition of national women's
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on random polling over the past year of
women who had voted in one or two of the last three elections, but
not in all three. The report also used focus group interviews
conducted last month of 30 women in Colorado, Kentucky and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted by Lake, Snell, Perry &AMP; Associates
Inc., a Washington-based public opinion research company.
</P>
<P>
   Natividad said the women, a majority of whom were working-class,
believed that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans were
addressing their needs. She said the group, making up more than 4
percent of the U.S. population, associated the Republican Party
with big business and saw the Democratic Party as either
ineffective or similar to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these women believe that right now, no party really
represents people who live paycheck to paycheck,'' Natividad said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, most of the women had little party
loyalty and said they would be willing to vote for third party
candidates. ``This is a group whose vote must be earned,''
Natividad said.
</P>
<P>
   However, both parties are courting the support of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party has been aggressively addressing the
concerns of working women by empowering them with more control over
their retirement, providing tax relief and making their kids
schools stronger by taking away control from bureaucrats in
Washington and giving it to local administrators, teachers and
parents,'' said Mark Anderson, a spokesman for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials could not be reached for comment, but
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
have targeted issues of interest to women _ including gun control
and education.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, education topped the list of concerns
for the women _ identified by the Women's Vote Project as
``occasional women voters'' _ most of whom did not have a college
degree. Specifically, the women wanted greater school safety,
smaller class sizes and more choice for parents over which schools
their children may attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women, who are barely making it, believe that education
is the best hope for their children to have a better life, and so
for them, issues impacting schools are priority number one,''
Natividad said.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns over school safety also elevated the issue of gun
control with the occasional women voters, who favored a ban on
concealed weapons and assault rifles as a way to stop school
shootings, the study said. However, these women were not in favor
of banning all guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to get rid of any weapon they feel is a threat
to their children, and hunting rifles just don't fall into that
category,'' said Celinda Lake, president and founder of Lake,
Snell, Perry &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   After education, the next most important issue for the group was
the availability of health insurance, the study found. Although
most of the women in the group had health insurance, many had been
without coverage in the past because of being unemployed or working
for a company that did not offer them insurance, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are terrified that something will happen to them
and that their life savings will go down the drain in a matter of
months or weeks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lake said candidates who want to sway the occasional woman voter
need to understand that this group feels it has been left out of
the economic boom of the past seven years.

GOOD ADVICE, RIGHT FROM THE BUTCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many cookbooks about grilling meat share a fatal flaw. The
recipes focus on how to flavor the meat, rather than on the meat
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It took a family of butchers to set things straight. In ``Prime
Time: The Lobels' Guide to Great Grilled Meats'' (Macmillan, $25),
Evan, Leon, Stanley and Mark Lobel, the owners of Lobel's Prime
Meats in Manhattan, put the emphasis on the raw ingredient. The
Lobels _ two brothers and a son of each _ understand that a
hamburger is nothing without the right cut of beef and that
grilling a burger takes some care. They push these points on every
page.
</P>
<P>
   Chapters are mostly divided by meat type, beef or lamb, for
example; the ones on burgers and marinades and rubs are the
exceptions. The chapter introductions, which include charts on
cooking times and meat-buying tips, are smart and amusing,
reflecting the authors' years behind the butcher counter, answering
such customers' questions as: What is flank steak? Can I baste with
beer? How do you keep skinless, boneless chicken breasts moist?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Lobel family's experience as butchers goes back so
far _ five generations _ the answers are clear and thorough. The
headnotes to the recipes are all business, describing what specific
cuts look like and what part of the animal they come from.
</P>
<P>
   For tortilla-wrapped round steak, for example, the headnote
reads: ``From the rump _ also called round, skirt or flank of the
steer _ round steak may be sold with a small, round bone or not,
depending on the butcher. It is lean and not as juicy as some other
steaks, which is one reason it lends itself so well to marinating,
slicing thin after grilling, and then serving with other flavorful
ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors also explain why the cut is appropriate for the
recipe. In a stuffed lamb chop recipe, for instance, they call for
loin or rib chops because these cuts are tender and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' they add, ``you could substitute shoulder lamb
chops, which, while not as tender, are less expensive and quite
flavorful.'' Few grilling books offer such detail.
</P>
<P>
   The Lobels rarely try to entice you with descriptions of the
finished dishes, letting the recipe titles speak for themselves. In
some cases, this is not too effective. For example, teriyaki steak
with grilled pineapple and rack of lamb rubbed with blue cheese
sound dated. Others, like chicken Provencal burgers and South
India-style lamb kebabs, are far from culturally authentic.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, recipes are uncomplicated, shaped to
complement the meat, not confound it. I had problems with a couple
of them. The lamb rosemary burgers had far too much rosemary in
them, and mustard-glazed shoulder lamb chops did not have enough
marinade to cover all the chops.
</P>
<P>
   The Lobels are careful, though, not to stretch beyond their
expertise. The reader is expected to know what to serve with the
grilled meat. With hamburgers, for instance, they simply tell you
how to prepare them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To avoid crumbly burgers,'' they write, ``open your fingers
slightly when handling the meat; don't squeeze the meat, and try
not to overhandle it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a relief to read a recipe for a grilled hanger steak that
has an ingredient list of just beef, salt, pepper and oil. There is
no 20-ingredient rub and no accompanying recipe for pommes frites.
The cut, called hanger because it hangs from the rib cage, is also
referred to as ``butcher's tenderloin,'' the Lobels write. It has
great flavor but is not the best-looking cut, which is why you
rarely see it in stores: butchers keep it for themselves. Following
the book's instruction, I knew how to ask the butcher to trim it
and felt comfortable grilling it.
</P>
<P>
   These plain recipes _ like those for veal chops, T-bone steak
and even hamburger _ show the Lobels at their best. I almost wish
they had done the entire book with just plain recipes for every cut
of meat.
</P>
<P>
   It is the qualities of the raw materials and the technique used
with each cut of meat that serious grillers really want to
understand. Getting ambitious with sauces and side dishes can come
later. Besides, the reality is that home cooks probably cook a
hanger steak seasoned with just salt and pepper more frequently
than they cook one with a complex rub or sauce.

   GRILLED HANGER STEAK
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Prime Time: The Lobels' Guide to Great Grilled
Meats''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   1 hanger steak, about 2{ pounds, trimmed and center vein removed
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill. Lightly spray the grill rack
with cooking spray. Coals are hot enough for grilling when you can
hold your palm 4 inches above them for only three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   2. Brush steak with olive oil, and sprinkle on both sides with
salt and pepper. Gently press salt and pepper into meat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sear meat for about 1 minute on each side, and then grill for
12 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness of steak. If thin end of
steak cooks before the wider end is done, position steak so that
the thin end is on the edge of grill. Turn steak frequently during
grilling. Cook to desired doneness: a rare steak is done when an
instant-read thermometer inserted in center reads 130 degrees. Let
steak rest for about 5 minutes before slicing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was a child, my family spent weekends at a
lake. It was just a short drive from our house, but not short
enough to drive home for lunch. So my mother always packed a
picnic. It was typical American fare _ blunt, salty, sweet and
creamy flavors, things like three-bean salad, chicken salad with
grapes and almonds, deviled eggs, potato chips and cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   I can still recall the sweetness the grapes added to the chicken
salad and the scent of lake water on my hands as I licked the salt
of potato chips off my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when I lived in France, my idea of a picnic
changed. It was no longer about stirring together salads with
mayonnaise and cutting up fruit. Picnics there seemed to create
themselves. As I traveled, there were inevitably local cheeses,
breads or cured meats I wanted to taste. I picked them up as I made
my way through the market and shops. All I needed was a bottle of
wine and a plot of land and I had a picnic on my hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, picnics are a bit of a novelty for me. They involve
packing up a meal, hiking a trail of sidewalks to Central Park and
hunkering down to a meal on grass, nestled among ranges of
buildings in one of America's most densely populated restaurant
cities. But they are a form of escape _ from reservations, from a
cramped city kitchen, from the madness of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   And at this time of year, with the days regrettably getting
shorter, eating inside makes so little sense.
</P>
<P>
   With all this in mind, I recently set out to plan a picnic in
the park. I began with simple delicacies, a delicious Champagne _
Bruno Paillard non-vintage brut _ and a twist on deviled eggs. I
replaced the mayonnaise in the filling with creme fraiche, and
stirred in chives. I piped them into the hard-cooked whites and
left the finishing touch _ a fat spoonful of osetra caviar _ for
the picnic ground.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the greenmarket influenced much of the rest of the
meal. I had a cool soup course in mind. With the hot dry weather,
the tomatoes from the market are concentrated and sweet, lovely for
soup. Combined with crushed coriander seed, orange zest, bay leaf
and garlic, they needed just a few minutes of cooking to wilt and
release their juices. I strained the broth, seasoned it generously
with salt and freshly ground black pepper and garnished it with
tiny dice of crisp cucumber and whole parsley leaves.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted chicken for the main course. Apart from making one of
the world's greatest leftovers, cold roasted chicken is also ideal
for picnics. You can cut the chicken into small pieces that can be
picked up by hand _ a crucial detail in picnic food.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part about serving roasted chicken cold is keeping
the skin from getting flabby and chewy. I bought small, lean
organic chickens and roasted them at a very high heat _ 475 degrees
_ to brown them well, crisp the skin and render as much fat as
possible. I also let them cool to room temperature before wrapping
the birds so the skin did not steam.
</P>
<P>
   Roasted chicken is, of course, wonderful eaten plain, but my
picnic was not about plain food. I wanted this course to be more
complex and communal, so I blanched haricots verts _ crunchy, thin,
refined finger food _ and whisked together a basil mayonnaise for
dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Then I added a dish that could be eaten with a fork _ the only
dish on my menu requiring a utensil. A friend had once made a corn
salad with truffle oil and served it on oven roasted potato chips
as an hors d'oeuvre. I took this idea one step further, softening
some chanterelles and garlic chives in a little olive oil and
folding these into the corn and truffle oil. It was nutty, garlicky
and richly textured, and yet fresh tasting, as picnic food should
be.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of the cooking for me. I stopped in at City
Bakery and picked up blueberry coconut tarts. They looked pristine,
with softened blueberries sunk beneath a fluffy, pure white
covering of coconut. More important, though, they were sturdy
enough to survive packing in a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Fabulous cheese was also easy to come by. From Murray's Cheese
Shop I procured three raw-milk cheeses: Le Chevrot, a nutty goat
cheese with both runny and caky parts; a wheel of Willow Hill
Autumn Oak, a hard, salty sheep's milk cheese from Vermont, and
Sire de Joux, a cow's milk from France with a firm rind that once
pierced releases an oozy, woodsy interior. Picnic weather is
perfect for cheese. By the time you get to it, it should be weeping
and soft, in need of a knife for spreading and a baguette torn into
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I still had another issue to deal with: how to get all the
food to the park, cool and intact.
</P>
<P>
   Any two handled-container would do _ even a laundry basket. I
used a deep lidded picnic hamper with handles on either side so
that two people could carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone the extra mile to make an elaborate meal, I didn't
want to eat it all on plastic and paper. I brought real flatware
and cloth napkins (wet and dry!), and even fresh flowers wrapped in
a wet cloth.
</P>
<P>
   I lined the basket with the picnic cloth for insulation, then
added small gel ice packs, which could easily be slipped between
containers and bottles. (If you are bringing a juice or cold soup,
you can freeze them before packing them. )
</P>
<P>
   Whether the soup is cold or just cool, though, is not worth
spending too much time worrying about. Picnics are for relaxing and
lingering. If you make a great spread, if you escape to the park,
there should be no worries for a while. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   PICNIC CHICKEN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus cooling time  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 3-pound organic chickens
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Rub chickens with a lemon
quarter. Season the cavities with salt and pepper to taste. Fill
the chickens with the lemons and garlic, then truss them. Rub the
exterior, including the undersides, with the olive oil. Season
generously with salt and pepper and place on a roasting pan at
least 2 inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roast, turning the pan occasionally so the chickens color
evenly, until an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part of
the thigh reads 175 degrees, 35 to 40 minutes. They should be well
browned; the high heat crisps the skin and renders a great deal of
fat. Remove from oven, transfer to a platter and let cool
completely (once covered, there should little condensation or the
skin will get flabby). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
Remove meat from bone and cut into small pieces before packing.
</P>

Add creme fraiche, mustard and finely sliced chives and continue
mashing until very smooth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and
cayenne. Cut remaining chives into pieces 1/2-inch long.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a pastry bag with a small (1/4-inch) round tip, pipe
the mixture into the cavity of each white, filling them completely
and making a small walnut-sized mound above the white. At the
picnic, spoon a little caviar on top of each egg and garnish with
pieces of chive. Yield: 4 servings.

large bowl. Scrape cobs over bowl to extract as much juice as
possible. Immediately sprinkle with truffle oil and season with
salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small saute pan, heat olive oil and garlic over medium
high heat. Add chanterelles. Season with salt and pepper to taste
and saute, stirring, until chanterelles are soft, about 3 minutes.
Do not cook off all the liquid. Remove garlic clove and discard.
Stir in garlic chives.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add chanterelle mixture to the corn and stir gently to
combine. Adjust seasoning. Serve warm or cold.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   BASIL MAYONNAISE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup packed basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   { small clove garlic, crushed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   } cup peanut oil.
</P>
<P>

a pinch of salt and puree until smooth. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk, mustard, vinegar
and garlic with a little salt and pepper. Whisk in the peanut oil,
beginning a drop at a time. Whisk vigorously after each addition of
oil, until mixture thickens and emulsifies. As the mayonnaise
thickens, you can add the oil faster, in a thin, steady stream.
</P>
<P>
   3. Whisk in basil mixture until smooth and homogenous. Adjust
seasoning. Keep cold.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 1 cup.

 &HT;    Tribulation, triumph of financing
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roger Barnette, 29, is the president and chief
executive officer of eTour.com, an Atlanta-based Web site that
delivers a new Web page geared to users' specific interests each
time they log on. Barnette's company recently received a $10
million infusion of venture capital from local investors including
WebMD's Jeff Arnold and iXL's Bert Ellis and Taylor Glover, senior
vice president of the Atlanta branch of Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner
&AMP; Smith. Barnette talked recently about the ups and downs of trying
to finance an Internet start-up venture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your experience looking for funding for your Web
site eTour?
</P>
<P>
   A: Raising money has been, and continues to be even after this
round, at the forefront of my mind. We did an initial seed round of
friends and family, then we did a $1 million angel round with
more-seasoned investors. Then we went to this round.
</P>
<P>
   I personally did the New York-Boston venture capital circuit and
the Atlanta venture capital circuit. It takes up a great deal, if
not the majority, of your time. The networking, structuring deals
and doing due diligence is something you never get away from, but
it's part of your business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever get to a point where you were sick of doing the
``dog and pony'' shows for potential investors? Did you ever start
to think, ``This isn't what I really want to be doing?''
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I always enjoyed telling my story because I love what I'm
doing, and I really believe in it. I love telling people what we're
about and saying ``look, here's our story.'' It's never drudgery
putting together the deals. It's just part of running an
entrepreneurial Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you feel after you made a presentation and the
investors said ``sorry, no?''
</P>
<P>
   A: You do get a lot of no's, and there are tons of reasons why
your company and the investor turn out to be a bad fit. Sometimes
it's because they don't understand your space, or the stage of
growth your company is at. But most of the time it really has
nothing to do with your management team or your idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the name of the game is money, should you just take the
first offer of funding you get?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best advice is to find people who know about you, who
know where your company fits in the marketplace and people who have
faith in your management team. Find people that can add value to
your company and you can get along with, because, ultimately you
have to work with them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you feel after this last round of funding was
completed? Did you celebrate, panic or just keep on working?
</P>
<P>
   A: Personally, I slept for two days. There is a brief
celebratory period, but before you get the money wired over, you
have to have a clear idea of how you want to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does obtaining a significant amount of VC money
change the way you do business on a daily basis?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's really about moving out of a start-up phase into a
fast-growth phase and they are two completely different
mentalities. One is wondering how much paper clips cost _ really
watching cash flow. The second is about how fast can we grow, not
how cheaply can we grow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You talk about finding the right investor. When you're
looking for money to just pay the bills, is there even such a thing
as a ``wrong investor?''
</P>
<P>
   A: We've had commitments from people who may not have been the
best investors for us, but we were eventually able to find people
who were a much better fit.
</P>
<P>
   But I have been on the flip side of this . . . where I'd read
these quotes about choosing the right investor and it seems so
weird when you are out there scratching for any money at all.
</P>
<P>
   I still think finding the right investor is really important. It
all comes out in due diligence and the questions they ask you about
how you will implement your vision.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't see eye-to-eye, there are enough things to keep you
awake at night _ your relationships with your investors shouldn't
be one of them.

GOLF CLUB MEANS END OF BARNEY ADAMS' TIGHT BUDGETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By BRUCE MEADOWS

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Barney Adams' Tight Lies fairway wood, as
its name implies, was designed to get golfers out of tough
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how Adams' career has been in and out of the rough,
he couldn't have invented the Tight Lies at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who has a management degree from Clarkson University in
Potsdam, N.Y., was an engineer for Corning Glass, worked as an
independent sales rep and served as a consultant for struggling
companies, which led him to Texas and a job with Dave Pelz's Golf
Equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The company folded, but Adams' experience with Pelz ``taught me
that I loved being in the golf business,'' said Adams, who had
played golf all his life and tried to get into the golf industry
out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote letters to Titleist, MacGregor, a lot of people,''
recalled Adams, whose Tight Lies has become the top-selling fairway
wood in the country. ``I was willing to do almost anything ... I
think I would have cleaned clubs if it got me into the business.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pelz's company was sold at auction, Adams purchased the
assets and started making equipment on his own. For 11 years, he
labored in obscurity, but also collected six patents on product
designs. He wrote articles for golf magazines, gave seminars and
kept his small company solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like a fairway wood out of the rough that somehow finds
the green, Adams came up with a winner in 1996 when he invented the
Tight Lies, comparable to a 3-wood. As a way to get the new product
on the links, Adams would stick a Tight Lies in the bag of golfers
for whom he had made custom clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started getting a few calls, then lots of calls,'' said
Adams, whose business is in Plano, Texas. ``We only had one phone _
no switchboard _ and the rule was, whoever was closest to the phone
picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams says ``some guy would call and say he had never seen his
friend hit the ball so good, and could he get one of those clubs?''
</P>
<P>
   Adams soon sought professional help to film an infomercial,
which caused the product to soar like, well, a well-struck shot
fairway wood.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, which were about $1 million in 1995, ballooned to $85
million by 1998. Adams Golf was named ``one of the fastest growing
small companies in the nation'' by Inc. 500 and got a similar honor
from Industry Week Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Adams' success was a gamble _ basically reversing the
shape of the club. He did this by making the traditional head shape
upside down, which not only lowered the center of gravity, but
increased the hitting surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major complaint we had always heard from golfers was not
being able to get the ball off the ground from the fairway,'' he
said. ``The idea of lowering the center of gravity was something I
had thought about for years, but it all came together when I made
that first sketch.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the sketch, on a yellow legal pad, ``took 10 minutes
after about 10 years of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough has been compared with cavity-backed irons and
oversize drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Success came quickly, but Adams remained grounded. He knew that
other companies would emulate his design, and he was right.
Orlimar, for one, has come on strong with its more expensive
Tri-Metal fairway woods.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew the Tight Lies couldn't float his corporate boat
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be known as a one-product company,'' said
Adams. ``But we didn't want to come out with something unless we
were absolutely sure if would help people play golf better.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Adams SC drivers and Nick Faldo wedges.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, larger than the Tight Lies, comes in three lofts,
but its selling point is helping golfers cut down on slices and
hooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barney has a real advantage with his new driver because the
spin-control feature is something none of the others have,'' said
golf industry analyst Terry McAndrew, whose Internet newsletter is
closely followed by the golf industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to market a new product that will cost more
than $300, it had better be something new,'' said Adams of his
titanium-faced club available with steel or graphite shafts at $369
retail.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brad White loved to play his trombone. He just
couldn't stand performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my first audition, I almost fainted,'' he recalled. ``I
lost vision, fell over and didn't remember what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in junior high school, and things have not gotten much
better since, confessed White, a 28-year-old classical musician
from Houston whose recent tryout for the St. Louis Symphony also
proved a bust. ``I was shaking so hard I couldn't even blow,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week his quest for a cure took him to New York and an
unlikely savior: Don Greene, a West Pointer, former Green Beret and
Army Ranger, instructor of ski instructors at Vail, criminal
investigator and sports psychologist for the 1984 U.S. Olympic
Diving Team.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly sat White down to watch a video of the two-time
Olympic javelin-throwing champion Tom Petranoff.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 51, a trim, intuitive athlete who more or less stumbled
into an appreciation of classical music late in life, has an
unusual specialty: bringing techniques of sports training, Eastern
martial arts and Western psychology to musicians struggling with
performance problems.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it ``teaching artists how to use energy.'' Applying
mental focusing and concentration through a process called
centering, he says, allows a performer to redirect energy often
perceived as the jitters or worse in ways that are not only calming
but also enhancing of the performance. The key, Greene says, is
switching the mental process from the left, or analytical, side of
the brain to the right, or instinctive, musical, side. Perfection
is not to be sought, he says, Zen-like. Only then may it come.
</P>
<P>
   The centering process, which he says can be reduced with
practice to 10 seconds or less, moves through seven steps, starting
with a declaration of intention (``I am going to . . .''), and
proceeding through concentration and breathing exercises to a focus
on ``the center'' (described as a spot two inches below the navel
and two inches inside the body) and a final redirection of energy
outward.
</P>
<P>
   It's not psychotherapy, he stresses. ``We're not talking about
your childhood. We're not talking about your dad or what happened
10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports and music may seem worlds apart, but mastery in both
requires similar psychological skills, says Greene, who holds a
master's degree in forensic science from George Washington
University in Washington and a doctorate in psychology from the
United States International University in San Diego. He charges
individual clients $125 an hour for sessions in his
citation-bedecked midtown apartment, where a glass case displays
his Special Forces beret, paratrooper wings and service patches.
</P>
<P>
   Stage fright is as old as performing itself, the bane of even
the greatest talents and the subject of limitless coping strategies
starting with the old chestnut ``Just relax.'' But Greene's
approach has been increasingly credited by mainstream institutions
from the Juilliard School, where he is on the graduate faculty, to
the Curtis School of Music, Yale, Oberlin, Northwestern and the New
World Symphony in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed by how practical and effective his
suggestions are,'' said Joseph W. Polisi, president of Juilliard,
where Greene began teaching master classes two years ago and where
his 1998 self-published book, ``Audition Success,'' is selling so
well in the bookshop that he is following it up with a sequel,
``Performance Success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The techniques have been used in other fields, obviously,''
Polisi said in an interview. ``But I don't think they've been used
in this way in music performance before, certainly not at this
intensity level.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Greene's approach ``allows students to find techniques
and tools to deal with what will inevitably be nerve-racking
experiences on every level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the New World Symphony, a 12-year-old orchestral academy
offering three-year fellowships, Greene holds several seminars a
year with the 85 students under Michael Tilson Thomas, the artistic
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud Don Greene for the work he is doing with young
musicians,'' said Tilson Thomas, who is also music director of the
San Francisco Symphony. He called Greene's contribution an
important part of the New World Symphony's training program and
added, in a statement released by his Miami Beach office:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our musicians live day-to-day with the realities of an
intensely competitive orchestral job market and the knowledge that
a three-minute audition can shape a whole life. Don Greene's work
addresses the concentrated focus that is demanded in those critical
moments, and he translates a somewhat intangible notion into a
concrete set of skills.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare them for their high-anxiety auditions with major
orchestras, Greene has them evaluate their strengths and weaknesses
on his Artist Performance Survey, which can be analyzed by
computer. He instructs them in the centering technique and subjects
them to adversity training, everything from dropping things loudly
behind them to plunging them into sudden darkness. He also
encourages them to give a name to their fears and to say silently,
for example, ``Go away, Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the New World's secret weapon,'' Joel Reist, a
bassist, said of Greene after serenely playing through the barrage
last October, adding, ``Now it's my secret weapon.'' He ended up
winning a job with the Nashville Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Greene also works with prominent private clients, most of whom,
he said, do not wish to be identified. But one, Julie Landsman,
principal horn player with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and a
Juilliard faculty member who introduced Greene to the school, said,
``He helped me organize a clear way to reduce performance
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   She in turn brought him in to talk to her students. Later, at
the 1997 Met horn audition, those who had worked with him came in
first, second, fourth and fifth. This year his clients came in
first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Counseling musicians did not seem the career Greene was destined
for. Growing up on Long Island, he was an avid gymnast and diver,
with athletic skills that won him appointment to the U.S. Military
Academy in 1966. After paratrooper and commando training, he was
the first from his class to be selected for the Army's Special
Forces and served on the headquarters staff of the John F. Kennedy
Center for Unconventional Warfare at Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Later he went undercover for the Army's Criminal Investigative
Division and worked for the Illinois governor's Office of Special
Investigations and the San Diego district attorney. After gaining
his doctorate with a dissertation comparing the firearms
performance of San Diego SWAT team members with and without
centering training, he served as the sports psychologist for the
Olympic diving team, the Golf Digest Schools and the Vail Ski
School.
</P>
<P>
   At Vail he met a bassist with the Syracuse Symphony who was
seeking help with his golf game, and he was invited to talk to
orchestra members about athletic principles and musical
performance. He branched out, giving master classes at the Lake
George Opera Festival and taking on private clients.
</P>
<P>
   White, the trombone player who flew in from Houston last week
for three hourlong sessions with Greene, was a self-described hard
case with a simple plea: ``I want to be able to perform an audition
without falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   He had studied books and seen psychoanalysts. They had helped a
little, he said, but not enough.
</P>
<P>
   After having him rate himself on the performance survey, Greene
began by showing White the javelin-throwing video featuring his
mentor, Robert M. Nideffer, a sports psychologist and author of a
1976 book, ``The Inner Athlete: Mind Plus Muscle for Winning,''
which Greene regards as a bible. The video's message was that by
relaxing rather than straining his muscles, Petranoff could throw
farther.
</P>
<P>
   Greene then asked White to pick up his trombone and play. ``Do
what you normally do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White hesitated. ``I'm just laughing,'' he said, ``because that
means I would crater.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, shifting his gaze uneasily from Greene to a visitor
taking notes, he started uncertainly on Mozart's Requiem and was
soon puffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was it?'' Greene asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty nervous,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 7 or 10 seconds, what was going on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get the tempo,'' White answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you thinking or hearing?'' Greene pressed. ``We need to
be clear about that. Thinking and hearing are miles apart. Left
brain you think in words, right brain you feel and hear the music.
I want you in right brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing, Greene said: ``For half a second your eyes went
up to the left.'' It was, he said, a sure sign that White was in
left brain, struggling for some intellectual answer. ``You won't be
doing it anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told White to pick a focus point somewhere below eye level,
to avoid the raised glance associated with left-brain thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK to look at the music?'' White asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not if you're analyzing the music,'' Greene said. ``Look
with soft eyes. Stare at the music and not see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He led White through some breathing exercises. ``You know how to
breathe,'' he said. ``I'm asking you to focus on breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked White to concentrate on his center. ``You want to sense
that place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next he had White chose a ``process cue,'' an evocative word or
phrase to switch him into right-brain thinking, something like
``Hear it,'' but, Greene said, ``not an end-product word like
`lush.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not looking for a Holy Grail word,'' he said, ``and not
the best performance of your life. Just solid, good playing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of `flow,' '' White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flow,'' Greene repeated. ``That's the best you can have. I
love flow.''
</P>
<P>
   After having White run up the stairs to pump up his heartbeat,
they went through the centering process quickly, and White played
again. It was much better, said Greene, who told him to keep
practicing his mental exercises and return the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's next client was Julie Nelson, a dramatic soprano from
Grand Island, Neb., who sings regularly with the Amato Opera in
Greenwich Village and is the full-time soloist at the Christian
Science Church on Central Park West at 68th Street. After winning a
Liederkrantz competition for Wagnerian repertory, she was invited
to sing in April at Alice Tully Hall, where she suffered through a
debilitating attack of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, `You're at Lincoln Center,' '' she said. ``I
was fighting myself.'' She vowed it would be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   She found Greene _ or ``Dr. Don,'' as she calls him _ through
her teacher, Judith Natalucci, and credits him with building her
courage through imaging exercises that, for example, encourage her
to see all the members of the audience as herself. ``It's not scary
because it's all you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She had come that afternoon with what she called ``my courage
statement.'' She read it to Greene: ``I will physically radiate
fun, fight, passion and poise, no matter what the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked pleased. ``What the performing arts takes is
courage,'' he said. ``It's no different from a race car driver or
SWAT team member. Remember what Maria Callas always says in `Master
Class': `Coraggio.'''

`MILLIONAIRE': NEW QUIZ SHOW. GREAT BIG PRIZE. WHO'S AFRAID TO GO
FOR IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review; words in bold can be in
italic.) 
(nk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all due respect, Regis Philbin, here's a mote of advice: No
more Mr. Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin is the host of the new ABC quiz show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' a concept so emphatic that there's no question mark
in the title. If the show's arrival comes as news to you, you can't
fault Philbin's enthusiasm level when it comes to promoting it. He
has been telling Larry King and any other interviewer who would
listen that ``Millionaire'' would, by itself, save the ABC network
from destitution. He may be right. But can anybody save the show
from Philbin's sunny enthusiasm?
</P>
<P>
   The show, which began a two-week nightly run on Monday, is a
near-replica of a television phenomenon in Britain that has
sometimes riveted nearly three-quarters of that nation's viewers to
their screens to see if any contestant gets all the way to the
(PS)1 million grand prize. So far no one has.
</P>
<P>
   Watching an installment of the British original, you can easily
see why it's so addictive. After beating nine others in a
one-question qualifying round, a contestant sits nose to nose with
the menacing host, Chris Tarrant, who is dressed in dark colors and
chuckling ominously. Each correct answer to a multiple-choice
question allows another step up the 15-rung ladder, from (PS)100 to
(PS)1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept is built on one element: tension. Escalating,
nearly unbearable tension. Even after the pigeon answers a
question, he must endure being asked ``Final answer?'' and ``You're
sure?'' until he isn't sure if he knows anything.
</P>
<P>
   Horror-movie music beats a frightening  &UR; pum-pum-pum-pum  &LR; as the
poor wretch decides whether to take home the money he's earned or
risk it on the next question. Everything Tarrant does and says is
calculated to rattle the contestant and to keep the viewer's heart
palpitating in time to that relentless music.
</P>
<P>
   The American version copies the original in nearly every detail.
The audience in the round looms over the inquisitor and his target.
The deceptively simple rules of the game allow the contestant three
``life lines,'' including one chance to phone a friend or a
relative to ask for help. And Philbin appears in the same dark
clothes, following Tarrant's lead by telling the studio audience to
``wake up'' when it's called upon to help a contestant (another
life line) and by pawing the women just as the British host does.
</P>
<P>
   But when that horrible  &UR; pum-pum-pum-pum  &LR; pounds into his skull,
Philbin can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is driving me crazy!'' he screamed Philbinially
during Monday's show. He  &UR; had  &LR; to break the tension. He also winced
when he had to read some of the intentionally funny possible
answers. (What makes shirt collars stiff? Starch, glucose, Viagra
...) ``I'm sorry!'' he bellowed. ``I don't write them!''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin is a reliable commodity. His persona: bombastic,
avuncular, with that self-mocking twinkle in his eye. ... ( &UR; You see
this, Gelman? This guy's calling me `avuncular'! What is that, a
disease? &LR; ) ... may be perfect for his morning talk show and his
countless commercials. But the man seems constitutionally incapable
of torturing people. Well, nobody's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' may conquer America on its own, even if $1
million is worth considerably less than (PS)1 million. The concept
is as simply effective as a paper clip. Or a sledgehammer. And
viewers here may learn to love it, even if the game is a little
hard on Philbin. ``Hillary,'' he told one contestant, ``you got my
heart churning and churning! I can't take it anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if it's too much for him, maybe he should yield the seat
to someone more confrontational. You suppose Mike Wallace is
available?

BLACKED OUT WHILE UNDERWATER, FATHER SAVED BY SONS, 5 AND 6

   BARTOW, Fla. _ Cade Adams squints up at his father and asks
about the incident at a hotel swimming pool almost two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you have any breath left?'' the 5-year-old
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Adams messes his son's hair and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll understand someday,'' the father of two said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts Jeff Adams is lucky to be alive and it's all due
to the quick thinking of his two children, Cade and Brawley, 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the two boys, Jeff and wife Jennifer spent the day
having fun on Bradenton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Adams, a 34-year-old Bartow firefighter, had planned a
weekend getaway that started on a Friday and ended on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, after a meal, the quartet had headed for the
hotel pool for a little swimming and competition.
</P>
<P>
   A family favorite is seeing how far everyone can go underwater
without taking a breath. The children asked their father to go for
a new record.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said, `Sure I'm going to go for it,''' Adams said. ``I'm
hard-headed sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The firefighter, who often tests the limits of his ability, is
an avid swimmer, kayaker and cyclist.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Jeff started his underwater swim, Jennifer Adams
left to return to the hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   With his boys watching, their father began what was meant to be
14 laps across the width of the pool, which Adams estimates would
have been 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through the feat, Adams bumped his head on the
side of the pool. A couple of laps later he stopped and floated to
the surface, his head in the water. Adams isn't sure if hitting his
head is what made him become unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Brawley remembers seeing his dad motionless on the top of the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to go help him,'' Brawley said. ``I grabbed his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children, both of whom are strong swimmers, dragged
their father to one side of the pool, lifted their father's head
from the pool and watched as Adams regained consciousness and
expelled water from his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they realize what they did,'' Adams said. ``In
my job I'm used to being on the other end of the spectrum ... it's
very humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams isn't sure how long he was unconscious but he is sure he
was close to drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words cannot possibly express the overwhelming emotions in my
heart and soul,'' Adams said in a letter he intended to be
published in The Ledger of Lakeland, Fla. ``I will never forget
regaining consciousness while coughing and sputtering, feeling
those little hands wrapped around my arm and holding my face out of
the water and hearing the two little voices asking, `Daddy, why
were you down so long?'''

   Telecommuting To the Set
</P>
<P>
   Roger Moore, as in the James Bond most people think of a few
seconds after they think of Sean Connery, is usually ensconced
happily in the principality of Monaco doing charitable work for
Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   But starting next month he is also going to be starring in, of
all things, a syndicated television series of the
action/beauty/lots-of-bathing-attire variety.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``The Dream Team,'' is an admittedly updated version
of ``Charlie's Angels'' that is based in Puerto Rico and features
an elite team of beautiful agents cleverly disguised as fashion
models.
</P>
<P>
   In what the show is calling an international casting coup, Moore
has signed on as J.W. Garrison, the Charlie of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore acknowledged that he had no real interest in working on a
television series, his first since he was Simon Templar on ``The
Saint'' a couple of decades ago. But the offer had an extremely
attractive aspect. ``I don't have to go anywhere,'' Moore said by
phone from Monaco. ``I do it all right here.''
</P>
<P>
   No trips to Puerto Rico where the rest of show will be filmed?
``No, I just stay here and they shoot me on a blue screen.'' The
blue screen is in a Monaco television studio. It is a blank blue
background that can be filled with the proper setting _ and other
characters _ using what is called chomo-key technology. ``I'll do
two or three scenes each show,'' Moore said. ``It is absolutely
perfect for me. I like the concept. I always liked the `Charlie's
Angels' idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dream Team'' stars Jeff Kaake, the token male action hero
on the team, as well as Angie Everhart, a onetime supermodel; Traci
Bingham, formerly of ``Baywatch,'' and Eva Halina, a former Miss
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The series' premiere is scheduled for the weekend of Sept.
25-26. In New York, the show will be on Channel 9 Sundays at 4 as
an intended antidote to football.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said most of his days were now filled with appearances on
behalf of Unicef and that the income from ``The Dream Team'' would
help finance some of that travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see me, most of the time they either address me as
Bond, Simon Templar or hey you,'' Moore said. ``It's usually `Are
you who you think you are?' or `Are you who you used to be?' A
young woman approached me recently and asked `Are you Roger Moore?'
I said, `Sometimes.'''

   `Millionaire's' Promise
</P>
<P>
   ABC's summer experiment with a game show in prime time got off
to an auspicious start on Monday night when the first edition of
its two-week-long series ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' soared
to one of the best ratings for the network this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the overnight ratings from the country's biggest cities,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' had an 8.4 rating Monday night,
the highest for any network show of the night except for the CBS
comedy hit ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which had an 8.5 overnight
rating. (Each overnight rating point represents 598,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   More promising for ABC, the show clearly showed tune-in
strength. ``The Drew Carey Show'' at 8 p.m. had a 5.8 rating in the
overnight measurement.
</P>
<P>
   While not exactly in the range of the phenomenally high ratings
the game show is scoring in Britain, where it was created, the
audience reaction is certainly promising, especially since the big
winner topped out at a puny $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on every night through
Aug. 29, except next Monday. It is being taped at the Sony Music
Studio in Manhattan.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Talk for Young Viewers
</P>
<P>
   Put together one of the original ``Generation X'' spokesmen and
one of the nation's senior conservative media leaders, and what do
you get? A new type of late-night talk show, they both hope.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``The Full Nelson'' and set to make its debut Saturday
night at 11, the show is the brainchild of Rob Nelson, best known
as the co-founder of the noisy and effective early-1990s political
action group called Lead . . . or Leave, which helped bring about
Social Security changes to protect the future retirement benefits
of still-young generations.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's patron is Roger Ailes, the former Republican political
strategist who is now chairman and chief executive of Fox News
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The show sounds like a cross between Bill Maher's ``Politically
Incorrect'' and an old-fashioned talk show like ``Donahue.'' Nelson
will have four or five guests familiar with his topic and will
solicit questions and opinions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ailes hopes to attract viewers in the 25-to-40 range who care
about issues but are bored by current television issues programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Generation X is against hypocrisy more than anything
else,'' he said Tuesday. ``They don't necessarily follow the
traditional lines of news-talk programming, where everyone's either
on the left or on the right. Younger people tend to view both
political points of view with suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has appeared on many traditional political talk shows,
which gave him some ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what will be asked, what the answers will be, where
it's going. It's not much fun. I want to do a show where you had
real conversation, unpredictable conversation, about social and
cultural and political topics that people really had on their
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ailes uses the term ``Gen X'' freely, Nelson, now 35 and a
recent graduate of Stanford Law School, hates it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole concept should be thrown out,'' he said. ``It was a
marketing term. It had no real purpose.''

<P>
   A TBS Surprise
</P>
<P>
   TBS Superstation's original movie ``First Daughter,'' a thriller
starring Mariel Hemingway as a Secret Service agent who must rescue
the president's daughter from terrorist kidnappers, delivered a
pleasant ratings surprise to the Turner-owned network Sunday night.
It attracted 5,309,000 households, the biggest movie audience ever
for a basic cable network. Only the USA Network's mini-series
``Moby Dick'' surpassed it, reaching about 600,000 more homes on
each of its two nights in March 1998.

RESPECTING MOUNT RAINIER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Mount Rainier appears on beer cans, bank checks and
license plates in the State of Washington, friends of mine swear it
does not exist. They come to Seattle every few years, bringing with
them an uncanny knack for visiting whenever the 14,411-foot hulk is
in hiding. Of course, this is not hard to do with a mountain that
generates its own weather system and can get 1,000 inches of snow a
year.
</P>
<P>
   By reflex, as a native Northwesterner, I apologize for the
clouds veiling the big volcano, and repeat the indigenous joke
about the weather. Visitor: Does it ever stop raining around here?
Resident: How should I know? I've only lived here six years.
</P>
<P>
   Then I mutter something useless like, ``You may not be able to
see the mountain, but can you feel it?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Mount Rainier has that kind of hold on people who
live within range of it. We look at Rainier the way Neapolitans
look at Vesuvius, or residents of New Orleans view the Mississippi
_ a terrible beauty, prone to mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   There are taller mountains in Colorado and Alaska, and one in
California. But for mythic allure nothing matches the skyward bolt
of molten rock and blue ice that rises from nearly sea level in the
backyard of three million people.
</P>
<P>
   I have climbed to the summit five times, by five different
routes. I spread the ashes of my grandfather over a Rainier glacier
that forms the headwaters of a river he used to fish.
</P>
<P>
   I took my two young children up to a Rainier meadow one
exceptionally hot Saturday in August, and spent the night watching
shooting stars and listening to the melodious Dave Niehaus call a
Seattle Mariners game on a tiny radio. You get the idea: after a
while, Mount Rainier starts to figure in an unusual number of life
events.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all the intimacy, I am still scared of the most famous
mountain in America. In an age of controlled, theme park thrills,
Rainier demands respect that borders on outright fear. On average
every year a couple of people will die climbing it; others will die
just trying to get close to it.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, it is always stunning and never the same: an ice
cone, mantled in green, bathed in the light of the season,
sometimes with just a halo of cloud cover on top. Close up, it is a
slow-rotting, dangerous volcano holding enough glaciers _ to a
depth of 700 feet or more in places _ to cover all of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   On my most recent climb, about eight years ago, a late-afternoon
heat spell loosened a couple of boulders the size of sport utility
vehicles from their glacial grip high on the mountain. As they came
tumbling down our descent route, we picked up our ropes and dashed
for protection.
</P>
<P>
   I saw that as a serious warning, and have never returned to the
top. Now I take refuge in been-there, done-that excuses and limit
my wanderings to myriad parts of Rainier's midsection.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the centennial of Mount Rainier National Park. In a
couple of visits to mark the occasion, I have been struck by how
much there is yet to discover within the 365 square miles of the
island in the sky. Sure, the summit is glorious, with views beyond
Puget Sound to the distant Olympics in the west, the desert of the
Columbia Plateau in the other direction and the line of lesser
volcanoes up and down the spine of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   But it is cold and the air is thin on top, a crater rim crowded
with anxiety over how to get down without falling into the tomb of
a crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain is only 60 miles southeast of Seattle, a landmark
that is part of the city's skyline and a major reason that an
average bungalow can cost another $150,000 if it has a ``Rainier
vu.'' It takes about two hours to drive from Seattle to one of the
park's three main entrances, and then another 30 minutes or so to
wend up a corkscrew road to airy and stimulating terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The park is a great showcase of primeval nature, particularly
the power of water. About 97 percent of the park is designated as
wilderness, classified as federal land ``where man himself is a
visitor who does not remain,'' in the language of the Wilderness
Act.
</P>
<P>
   But it is remarkably easy to escape the city and experience the
wild for a few hours. Many people show up in sandals and pumps _
foolishly unprepared, in my mind _ for an afternoon of high alpine
play just before dinner in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the park entrance, after a tour through the
strip-mall excess of the Puget Sound metro area and the clear-cut
patches that mar the forest lands around the mountain, is a step
back to another America.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier was the nation's fifth national park, following
Yellowstone, Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon. It was given
protected status during a time when many Americans started
embracing their own wild land as a point of national pride and a
counter to the old glories of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   More contentious than the park designation was the name itself.
It was bestowed on the mountain by Capt. George Vancouver in 1792
to honor Peter Rainier, a British admiral who fought against the
Americans in the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The Coastal Salish Indians called it Takhoma, or a name
approaching that sound. In a campaign that has raged throughout the
last century (and much of this one) to change the name to Mount
Tacoma, one newspaper derided Rainier as ``King George III's fat
old admiral,'' as Bruce Barcott recounts in his book, ``The Measure
of a Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Indians considered any attempt to climb the mountain a
fool's errand. The Indian guide Sluiskin, who led two men halfway
up the mountain in the first successful known ascent of Rainier in
1870, exhorted the climbers to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The oral history of the native people included numerous accounts
of minor eruptions. Mount Rainier is young by geologic time, barely
one million years old. It is a dormant volcano that lost nearly
1,500 feet of its summit in an epic collapse and mudslide more than
5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If something similar happened today, more than 100,000 people
would be in harm's way, according to federal geologists. Two other
Cascade Mountain volcanoes to the south have erupted in this
century: Mount St. Helens in 1980 and Lassen Peak between 1914 and
1921. When Rainier's number is up, Sluiskin's words may come back
as a haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Most people do not think of fire and heat when they look at
Rainier. They think of water and cool forests. The climate zones in
the park can range from temperate rain forest to arctic tundra, all
of which can be experienced quite easily within a day.
</P>
<P>
   The lower elevations, particularly around the Ohanapecosh
Visitor Center in the southeast corner, are congested with ancient
cedars, fir and hemlock _ the kind of forest that used to cover
most of the west side of the Cascade Mountains. The simple valley
walk through the Grove of the Patriarchs, just north of
Ohanapecosh, goes through prime old growth.
</P>
<P>
   The roads into the national park are few, and well-engineered,
with stone bridges crossing deep ravines and winding through the
overgrown forest, and past waterfalls tumbling down the basalt
flanks. Only one road _ the route to the ranger station, lodge and
visitor center at Paradise, on Rainier's southern flank _ is open
year round.
</P>
<P>
   Most people limit their time to walks in and around the cluster
of buildings at Paradise. The visitor center, newly renamed for the
late Sen. Henry M. Jackson, is the most extensive of the four in
the park. Paradise Inn, built in 1917, is framed by massive
timbers, with an open fireplace of river rock, a cozy bar, large
dining room and a sun deck.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, snow can pile up to the third floor of Paradise
Inn, which makes it look like the lodge where Jack Nicholson went
crazy in ``The Shining.'' But the park has enough ghosts of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Park historians say that the term ``flying saucer'' originated
from a sighting of nine forms and a blue flash by the pilot Kenneth
Arnold in 1947. A marine transport crashed on the mountain more
than 50 years ago. When the plane was finally found by a climbing
party, much later, they discovered partly decomposed bodies
strapped into their seats, the pilots with headphones still in
place.
</P>
<P>
   At 5,400 feet, Paradise is the jumping off point for most climbs
of Rainier, and a place to watch buff mountain guides tell stories
with only a slight bit of embellishment. The record, by the way,
for fastest round-trip climb from Paradise to the summit and back
is just over five hours, held by a Rainier guide. Almost everyone
else takes at least three days.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in good physical shape can get to the top of Mount
Rainier, but it is not for people who lack experience in glacial
climbing. Sometimes even the best athletes are stymied by altitude
sickness _ the nausea and headaches brought on by the sudden rise
from sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the first day of a climb is a haul through soft snow
to Camp Muir, a perch of stone huts and tent platforms at 10,000
feet. Then, climbers rise just after midnight, lace up steel
crampons on stiff boots, tie into a rope, and begin the steady
march to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the most dramatic time of a Rainier climb is the hour
just before dawn, as the stars recede and the sky turns to a salmon
color. Always full of doubts, cold and sucking wind, I worry about
deep crevasses, or towering ice blocks. Then a dash of color from
the early sunrise takes my mind in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I helped to lead a blind man to the top; though he missed
the show of light, he detected the summit by the smell of sulfide
emanating from one of its crater vents. The summit day takes about
7 to 10 hours up, 5 hours back down to Camp Muir. The third day is
a return to Paradise, often with a traverse through the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two million people visit the park every year, and only a
fraction of them _ about 10,000 people _ attempt to climb the
mountain. Half the climbers are successful. Those who fail are
usually turned back by foul weather, altitude sickness or
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise is a hush of white for most of the year. But in the dry
months from July into early October, it is a perfect spot to pick
up one of the easy trails around Rainier. A moderate five-mile
loop, the Skyline Trail, can lead a hiker high enough to see some
of the other volcanoes to the south.
</P>
<P>
   But more rewarding are the flowers, which dazzled John Muir
during his visit in 1888. The naturalist called these fields ``the
most luxurious and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the
alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top ramblings.''
</P>
<P>
   The flowers _ entire horizons of lupine, Indian paintbrush and
pink heather _ give way to a blaze of magenta and purple in the
fall, when the huckleberry bushes and vine maple start to bleed
color.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To avoid crowds, I prefer the trails around the visitor center
near Sunrise, at 6,400 feet the highest point in the park reached
by road. It usually closes when the snow starts to fly in late
September. The drive to Sunrise, on the mountain's east flank, is
in many ways superior to the more traveled route to Paradise, and
certainly a more scenic trip from Seattle. Sunrise also has better
weather, because the mountain's bulk blocks many of the westerly
storms.
</P>
<P>
   From Sunrise, you can walk just a half mile to get a close-up
view of the Emmons Glacier, one of the longest legs of ice in the
contiguous United States. Or, hike two and a half miles one way to
Burroughs Mountain, a ridge just a whisper away from the big ice
walls on the mountain's north side.
</P>
<P>
   These glaciers are not static. One of them, Tahoma, has receded
by nearly a mile over the course of this century. They are always
shedding something, contributing to the chorus of waterfalls
everywhere in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Since I started avoiding the summit, I have fallen in love with
the Wonderland Trail, aptly named, which circles the entire
mountain for total of 93 miles, although most hikers walk shorter
segments.
</P>
<P>
   It can be reached from Paradise, Sunrise or through the park
entrance on the northwest corner at the Carbon River. Because of
several washouts, rangers now recommend that the Carbon River
approach only be taken by people with high-clearance vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In wet years, such as 1999, the Wonderland Trail will contour
through snow even late in the summer. But the rewards are plenty. A
huge herd of Roosevelt elk, with their chests of dark brown fur and
large racks, graze in the grass and flower meadows on the trail.
White mountain goats clamber along rock ridges. Eagles snatch trout
from the shallow lakes. It is all I need to keep Rainier as a
steady companion.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   Mount Rainier is a half day's drive from Portland, Ore., Tacoma
or Seattle. Only the road to Paradise, following State Highway 7 to
the park entrance just beyond the town of Ashford, is open year
round. Sunrise is reached by State Highway 410, south of Seattle.
The entrance fee is $10; (360) 569-2211 or www.nps.gov/mora.
</P>
<P>
   All climbers must register with park rangers and get a permit
($15). Overnight stays in the wilderness also require permits,
which are free unless reserved ahead, at (360) 569-4453, for $20.
Inexperienced climbers who wish to attempt the summit can take
training classes that include a guided climb to the top for $500,
through the park's long-established guide concessionaire, Rainier
Mountaineering, (360) 569-2227.
</P>
<P>
   The park has nearly 600 campsites within six campgrounds, at $10
to $14 a night. Reservations are recommended through Labor Day, at
(800) 365-2267 or http://reservations.nps.gov. Paradise Inn has 117
rooms, including 31 with shared baths, in the historic lodge. Rooms
start at $70.
</P>
<P>
   The only other lodging within the park is at the 25-room
National Park Inn at Longmire, in the lower elevations on the road

ENHANCING SOUND IN A HUSH-HUSH WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York City Opera and the New York City Ballet fully
anticipated some negative reaction to their joint decision to
install an electronic sound enhancement system this month in the
acoustically troubled New York State Theater, the home to both
companies at Lincoln Center. The system will be in place in time
for the opening of the City Opera's season Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Most lovers of classical music consider opera houses and concert
halls the last bastions of unamplified natural sound. So this step
by two major American arts companies into a new terrain of
electronically enhanced acoustics was bound to be considered by
many an ominous crossing of a line.
</P>
<P>
   But what these companies are doing openly other companies and
arts centers have been doing surreptitiously. Among them is the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, which for two years has used the Lexicon
Acoustic Reinforcement and Enhancement System, commonly called
Lares, in its 2,080-seat Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Mark London, the director of capital projects at the academy,
said that the Lares system, designed and installed by the
Connecticut-based acoustical firm of Jaffe Holden Scarbrough, was
not used for opera. But almost all performances by the Brooklyn
Philharmonic, for which the orchestra plays from the stage, not the
pit, take advantage of the house's electronic sound-enhancement
capability, as do all theatrical productions involving the spoken
word, though that is far less controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of the sound system was part of some major
renovations of the Opera House completed in the summer of 1997. But
no official announcement of the acoustical enhancement equipment
was made, and programs for the Brooklyn Philharmonic do not
routinely indicate the use of such equipment. London said: ``They
didn't go out of their way to hide it, but they didn't go out of
their way to trumpet it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Lichtenstein, who was the president of the academy when
the equipment was installed, said that such systems were unlike
anything most classical music aficionados would think of as
amplification. For this reason, he said, he chose to keep it quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of enhancement or amplification, or whatever you
call it, is not that much,'' he said. ``Our feeling is that people
have a prejudice against this kind of thing; they think that to use
such a system is kind of faking it. We really don't think that's
true. At the same time, we didn't want to make a big deal of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Academy is one of dozens of halls across the world
that have introduced electronic enhancement systems to improve
their acoustical shortcomings, according to information provided by
Lares Associates. These range from smaller halls like the Tsai
Performance Center at Boston University to important regional music
spaces like Copley Symphony Hall in San Diego and the Hummingbird
Center of the Arts in Toronto, home of the Canadian Opera Company.
Some major music halls abroad have long admitted to enhancing
acoustics electronically for operatic performances, including the
German State Opera in Berlin and the Adelaide Festival Center
Theater in Australia, which both use Lares systems.
</P>
<P>
   But similar systems have been installed in some major music
halls with considerably less openness, notably the Houston Grand
Opera's Wortham Theater Center. A complete listing of Lares
installations includes 16 performing arts centers worldwide that
have requested, Lares officials said, that they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which some companies have tried to keep such
installations secret shows how controversial electronic enhancement
remains in the world of opera and concert music. In this light, the
decision by the City Opera and the City Ballet to embrace the
technology openly can be seen as a bold and risky move.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Theater will employ an Acoustic Control
System, made by ACS, a Dutch competitor of Lares. There are other
such systems, like that of SIAP (System for Improved Acoustic
Enhancement), another Dutch company. The SIAP system was installed
in the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center with scant
controversy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Acoustical designers like David Griesinger, who has worked
closely with Lares Associates, vigorously emphasize the differences
between their systems and claim greater achievement for their own.
</P>
<P>
   But to most laymen the systems will seem relatively similar in
concept and function. Each involves the use of multiple
state-of-the-art microphones working in tandem with a large network
of sophisticated speakers placed discreetly throughout the hall:
overhead, on back and side walls, under balconies. Only by placing
one's ear close to the speakers, those who have studied the systems
report, can one even detect that sound is being emitted. The
designers describe the technology as sonic architecture. Still, as
Steve Barbar, the president of LARES Associates, conceded recently,
``the word electronic has a strongly negative connotation as it
applies to classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbar asserts that the physics of electronics and architecture
are the same: each reflects and refracts the sound throughout a
hall. ``To the degree that we can amplify the sound and the human
hearing system cannot distinguish between electronics and
architecture, we win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics reviewing the Brooklyn Philharmonic at the Brooklyn
Academy for the last two years have not expressed suspicion about
the acoustics. This might appear to affirm the naturalness of
electronic enhancement. ``The system has added an amazing amount of
warmth to the orchestra and significantly altered the acoustics of
the hall,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But audiences may well feel they have the right to judge how any
change in sound relates to electronic tinkering. Even musicians who
play with the orchestra concede that ``sound enhancement'' is a
euphemism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enhanced is a fudgy term, isn't it?'' said Henry Schuman, the
principal oboist with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. ``Amplified is
amplified.'' Schuman was quick to point out that although the
installation was not announced publicly, the musicians in the
orchestra were briefed on it by their music director, Robert Spano,
a conductor highly praised for his accomplishments with the
Brooklyn Philharmonic. Most of the players went along with it,
Schuman added, because of their trust in Spano's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein proposed the installation of a sound-enhancement
system to Spano shortly before he assumed the directorship of the
orchestra in 1997. ``I was initially strongly opposed,'' Spano
said. ``When I finally relented and heard my assistant conduct big
chunks of John Adams' `Chairman Dances' as I listened from the
hall, I couldn't tell anything electronic was being used. The Opera
House was very dry. This system just created ambient space and
reverberation around the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt that his audiences should have been told of the
electronic enhancement, he said: ``I don't know what to say. It's a
non-issue. It's not amplification. It's not significantly altering
the live concert experience.''
</P>
<P>
   By eventually being open about a Lares installation at the
Hummingbird Center in Toronto, administrators there were able to
win over audiences and even some critics. Like many multipurpose
halls, this 3,200-seat, fan-shaped auditorium, built in 1960, the
largest such hall in Canada, faced acoustical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to make the sound better for a wide range of
attractions,'' said Elizabeth Bradley, the center's general
manager. ``But we could not afford to completely reconfigure the
auditorium, which would have meant a $60 million to $70 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into the Lares technology and for a relatively
modest amount, about 450,000 in Canadian dollars, we could not only
make a definitive improvement in the sound, but we could utilize
different settings for the spoken word, for theatrical productions,
for opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The system was installed in November 1996. The public was told
nothing about it at first while sound engineers experimented with
adjustments. Finally, 18 months later, ``we came clean,'' Ms.
Bradley said. The press, various artist managers and patrons were
invited to a demonstration. Soon, some critics who had been
exasperated with the hall's acoustics were praising the changes in
print.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on a 1998 production of Bellini's ``Norma,'' David
Lasker of The Globe and Mail wrote: ``The splendid acoustics are a
gift of the Lares sound-reinforcement system, installed last year.
Now everyone at the Hummingbird has a good seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Just who knew what when is harder to assess in the case of the
Houston Grand Opera, because its performance venue, the Wortham
Theater Center, uses a ``hodgepodge of a system'' installed in
stages over several years, said James Ireland, the opera company's
managing director. The 2,400-seat hall, which opened in 1987 and is
used for opera, touring musicals and other musical theater
productions, proved to be a frustrating space. ``We wanted to make
the sound dry enough for musicals but wet enough for opera,''
Ireland said, noting that today the system is used selectively in
operatic performances.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic moments of a big Verdi chorus might be given a
boost, Ireland said. Or a singer placed in a dead spot on a
particular set might be highlighted a bit. ``We are not trying to
make the sound louder,'' he said. ``We just want to get that
thrilling spiraling sound sensation of grand opera.'' Many purists
would ask what the difference was between this and amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ward, the music critic of The Houston Chronicle, said
that it was known that electronic enhancement was being used, its
extent was unclear. ``It depends upon what they mean,'' Ward said.
``That some aspects of the sound are given a boost is understood.
But if a certain amount of sound is being regularly piped up to the
balconies, that is not talked about very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many classical music insiders are appalled by such acoustical
systems. ``I'm flabbergasted that people would do this so
lightly,'' said Speight Jenkins, the general director of the
Seattle Opera, who insisted that at his house amplification was
used only for occasional spoken dialogue in operas and for special
effects like enhancing the offstage voice of Fafner the dragon in
Wagner's ``Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we give in to amplification or enhancement or whatever the
catch phrase is, the very personality of the voices will change,''
he said. ``If you go beyond this, which is to me a question of
morality, you get close to a place where you are taking away one of
the most important characteristics of our art form.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera buffs tend to feel passionately about natural sound.
Countless fans of Leontyne Price will cherish the memory of her
pianissimo high notes in ``Aida'' floating up to the stratosphere
of the Metropolitan Opera House. Those who heard Birgit Nilsson
believe that no recording ever came close to capturing the effect
of hearing her force-of-nature dramatic soprano voice live.
</P>
<P>
   What are the implications of introducing microphones and
speakers into the opera house and the concert hall? Will
small-voiced singers be tempted into roles for big voices? Will
intimate chamber ensembles routinely play in symphonic halls? Will
audiences get used to enhanced sound and demand it everywhere? Will
amplification soon pervade opera houses the way it does all
Broadway theaters, with, in the opinion of many listeners, woeful
consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Scarbrough, a leader of the acoustical design firm that
installed the system at the Brooklyn Academy, said there was much
educating of audiences and musicians to be done. ``The development
of things like Digital Signal Processing has yielded such
tremendous advances that many of the skeptics have been won over,''
he said. ``We are beginning to see the barriers broken down.'' But
that is exactly what traditionalists fear.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ As they waited last week to take their place
in the Iowa State Fair parade, a group of enthusiastic Gary Bauer
supporters brushed up on a campaign song, to the tune of the
``Gilligan's Island'' theme:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITAL)When Gary Bauer gets elected/He'll be president/When
the straw poll rolls around/Please be in his tent!(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a hard time believing this,'' said Bauer, his
face brightening in a leprechaunish grin as he stood waiting, a few
feet behind Elizabeth Dole. ``I'm marching in a parade and people
are singing a song and putting my name in it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 6, and with no previous election campaigns under his
belt, Bauer is both the shortest in stature and in campaign
experience of the candidates running for president this year.
</P>
<P>
   But looks and resumes can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITAL)''Our campaign's on a budget/We don't have big bucks
to spend/But when he gets elected/ Our country he will mend. ``(END
ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Striding confidently through crowds at the fair, bantering with
the national press about the perfidy of nominating candidates in
``Nicorette-filled rooms,'' or visiting a community center run by a
Muslim on the poor side of Des Moines, Bauer often comes off as the
most adept campaigner running for president this year in either
party.
</P>
<P>
   At a city park in Ames two days before the Iowa Republican straw
poll, he brought a group of mostly college-age supporters to their
feet with a talk about the towns such as Pearl, Paducah and
Littleton, ``where American kids have killed American kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm left with the overwhelming sense that we've done well by
you on so many things, but we have this hole inside our country,''
he told his young audience. ``We have all these civil rights laws
and we still have racial hatred, all these material things and
still our families are falling apart ... all the different things
we own and yet we don't know how to treat our own babies.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an outpouring of the passion Bauer says is lacking in
American politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an alcoholic Kentucky janitor, Bauer attended
Georgetown Law School and became an under-secretary of education
under Ronald Reagan, a name he often invokes on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who headed the conservative Family Research Council,
argues the GOP should be ``a party of bold colors, not pale
pastels.'' He would make opposition to abortion a requirement for
his judicial appointees and take most-favored-nation trading status
away from China.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he speaks of reaching out to Democrats _ doing
so literally at the state fair, stopping by the Iowa Democratic
Party booth to shake hands _ and minorities, as he did in his visit
to the Creative Visions Human Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, if I am elected, my presidency is going to be
about everybody and not just my fellow white middle-class
Americans,'' he told the center's director, Imam Ako Abdul-Samal.
He notes with pride that 15 black organizations sent letters
supporting his appointment to the Education Department post.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer often speaks often of his blue-collar roots in the
rough-and-tumble Ohio River town of Newport. But he also travels in
the inner circles of Washington's conservative establishment. After
finishing a satisfactory fourth in the Iowa straw poll, he and his
family left for a week's beach vacation with the family of Weekly
Standard publisher William Kristol.
</P>
<P>
   While Bauer hasn't run for office before, his work as president
of the Family Research Council and later as chairman of a political
action committee, the Campaign for Working Families, has given him
extensive experience in both direct-mail fund-raising and
fashioning issues-based campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   His PAC raised $7 million in two years, and the Family Research
Council proved itself effective in mounting issue ads for
conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the gee-whiz quality of his campaign, it is guided
by a staff of seasoned veterans who have worked for Ronald Reagan,
Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm and Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team with a lot of scar tissue,'' said Jeff Bell, his
senior political adviser. Bell's partner in an economic forecasting
firm and former compatriot in Kemp's presidential campaign, Frank
Cannon, is Bauer's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Marlys Popma, who has headed the Iowa Right-to-Life organization
and served as executive director of the state GOP, said she
intended to try to persuade Bauer not to run until she heard his
``impassioned presentation'' at an early organizational meeting.
Then she signed on to head his Iowa operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a delivery style that is appealing to me as a woman.
He's firm and strong, but he doesn't yell. He doesn't scream,''
Popma said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the distinctions Bauer draws between himself and
conservative rival Pat Buchanan is that his supporters are about
2-to-1 women, while he says Buchanan's are 2-to-1 men.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's fourth-place finish ahead of Buchanan in Saturday's
straw poll gave his campaign the strategic victory it needed,
although his impressive showing on the stump had raised
expectations even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in anecdotal heaven right now,'' Bauer said at a pizza
party for volunteers the night before the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of this early contest he remains a decided underdog,
but he has a base of small contributors - his finance chairman is
Ronald Blue, an Atlanta financial planner -- that should allow him
to continue well into the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have as many contributors as George W. Bush has,''
he told reporters last week. ``I just lack one zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign claims about 65,000 contributors who have given an
average of $70. It is gaining between 1,000 and 1,500 contributors
a week, Bauer said. With about $3 million in matching funds, the
campaign has raised a total of $7.6 million - far short of Bush's
total, but enough to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Bauer's platform seems aimed straight at religious
conservatives. He favors vouchers for home schoolers and opposes
gambling, the ``gay rights agenda'' and assisted suicide. (He also
favors a ``family friendly'' 16 percent flat tax, a beefed-up
military and vigorous support of Israel and Taiwan.)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent talk at a Des Moines church, he assured the
congregation that ``America was built by men and women in church on
Sunday, at work on Monday and in the voting booth on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer understands he has to appeal to a wider base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like talking in terms of the Christian right,''
he said last week. On the day of the straw poll he bristled at a
question which put him in that category, answering that he was
``not running for pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he and Abdul-Samal, whose community center sponsors
drug treatment and weapons exchange programs, ``share a common
ground'' in the belief that the country's problems must have have a
``faith-based'' solution.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the passion, Bauer sometimes strikes a whimsical note
that betrays his first-timer status. In a talk at Iowa Falls he
said he'd give the IRS a taste of its own medicine by ordering an
audit of all its agents, a pledge he later said was just a joke.
And at several stops he promised his audiences they would not only
receive an invitation to his inauguration, but could sleep in the
Lincoln bedroom - a commitment that would surpass the record of
Bill Clinton, who has kept the bedroom pretty busy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mistaking his resolve to make a serious run at
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony at the Des Moines church, Bauer told the story
of how his grandmother began taking him to church after his uncle
was murdered by the crime syndicate which ran the brothels and
casinos of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   It was that transformation, he said, that led him into his first
political fight, the campaign led by local businessmen and pastors
to clean up the town. This year, he's running for the presidency
with the same revivalist intensity.

SAN FRANCISCO _  SECRETS-Dips  _ One of the best restaurants to
open in the last few years is Kokkari, a Greek restaurant. &HT;    One of the classic ways to begin a Greek dinner is with a
cucumber and yogurt spread, called Tzatziki, and a roasted eggplant
puree, called Melitzanosalata. Although both dishes are available
at most Greek restaurants, they're particularly good at Kokkari.
They're served with warm triangles of grilled pita.

 SAN FRANCISCO _  The names alone tempt and entice: Lemon Boy,
Wolford's Wonder, Cherokee Purple, Marvel Stripe, Radiator Charlie
Mortgage Lifter (who, as you surely know, is a cousin of Amish
Brandywine).
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, they are not prize fighters, but comeback kids who strut
their stuff in the bins of farmers' markets and some food-forward
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, these heirloom tomatoes seemed doomed,
pushed toward oblivion by generally picked-while-green hybrid
Romas, hydroponically grown cluster tomatoes and a few other
varieties of great uniformity, near-indestructibility and, for the
most part, insipid flavor.
</P>
<P>
   A few intrepid gardeners/conservationists tried to keep the old
varieties alive, growing them in backyard plots and swapping seeds
with like-minded tomato lovers. And they managed _ largely via
farmers' markets _ to popularize these tomatoes that range from
tiny cherries to whopping two-pounders and from green and yellow to
rust and the hue of old Bordeaux wine.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown is one of these tradition-minded growers who has
parlayed a personal passion into a viable business. She now grows
30 varieties of heirloom tomatoes on her small family farm, AllStar
Organics in Lagunitas (Marin County).
</P>
<P>
   Brown has less than three acres under cultivation, but she grows
enough to supply a number of high-end restaurants, natural food
stores and central Marin's upscale grocery, Woodland Market in
Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's farming career began _ depending on how you care to look
at it _ either with a disaster or with serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, the software development company for which she
worked went belly-up. Having gardened all her life, the Long Beach
native who had lived and owned land in Marin for more than two
decades, decided to say farewell to the corporate routine. ``I took
a little risk,'' she admits of her move into for-profit organic
gardening and food advocacy, ``But I didn't have much to lose. I
could always go back.''
</P>
<P>
   The valley where she lives with her husband, Marty Jacobson, is
ringed by trees and has its own microclimate. She calls it a warm
bowl, although its cool nights slow things down to the point that
her harvest is starting in earnest just about now. She expects her
tomatoes to be at their prime around September 8, though she and
her husband _ sometimes assisted by son Bo, 19 _ expect to harvest
three times a week until Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few early varieties, but most heirloom tomatoes tend
to ripen late, unlike the hybrids that fill supermarket bins and
which were developed for early harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Brown explains that an heirloom tomato is not only a fruit that
has not been genetically altered, but one that has gone through the
hands of at least four generations of gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners, she says, have kept meticulous records for a long
time. Genetic diversity, she says, is best preserved when a maximum
number of people cultivate a certain plant, not when huge companies
control the market by patenting DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Brown cites an example of survival: In 1994 she planted a tomato
named 1894 after the year of a calamitous flood in the Ohio River
Valley that wiped out crops. But somewhere nearby, the valley's
traditional tomato survived and the seeds were returned to the
valley and have been nurtured since.
</P>
<P>
   Passionate about sustainable agriculture and preserving our
agricultural heritage, Brown splits her time between her farm and
Berkeley's Center for Ecoliteracy.
</P>
<P>
   She also finds time for the Marin Food and Agriculture Project
and its gleaning program. This grass-roots endeavor shows middle
and high school students how to gather produce that's left in
organic gardens and farms after the official harvesting is done _
the likes of baby spinach leaves and parts of other crops that are
either too small or too tall to be garnered in regular harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, Brown says, can't afford to pay crews to pick these
leftover vegetables, yet gleaners can collect hundreds of pounds of
perfectly good produce that is then given to the Marin Food Bank or
soup kitchens. Working a typical four-hour shift, a school class of
about 30 youngsters averages 1,000 pounds of vegetables, she
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says proponents of organic gardening like herself are
heartened by the fact that consumers and chefs have become savvy
about the glories of heirloom tomatoes and are willing to
accommodate themselves to the tomatoes' drawbacks _ higher price
and shorter shelf life. These pale by comparison, she says, to the
tomatoes' full and varied shapes, colors and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Aside from the variety, the most important thing to know about a
tomato is whether it was vine-ripened. With heirloom tomatoes
purchased at a farmers' market, that is virtually assured. Often,
vendors will slice a few so you can taste before you buy, and they
certainly know their crops, so you can ask which kinds are sweet or
acidic, juicy or firm.
</P>
<P>
   Stores that carry heirloom tomatoes also show a commitment to
excellence that generally carries over into their staff training.
So there's a good chance that produce clerks at those stores can
answer questions _ or, steer you toward someone who can.
</P>
<P>
   You may like big, hefty fruit for slicing into salads, but don't
overlook the many kinds of cherry tomatoes (Pink Pearl, Red or
Yellow Pear, Yellow Plum, Chadwick Cherry, etc.). They can be just
as enticing in the salad bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you should eat tomatoes as soon as you get them home,
but if you want to enjoy them over the next few days, that's fine
as long as you don't refrigerate them. Refrigeration kills their
delicate flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Marin tomato grower Janet Brown is a purist not only in her
selection of heirloom seeds and her growing practices, but also
when it comes to eating her favorite crop. Her family's preferred
way to eat freshly picked tomatoes is to slice them, then simply
dress with a drizzle of olive oil, a little salt and pepper, some
fresh basil and maybe a bit of fresh mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   The less you fuss with these tomatoes, the better, Brown
believes. She and her son, Bo, also like a super-simple pasta:
While the pasta cooks, chop tomatoes of at least three different
colors. When the pasta is al dente, drain, return it to the pot and
toss in the tomatoes with their juices, a small amount of olive
oil, basil leaves cut into thin ribbons, salt and pepper and some
freshly grated Parmesan, plus a bit of garlic, if you wish. That's
it. The heat of the pasta is enough to lightly ``cook'' the
tomatoes.

perfectly good produce that is then given to the Marin Food Bank or
soup kitchens. Working a typical four-hour shift, a school class of
about 30 youngsters averages 1,000 pounds of vegetables, she
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says proponents of organic gardening like herself are
heartened by the fact that consumers and chefs have become savvy
about the glories of heirloom tomatoes and are willing to
accommodate themselves to the tomatoes' drawbacks _ higher price
and shorter shelf life. These pale by comparison, she says, to the
tomatoes' full and varied shapes, colors and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; Aside from the variety, the most important thing to know about a
tomato is whether it was vine-ripened. With heirloom tomatoes
purchased at a farmers' market, that is virtually assured. Often,
vendors will slice a few so you can taste before you buy, and they
certainly know their crops, so you can ask which kinds are sweet or
acidic, juicy or firm.
</P>
<P>
   Stores that carry heirloom tomatoes also show a commitment to
excellence that generally carries over into their staff training.
So there's a good chance that produce clerks at those stores can
answer questions _ or, steer you toward someone who can.
</P>
<P>
   You may like big, hefty fruit for slicing into salads, but don't
overlook the many kinds of cherry tomatoes (Pink Pearl, Red or
Yellow Pear, Yellow Plum, Chadwick Cherry, etc.). They can be just
as enticing in the salad bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you should eat tomatoes as soon as you get them home,
but if you want to enjoy them over the next few days, that's fine
as long as you don't refrigerate them. Refrigeration kills their
delicate flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Marin tomato grower Janet Brown is a purist not only in her
selection of heirloom seeds and her growing practices, but also
when it comes to eating her favorite crop. Her family's preferred
way to eat freshly picked tomatoes is to slice them, then simply
dress with a drizzle of olive oil, a little salt and pepper, some
fresh basil and maybe a bit of fresh mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   The less you fuss with these tomatoes, the better, Brown
believes. She and her son, Bo, also like a super-simple pasta:
While the pasta cooks, chop tomatoes of at least three different
colors. When the pasta is al dente, drain, return it to the pot and
toss in the tomatoes with their juices, a small amount of olive
oil, basil leaves cut into thin ribbons, salt and pepper and some
freshly grated Parmesan, plus a bit of garlic, if you wish. That's
it. The heat of the pasta is enough to lightly ``cook'' the
tomatoes.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Greek Dips With a Difference   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  One of the best restaurants to open in the last
few years is Kokkari, which is among only a handful of upscale
Greek restaurants in the United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impressive, $5-million interior feels like a grand living
room with a massive fireplace, rustic beam ceiling and a communal
table for large parties.
</P>
<P>
   While the food is light and fresh, chef Jean Alberti uses his
French training to add an edge of refinement to the lusty food.
</P>
<P>
   He grills shrimp and places them over caper mashed potatoes with
a preserved Meyer lemon vinaigrette. Fish is roasted whole and
served with lemon. He fries smelt to a crisp crunch and makes a
wonderful moussaka in a bowl with a thick layer of bechamel as rich
as cream.
</P>
<P>
   One of the classic ways to start is with cucumber/yogurt spread,
called Tzatziki, and roasted eggplant puree, called
Melitzanosalata. Both dishes are available in most Greek places,
but they're particularly good at Kokkari. They're served with warm
triangles of grilled pita.
</P>
<P>
   The yogurt may be made at home, or you can buy commercial yogurt
and let it drain for several hours _ or longer _ to thicken. The
eggplant may be grilled, or roasted directly over a gas or electric
burner on top of the stove.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Kokkari, 200 Jackson St. (at Front Street), San Francisco; &LR; 
 &LR; (415) 981-0983. Lunch weekdays; dinner Monday-Saturday. &LR;

it.
</P>
<P>

 &LR; CUCUMBER SPREAD (TZATZIKI)
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Greek yogurt (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 large cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>

   1/2 tablespoon white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped

<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the yogurt in a sieve lined with a double layer of
cheesecloth. Set the sieve in a bowl and let drain for at least 2
hours. If using regular yogurt, you may need to let it drain for 24
hours in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the cucumbers and trim the ends. Cut them in half
lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Mince the
cucumbers, place in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Set aside
for 1 hour to drain, then pat dry with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the cucumber with the garlic, 3 tablespoons of the olive
oil, the vinegar and dill. Fold into the drained yogurt and season
with salt and pepper. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil
on top.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Greek yogurt is thicker and richer than commercial
yogurt and can be found at some Middle Eastern markets in the Bay

 WINE POTPOURRI: Old Families and New Wines   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Recently, I had the pleasure of tasting two new
Cabernet Sauvignon-based red wines, both products of new branches
of old California wine families.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stylistically, the two wines are as different as chalk and
cheese _ one emphasizing Cabernet Sauvignon and American oak, the
other Merlot and French oak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steven Kent Winery &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Steven Kent Mirassou Sr. parted company with Mirassou
Vineyards, the family-owned winery in San Jose, to strike out on
his own. Within months, Mirassou had teamed up with Ivan Fusey, a
former Hungarian freedom fighter, to form a small wine company
called Ivan Tamas Wines.
</P>
<P>
   With Mirassou's wine industry contacts, the partners were able
to buy select lots of grapes and have the wines made on contract at
Wente Vineyards in the Livermore Valley. Ivan Tamas Wines soon
became a successful California take on the traditional French
 &LR; negociant  &LR; where wine is purchased and sold under different
brands.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the partnership had run its course and Fusey and
Mirassou parted company. A year earlier, Steven Kent Mirassou Jr.
began working for his father at Ivan Tamas. When Fusey moved on,
Steven bought Fusey's shares of the company and became part of a
new Mirassou family wine business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ivan Tamas wines represent quality and good value. Many
of the wines are made from Livermore-grown grapes, while others are
one-of-a-kind white wines, including the Ivan Tamas Trebbiano, made
from one of Italy's most prolific white grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the line solidly established, Steve Mirassou is seeing
a dream come true. Next month, Ivan Tamas Wines will release 1996
Steven Kent Winery Livermore Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, that
Mirassou says is the first of a string of super-premium Cabernets
that will compete with the best of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The new wine is made by Mark Clarin, assistant winemaker at
Wente, with the help of Wente's winemaster, Willie Joslin.
</P>
<P>
   The Steven Kent Winery 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon, $45, comes from
Folkendt Vineyard in Livermore and is aged in American oak barrels
for 12 months _ a true pleasure to smell and drink. The aromatics
are fresh and ripe, with berry and clove accents. It's chewy and
full, with bright fruit flavors, firm tannins and a long promising
finish. Drinking nicely now, this wine will improve with more age.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1,200 cases were produced, and Mirassou says when the
vintage is not up to their standards, the wine will be declassified
and bottled under the SK brand for about half the price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lail Vineyards &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My tasting of Lail Vineyards 1996 Napa Valley J. Daniel Cuvee
came earlier in the year, with Robin Lail, daughter of John Daniel
Jr., manager of the fabled Inglenook Vineyards until 1964. Daniel
and his father, John Daniel Sr., were caretakers of the winemaking
legacy of Gustav Niebaum, founder of Inglenook.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Lail worked for the Robert Mondavi Winery for five years
and then was co-founder of The John Daniel Society, producers of
Dominus and co-founder of Merryvale Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lail and her husband, Jon, have resurrected the family
winemaking tradition with the J. Daniel Cuvee.
</P>
<P>
   Lail Vineyards 1996 J. Daniel Cuvee, $60, is a blend of 73
percent Merlot and 27 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, and has been aged
for 20 months in French oak barrels. The nose is fragrant with
light spicy oak notes mingled with ripe raspberry. The fruit and
oak are well balanced and the wine has good structure and length. A
little tight right now, with bottle age it will expand and develop.
Only 600 cases were produced.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A while back, an incomplete explanation of the winemaking
technique Carbonic Maceration was given in Wine Q &AMP; A. At issue was
the question of whether carbonic maceration occurs without the
presence of yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonic maceration is an enzymatic fermentation that takes
place within the cells (intracellular) of a grape,  &LR; not &LR;  by the use
of yeast. Rarely is there a 100 percent CM fermentation since whole
berries in the fermenter are crushed by the weight of other grapes,
thus initiating extracellular (yeast) fermentation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Corrections &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Potpourri column on the Delta and Chenin Blanc, I
stated that R &AMP; J Cook was an operating winery in the Clarksburg
area of the Delta. R &AMP; J Cook has ceased operations, leaving Bogle
the only operating winery in the Clarksburg area. Further, Bogle
continues to produce a Clarksburg Chenin Blanc for sale only at the
winery.
</P>
<P>
   An item in the August 4 Potpourri implied that R.H. Phillips
Vineyard in Esparto was forced to close down by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the regulatory agency of the federal
government, for ``labeling irregularities.'' While the winery did
close its doors for three days in compliance with an ATF order,
R.H. Phillips is open and doing business as usual.

 &HT;    AS AIRLINES GET TOUGH ON UNRULY PASSENGERS, SOME CALL FOR MORE
PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid growing tension in the once friendlier skies,
airlines are cracking down on unruly passengers, summoning police
to make arrests and banning customers for life from their planes.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing, say some in the travel industry, are sufficient
efforts to resolve these problems before they erupt on board
aircraft and inside airports, where increasingly crowded conditions
have bred frustration and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The number of incidents estimated by the U.S. airline industry
approached 5,000 last year. That's tiny compared to the more than
600 million passengers who fly each year in the United States.
However, the episodes are on the rise, prompting a
``zero-tolerance'' reaction from the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   When a Miami woman traveling on American Airlines last week was
blocked from her seat by a serving cart, she unleashed a
four-letter-laced complaint and was met with state troopers upon
arrival in Boston. She now faces criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the head of Continental Airlines wrote
letters to the major law enforcement officials in New Jersey
demanding full criminal prosecution of a passenger. The customer, a
Virginia man, had wrestled with a gate agent at Newark
International Airport when the passenger was blocked from chasing
his toddler down a jetway. The gate agent was hospitalized for a
week, and the customer faces a possible prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Federal aviation officials now have a policy of rushing to the
scene when an airline complains about customer conduct, so that
they can gather evidence for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, airlines have told passengers not to come back,
ever. ``We've done that,'' said American Airlines spokesman Tim
Smith, who added that such bans are difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   With the get-tough actions, the president of the Association of
Flight Attendants said Tuesday that neither the carriers nor the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have done enough on the
preventive side to show employees how to spot possible explosive
situations and defuse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been enough training on how to manage
confrontation,'' said Pat Friend, who heads the 43,000-member
union. ``The airlines seem unwilling to make the investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Although airlines have begun to offer some supplementary
instruction, she said that few of the major airlines have intensive
courses in this era of over-crowded facilities, crammed airlines
and disgruntled passengers stranded by delayed flights.
</P>
<P>
   She cited Delta Airlines as one exception. The Atlanta-based
carrier has instituted a new course called ``Verbal Judo'' for new
employees. And Chorda Conflict Management of Austin, Texas, said
this week that it has a contract to provide the airlines with more
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants union helped write a FAA advisory that
urges all airlines to provide this kind of training, but Friend
said that a non-binding recommendation is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see it mandatory,'' she said, adding that the FAA
is ``disinclined to issue regulations'' which would be costly for
the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA defended the airlines' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing that there's a real change in how flight
attendants have handled the unruly passenger, especially in
defusing the unruly situation,'' said Kathryn Creeder, a
spokeswoman for the agency that oversees flight safety. She said an
advisory is preferable because it can be issued so much faster than
a regulation.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Four Granola Brands Out-Crunch the Rest   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Grocery stores offer a dizzying variety of
cereals, and perhaps none is as over-represented as granola. You
can buy it with or without nuts, low-fat, full fat, strawberry,
blueberry or peach flavored.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted nine different granolas. We limited the
selection to those with raisins and not labeled as flavored or
low-fat. We also included only those that are sold prepackaged, not
those sold in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   The granola was tasted both with and without milk, and prices
for a 16-ounce package ranged from $1.39 to $4.89.
</P>
<P>
   The panel picked four brands as far and away better than the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Quaker 100% Natural &LR;  (28 ounces, $4.99-$5.79
at many supermarkets).
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists especially liked the texture and appearance. One
commented that it looked like homemade granola. Two others thought
it was too sweet. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Trader Joe's Fruit 'n' Nut &LR;  (16 ounces,
$1.69 at Trader Joe's).
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists described it as well balanced between sweet and
nutty flavors, but another thought that too much cinnamon threw the
cereal out of balance. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oat Cuisine Original  &LR; (14 ounces, $3.49 at Whole Foods) came in
third. Two panelists wanted it to be sweeter. Another described it
as ``too much like seed,'' but still another thought it was ``fun,
with lots of goodies.'' Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cafe Fanny  &LR; (16 ounces, $4.89 at Andronico's) came in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists disliked the amount of sunflower seeds, but others
liked the toasted flavor. One panelist described it as ``fresh,
nutty and well-balanced.'' Three would buy it; two might.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped significantly, but  &UR; 365 Almond Raisin  &LR; (24
ounces, $2.99 at Whole Foods) came in fifth. One panelist called it
``wholesome, but not very complex.'' Another thought it was dry and
boring, but still another liked the crunchy toasted oat flavor. One
would buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Sun Ridge Farms Super Nut Crunch,
Breadshop's Crunchy Oat Bran, and Alvarado St. Bakery, but they
fared too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were Steve Baker, California Culinary Academy intern;
John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin, culinary director,
Center for Culinary Development; Donna Katzl, chef-owner of Cafe
for All Seasons in San Francisco; and Kim Severson, Chronicle staff
writer. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 &HT;    Premiere Technologies evolving with changing business market
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Premiere Technologies is trying to keep pace with
swiftly changing technology and turn itself into an Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company released two products this summer,
both of which mark the evolution of two of its existing
technologies: voice messaging and conference calling.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrate, which enables customers to receive their e-mail
over a cell phone, launched in June on the heels of a massive
advertising campaign that put the product name in newspapers, on
the airwaves and on billboards and the backs of buses. The
$20-per-month service is geared toward business people.
</P>
<P>
   VisionCast, released last week, lets conference call attendees
follow a multimedia slide presentation with sound from anywhere
through a Web site or a company's intranet. The sound comes through
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the Web is part of Premiere's plan to sell new
products to existing customers and to move its products to the Web,
said Randy Salisbury, vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you can give a user a choice of communication tools,
the more you're going to win the ballgame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere, among the first of a wave of Atlanta technology
companies to capture Wall Street's attention when it went public in
1996, also is investing in emerging companies. PTEK Ventures,
Premiere's investment group, bought 2.1 million shares of
Atlanta-based WebMD. The WebMD site, which links doctors, patients
and insurers through the Web, merged with Calif.-based Healtheon in
May. Premiere bought its shares for $4.2 million. Premiere will
have about 4.9 million shares of the new company once the merger is
completed, which is expected by early October. Tuesday's closing
price was $7 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere also has a 14.5 perfect stake in USA.Net, a
Colorado-based seller of e-mail services for consumers and
businesses. Last week, the company withdrew its request for an
initial public offering, citing a stock market that has been rough
on many IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere's investment arm also has a 12.5 percent cut of
VerticalOne, an Atlanta company headed by Gregg Freishtat, a former
Premiere executive. VerticalOne launched a service this month that
lets people access several online accounts through one password.

   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ The worst recorded earthquake
to hit western Turkey killed at least 1,100 people and injured
thousands, destroying buildings and cutting off power and water to
millions living along the heavily populated Bosporus Strait. The
death toll, based on the number of bodies that have reached
hospital morgues, is expected to rise. (Summary from wires.) By

   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Three months after President Boris
Yeltsin fired him as prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov makes a
dramatic reentry into Russian politics, this time as head of a new
electoral alliance poised to assume a commanding lead in the coming
election campaigns. By Celestine Bohlen. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CRIME (Austin, Texas) _ Law and order has always been part
of George W. Bush's politics. Bush ran for governor of Texas in
1994 with a series of grainy black-and-white commercials depicting
a man abducting a woman at gun point in a parking garage and, a
moment later, a police officer draping a blanket over the woman's
body. Charging that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann Richards, was
soft on crime, Bush promised to get tougher with criminals. That
stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the
five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent in
pressing a law-and-order agenda. But how Bush's record on criminal
justice will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested
as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. By Fox
Butterfield. 3,000 words.

<P>
   CHINA-NUKE (Undated) _ Folo and reaction to a recommendation by
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that disciplinary action be taken
against three officials for failing to handle properly the spy
investigation at Los Alamos National Laboratory. By William J.
Broad.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL-RIGHTS-LAW (Undated) _ More than a generation after civil
rights and environmental lawyers took their battles to the courts,
there are now lawyers who say they are following in those footsteps
on behalf of clients with names like Freckles and Rainbow. Fighting
for creatures like performing orangutans and dogs used in
experimentation, the lawyers are creating a new field of animal law
with far more ambitious goals than traditionally weak anti-cruelty
laws. They are filing novel lawsuits and producing new legal
scholarship to try to chip away at a fundamental principle of
American law that animals are property and have no rights. By
William Glaberson. 1,900 words.

UPGRADED QUAKE-MONITORING SYSTEM HADN'T BEEN FINISHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said
the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a
devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago
as a particularly dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
   A team of MIT scientists has been studying the region for a
decade, but said new equipment now being installed to monitor the
fault's motion, which might have provided enough warning to save
some of the estimated 2,000 people who died, was not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
   The quake's center near the town of Izmit was on a stretch of
the North Anatolian fault where the MIT team, working with
scientists from Turkish universities and the nation's science
foundation, ``marked it two years ago as an area to be watched
closely,'' said M. Nafi Toksoz, a Turkish-born MIT professor of
geophysics and seismology who has been studying earthquakes in
Turkey since 1971. ``I have walked just about every foot of that
fault zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in addition to the thousands killed and injured, the
quake did extensive damage to residential and industrial buildings
in Izmit and nearby towns in a major industrial center, and left
more than 100,000 homeless. The damage is expected to run to
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, the MIT-Turkish team has been monitoring
the motion of the ground along both sides of the fault line using
one of the world's most advanced networks of GPS (Global
Positioning System) satellite receivers, which can pinpoint
locations to within one-tenth of an inch. It was readings from
these instruments that showed that ``this was the region where most
of the stresses were accumulating,'' Toksoz said.
</P>
<P>
   But these GPS readings have only been taken once a year; a new
system, using GPS receivers that continuously send position
information, is being installed to replace the decade-old stations.
But only one station is operational.
</P>
<P>
   If a network of the new monitors had been in place, Toksoz said,
``we might have been able to predict the quake and provide some
warning.'' That warning might have been anywhere from a few minutes
to a few hours before the shaking began, he said, providing enough
time for people to leave vulnerable buildings, and perhaps even to
store water and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A real-time warning based on GPS data has never been issued,
Toksoz said. But the only similar networks of monitoring stations
in the world, one in Japan and one in southern California, have
shown distinct signs of some impending earthquakes when scientists
have looked back at the records after a quake occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have detected precursor motions,'' Toksoz said, ``but
not in real time.'' With the added impetus of this quake, he said,
``we'll push on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said earthquakes have been gradually migrating westward along
the North Anatolian fault, as stress builds up in the rock and is
then released. The largest earthquake ever recorded on the fault
was a magnitude 8.2 quake in 1939, which killed 20,000 people, and
there have been six other quakes greater than magnitude 7 since
then, each spanning a 60- to 100-mile segment of the fault.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, with a population of 12
million, lies just 65 miles west of Izmit, and may be the next
place to feel the fault's wrath. The fault line, which closely
resembles California's San Andreas fault, passes just a few miles
from the city. Geologists call both faults right-handed strike-slip
faults.
</P>
<P>
   The Izmit earthquake may actually have increased the stresses on
the Istanbul segment of the fault, increasing the odds of a major
quake there in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much concerned about what might happen in that
area,'' Toksoz said. ``There is the potential for a major
earthquake.'' There is an earthquake building code in place in the
city, he said, ``but unfortunately, implementation is lax.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, a major quake striking the city ``could be
an economic disaster as well as a human disaster.'' Even this
week's quake, though centered 65 miles away, did some property
damage and caused a few deaths in Istanbul. ``But with warning, we
could at least prevent some of the human casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   This quake's magnitude, still being worked out by scientists in
Turkey, the United States and other countries, has been identified
as magnitude 7.5 by the MIT scientists, 6.8 by Turkish scientists,
and 7.8 by the US Geological Survey. Bill Smith, a geophysicist at
the US Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center
in Colorado, explained that such numbers are ``still subject to
change. Some of these magnitude calculations are very labor
intensive. . . . Magnitude is not a precise measurement, it's
really an art.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said scientists use six to eight different magnitude
numbers, computed using the various waves produced by a quake. But,
he said, ``In most cases, the numbers agree better than on this
one.'' It is not yet clear what this unusual disparity might mean,
he said. Toksoz added that readings based on measurements farther
from the site usually give a more accurate representation, because
instruments close to the quake can be ``saturated'' by the
intensity of the shaking and get a lower reading.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded since the main quake,
which occurred at about 3 a.m. local time. The largest of the
aftershocks was magnitude 5.3, just over three hours later, but
activity is continuing and will be closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was the largest recorded in Turkey since 1976.

<P>
   WHITE-RAP-MUSIC (Undated) _ Rap, like most everything from the
blues to alternative rock before it, has been officially embraced
by those who originally ostracized it, avariciously consumed by
those who it was invented in part to declare independence from. Of
course, rap has been integral to pop music and suburban youth
lifestyle since at least 1986, when the first rap album (by the
Beastie Boys) crossed over to number one on the Billboard charts.
But the difference is that back then, when white kids _ the Beastie
Boys, Rick Rubin and hard-rock bands like Faith No More and Anthrax
_ were getting into rap, it was a genre they were only just
discovering. Soon after, rappers began appearing who spoke almost
solely to white concerns, like Me Phi Me and Kid Rock, but they
didn't succeed because then because they were too early (and not
very good either). But today, rap is like the Beatles. It is a
birthright, something many white kids grow up listening to, a
standard by which they calibrate their lifetime notion of pop
music. By Neil Strauss.

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT-BROOKS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ A look at film director,
Albert Brooks, whose latest movie ``The Muse'' will open Friday.
Previous films that he has written, directed and starred in are:
``Real Life,'' ``Modern Romance,'' ``Lost In America,'' ``Defending
Your Life,'' and ``Mother.'' By Margy Rochlin. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TASTE-OF-CHERRY-VIDEO (Undated) _ In the way of most films by
the great Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, ``Taste of Cherry''
approaches large questions through a constrained and fascinating
tale. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN-DANCE (Undated) _ The quirky story-ballet of Rostislav
Zakharov's ``Fountain of Bakhchisarai,'' which, though dating from
1934, had never been seen in New York until the Kirov Ballet
brought it to the Metropolitan Opera House this summer.
``Fountain'' arrived with a strange reputation. Based on a poem by
Pushkin, it dates from the time when Socialist Realism dominated
the arts in Soviet Russia. So it was easy to fear that it would toe
a dull party line. Instead, despite its occasionally trite score by
Boris Asafiev, it proved lively. By Jack Anderson. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LIVE-SAX-ACTS (New York) _ Two bare-chested men, wearing
tartanless kilts and effeminate jazz shoes, dance and play the
saxophone; the same pair, dressed in tuxedos, speak to each other
through bullhorns, slap each other's faces or grab each other's
crotches without flinching, all the while exchanging gentlemanly
chitchat; finally, as two guys in business attire, they wheel and
deal on the telephone. These are just some of the loaded images
that the choreographer-dancer Dan Dorfman and the
composer-performance artist Dan Froot have devised for their three
comic duets, ``Horn'' (1990), ``Bull'' (1994) and ``Job'' (1996),
respectively. The roughly 20-minute pieces have been performed
several times since their premieres as ironic accents in Dorfman's
and Froot's individual performance gigs. Now they will present them
as an evening unto themselves under the title ``Live Sax Acts'' at
Dance Theater Workshop. By William Harrris.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RABIN-RENARDY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Sony Classical's Masterworks
Heritage series was conceived to celebrate the past, but with a new
CD devoted to the violinists Michael Rabin and Ossy Renardy (MHK
60894), the label is also paying homage to two artists cut down in
their prime. Both players were already superior musicians when they
died, and in certain circles their demise still elicits palpable
regret. By David Mermelstein.
</P>
<P>
   SALZBURG-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ Salzburg is in good part a city of
shopkeepers, and streets are jammed with visitors spending money.
How much of a magnet the music festival is, and how much the small,
pretty and reasonably historic city surrounded by Alpine scenery,
is hard to judge. A lot of visitors, and they are 40 percent from
German-speaking places, don't look as if they can afford $400, or
even $100 tickets; residents often appear more prosperous than
their customers. Calls for a small-scale, small-budget, homegrown
festival have been heard, but businessmen are not protesting too
loudly about Gerard Mortier, who has ran the festival since 1991.
By Bernard Holland.

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STILL-LIFE-ART (Amsterdam, Holland) _ A new show at the
Rijksmuseum here, ``Still Life: Paintings From the Netherlands,
1550-1729,'' with 70 carefully selected paintings, many on loan for
the occasion, claims to be the first exhibition to display all the
different types of still life from the golden age of Dutch and
Flemish painting. And it succeeds in demonstrating why they were so
popular in their day and why they are attracting new interest
today. The show runs in the Rijksmuseum's South Wing through Sept.
19 and will then be on display from Oct. 31 to Jan. 9 at the
Cleveland Museum of Art, which has a rich collection of still life
of all periods and is a co-organizer of this exhibition. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-BEHIND-THE-MUSIC (Undated) _ In the two years since it was
first broadcast, ``Behind the Music'' has become the music
industry's closet compulsion. Members of the media elite may not
blithely volunteer the information, but just start asking and
you'll be amazed at how many people admit to watching. ``Behind the
Music'' is ``Entertainment Tonight'' without the heavy cheese
factor, ``Biography'' minus the historical pretensions. It's a
simple, brilliant formula: a one-hour documentary about the ups and
downs of music careers, with subjects from Fleetwood Mac to David
Cassidy to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Madonna. By Karen Schoemer.
</P>
<P>
   TV-STRANGE-JUSTICE (Undated) _ ``Strange Justice,'' a Showtime
drama (which has its premiere next Sunday night) is about the
controversial confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas. Directed by
Ernest Dickerson, who has previously been director of photography
on six Spike Lee films, ``Strange Justice'' stars Delroy Lindo as
Clarence Thomas and Regina Taylor as Anita Hill, the former
colleague who testified that he had sexually harassed her. By
Bernard Weinraub.

   JERUSALEM _ Islamic guerrillas in Lebanon killed two Israeli
soldiers and wounded six others Tuesday, a day after a top
guerrilla commander was killed by a car bomb that the guerrillas
say was the work of Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials in Israel and in Lebanon said that while the
sequence of events raises tensions considerably, the timing was
almost certainly coincidental. They said the deadly clash Tuesday
between Israeli soldiers and guerrillas of Hezbollah, the Party of
God, in the southern strip of Lebanon controlled by Israeli forces,
was unrelated to car bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting, in a no man's land at Wadi Slouki known for such
clashes, was said to have lasted about two hours and was the worst
in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Israeli warplanes raided suspected Hezbollah positions
in Lebanon, damaging a few cars in Shaqra. Israeli ships off the
southern Lebanese coast fired on a dinghy near Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's deaths, 13 Israeli soldiers have been killed in
Lebanon this year. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said during his spring
election campaign that he planned to get Israeli troops out of
Lebanon in the coming year as part of a peace accord that he hopes
to strike with Syria, the effective power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two roadside bombs exploded next to the BMW sedan of
Ali Hassan Deeb, 42, coordinator of operations in the south for the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah military wing; he was killed instantly.
The Israeli news media said he had been on the top of Israel's
``most wanted'' list for carrying out attacks against Israeli
soldiers in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel very rarely accepts or denies responsibility for such
attacks but it was widely assumed here that Israel had carried it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Army Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz implied that the
blame lay elsewhere when he said Tuesday, ``The Israeli army does
not get involved in internal disputes between terrorist
organizations in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, on the other hand, laid the blame directly on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement calling Deeb a ``senior holy warrior,'' Hezbollah
said the bombing confirmed ``beyond a doubt'' that Barak is no
different from his predecessors ``in being aggressive against our
people and peoples of the Arab and Islamic nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tel Aviv on Tuesday, a court convicted a German man of
threatening state security by conspiring with Hezbollah and taking
photographs of public places to help the group choose bombing
targets. The man, Steven Smyrek, 27, a former German soldier who
converted to Islam, was arrested in November 1997 at a Tel Aviv
airport while trying to enter Israel. The court is to sentence him
on Wednesday.

FAULK EXHIBITING LOTS TO THINK ABOUT IN TRAINING CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots would have put themselves in
great position in the AFC East if they had done whatever it took to
obtain Jamal Anderson from the Atlanta Falcons, but twice when they
had the opportunity to trade for him, salary cap restrictions
thwarted them. The division really doesn't have a big, bruising,
dominating back, and the Patriots with Drew Bledsoe and Anderson
could have been devastating.
</P>
<P>
   But now they will go to what they think is a more realistic and
cheaper Plan B. If second-round pick Kevin Faulk had come into camp
and been a complete bust, Terry Allen would be here; but the more
Faulk impresses, the less likely it is that the Patriots will
succumb to Allen's extraordinary salary demands. Tuesday, the team
also signed rookie free agent running back Marques Brigham, who was
a 1,000-yard rusher at Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   While Faulk is not a sure thing, he is as close to one as the
Patriots have. They moved up to the 46th spot in the draft to take
Faulk after losing out on J.J. Johnson of Mississippi State, who
went to the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   After the draft-day deal for Anderson fell through, the Patriots
tried but failed to make a deal with AFC East rival Indianapolis
for Marshall Faulk, who went to the Rams for a second- and
fifth-round pick. But the Patriots maintained their pursuit of a
runner in the family by drafting Marshall's cousin, Kevin, out of
LSU.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may have hit the jackpot, as Faulk is quickly
showing that he may be the answer to Robert Edwards's injury and
Curtis Martin's departure.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibition game _ a 20-14 loss to the Redskins in which
Faulk carried 11 times for 44 yards and caught one pass for 8 yards
_ does not provide sufficient evidence. Yet there is something
about Faulk that everyone seems comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   From Bledsoe saying Faulk is the only back he's seen who hits
the hole first and then makes his cuts, to left guard Max Lane
saying Faulk is quickly developing a relationship with the
offensive line, the reports are good.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk is 5 feet 9 inches, 205 pounds, which makes him solid,
powerful, and shifty. He's technically sound as a runner and
understands the position much more than Edwards, who had been a
running back only two years before being drafted by the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different speed than college,'' said Faulk, who played
in the competitive Southeastern Conference and averaged 127 yards
rushing his junior season. While the Patriots first thought he
would be a returner, it's obvious now that his main competition,
Lamont Warren, is not a feature back but more of a third-down back
who catches the ball very well.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk catches it well, too.
</P>
<P>
   A big question on Faulk is whether he can be durable enough,
with his smaller body, to take 20-25 carries a game over a 16-game
schedule and beyond. The Patriots are quickly thinking the answer
is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had called Faulk's performance one of the highlights of
last Friday's game, but he backed off a bit Tuesday. Instead of
proclaiming Faulk the starter, the coach decided to keep Warren and
Derrick Cullors and possibly Allen, Raymont Harris, or whomever in
the mix by saying, ``I like the first steps. I like what I've seen
from our guys so far. But like we've said all along, it's going to
take a month to figure this out. We're still looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like what Kevin did last week. I thought he showed a
real spark. We'll start him this week and see how he fits in that
role. We're just day-to-day right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Carroll doesn't want to give the job to Faulk
because the Patriots are still negotiating with Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis: Why?
</P>
<P>
   If Faulk and the offensive line can get coordinated quickly,
that would be a far better alternative than bringing in a
broken-down veteran. Running back is the one position where the
rookie is better than the available veteran talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's catching on really quickly,'' said Lane. ``He plays more
like a guy who's 225 pounds. I think already we've seen great
progress with him. We're getting an idea of what he can do and how
he runs it and we're all very comfortable with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk thinks his SEC experience has prepared him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition in the league is fierce, and I think I've been
able to use some of the stuff I learned there,'' said Faulk. ``My
coaches have always emphasized hitting the hole and then making the
cuts, so that's nothing new to me. Here the linebackers are faster
and they can cut through the line of scrimmage faster and be on top
of you before you know it. That's the big thing, the speed of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk is a Walter Payton fan and grew up wanting to run like
him. He also watched Barry Sanders quite a bit. His physical
stature is not much different from Payton or Sanders; he's also
built along the lines of Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he is better prepared to start at his position than
first-round picks Damien Woody at center and Andy Katzenmoyer at
middle linebacker. Certainly there will be times in the next few
weeks when Faulk will not exactly look like the second coming of
his cousin, but the Patriots may have a keeper in him.

QUEEN'S AIDE IN CANADA TAMES ROYAL LION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ No more shall the English lion loll its tongue over
loyal Canadian subjects. The queen's royal representative in Ottawa
has snipped it off.
</P>
<P>
   Governor General Romeo LeBlanc, vice regent of Canada, has also
yanked the claws of the beast decorating his official crest. He's
given poor puss a shave. And even stripped away the snarl. So the
emblematic creature now resembles more a cousin of Disney's ``Lion
King'' than the fierce symbol of Rule Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never liked that lion,'' said LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
   The taming of the lion has irked Canadian monarchists and other
traditionalists. But defenders of the makeover say it was done to
create a royal symbol for Canada that is ``more welcoming, more
engaging, less fierce,'' in the words of Robert D. Watt, who as
chief herald of Canada oversees the nation's symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The redrawing of the governor general's crest was urged by
LeBlanc, who appears to have developed a rather personal antipathy
toward the beast on his official seal _ or at least its long
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few things I'd like to abolish,'' LeBlanc told
Canada's National Post newspaper. ``When I was growing up, one
thing was completely forbidden: Sticking your tongue out at
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the governor general's office have scrambled to put
a sunnier spin on a controversial change that has drawn interest
across Canada and in Britain. The tongue-plucked lion, they say, is
partly intended to give visitors to the welcome center at Rideau
Hall, the royal residence in Ottawa, a warmer, more ``accessible''
image of the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The revision of the royal symbol appears to have caught Canada's
elected officials off guard, and has caused mutterings among ardent
monarchists.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the change was publicly proclaimed by
LeBlanc not in Canada or even Britain, but at last week's World
Acadian Congress in Lafayette, La., a gathering of French Canadians
and bayou Cajuns not known for their warmth of feeling toward
either the British crown or English Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Acadians, often called Cajuns in the United States, are
descendants of French settlers dispossessed and driven from their
Nova Scotia settlements by English soldiers in 1755, one of the
cruelest chapters in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc, himself of Acadian descent, poked a bit of fun at the
lion as a Canadian symbol. ``I've never met one in Canada,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among English Canadians, meanwhile, the redrawn royal lion has
stirred growls of disapproval, if not roars of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country just keeps chip-chip-chipping away at its
traditions, and that's bad,'' said Catherine Craig of Westmount,
Quebec, a posh anglophile enclave in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new lion is cuter, perhaps. But should a national symbol
be cute?'' she asked. ``I don't think so. Would you Americans want
a cute eagle?''
</P>
<P>
   As Canadian national symbols go, the royal lion of the governor
general is not nearly as famous as the red maple leaf or the
beaver. It is seen mostly at high state functions, where the
governor general represents Queen Elizabeth II, who is also monarch
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It adorns the flag flying outside Rideau Hall, where inside the
lion glares from china, cocktail napkins, stationery, and other
household items.
</P>
<P>
   But since May, the lion has started appearing in its revised
form on T-shirts, coffee mugs, pens, and knicknacks sold at the new
visitor's center near the hall. The desire for a more
tourist-friendly lion coincided with LeBlanc's loathing for the
lolling tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The essential design of heraldic symbols is more or less
sacrosanct, said Watt in an interview from Rideau Hall, ``but there
is room for restyling so long as tradition is respected. Neither
tongue nor claws were essential.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries the English lion has served as the symbol of the
world's oldest monarchy. A crowned lion clutching a maple leaf
became the official symbol of Canada's governor general in 1931, by
order of King George V.
</P>
<P>
   The original lion symbol had baleful eyes, bristling whiskers,
protruding claws _ plus that tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition of the tongue goes back to the beginning of
heraldry in the 12th century,'' said Watt. ``One theory is that the
creature in this dramatic pose is showing a readiness to act in
fierce service of its owner.''
</P>
<P>
   The new crest boasts a cleanshaven, declawed lion whose
countenance is far less menacing, though still not exactly
cuddlesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance,'' Watt said. ``We still wanted a
lion, not a pussycat.''

   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ Half the catch of North Pacific whitefish,
used everywhere from British supermarkets to McDonald's deep
fryers, comes from 11 Russian supertrawlers.
</P>
<P>
   So a recent decision by the Russian government to void a
contract with a U.S.-Russian joint fishing venture and transfer its
ships and catch quotas to a debt-ridden Russian rival has roiled
the multibillion-dollar fishing industry and raised the possibility
that foreign creditors will seize the ships.
</P>
<P>
   The June 29 decision, which was suspended by a Moscow court a
few weeks later but which could be reinstated at a court hearing
this week, threatens to ruin the American partners of Super Joint
Stock Co., the Vladivostok fishing concern that had held the
contract now held by Super's Russian competitor, Dalmoreproduct
Holding Co. It could also double the cost of Pacific whitefish if
creditors respond by having the trawlers seized in foreign ports,
as is likely, said Bjorn Hermann, the Seattle-based manager of the
U.S. subsidiary of DNHS Seafoods Group, a Norwegian frozen seafood
supplier that is one of the creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the boats get arrested, it's going to get dirty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The supertrawlers, which are like floating fish processing
factories, were originally among 15 that the Soviet government
ordered a few years before its collapse in 1991. The government had
paid for 20 percent of the $450-million cost of the vessels, which
were eventually built in Spanish shipyards between 1992 and 1995.
The balance was financed by Western loans that the Russian
government is expected to repay.
</P>
<P>
   With the privatization of the national fleet, the ships passed
to a Russian-owned company called Bergen Industries &AMP; Fishing Co.
Bergen leased three ships to Dalmoreproduct and 11 to Super (one
was destroyed in a fire). In May, the Committee for Fishing, the
Russian government agency that regulates commercial fishing,
authorized a joint venture between Super and a Seattle company, Far
East Maritime Services. Under that agreement, Far East Maritime
would sell Super's catch, provision Super's ships and pay an annual
fee to the Russian government to help cover the Soviet debt on the
ships.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 29, the committee abruptly voided the contract and
gave use of the ships and their fishing quotas to Dalmoreproduct.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE OR CONTINUE WITH TRIMS INDICATED BELOW)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Those responsible for the voided contract were reluctant to
discuss their rationale. Officials from the Committee for Fishing
did not return calls seeking comment. Dalmoreproduct president Yury
Didenko broke three appointments with a reporter, sending word
through his secretary that he was unavailable. Oleg Simonov, head
of Bergen Industries, also did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Super officials said privately that the voiding of the contract
might have its roots in increased tension between Super and Bergen
Industries over a $17.1 million fee payment, which Super made last
spring as part of its obligation to help cover the Soviet debt on
the ships. Super contends Bergen Industries used the money for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-foreign sentiment may also have played a role in the voided
contract. In July, Dalmoreproduct's in-house newspaper accused
Super of giving its Seattle partner too much control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the `shadow' management of the company, which
is located in the United States, in Seattle, can lead to big
financial losses and the loss of the ships for Russia,'' the paper
stated.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the captains of the 11 vessels, Divenko of
Dalmoreproduct assured workers that their vacation schedules and
pay rates would remain the same under their new owners. He wrote
that the transfer would ``preserve your vessels for the Russian
Federation, which have been under threat of alienation and resale,
with the goal of saving your workplace and a more effective use of
the fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   The trawler captains were not persuaded. In a letter to the
Russian government signed by all 11 captains, they wrote that their
crews ``were outraged with the news of the intrigues behind the
scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at his anchorage in the Bering Sea, Yury
Krupenya, captain of the Sozidaniye, said the ships had been
sitting idle, waiting for the struggle to play out. Each ship has
11 to 14 foreign experts on board, many of them Americans, who
supervise everything from equipment to fish quality, and Krupenya
said the dispute had left them in a prolonged state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never encountered anything like this before, and they
don't even know how to react,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   American businesses with a vested interest in the outcome are
also worried. Far East Maritime Services has already spent at least
$25 million to supply the trawlers with provisions, said David
Gens, a senior financial official with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Others could also lose. The supertrawlers must be serviced in
foreign ports because of their advanced equipment, and they
annually spend $100 million in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suppliers are not going to take this lying down,'' Gens
said. If the issue is not resolved and the suppliers are not paid,
he said, ``the vessels will be arrested and sold off, and Russia is
going to lose everything.''

PRIMAKOV JOINS ALLIANCE OF YELTSIN RIVALS, ALTERING POLITICAL
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Three months after President Boris Yeltsin fired him as
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov made a dramatic re-entry into
Russian politics Tuesday, this time as head of a new electoral
alliance poised to assume a commanding lead in the coming election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited decision by Primakov, whose popularity has
thrived during a three-monthlong silence, has already recast the
shape of Russian public life as this vast and unwieldy country
prepares for the post-Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   Shown in poll after poll to be Russia's most trusted and
respected politician, Primakov, 69, a former foreign minister,
spymaster and wily survivor from the Soviet era, has been courted
alternately by his old allies in the Communist Party and by a new
center-left coalition put together two weeks ago by Moscow's
ambitious mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, in preparation for December's
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Primakov made his choice, and at a news conference
threw his political weight behind the Luzhkov team by agreeing to
head its list of candidates for the December balloting. With
Primakov now firmly on board, the Fatherland-All Russia coalition
could become an unstoppable force. It is already widely called the
new ``party of power,'' a term used here to describe the party of
the incumbent political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Primakov left unanswered the critical question of which of
the two strong-willed battle-hardened politicians that head the
coalition _ himself and Luzhkov _ will emerge next year as Russia's
leading presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will agree,'' said Primakov with typical ambiguity, adding
later that his mind was not made up about a presidential bid in
2000, when Yeltsin has promised to step down at the end of his
second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you without bending the truth that so far I have
not made any decisions on that score,'' he said. ``Much will depend
on how much trust I will have from the population, and I lay great
store in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's alliance with Luzhkov may only be temporary, designed
to last long enough to push their joint coalition into a dominant
position in the next parliament. The two could pair up for the
presidential elections, with Primakov, the more senior figure with
more national experience, running for president, and Luzhkov
waiting his turn to become either prime minister or to fill a newly
proposed post of vice president _ although such an arrangement
strikes some experts as improbable.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in Luzhkov's nature to step back,'' said Otto
Latsis, a noted political commentator. ``But at the end of the day,
they have now agreed on a coalition for parliamentary elections,
and they can put off the decision on the presidential elections.
These are ten months away, and that is a long time in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   With his stolid appearance and his experience as a Middle East
expert and Cold War adviser to Soviet leaders, Primakov comes
across as an elder statesman, an image that has broad appeal in
Russia today, after a decade of political turbulence and discord.
His guarded manner, and flashes of sly wit, contrast sharply with
Yeltsin's belligerent and bombastic populism, which has left people
bitter and exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who became prime minister last September in the wake
of a devastating financial crisis, was credited with restoring
political calm, largely by appeasing Yeltsin's Communist
opposition, and with arresting the economy's downward spiral.
Critics argue that Primakov's government did little more than mark
time. Supporters say that the country needed the breathing spell he
provided.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even after he left office and dropped from public sight,
Primakov's popularity held steady. His popularity rating is not
high _ 26 percent of Russians polled last July said they trusted
him _ but against the backdrop of Russia's often sordid political
scene, they are higher than anyone else's. Luzhkov, for instance,
is trusted by 17 percent, according to a poll of 2,407 Russians
taken by the All Russian Public Opinion Center, while Sergei
Stepashin, the man who succeeded Primakov as prime minister, is
trusted by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin on Tuesday continued talks with leaders of Russia's
cluster of center-right parties, which include the once-mighty Our
Home is Russia, headed by another former prime minister, Victor
Chernomyrdin, and parties headed by the economic reformers once
favored by Yeltsin and widely disliked by the public.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they unite, most political experts agree that while
they will probably get the 5 percent of the popular vote required
to qualify as a parliamentary faction, they will not be able to run
ahead of Fatherland-All Russia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared statement, Primakov on Tuesday stressed that he
is not joining any party, or movement, but has agreed to head the
list of candidates put forward by the new Fatherland-All Russia
coalition for elections to the 450-seat Duma, or lower house, to be
held on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the coalition as an ``association of healthy centrist
forces, open to all who wish Russia good,'' Primakov said his goal
is to turn politics away from a debilitating cycle of intrigue,
blackmail and back-biting, towards a more constructive debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must move toward consensus in society,'' he said. ``It is
only through consensus that we can achieve stability and rescue our
country from its troubles, its people from the poverty they do not
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Walking with a cane that he has used since he underwent a back
operation in Switzerland last spring, Primakov appeared Tuesday
together with his new political allies who, besides Luzhkov,
include the governor of St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest
city, Vladimir Yakovlev; Mintimer Shaimiyev, governor of oil-rich
Tatarstan, and Mikhail I. Lapshin, a leader in the Agrarian Party,
which has traditionally been aligned with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   This group represents the backbone of the new Fatherland-All
Russia coalition whose emergence two weeks ago came as a direct
slap to Yeltsin, who has tried hard in recent months to disrupt and
derail Luzhkov's national political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians and observers now agree that Yeltsin's firing
last week of Stepashin, three months after he became prime
minister, was a belated attempt to regroup his own political forces
and stop the momentum building up behind the Luzhkov team.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin named his new prime minister, Vladimir Putin, a curt
former intelligence chief, as his political heir, indicating that
he is not ready to relinquish the Kremlin without fighting for a
say over who succeeds him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In another signal of the ongoing struggle, Yeltsin on Tuesday
dismissed a minister of justice whom he recently chided publicly
for not unearthing illegal activities by the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from its early lineup, the new coalition looks like a
regrouping of political figures who began their careers in the old
Soviet Communist Party and have managed to amass new power during
the Yeltsin era. They also represent the growing influence of
Russia's regions in the reopened battle for control of the central
government in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Setting his sights on the next parliament, Primakov on Tuesday
outlined specific goals for his new alliance, which would include
making changes to the Russian constitution and the structure of
Russia's presidential system.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed reinstituting the position of vice-president _ a
post abolished in the 1993 constitution after Yeltsin's first vice
president tried to lead a mutiny against him _ and a special law
guaranteeing ``full security and a worthy life'' to presidents
after they leave office.
</P>
<P>
   This last pledge was an obvious olive branch to Yeltsin and his
presidential administration, whose increasingly desperate battle to
influence the choice of a presidential successor is widely thought
to be driven by concern for their own future.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin in recent months has fought hard to keep a series of
corruption investigations from focusing on members of the
``family,'' as Yeltsin's inner circle is known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything possible to make sure that this bloc is
not `against' but `for,''' Primakov said. ``Enough of strife,
attacks on each other, threats to ban parties which are against
somebody's liking, enough of mud-slinging.''

OFF-THE-PODIUM INTRIGUE SURROUNDS TWO LEADING JOBS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The backstage scuffling between eminent conductors looking for
eminent jobs (and jobs looking for them) keeps the music world
happy with gossip. Equally juicy are the speculations about the
people who actually run big musical organizations.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is Gerard Mortier, the wry, outwardly diffident
Belgian director of the Salzburg Festival, who has kept the Herbert
von Karajan legacy at bay since 1991, annoying in the process
Viennese bureaucrats and other conservatives. Mortier's contract
expires in 2001, and already a crowd is gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that the Karajan faction has winced patiently over
operas by Ligeti, Berio and Messiaen and is ready to retake lost
territory: goodbye to foreign orchestras with strange repertory;
hello to the benign stranglehold of the Vienna Philharmonic and its
beloved repertory. Less Boulez and Berio, more Mozart and Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies remain a presence at Salzburg, with major
presentations this summer by Deutsche Grammophon and Teldec. (Don't
think those CD advertisements in shop windows aren't paid for and
competed over.) Still, the prior and all-engulfing electronic
conglomerate, with Karajan as chief executive officer of classical
music, has receded under Mortier.
</P>
<P>
   Salzburg is in good part a city of shopkeepers, and streets are
jammed with visitors spending money. How much of a magnet the
festival is, and how much the small, pretty and reasonably historic
city surrounded by Alpine scenery, is hard to judge.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of visitors, and they are 40 percent from German-speaking
places, don't look as if they can afford $400, or even $100,
tickets; residents often appear more prosperous than their
customers. Calls for a small-scale, small-budget, homegrown
festival have been heard, but businessmen are not protesting too
loudly about Mortier's adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Those protests are going on elsewhere; and given the intrigue
and back-stabbing indigenous to European arts organizations, do not
think that Mortier's administration has offered a solid front in
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in any case, a man who relishes a fight and thrives in
his quiet way on enemies. Mortier not only hatches interesting art;
he is also busy raising money American-style, a lot of it indeed
American. His contract is strong, and it has given him the
necessary cards to play.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that anyone else could maintain his level
of innovation, or that the Austrian government would convey on a
successor the powers he now holds.
</P>
<P>
   What will Mortier do after 2001? There has been speculation
about professorships or even an entry into Belgian politics. One
venerable American opera house in need of leadership reportedly
dispatched two board members to a major European city recently in
order to discuss the job with him.
</P>
<P>
   These men, the story goes, had never heard of Gerard Mortier
prior to their assignment and had no idea what the Salzburg
Festival was, indeed confusing Salzburg with Strasbourg. They
politely asked Mortier for his resume, whereupon Mortier asked them
for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also talk that Mortier and his bureaucrats might
actually decide that they need each other, and that he will stay on
in Salzburg. Where else, at any rate, could he find such delicious
enemies?
</P>
<P>
   The other principal entry in the raised-eyebrow column comes
from Southern California, where Willem Wijnbergen, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's shiny new managing director from the Netherlands,
has abruptly resigned. Or was he fired?
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are dealing with that one because the answer determines
whether he will be paid after September, or whether his contract,
set to run until next June, is called off.
</P>
<P>
   No one who knows will say what the provocations were. What is
sure is that Wijnbergen sent the Philharmonic board a letter in
mid-June listing a number of concerns and problems having to do
with his duties, and citing his contract's ``Notice of Termination
for Good Reason'' as an apparent spur to action.
</P>
<P>
   The implied threat seems to have backfired (are Richie Phillips
and the baseball umpires listening?). The board took his letter as
a resignation, and so things seem to stand this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wijnbergen, only 40, has pockets-ful of credentials. He is a
trained musician and a seasoned corporate executive who holds an
MBA from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He put new fiscal
life into the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and came
to Los Angeles in the wake of Ernest Fleischmann's colorful and
effective 28-year tenure as managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found their new man arrogant, others agreeable. Given
the business experience, however, some of his moves have been
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   First was the major uprooting of established personnel and a
wave of new hirings. Good executives rarely go into a new job and
clean house. Later, perhaps; demoralized, otherwise, are the people
you keep. Second was the reported seven-figure renovation of
executive offices, this in a time when symphony orchestras preach
parsimony.
</P>
<P>
   Other things did not look good. Insisting on paid tickets and
reversing an old policy of artfully papered houses on
less-than-sellout evenings, Wijnbergen found himself with
embarrassing holes in the audience. Then there is the old business
adage: never give an ultimatum unless you are sure of the outcome.
Evidently, he did and he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The result is more embarrassing holes. Poised finally to begin
construction of Frank Gehry's Disney Hall, facing a sabbatical by
its imaginative music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen, not to mention
an expiring orchestra contract, and considerably dependent on
income generated by the Hollywood Bowl, whose longtime director
Wijnbergen fired, the Los Angeles Philharmonic finds itself at the
dreaded excavation phase of any renovation. The workers have ripped
up the old and then gone away.

JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER SHOWS THE STRENGTH BEHIND THE WARM IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi began his thoroughly
unexpected rise in the polls a few months back, the growing support
for him had scant relation to his government's policies.
</P>
<P>
   It stemmed instead, analysts said, from the inexplicably
reassuring feeling he had sent to a nation stuck deep in economic
doldrums, coming across as its warm and fuzzy, even slightly
absent-minded uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls have consistently shown that Obuchi's most winning
features are his seeming lack of arrogance, his personal modesty
and his self-deprecating humor.
</P>
<P>
   So scarcely anyone sensed what was coming this month when Obuchi
cobbled together the largest governing coalition that Japan has
seen in decades and pushed through parliament a raft of measures
far more ambitious than any other prime minister has managed in the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   These included the adoption of the Japanese flag and imperial
anthem as official symbols of the nation _ something several
previous governments had failed to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Given his early image as an unassuming politician with perhaps a
hint of the pushover in him, what is perhaps most surprising is the
merciless, if quiet, use of hardball tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask Obuchi a question about the economic system or his
vision of the country and its history, he may be unable to give you
much of an answer,'' said one schoolmate of the prime minister and
former senior official. ``But he has a very shrewd sense of who is
with him, what those people want and how their support can be
bought. In other words, he is a born politician, almost in the mold
of a Lyndon Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   These political abilities shone last week when Obuchi forced the
junior members of his governing coalition, the Liberal Party, to
back down from their threat to pull out of the alliance unless the
prime minister's Liberal Democratic Party supported a measure to
reduce the number of seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY MAY END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The Liberals joined the government last year after extracting
promises from Obuchi on a platform for the government. Among the
agreed-upon items was the pursuit of a 25 percent reduction in the
number of seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the Liberal Party's bid to reduce the membership was
part of its overall push for smaller government. But few
commentators missed the fact that the reduction, which would have
been concentrated in seats chosen through proportional
representation, would have strengthened the Liberals in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the pro-business Liberal Party's alliance with the
Liberal Democratic Party drew support for Obuchi's Cabinet from
business and gave Japanese voters the impression of a new dynamism
in the government. What it lacked, however, was the votes needed to
pass constitutional changes and authorize referendums.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of majority will be needed to pass a contentious
amendment early next year that will allow Japan to play a larger
role in cooperating militarily with Washington and acting in its
own self-defense, after decades of pacifism enforced by a postwar
constitution dictated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Obuchi recently turned to another opposition group,
the New Komeito Party, to form an even bigger alliance. The problem
with the larger new alliance, however, was that New Komeito, a
Buddhist-backed party whose parliamentary strength is substantially
greater than the Liberals, wins many of its seats through the
proportional representation system and has adamantly rejected any
reduction in its number.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the Liberal Party and a longtime
political heavyweight, threatened to walk out of the coalition by
the end of the week unless the reduction in seats was approved.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Obuchi prevailed by sharply turning up the
pressure on Ozawa, letting it be known to Liberal Party members how
difficult the next elections would be for them if both the Liberal
Democrats and New Komeito focused on the relatively small number of
seats they held. Then, by making a promise to take up the seemingly
insoluble issue of the reduction in proportional seats in the next
legislative session, he offered the Liberal Party a face-saving way
to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Liberal Party's declarations, policies had little
to do with how politics played themselves out. What counted was
that by sheer strength of numbers, Obuchi had maneuvered a smaller
party into accepting his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japanese politics, there is no thought given to attracting
people's support through policies; numbers always come first,''
said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor of politics at Niigata University
of International and Information Studies. ``Part of Obuchi's
strength is knowing the importance of numbers. For him, it is
second nature to calculate.''

PRIMAKOV-LUZHKOV TEAM SEEN AS POWERFUL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's most popular politician,
looks like Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   He also has zero charisma, and his greatest accomplishment in an
eight-month stint as prime minister was that, unlike his
predecessors, he didn't do any damage to Russia's already battered
economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Primakov's announcement Tuesday that he was joining
forces with Russia's second most popular politician, Moscow's
powerful Mayor Yury Luzhkov, could transform this country's
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The political dream team of Primakov-Luzhkov has Moscow pundits
buzzing _ and with good reason. If this alliance holds, it could
dominate parliamentary elections scheduled here for December, and
catapult one of these two ambitious men into the Kremlin when
President Boris N. Yeltsin's term expires next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov had been courting Primakov for months, publicly offering
the 69-year-old former prime minister the top spot in an electoral
bloc he recently formed with Russia's powerful regional leaders.
But Primakov, a former spymaster and seasoned Soviet bureaucrat,
maintained a stony public silence _ until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable why Luzhkov wanted to team up with
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that he is far and away Russia's most
trusted politician with a 26 percent rating _ low by American
standards, but positively stratospheric for this country's cynical
and battered electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more importantly, the polls also show that Primakov
could single-handedly change the results of Russia's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll shows that if Primakov stayed on the sidelines,
the Communist Party would dominate those elections, taking 34
percent of the vote. Luzhkov's party _ which has the awkward name
Fatherland-All Russia _ would come in second with 16 percent. But
with Primakov joining Luzhkov, his Fatherland-All Russia leapfrogs
into first place with 28 percent, leaving the Communists in second
with 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov wanted the alliance so badly that he even said he would
give up his much publicized presidential ambitions to support the
older and more popular Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   A Primakov-Luzhkov ticket clearly has the Kremlin _ which sees
the two as mortal enemies _ worried. Pavel Krasheninnikov, who was
fired Tuesday as Yeltsin's Justice Minister, said that the
president's inner circle tried pressuring him into blocking the
registration of Luzhkov's party to keep it out of December's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   So just what is it that makes Primakov, who often reads his
speeches from index cards, such a political heartthrob?
</P>
<P>
   The weekly newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti wrote recently that
Primakov's ``true strength and potential are not in his programs or
in his political manifesto,'' but in his image _ something the
paper called ``the Primakov phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, this phenommenon is a mix of positive
associations. Primakov is seen as a patriot, but not a dangerous
nationalist; people don't associate him with the rampant corruption
that plagued other governments; and his modest personal style
contrasts sharply with the arrogance of the young Western-oriented
economists who dominated earlier Cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov emerged as a compromise prime minister in the chaos
that followed Russia's debt default and ruble devaluation last
August, only to be abruptly fired by Yeltsin eight months later.
During his eight months in office, he strived to be a consensus
builder, winning praise for guiding Russia out of last year's
financial meltdown without major catastrophe. His cautious style,
and his support for some state regulation of the economy, struck a
chord with Russians weary from a decade of wrenching social and
economic change. After his sacking, his popularity only increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov came in with a government that was boring _ and this
was good,'' said Moscow-based political analyst Boris Kagarlitsky.
``After everything that has happened in our country, as soon as a
government promises that exciting things are on the horizon,
everybody is certain that life will again become worse.'' Nostalgia
also accounts for some of Primakov's appeal, according to
Kagarlitsky, who adds that ``Primakov reminds people of what they
liked about the Soviet Union, although he is not seen as
dangerous.''

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Five weeks after signing a peace treaty
to end a catastrophic eight-year civil war, the leader of the
rebellion in Sierra Leone has yet to return.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to be concerned over his safety, his accommodations
here in the capital and, perhaps most significantly, his travel
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A government position at the vice-presidential level awaits the
rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, who has been holed up since May in a
five-star hotel in the nearby West African nation of Togo.
</P>
<P>
   But Sankoh and his men want to return to Sierra Leone by
visiting their stronghold in the eastern city of Kailahun before
traveling down to Freetown in a convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else _ the government, the United Nations, Western
diplomats, even Sankoh's main ally _ is urging him to fly directly
to Freetown. A triumphant journey by convoy, laden with powerful
symbolism, would risk destabilizing an already fragile peace
accord, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the accord remains the best hope for this small,
diamond-rich country, whose war left the government dependent on
outsiders for its survival and created lasting images of ordinary
citizens with their hands hacked off by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, a deal drafted by desperate men, grants the
rebels power in the government and amnesty for war crimes, both for
the sake of peace.
</P>
<P>
   A three-month cease-fire has held so far despite some
skirmishes, and envoys of Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front have
professed their commitment to the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to lay down our arms and get into the
political arena so that we can let the people decide their future
leaders,'' said Solomon Rogers, a rebel leader, referring to the
agreement. It calls for the Revolutionary United Front to be
converted into a political party and to present a candidate in the
2001 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, chairman of the People's Peace Council _ until recently
called the People's War Council _ stayed with his fellow envoys at
a guest house guarded by a dozen government soldiers. His group is
part of Sankoh's organization.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate obstacles to peace are the countless rebels
and other guerrillas hiding in the bush. Their presence and
unpredictable behavior have made it impossible to obtain a full
picture of the destruction nationwide. A group led by U.N.
officials was recently held hostage for about a week by disgruntled
fighters just north of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   So far, international relief agencies have been unable to
venture into rebel-held territory, said Sarah Laughton, an official
here with the World Food Program, which is supplying resources to
Freetown and two cities east of here, Bo and Kenema.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the World Food Program and other relief agencies
fear that a delay in providing food to all regions, especially
those held by the rebels, may create unrest in those areas, Ms.
Laughton said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement, the rebels and their allies must
undergo what has become known as ``D.D.R.'' _ disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration. No one believes that Sierra Leone
will see lasting peace unless the process proves successful.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation, which has received enough financing from the
European Union and the World Bank and was supposed to begin on
Wednesday, is already behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies mainly in the delicate matter of who will
disarm the rebels, said Francis G. Okelo, the U.N.
secretary-general's special representative to Sierra Leone. One
option would leave the task to a peacekeeping force from the
Nigerian-led West African organization that has been fighting the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative would consist of using those troops and more
than 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers. Rebels are considered more likely to
cooperate if the United Nations takes part, but it is unclear
whether the political backing for that kind of commitment exists in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   For disarmament to work, the rebels must be convinced that peace
is more attractive than continuing war, an argument made more
difficult by the fact that the rebels now control the country's
diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace deal, Sankoh _ a prisoner for the last two years
whose death sentence was lifted recently as part of the peace
agreement _ is to become chairman of a new commission for the
management of strategic resources, national reconstruction and
development. His top commanders are to fill four Cabinet positions.
He was released from prison to go to Togo for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The rank-and-file rebels, many of them illiterate child
soldiers, are to receive about $150 each on entering disarmament
camps, where they are to receive some form of vocational training.
They have been promised another $150 each on leaving the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger that the public will view the rebels as
receiving special treatment,'' Okelo said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a danger because Freetown is still recovering from a
fierce January attack that left thousands dead, houses burned and
countless maimed or raped.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents here seem willing to stomach an agreement that
shares power with the rebels and gives them amnesty for the sake of
peace. But beneath that acceptance is a seething anger at the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's crazy,'' Alimamy Koroma, general-secretary of the Council
of Churches in Sierra Leone, said of Sankoh. ``He has become even
more crazy because the government has been very weak. Now he sees
himself as a victor. All he wants is power. He tells you he is
fighting against corruption. It hurts all of us that someone of the
low caliber of a Foday Sankoh could destabilize the entire Sierra
Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Sankoh, a cashiered army corporal and former commercial
photographer, began an insurrection with a group of rebels trained
in Libya, with help from Liberia and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mission was to destroy a corrupt system under which
the government and foreigners monopolized the country's diamonds,
leaving Sierra Leone one of the poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sankoh signed a peace agreement with Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah, who had been chosen president in what were considered fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the military staged a coup in 1997 and invited the rebels to
join them in Freetown in a partnership that lasted until February
1998, when the West African military force helped restore Kabbah to
power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the rebels waged a campaign of terror against
ordinary citizens, raping, killing and mutilating noncombatants.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's group also used child soldiers, often enlisting them by
force and plying them with drugs to force them to commit atrocities
_ practices first used in West Africa by President Charles Taylor
of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor long denied helping Sankoh's group, but the United States
and other governments accused him this year of being Sankoh's chief
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   They applied increasing pressure on Taylor to urge Sankoh toward
peace and dangled the carrot of a resumption in international aid
to Liberia, officials involved in the recent peace negotiations
said. Eventually, Taylor cooperated, affixing his signature to the
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is also trying to persuade Sankoh to abandon, for the
sake of political decorum, his idea of arriving in Freetown in a
victorious convoy, said a Western diplomat. But whether the
mercurial Sankoh, who recently visited Col. Moammar Gadhafi in
Libya, will listen to Taylor remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sankoh's envoy, Rogers, said a convoy was a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, it would be a victory march,'' Rogers said, adding
that Sankoh would return to Sierra Leone this week. ``He left
Freetown a prisoner, and he is coming back here as a free citizen
of Sierra Leone.''

 &HT;    Canneries setting records as gardeners stock up on food _ just
in case
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAWSONVILLE, Ga. _ Suzanne Franklin scoops up some home-grown
jalapeno peppers from a big bowl and begins fearlessly slicing away
bare-handed, even though the more experienced at the Dawson County
Cannery advise gloves to protect her skin.
</P>
<P>
   She mixes the hot peppers with spices, onions and tomatoes also
from her garden and pours the salsa into quart jars. Then the jars
go into giant barrel-shaped metal cages and are dropped into a
massive pressure canner that can process 84 jars or 125 tin cans at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The salsa is just the latest of Franklin's projects at the
cannery, a do-it-yourself-but-with-help facility she discovered
earlier this summer near her 15-acre home. She brings her own
produce, jars and recipes to this small warehouse, and for a small
fee, she can preserve several quarts of food in a fraction of the
time it would take at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done a little canning in the past, but this year I have
a much larger garden because I had Y2K in mind,'' said Franklin,
44, who's canned everything from tomatoes to corn at the cannery.
``The girls at the bank and my neighbors all tease me and say they
know where they are going if there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With folks like Franklin streaming in, the Dawson County
Cannery, along with others across the state, have been going full
steam this summer. Directors say one of the key reasons is concern
over possible malfunctions of utility or food services or cash
shortages at the turn of year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dawsonville facility has processed 14,500 quarts of food in
its seven-week summer season, compared to 5,560 quarts last summer.
The cannery in Tift County processed 19,000 quarts, compared to
11,000 last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the phones at county Extension offices have been ringing off
the hook with calls about home canning, said Elizabeth Andress, a
Cooperative Extension Service food safety specialist at the
University of Georgia, which coordinates the state's Extension
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done any formal survey, but we can pretty much tell
that a lot of the increase in interest is Y2K concern,'' said
Andress. ``In particular, folks are interested in canning because
they are worried they won't have electricity to run a freezer.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest tends to be more in suburban and rural areas than
in the heart of the city. County Extension specialists in Fulton
and DeKalb counties say they've had more calls about storing water
than canning food.
</P>
<P>
   The family and consumer science agents in the Gwinnett and Cobb
County Extension offices say they've had Y2K calls from folks
wanting to know how to can everything from hot dogs to cake mixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems some people are really planning ahead, and they want
gourmet meals if the power really goes out, not just a few
emergency supplies,'' said Marilyn Zember, family and consumer
sciences specialist in the Cobb County Extension office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most experts advise having an emergency food supply
that would suffice for three days to one week. And that's not just
for Y2K, but for all kinds of disasters that could knock out power
or otherwise affect the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Johnson, the family and consumer sciences agent for Carroll,
Haralson and Polk counties, said she's had ``10 times as many calls
as I had last year,'' and she definitely attributes the increase to
Y2K concern. Many callers are first-timers who've ``climbed into
the attic and pulled out their grandmother's canner.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she's concerned that folks are trying to rely on
their memories of the process rather than following the latest
guidelines. ``They are also trying to can a lot of very difficult
foods, like meat and poultry or combined products like beef stew,''
she said. ``With all the guessing going on this summer in terms of
food safety, I'm very concerned what this winter could bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Food that is not canned properly can spoil and cause serious
illnesses like botulism. Johnson strongly urges those who are
delving into home canning for the first time _ or for the first
time in a long time _ to contact their county Extension office for
the latest guidelines and recipes that have been tested.
</P>
<P>
   There are many rules to canning. Low-acid foods and high-acid
foods must be treated differently. Some things require boiling in a
water bath; others require pressure canning. And some things
traditionally canned, like squash, are no longer recommended
because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Liles, 50, tried her hand at canning for the first time in
years after moving from Douglasville to a 30-acre farm in Polk
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever really had a big garden, so I
went all out and bought a pressure canner and all the equipment,''
she said. ``I got a quick education at the county Extension
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Liles said her interest is ``part a change of lifestyle and part
Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for Christy Mitchell, whose family recently
traded a home in Alpharetta for more than 140 acres and a slower
lifestyle near Dawsonville. She was a newcomer to the cannery there
this summer, but quickly became a regular, visiting once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've canned tomatoes, beef tips, blueberries and probably 50
quarts of green beans,'' said Mitchell. ``We are not loo-loo about
Y2K concerns, but that's one reason I put up some meat. I wanted to
have foods for an entire meal should there be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Stowers, director of the Dawsonville cannery, said a good
garden year also contributed to the facility's increase in
business, but he's seen a number of new customers like Franklin and
Mitchell in the cannery. By the end of the fall season, during
which the cannery operates two days a week, he expects to see the
total reach 20,000 quarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mornings, we had as many as 30 customers all working at
once,'' said Stowers. The Dawson County cannery is one of about 20
such facilities operated by agriculture departments of local
schools around the state. There are also a handful of private
canneries operated by churches or farmers' markets around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Canneries provide huge, clean work tables for cleaning, cutting
and chopping food, which is then run through a blanching system.
Customers then put the foods into jars they've provided or into tin
cans purchased at the cannery. Tin cans are run through a long
tunnel for more sterilizing and then lids are clamped down.
</P>
<P>
   Cannery operators put the jars and cans into large metal baskets
and lower them into huge pressure canners. The operators monitor
the canners for proper times and temperatures, which vary depending
on the food product.
</P>
<P>
   Customers provide the food, the jars and some of the work,
keeping the cost of using the cannery down to 28 cents a quart jar.
Those preferring tin cans pay 47 to 53 cents a quart, cans
included. ``We can process 800 quarts a day, which would take 150
hours at home,'' said Stowers.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience has always attracted some customers, like Maude
and Warren Harben, who have been going to the Dawson County Cannery
since it opened 14 years ago. Each year, they ``put up'' tomatoes,
green beans, Brunswick stew and a variety of other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so busy here this year, and I know some of it is
Y2K,'' said Maude Harben. ``But I believe this will get people
interested in putting up food, and we'll see many of them back next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cook, director of the cannery in Tift County, said she
believes newcomers to the process will be back. Her first major
hike in business came last year after she spoke to a group of folks
concerned about Y2K. She helped them process 12,000 quarts last
fall and saw many of them back this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of folks, once they eat some of the stuff
they've put up for Y2K, they'll be back,'' said Cook. ``I've
already had one woman tell me her `Y2K' came when her husband lost
his job. She was proud she had food on hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Franklin said her efforts at the Dawsonville cannery
this summer have definitely been a ``no-lose'' endeavor. If there
is no need at the beginning of the year, she'll still have some
delicious food to enjoy and share.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll definitely be back here next year,'' said Franklin as
she finished chopping her peppers at the cannery. ``This has been
just too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in canning, the best place to start is
with your county Extension Service office.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Internet access, you can directions and recipes at
www.fcs.uga.edu/outreach/coopex. You'll be given a menu of choices.
Choose ``food safety and preservation,'' then ``publications and
resources,'' and then ``Food Preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia, which operates the statewide
Extension Service, has recently updated its publication ``So Easy
To Preserve.'' It's available for order through the county
Extension offices.

SWISSAIR CRASH SUIT NAMES DUPONT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a week after Canadian investigators pinpointed
metalized Mylar insulation as feeding the fire that brought down
Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia, the first suit naming chemical
giant DuPont, the manufacturer of Mylar, as a defendant was filed
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The wrongful death suit was filed Monday in federal court on
behalf of the relatives of seven Europeans who were among the 229
killed when the MD-11 crashed into the Atlantic while trying to
make an emergency landing. It charges that DuPont, along with the
airplane manufacturer and two smaller firms that made modifications
to the entertainment system, a likely ignition source for the fire,
were responsible for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The filing comes after the Aug. 11 announcements by Canadians
that the insulation fed the fire and an order on the same day by
the US Federal Aviation Administration giving airlines four years
to remove all metalized Mylar insulation from the 699 airplanes in
the US fleet that currently have the material. The planes _ DC-10s,
MD-11s, MD-80s, MD-88s, and MD-90s _ were all manufactured by
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is now owned by Boeing Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 47 other wrongful death cases filed in
the wake of the Sept. 2, 1998 crash, but this is the first to
include DuPont as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intentionally delayed filing until the investigation
progressed enough that we had a clear sense of what caused the
crash,'' said attorney David Rapoport.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada called for
the removal of metalized Mylar from planes because it noted ``there
are indications that a significant source of the combustible
materials that sustained the fire was thermal acoustical insulation
blanket material.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA agreed and issued an order _ which will likely take
effect later this year after a comment period _ calling for the
removal of all such insulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely troubled by the four-year timetable,'' said
Rapoport. ``As a consumer, knowing that metalized Mylar is
implicated in the spread of fire _ and the spread is probably the
most dangerous thing that happened on Flight 111 _ I am appalled
that 3 1/2 years from now I could get on a plane that has metalized
Mylar acoustic thermal insulation blankets in the wall and not know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the plane, an MD-11, had design flaws and
that DuPont knew from earlier on-board fires that Mylar, the film
used to encapsulate the insulation, was a danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant DuPont knew before the crash of Swissair Flight
111 that metalized Mylar film ignited or otherwise dramatically
increased the spread of on-board aircraft fires in at least three
different incidents, one of which preceded the Swissair crash by
almost five years,'' the suit states. ``The Mylar insulation on the
subject aircraft served as a fuel which rapidly spread the on-board
fire and directly contributed to cause the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   A DuPont spokeswoman said the company does not make or sell
insulation blankets, but is a raw materials supplier to insulation
manufacturers. She added that the company is reviewing the
complaint and would have no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   No date for a hearing has been set in federal court.

SCHOOL SMOKING (Phoenix) - A new Arizona law prohibits possession

FOREST (Phoenix) - Environmentalists are calling for a halt to the

state's dwindling number of large, old ponderosa pines. This comes
on the heels of a successful appeal of a timber-cutting program
planned near Flagstaff, and it comes as a federal public employees

 &HT;    Bush coming to Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ohio is suffering through a drought this
summer, but the state's Republicans will again shower campaign
money on Texas Gov. George W. Bush when he begins a two-day visit
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After fund-raisers in Columbus and Akron, Bush expects to have
raised $1.5 million in Ohio in less than a month, campaign aides
said. The leading Republican presidential candidate took in $1
million on July 22 in Cincinnati and this week's visits are
expected to total $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back appearances indicate the increasing importance
the Bush campaign is giving to Ohio, one of a handful of states
that experts say will be the ``battleground'' of the 2000
presidential election because they're large states that could go
for either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ohio, the key states include Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Illinois and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gov. Bush has found a great deal of support in Ohio
and realizes that this is a state that plays a significant role in
electing the next president,'' said Mindy Tucker, Bush's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his big win in the Iowa straw poll, Bush's Thursday
schedule includes two events in Columbus _ a stop at The TEACH
(Enrichment Association of Community Healing) Center and then a
$1,000-a-person fund-raiser at the home of Les Wexner, chairman of
the Limited Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush will be in Akron, first for a stop at the Haven
of Rest Ministries and then for another $1,000-a-person
fund-raiser, this one at the Hilton Fairlawn Hotel. Summit County
Republican Chairman Alex Arshinkoff, the first county chairman in
Ohio to endorse Bush, has organized the event.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, former President George Bush, was a winner in
Ohio three out of the four times he appeared on the presidential
ballot _ twice as Ronald Reagan's vice presidential runningmate and
once as the Republican presidential candidate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Bush lost Ohio in 1992 when Democrat Bill Clinton won
the state and the election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Ohio schedule follows the pattern he set in Cincinnati _
visit with a community group providing compassion and service and
then raise lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, where Bush took in $1 million at a fund-raiser _
the most ever raised at a single event in Ohio during a primary
campaign _ he first made a public appearance at the Hope Temple
Ministries, a storefront church in a predominantly black
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Bush, 53, raised about $37 million in the first half
of the year, more than any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period in Ohio, he came in second in fund-raising
to U.S. Rep. John Kasich, R-Westerville, but that was before Kasich
withdrew from the race and before the Cincinnati event. In the
Miami Valley, Bush finished third in the money chase with $17,950,
compared to $29,750 for Kasich and $22,930 for Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Bush has stepped up his Ohio fund-raising
efforts since Kasich dropped out of the presidential race and
endorsed Bush, said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss
Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical thing is that with Kasich out of the race, it
became easier for Bush to raise money in Ohio. The local
fund-raisers for him were able to put together events,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Bush buttressed his position as the frontrunner
for the Republican nomination by grabbing nearly one third of the
votes in the Iowa straw poll in a field of nine candidates. Former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander's sixth-place finish prompted
Alexander to drop out, joining Kasich on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in Ohio acknowledge that Bush's campaign is a
``money machine,'' but say the Texas governor will be slowed when
issues become the focus of the campaign
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be today's media darling, but when people see what's
underneath the surface, and strip him bare, they won't like what
they see,'' said Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery
County Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is raising a lot of money too right now, but it is
certainly not a surprise that a Republican candidate is raising a
lot of money,'' he said.

A YUGOSLAV OPPOSITION LEADER WITHDRAWS FROM ANTI-MILOSEVIC RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In a severe blow to the effort to oust
President Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of the largest opposition
party and an influential former army general withdrew Tuesday from
a major anti-Milosevic rally scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement and
the opposition's best orator, said Tuesday that he would not
participate in the rally because of the behavior of the Alliance
for Change, which is effectively led by his rival, Zoran Djindjic,
the leader of the Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   Momcilo Perisic, whom Milosevic fired as army chief of staff
last November, also pulled out, saying he did not support a
transitional government of experts, one of the aims of the rally,
but rather favored early elections for a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, the first one in the capital, Belgrade, since
Yugoslav troops pulled out of Kosovo, has been seen as a high point
of a summer of waxing and waning protests against Milosevic. The
rally and the turnout for it will be judged by all the players here
as a test of anti-Milosevic sentiment, and the regime has been
attacking its organizers for various shortcomings _ including doing
NATO's bidding and choosing to hold the rally on President
Clinton's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The issues involved in Draskovic's decision Tuesday not to speak
at the rally were personal, symbolic and substantive, his aides
said. First, he disapproved of a change in the lineup of speakers
for the rally that came just two hours after the list was issued.
The new lineup included Vesna Pesic, the former Civic Alliance
leader, and Velimir Ilic, the mayor of Cacak. Draskovic would not
accept Ilic, his former deputy who joined with Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, Draskovic decided he would not speak.
Instead, his party's speaker at the event will be Spasoje Krunic,
who is the chairman of Belgrade's executive council but is a much
less compelling figure than Draskovic. Draskovic did, however, call
on his supporters to come to Belgrade and take part in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Draskovic said, ``I cannot accept
many, many stupid ideas of irresponsible people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the rally was too late and should have been
held at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government has sharply attacked Perisic, labeling the former
general, who is slight in stature, ``a small weakling,'' an
``unrealized male'' and ``General Clark's orderly,'' a reference to
Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander.
</P>
<P>
   The government, having tried to consolidate itself around the
parties of Milosevic, his wife, Mirjana Markovic, and the
ultranationalist politician Vojislav Seselj, is generally anxious
about sentiment in Belgrade, however pleased it may be about a
continually divided opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's developments may weaken the opposition and make it
seem less credible to ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the rally, on Wednesday, there will be be a
large crowd at the first soccer match between Yugoslavia and
Croatia since the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd is likely to shout anti-government slogans, the
government fears something more serious. The Belgrade press has
reported rumors that the ruling parties have bought or secured a
third of the seats _ up to 20,000 _ for their members.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials feel that if Yugoslavia, which boasts a strong
team, beats Croatia, the sense of good feeling may carry over to
the Thursday rally. Or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The bitter and visceral rivalry between Djindjic on one side and
Draskovic and his powerful wife, Danica, on the other, has
bedeviled and infuriated U.S. diplomats trying to follow up on the
war against Serbia with Milosevic's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. diplomat, Robert Gelbard, met in Serbia's sister
republic of Montenegro with all key Yugoslav opposition leaders to
plan strategy and provide advice and encouragement _ if not the
millions of dollars that Milosevic's propaganda asserts.
</P>
<P>
   But the visibility of U.S. diplomats advising the domestic
opposition on the ouster of the elected Yugoslav president has been
a gift to Milosevic's propaganda machine, making it easy to tar the
opposition as traitors or dupes of the nation that just bombed
Belgrade and is overseeing the exodus of Serbs from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, the Alliance for Change generally and the Clinton
administration want Milosevic to resign as a first step and for him
to be delivered, perhaps within six months, to the war crimes
tribunal in The Hague. They want a transitional government of
experts to serve for a year to prepare fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic wonders how they intend to force Milosevic's
resignation without violence, unrest and even ``civil war,'' and he
has proposed either new, internationally supervised elections to
replace Milosevic, or a transitional government, to be negotiated
with the regime, that would render Milosevic a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic now believes that Milosevic will never agree to a
transitional government and that the time for such an idea is past.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's ideas are also vague, but he believes that Milosevic
can be pushed or seduced to resign, presumably with some promise of
immunity for his family and his assets.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic, who has started his own movement, is trying to induce
members of the army, police and current regime to leave the
Milosevic circle. He believes, like the Alliance, that Milosevic is
not trustworthy and must be forced or persuaded to resign as a
first step, said his spokesman, Boris Karajicic, a former student
resistance leader. But Perisic wants early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic's views are closer to Draskovic's, and they both seem to
want a more constitutional process than what the Alliance favors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ms. Pesic, former leader of the Civic Alliance, even
suggested that if Milosevic remained in office, ``the Romanian
model, if need be,'' could not be ruled out. The Romanian dictator,
Nicolae Ceausescu, and his wife were overthrown and executed in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime immediately seized on Ms. Pesic's comments
and Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic called the Alliance for
Change, commonly disparaged as ``the Alliance for NATO,'' a
``terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, according to state television, a prosecutor asked the
police to examine evidence that Ms. Pesic is guilty of a felony
charge for inciting and ``an attack on the constitutional system.''
</P>
<P>
   That is another reason that Draskovic found her inclusion in the
list of speakers unfortunate, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance officials believe that Draskovic, who joined the
Yugoslav government in January but was fired during the war, is
doing Milosevic's bidding. They believe that Draskovic, whose party
controls Belgrade and its influential television station, Studio B,
with the support of Milosevic's party, is being pressured by the
regime.

SWISSAIR CRASH SUIT NAMES DUPONT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a week after Canadian investigators pinpointed
metalized Mylar insulation as feeding the fire that brought down
Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia, the first suit naming chemical
giant DuPont, the manufacturer of Mylar, as a defendant was filed
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The wrongful death suit was filed Monday in federal court on
behalf of the relatives of seven Europeans who were among the 229
killed when the MD-11 crashed into the Atlantic while trying to
make an emergency landing. It charges that DuPont, along with the
airplane manufacturer and two smaller firms that made modifications
to the entertainment system, a likely ignition source for the fire,
were responsible for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The filing comes after the Aug. 11 announcements by Canadians
that the insulation fed the fire and an order on the same day by
the US Federal Aviation Administration giving airlines four years
to remove all metalized Mylar insulation from the 699 airplanes in
the US fleet that currently have the material. The planes _ DC-10s,
MD-11s, MD-80s, MD-88s, and MD-90s _ were all manufactured by
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is now owned by Boeing Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 47 other wrongful death cases filed in
the wake of the Sept. 2, 1998 crash, but this is the first to
include DuPont as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intentionally delayed filing until the investigation
progressed enough that we had a clear sense of what caused the
crash,'' said attorney David Rapoport.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada called for
the removal of metalized Mylar from planes because it noted ``there
are indications that a significant source of the combustible
materials that sustained the fire was thermal acoustical insulation
blanket material.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA agreed and issued an order _ which will likely take
effect later this year after a comment period _ calling for the
removal of all such insulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely troubled by the four-year timetable,'' said
Rapoport. ``As a consumer, knowing that metalized Mylar is
implicated in the spread of fire _ and the spread is probably the
most dangerous thing that happened on Flight 111 _ I am appalled
that 3 1/2 years from now I could get on a plane that has metalized
Mylar acoustic thermal insulation blankets in the wall and not know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the plane, an MD-11, had design flaws and
that DuPont knew from earlier on-board fires that Mylar, the film
used to encapsulate the insulation, was a danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant DuPont knew before the crash of Swissair Flight
111 that metalized Mylar film ignited or otherwise dramatically
increased the spread of on-board aircraft fires in at least three
different incidents, one of which preceded the Swissair crash by
almost five years,'' the suit states. ``The Mylar insulation on the
subject aircraft served as a fuel which rapidly spread the on-board
fire and directly contributed to cause the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   A DuPont spokeswoman said the company does not make or sell
insulation blankets, but is a raw materials supplier to insulation
manufacturers. She added that the company is reviewing the
complaint and would have no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   No date for a hearing has been set in federal court.

of George W. Bush's politics. He ran for governor of Texas in 1994
with a series of commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at
gunpoint in a parking garage, and a moment later, a police officer
draping a blanket over the woman's body. Bush promised to get
tougher with criminals, and that stand helped him win. An
examination of his record for the five years he has been governor

EXPANDED DUTIES FOR TEACHER AIDES CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the next several weeks, teacher's aides will be
heading back to the classroom _ and into a new controversy about
their role once they get there.
</P>
<P>
   While teacher's aides have been helpful for most students, US
Department of Education officials say that in recent years, many
schools have given aides broader responsibilities, often having
them teach subjects without the proper educational background.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, whose salaries are funded through the federal
government's $8 billion Title I program, are not allowed to teach.
Under Title I, their work should be limited to clerical duties _
monitoring exams, taking attendance, or recording grades _ freeing
teachers to focus on in-class instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But with enrollments ballooning and yearly budgets shrinking,
more and more schools are relying on teacher's aides, many of whom
lack college degrees, to play the role of certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' said Melinda Malico, an Education
Department spokeswoman. ``Students, especially in poor areas, need
the best teachers they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration isn't making any plans to crack
down on schools that use teacher's aides in unauthorized ways,
officials are pushing for higher educational requirements for the
aides.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study of Title I by the Education
Department, 25 percent of teacher's aides who currently work in
classrooms had college degrees. In high-poverty schools, where more
than half of the students come from low-income homes, only 10
percent of the aides had a college degree. In some cities, a few
teacher's aides did not have high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Although some teacher's aides are allowed to tutor students,
they are limited to subjects the teachers have already covered in
class, Malico said. However, in large classes, aides often end up
acting as substitute teachers, according to Malico, who helped
conduct the Title I study.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of the aides in the study were teaching or
helping to teach students, and 75 percent of the aides said they
spent some time teaching without a certified teacher present,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse schools of caving into budget pressures because
teacher's aides earn significantly less than qualified teachers who
command much higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston last year, for instance, teacher's aides earned an
average of $20,000, while teacher salaries averaged $54,000 a year.
In some cities, teacher's aides earn as little as minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what the Title I money is for,'' Malico said.
``Teacher's aides are supposed to supplement the teachers, not
replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Title I program, enacted in 1965, is the largest federal
education funding program. It aims at closing the achievement gap
between poor and affluent students in elementary schools. Nearly
all public schools in urban areas qualify for aid. Schools can use
Title I money to set up after-school programs, tutoring groups, or
hire teacher's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Boston school principals said they have never allowed aides to
teach in their schools, and some criticized schools that have done
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would go against the definition of what teacher's aides
are,'' said Janet Palmer-Owens, the principal at Mason Elementary
School. ``They're in the schools to aid teachers, not do the actual
teaching. Otherwise, we'd have to call them teachers, which they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Lynch, a spokeswoman for Boston Public Schools, said
Boston has not faced the same teacher shortages as some other
cities have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we felt the pinch, there's no way we would allow aides
to go unsupervised,'' Lynch said. ``I'm surprised it happens
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lynch, a majority of Boston's aides have bachelor's
degrees, and some are working toward a master's degree. Nearly all
the aides are working toward teacher certification, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is supposed to vote this year to reauthorize Title I
and the education act, which also means sparring over fine-tuning
the guidelines for funding teacher's aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed adding a requirement
that by mid-2002, aides paid through Title I must have at least two
years of college education. Under the plan, teacher's aides also
could apply for financial assistance to obtain their college
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans favor a flexible program that would allow schools to
decide how to use education funds instead of having the federal
government setting guidelines for individual school districts.
</P>
<P>
   While there is widespread support for having college-educated
teacher's aides, some proponents of aides say tougher standards
could bar some valuable people from the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said many aides have grown up in the same neighborhoods
as the students and can provide emotional and cultural support that
teachers sometimes cannot give. Nationally, the teaching force is
comprised primarily of middle-class white women, while teacher's
aides tend to be women of color, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teacher's aides can have a unique understanding of the
circumstances in a student's life that may be affecting his or her
studies,'' Feldman said, ``because they may have gone through the
same thing themselves.''

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Meet the new Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the old aloofness that critics saw as arrogance. As
Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Co. struggles to overcome
sagging earnings and the fallout from his feud with his former
studio chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg, he has suddenly begun playing Mr.
Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   He is wooing Wall Street with uncharacteristic eagerness and
even sounds contrite when discussing his put-down of Katzenberg as
a ``midget.'' And like a child watching a scary scene in a Disney
animated movie, he is praying for a happy ending. Indeed, Eisner
seems almost desperate to restore the company's mystique _ and his
own image.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who once preferred to let his promotional autobiography,
``Work in Progress,'' speak for him, is now suddenly accessible.
Perhaps humbled by bad publicity and weak profits, he seems
determined to assure outsiders that Disney is again poised for
growth, which may be good news for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is like a Disney fairy tale,'' Eisner said in an
interview at Disney headquarters in Burbank. ``All's well that ends
well. The truth will win out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this is no fairy tale _ it is the fight of Eisner's
15-year Disney career. Yet he isn't really expecting a Prince
Charming to ride to his rescue. Rather, the kinder face he wears
these days for the outside world is the public-relations gloss he
is putting on a very methodical plan he hopes will turn Disney
around.
</P>
<P>
   He has little time to lose. After 13 years of growth, earnings
fell last year and are expected to slip more this year. Disney's
stock has slumped by about a third from its 1998 high of just over
$42. (It closed on Tuesday at $28.50.) The company's ABC network is
floundering, and its huge capital-spending program has yet to pay
off. And to Wall Street's dismay, Eisner continues to reign without
an heir in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   For the 57-year-old Eisner, analysts say, one painful and
surprising part of the spectacle is the sense that he has been
outmaneuvered by other media tycoons who once walked in his shadow.
``Michael is looking around and recognizing that Jerry Levin and
Ted Turner at Time Warner, Mel Karmazin at CBS and people like them
are defining and setting the stage for the industry,'' said
Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine Webber Inc.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying, `Wait a minute, I thought I was the Prince. Who
is that old man who turned around Paramount?''' Dixon added,
referring to Sumner Redstone, the 76-year-old chairman of Viacom
Inc. In Dixon's view, the best news for Wall Street is Eisner's
determination to make a comeback. ``Michael never saw real
competition and now it is coming out of the woodwork. He's saying,
`It's good to be King, and I'm not King anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, clearly unhappy at being on the defensive, played down
Disney's plight. ``There are highs and lows,'' he said. ``This is a
flat period. We have had 14 years of not flat periods. No one is
used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people under pressure, Eisner frequently, if somewhat
wearily, refers to Disney's overall track record, as if to assure
both himself and his audience that this downturn is only temporary.
``It is evolution,'' he said. ``But nobody can complain about where
we went from 1984 to 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all his public optimism, Eisner is scrambling to get Disney
back on track. His strategy: streamline operations, sell
nonstrategic assets and get spending down.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, industry executives said the company had
decided to sell Fairchild Publications, its magazine division, for
an estimated $650 million. Rumors swirled that Disney was
considering selling its Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team and the
Anaheim Angels baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   And Walt Disney International president Robert Iger has been put
in charge of realigning overseas operations to better integrate
Disney's businesses. The company is, for example, considering using
its ties to retail outlets in Britain to promote both new films and
older videos, along with its merchandise. That approach could add
$3 billion to its total sales of $22 billion in 1998, said Disney
chief strategic officer Peter Murphy. .
</P>
<P>
   The plan is ``to pick low-hanging fruit,'' Eisner said,
suggesting that consumer products, video and movies are already
popular overseas and that greater profits are within reach. If this
works, much of the profit will go directly to the bottom line, said
chief financial officer Thomas Staggs, , since the cost of films,
for example, has already been recovered in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Disney sells assets, Eisner has ordered Staggs to review
all major capital spending. The company says the most expensive
projects will soon be behind it, including a new $1.4 billion
attraction at Disneyland. This reassessment comes on top of a
cost-cutting drive aimed at saving half a billion dollars at its
film division.
</P>
<P>
   Iger, who is also chairman of the ABC Group, said that next
year, primarily because of cost savings and a strong up-front sales
market, the ABC network is likely to show slim profits after losing
an estimated $50 million in the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors still believe Disney became undisciplined with
its money _ for example, in its purchase of two $400 million cruise
ships, which they say will never generate the huge returns of, for
example, cable services that are less expensive to create. Such
high-cost ventures, combined with poor ratings at ABC, have hurt
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the recent moves to discipline spending, cut costs and
exploit opportunities overseas are reawakening investors' interest
because they view Disney's receptiveness to Wall Street's concerns
as good news. David Londoner, who has long followed Disney for
Schroder Inc., said he ``would be happy to see them sell the sports
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a core business,'' he said. ``I always worry when
chief executives buy sports teams. So many times, it is ego-driven
rather than bottom-line-oriented. The company is making the right
moves, but it may take more than a year before Disney is back on
its growth track.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1999, the company reported
net profits of $1.22 billion, down from $1.55 billion a year
earlier, while sales rose to $17.6 billion from $16.83 billion.
Excluding a gain from the addition of Infoseek, a popular Internet
search service, operating income fell 17 percent, to $2.7 billion,
and net income dropped 26 percent, to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As Disney races to reverse that trend, skeptics say it has a
compelling need to retain tough, independent-minded managers. ``The
company is very Michael-centric,'' said one former executive who
insisted on anonymity. ``Everybody worries about what Michael will
think. They are always looking over their shoulder.''

 &HT;    Home Depot to sell inventory online
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A month or so away from selling its first products
online, Home Depot has decided against just sticking its toe in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement giant said Tuesday it has ditched plans for
a trial run of product sales this fall on www.homedepot.com.
Instead, Home Depot will put its entire inventory of more than
50,000 products up for sale on the Web, beginning sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially we wanted to get our feet wet and offer 1,000
products online. But (recently) it has become apparent that the
better way to do it was to offer the full catalog,'' said Jeff
Cohen, group president of direct marketing businesses. He said
prices on the Web will be the same as in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot re-launched its Web site in June with more
interactive features and home improvement project tips.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, customers have sent a big signal that they want
access to products _ and lots of them, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they wanted to check the stock online, then
purchase them in the store, or purchase online and return in the
store if necessary, or order online and pick it up at the store,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused us to take a step back,'' Cohen added. ``In our
hearts, we knew we'd have to offer more than just a thousand
products to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to take several more months and considerably more
staff to set the ramped-up plan in motion. The company will
dedicate 50 people to the Internet venture, Cohen said. It already
has reassigned 20 technology staffers and is looking to hire more.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Ryan, formerly senior vice president of merchandising, has
been named senior vice president, Internet. He'll oversee the
Internet staff and development of the Web site at the company's
headquarters near Vinings, off I-285 and Paces Ferry Road. The
company also has a customer service staff for its Web site in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Home Depot has expanded its product offerings, its
overall Internet strategy is still to point customers back into the
stores, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Online shoppers will be able to customize their home pages with
information about what's available at their community store.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet product offerings and prices will be
market-specific. Shoppers in the Southeast, for example, would not
necessarily have access to merchandise sold at Home Depot stores on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's path to the Internet has created a buzz in the home
improvement industry. For one thing, the retailer was extremely
secretive about what it was planning to sell online.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot caused a stir recently after it sent a letter to
suppliers warning them to think twice before selling their products
over the Net in direct competition with the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers called the move heavy-handed, but Home Depot said
Tuesday that it hadn't received any feedback from manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of national and regional housing supply and hardware
retailers, including some pure Internet companies, have beaten Home
Depot to the Web with online sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. sells 3,500 Craftsman tools,
2,000 appliances and 4 million replacement parts on www.sears.com.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, Home Depot's largest direct
retail competitor, started selling certain tools, ceiling fans and
steel doors through manufacturer sites in November. By the end of
the year, Lowe's will start selling a limited amount of products on
its Web site at www.lowes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of home improvement products over the Internet could reach
$6.5 billion by 2002, according to the Home Improvement Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   A Prudential Securities report published in May estimated that
Home Depot's Internet sales could generate $75 million in the first
year, assuming 500,000 transactions a year at an average of $150
each. The report indicated the estimate was conservative,
considering that the average Home Depot store makes about 874,000
sales a year.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot would not disclose sales projections for its Internet
venture.

 BURBANK, Calif.: their shoulder.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clash with Katzenberg was no help. Eisner passed up a chance
to settle a lawsuit filed by Katzenberg over the terms of his
contract for considerably less than the reported $250 million
settlement he reached in July. On top of that, he suffered the
embarrassment of a leak of notes from his autobiography in which he
referred to Katzenberg as a ``little midget,'' raising questions
about his attitude toward his remaining managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting because the company is supposed to be
people-friendly,'' said another person close to Disney who insisted
on anonymity. Such language sent a message that ``OK, if he can say
that about Jeffrey Katzenberg, what does he think about me?'' this
person said. ``Michael is very closely associated with Disney. It
was as if Walt Disney had said it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has maintained privately that he took such a tough stand
because he believed Disney had no obligation to pay what Katzenberg
was demanding. But he acknowledged that the negative publicity has
been unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I am that dark person that people write about,''
Eisner said. ``I think I made a mistake. I don't want that to be
the headline. I'd rather the headline be other stuff, but what can
I do?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has become so eager to generate good headlines that he
seems to waver between letting his current team take on expanded
responsibilities and hiring a tough No. 2. But he is clearly
annoyed by all the pressure to take the latter path. ``Everybody
looks at me and says, `Oh, well, he is 57. He must be nearing
death, so why doesn't he have six successors lined up outside his
office?''' Eisner said. ``Nobody asks Sumner Redstone, who is 117.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a bypass,'' he added _ in August 1994. ``That's
what made people start to think. That's fair. I think about it. But
I couldn't have a better company. We have very strong people.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Disney's main rivals _ Time Warner Inc., Viacom Inc.
and News Corp. _ also lack strong No. 2's. But a series of
departures put Eisner's track record under scrutiny. First came the
high-profile ouster of Michael Ovitz as Eisner's second-in-command
in 1996. Then Geraldine Laybourne, the creator of Nickelodeon, left
in 1998 after two years, followed by Jake Weinbaum, who, after
running Disney's Internet operations, formed Ecompanies, in which
Disney is a major investor.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has no plans to modify his involvement in operations,
which some critics say is too autocratic. Already he is tinkering
with the Go Network, which is to be part of the Internet company
that Disney is combining with its own Internet operations into
Go.Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great room does not become a great room until you place the
ashtrays, the flowers, the books,'' Eisner said. ``So yes, I do
occasionally write memos about details. I think my attention to
them forces everybody else to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he argues, the company is far too big for him to
intrude too much. And for all the talk about defections, Walt
Disney Attractions president Paul Pressler , has been at Disney for
12 years and Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth for 5. The
biggest question now is whether Eisner can keep his current team in
place. Any further turnover would surely alarm investors.
</P>
<P>
   But if Eisner feels the need to justify himself, that could
serve shareholders well. The publicity may force the company to
focus on both its operating businesses and its management problems.
Certainly the board was not happy with the ``midget'' incident, a
person close to the board conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has some mighty discerning shareholders to please. One is
billionaire Texas industrialist Sid Bass, , whom he describes as
one of his best friends and with whom he talks or exchanges e-mail
daily. Another is investor Warren Buffett, whose philosophy of
management Eisner is now trying to put in place.
</P>

EXPANDED DUTIES FOR TEACHER AIDES CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the next several weeks, teacher's aides will be
heading back to the classroom _ and into a new controversy about
their role once they get there.
</P>
<P>
   While teacher's aides have been helpful for most students, US
Department of Education officials say that in recent years, many
schools have given aides broader responsibilities, often having
them teach subjects without the proper educational background.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, whose salaries are funded through the federal
government's $8 billion Title I program, are not allowed to teach.
Under Title I, their work should be limited to clerical duties _
monitoring exams, taking attendance, or recording grades _ freeing
teachers to focus on in-class instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But with enrollments ballooning and yearly budgets shrinking,
more and more schools are relying on teacher's aides, many of whom
lack college degrees, to play the role of certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' said Melinda Malico, an Education
Department spokeswoman. ``Students, especially in poor areas, need
the best teachers they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration isn't making any plans to crack
down on schools that use teacher's aides in unauthorized ways,
officials are pushing for higher educational requirements for the
aides.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study of Title I by the Education
Department, 25 percent of teacher's aides who currently work in
classrooms had college degrees. In high-poverty schools, where more
than half of the students come from low-income homes, only 10
percent of the aides had a college degree. In some cities, a few
teacher's aides did not have high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Although some teacher's aides are allowed to tutor students,
they are limited to subjects the teachers have already covered in
class, Malico said. However, in large classes, aides often end up
acting as substitute teachers, according to Malico, who helped
conduct the Title I study.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of the aides in the study were teaching or
helping to teach students, and 75 percent of the aides said they
spent some time teaching without a certified teacher present,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse schools of caving into budget pressures because
teacher's aides earn significantly less than qualified teachers who
command much higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston last year, for instance, teacher's aides earned an
average of $20,000, while teacher salaries averaged $54,000 a year.
In some cities, teacher's aides earn as little as minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what the Title I money is for,'' Malico said.
``Teacher's aides are supposed to supplement the teachers, not
replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Title I program, enacted in 1965, is the largest federal
education funding program. It aims at closing the achievement gap
between poor and affluent students in elementary schools. Nearly
all public schools in urban areas qualify for aid. Schools can use
Title I money to set up after-school programs, tutoring groups, or
hire teacher's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Boston school principals said they have never allowed aides to
teach in their schools, and some criticized schools that have done
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would go against the definition of what teacher's aides
are,'' said Janet Palmer-Owens, the principal at Mason Elementary
School. ``They're in the schools to aid teachers, not do the actual
teaching. Otherwise, we'd have to call them teachers, which they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Lynch, a spokeswoman for Boston Public Schools, said
Boston has not faced the same teacher shortages as some other
cities have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we felt the pinch, there's no way we would allow aides
to go unsupervised,'' Lynch said. ``I'm surprised it happens
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lynch, a majority of Boston's aides have bachelor's
degrees, and some are working toward a master's degree. Nearly all
the aides are working toward teacher certification, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is supposed to vote this year to reauthorize Title I
and the education act, which also means sparring over fine-tuning
the guidelines for funding teacher's aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed adding a requirement
that by mid-2002, aides paid through Title I must have at least two
years of college education. Under the plan, teacher's aides also
could apply for financial assistance to obtain their college
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans favor a flexible program that would allow schools to
decide how to use education funds instead of having the federal
government setting guidelines for individual school districts.
</P>
<P>
   While there is widespread support for having college-educated
teacher's aides, some proponents of aides say tougher standards
could bar some valuable people from the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said many aides have grown up in the same neighborhoods
as the students and can provide emotional and cultural support that
teachers sometimes cannot give. Nationally, the teaching force is
comprised primarily of middle-class white women, while teacher's
aides tend to be women of color, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teacher's aides can have a unique understanding of the
circumstances in a student's life that may be affecting his or her
studies,'' Feldman said, ``because they may have gone through the
same thing themselves.''

ROYAL AHOLD IN BIDDING WAR FOR HANNAFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop &AMP; Shop's Dutch parent may be among those looking to buy
Northeastern food giant Hannaford Bros. Co. of Scarborough, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC reported Tuesday that Royal Ahold NV, which operates Stop &AMP;
Shop Cos. of Quincy, Mass., was close to acquiring Hannaford for
about $3 billion. But later in the day, CNBC reported that a
bidding war had broken out for Hannaford among Ahold and some of
the largest grocers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies would comment on the reports. But trading
was halted early Tuesday afternoon on Hannaford's stock shares and
never resumed. The stock hit a 52-week high of 65 1/4 Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange and was trading at 63 11/16 when
trading was suspended, giving the company a market value of $2.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Hannaford, a midsize chain with $3.32
billion in sales last year at its roughly 150 stores, is being
widely sought after. (Some Hannaford stores operate under the Shop
'n Save nameplate.)
</P>
<P>
   With Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart Corp. aggressively moving
into the food business, grocery chains are looking for critical
mass to stave off the challenge from giant discounters.
</P>
<P>
   In a business in which the profit margins are thin and size
matters, the Wal-Mart threat has supermarket companies scrambling
to make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   When, for example, the British parent of Shaw's Supermarkets
Inc., J Sainsbury PLC, announced plans late last year to acquire
Star Markets Co. of Cambridge, Mass., Shaw's indicated that
additional size was needed to cement its hold on the New England
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions give chains more buying power and enable them to
operate more efficient distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Ahold has been on an acquisition spree in recent
years, buying up chains along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   US sales now are estimated to account for about $20 billion of
the company's worldwide revenue of $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ahold's northernmost US chain, Stop &AMP; Shop, has no stores in
Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, states where Hannaford has a
large presence and where Shaw's is often the chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of adding a missing piece to the geographical puzzle of
the East Coast, the acquisition of Hannaford by Ahold ``would
completely make sense,'' said editor Craig Faucher of the Griffin
Report of Food Marketing, which tracks the grocery industry in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hannaford could fill in some holes and thin spots
for Ahold in New York state around Albany and in the Carolinas,
where Hannaford also operates stores, Faucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Stop &AMP; Shop operates 197 stores in the Northeast with annual
sales of about $6.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When supermarket chains merge, antitrust regulators have not
hesitated to require the buyer to divest some stores if they
believe the sale would allow one chain to be so dominant as to
stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   When Sainsbury bought Star, for example, for $476 million, it
had to divest 10 stores. The resulting chain has 170 stores, which
last year had sales of about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While an Ahold purchase of Hannaford would give the Dutch
company chains stretching from South Carolina to Maine, geography
isn't the sole factor in grocery expansions.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hannaford's likely suitors were Idaho-based Albertson's
Inc., Food Lion Inc., and, possibly, Ohio-based Kroger Co., Wall
Street analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   With only a handful of quality chains available on the East
Coast, Hannaford may be a much sought-after prize that could fetch
more than its market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannaford is an important strategic prize,'' Merrill Lynch
analyst Mark Husson said. ``That might make the bidding war more
emotional than rational.''

 &HT;    Home Depot's profit for quarter soars 45%
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's second-quarter profit rose 45 percent as
customers continued to spend more on building materials, flooring
and remodeling products for kitchens and baths.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement didn't do much for the stock Tuesday, although
it has gained in recent days in anticipation of the results. Home
Depot closed at $63.06 1/4, down 93 3/4 cents. The stock is up 11
percent over the last five trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the Atlanta-based home improvement retailer rose
to $679 million, or 44 cents a share, from $467 million, or 31
cents a share, in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, quarterly sales totaled $10.43 billion,
an increase of 28 percent from $8.14 billion in the year-ago
period.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Home Depot said profit would beat analysts' forecasts
by 5 cents a share. Analysts had expected the home improvement
retailer to earn 39 cents, according to a survey by First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores open at least one year rose 11 percent from the
same period last year. Same-store sales are a key indicator of a
retailer's business because they exclude sales from new and closed
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's strong same-store sales increase was driven in part
by a 7 percent increase in the average cash register transaction.
The average sale in the second quarter was $48, up from $45 in the
year-ago period. Average weekly sales per store rose to $978,000,
up from $933,000.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said same-store sales increases will likely taper a
bit in the third quarter to the ``high single digits,'' or 7
percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is ``clearly outperforming the industry and the
closest competitor _ Lowe's,'' said analyst Douglas Gordon of Banc
of America Securities. In its earnings announcement on Monday,
Lowe's Cos. said its same-store sales rose 5.6 percent in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with interest rate fears mounting, consumer spending
hasn't slowed,'' Argus Research Corp. analyst Alan Mak told
Bloomberg News. ``Coupled with a strong housing market, that leads
to gangbuster results.'' He rates the stock a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said Tuesday it will replay its quarterly conference
call with analysts over its Web site at www.homedepot.com. The
replay will be available for five days.

98 ARRESTED IN DRUG RAIDS ACROSS U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
 BUST-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
and STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Federal lawmen arrested 98 people Tuesday in the
breakup of a coast-to-coast drug smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   The government's yearlong investigation in 14 cities, dubbed
Operation Southwest Express, also led to the seizure of $1.15
million in cash, 2,727 kilograms of cocaine and 4,158 pounds of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI called the ring one of the top 20 drug distribution
networks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests began Monday night in San Diego with Omar Rocha
Soto, the ring's alleged leader, and his wife, Adriana Espinoza.
Federal agents also arrested three men they say ran the
organization's El Paso base, brothers Daniel, Raul and Angel
Sotello-Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The ring relied on trucks, trains and cars to circulate several
tons of cocaine and marijuana to distributors in Chicago,
Cleveland, New York, Nashville and Boston. The drugs were smuggled
from Mexico, South America and Southeast Asia, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Houston raided two businesses Tuesday as part of the
operation and arrested five Houston-area residents. About $280,000
in cash, a Land Rover and two Ferraris were seized.
</P>
<P>
   Bassam ``Sam'' Khalil Farhat, 35, Steven Foufic Timani, 32,
Courtney Brian Cunningham, 22, Luis Hernando Melendez, 36, and Jose
Santana, 28, were indicted on charges of conspiracy to possess with
intent to distribute in excess of 5 kilograms of cocaine since May
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Farhat and Timani also were charged with money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they cartel leaders? No,'' said Drug Enforcement
Administration special agent Ernest Howard. ``But they were heads
of cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials suggested Rocha-Soto in San Diego coordinated
the trafficking; members of the Sotelo-Lopez family in El Paso
transported the drugs to Chicago and Boston; and Farhat and Timani
in Houston were responsible for transportation and distribution of
cocaine to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are much more than mules,'' said Houston Police
Department Lt. Gray D. Smith, part of the federal and local High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not users. They were businesspeople. Junkies don't
drive Ferraris,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said large trucks were used to transport the drugs in
Houston and the cargo was placed in ``stash houses'' around the
city before distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Magidson said investigators were
helped by a ``rare occurrence'' _ the use of a roving wiretap to
track a number of cellular phones used in the drug transactions.
Typically, a wiretap is sanctioned for a specific telephone line,
not to follow a person as they use different wireless equipment
from week to week.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard described the drug ring as
an equal opportunity criminal network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization that was disrupted today embraced the
American capitalist idea and would sell any type of drug for a
profit,'' he said. ``It did not discriminate in its dealings with
any other drug organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said arrests, seizures or other operations also occurred
in Lufkin, Texas; Chicago; La Salle, Ill.; Cleveland; Dayton, Ohio;
Allentown, Pa.; New York; Albany, N.Y.; Nashville; and Atlanta.

EX-SECURITY CHIEF SAYS CHINESE SPY SUSPECT WAS SINGLED OUT BECAUSE
OF RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The former head of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico said Tuesday that American
scientist Wen Ho Lee, the top suspect in the Chinese atomic spy
case, was unfairly singled out for federal investigation because of
his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a key factor,'' Robert Vrooman said in an interview.
``There were 83 people who went to China'' from the New Mexican
weapons lab in the 1980s, any one of whom might have leaked
secrets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Caucasians'' were not investigated, Vrooman said,
even though they had access to weapon secrets. ``And they made
contact with the same people that Lee was in contact with,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Though intelligence experts eventually discovered that Lee had
downloaded secret weapons-related computer codes onto an unsecure
computer, Vrooman said Tuesday that Lee's ethnic background ``was a
major factor'' in initially making him the key suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who has declared his innocence of the spy charges, is a
Taiwan-born scientist who worked at Los Alamos for more than two
decades before being fired in March for violating security rules.
Investigators then discovered that he had transferred vast amounts
of secret nuclear data from Los Alamos' classified computer system
to an open network. The data he downloaded included the legacy
codes, mathematical approximations of nuclear weapons designs.
</P>
<P>
   Counterintelligence experts say racial focusing is not uncommon
in spy investigations because foreign intelligence services often
target people who may have cultural or political sympathies with
foreign states.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman is apparently the first investigator in the case to
publicly raise the issue of racial bias, though some Chinese
American rights groups had done so previously. Vrooman's remarks
were first reported Tuesday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called for Vrooman
and two other Los Alamos officials to suffer disciplinary action
for failing to handle the lab's spy probe properly. Vrooman was not
named in the Energy Department's news release, but officials
disclosed his name to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials said Tuesday that a decision on any
disciplinary action would probably not be made for weeks.
Richardson has recommended terminating Vrooman's contract as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and other managers at Los Alamos have denied that
Lee's Asian ancestry sparked suspicions that he was involved in
possible espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman's criticisms that the investigation prematurely focused
on Lee echo the more general findings of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, which earlier this month made public a report on
the China espionage probe. It said federal investigators erred
early on when they focused on Lee without having adequately
reviewed other possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The spy scandal erupted in March when the House select committee
on Chinese espionage, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
neared completion of a report charging that China stole secrets
about seven of America's most advanced warheads. Lee was not named
in the report when it was publicly released in May, but his
identity had emerged months before.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' earlier this month, Lee
said he was a victim of ethnic bias and that he had downloaded
secret files in order to protect them, a practice he said was
common at Los Alamos. He denied giving the material to anyone else
and denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Los Alamos director John Browne and
other lab managers strongly disagreed with Lee's explanations about
why he violated security regulations by transferring millions of
lines of classified computer code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that anyone has ever done anything like
this before at Los Alamos,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, a former case officer at the CIA, said Tuesday in
interviews and a two-page statement that federal investigators had
``not one shred of evidence'' that linked Lee to Chinese espionage.
He said he scrutinized the case for nearly three years, from June
1995 until he retired from Los Alamos at age 61 in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Vrooman strongly defended his actions,
accused the Energy Department of playing politics and said the
nation's nuclear weapons labs had been unfairly targeted in the spy
scandal. Though China has obtained secret weapons information, he
said, it is more likely it came from the military or defense
contractors than from weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not design information,'' he said of the lost secrets.
``It was engineering data. If you were a Las Vegas oddsmaker, you'd
put your money on DOD,'' the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said federal investigators had found that secret data on the
warhead at the center of the investigation, the W-88, the most
modern in the American arsenal, had been made widely available
throughout the federal bureaucracy to hundreds of people.
</P>

   Vrooman said the Energy Department's Office of
Counterintelligence had identified Lee as ``the prime suspect based
on, at best, cursory investigation at only two facilities.'' They
were Los Alamos, the birthplace of the bomb, and the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, the nation's other

   Last week in recommending the disciplinary action, the Energy
Department criticized Vrooman for allowing Lee continued access to
nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's inspector general reported to Richardson
last week that in 1997 the Albuquerque field office of the FBI told
Vrooman that there was no longer any investigative reason to keep
Lee in his sensitive position with access to classified
information. Vrooman did not take any action to move Lee and did
not tell the managers at Los Alamos about the FBI's finding,
according to the department.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Vrooman said his decision to continue Lee's access
had been made in concert with officials of the FBI and the Energy
Department's chief intelligence officer, Notra Trulock. Trulock did
not return calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to note that Executive order 12333 specifies
that the FBI has responsibility for counterintelligence
investigations within the United States,'' Vrooman said in his
statement. The internal security office at Los Alamos, he added,
``can only provide support to the FBI.''

<P>
   Vrooman said he had followed the Energy Department's
counterintelligence code of ethics to try to protect Lee's identity
but other Energy officials had not, ``as evidenced by the trial and
conviction by rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman added that he had been targeted for disciplinary action
because he opposed the Energy Department's view that the Chinese
espionage had occurred in its warrens rather than elsewhere. ``I
consider disciplinary action against me to be retaliation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials have ``put constraints on us that are going to
destroy'' the Los Alamos lab, Vrooman said. ``This is a national
treasure. I don't want to see it destroyed based on false
allegations.''

EX-SECURITY CHIEF SAYS CHINESE SPY SUSPECT WAS SINGLED OUT BECAUSE
OF RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Doublefiled: also moved in `a' category) 
 (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The former head of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico said Tuesday that American
scientist Wen Ho Lee, the top suspect in the Chinese atomic spy
case, was unfairly singled out for federal investigation because of
his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a key factor,'' Robert Vrooman said in an interview.
``There were 83 people who went to China'' from the New Mexican
weapons lab in the 1980s, any one of whom might have leaked
secrets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Caucasians'' were not investigated, Vrooman said,
even though they had access to weapon secrets. ``And they made
contact with the same people that Lee was in contact with,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Though intelligence experts eventually discovered that Lee had
downloaded secret weapons-related computer codes onto an unsecure
computer, Vrooman said Tuesday that Lee's ethnic background ``was a
major factor'' in initially making him the key suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who has declared his innocence of the spy charges, is a
Taiwan-born scientist who worked at Los Alamos for more than two
decades before being fired in March for violating security rules.
Investigators then discovered that he had transferred vast amounts
of secret nuclear data from Los Alamos' classified computer system
to an open network. The data he downloaded included the legacy
codes, mathematical approximations of nuclear weapons designs.
</P>
<P>
   Counterintelligence experts say racial focusing is not uncommon
in spy investigations because foreign intelligence services often
target people who may have cultural or political sympathies with
foreign states.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman is apparently the first investigator in the case to
publicly raise the issue of racial bias, though some Chinese
American rights groups had done so previously. Vrooman's remarks
were first reported Tuesday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called for Vrooman
and two other Los Alamos officials to suffer disciplinary action
for failing to handle the lab's spy probe properly. Vrooman was not
named in the Energy Department's news release, but officials
disclosed his name to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials said Tuesday that a decision on any
disciplinary action would probably not be made for weeks.
Richardson has recommended terminating Vrooman's contract as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and other managers at Los Alamos have denied that
Lee's Asian ancestry sparked suspicions that he was involved in
possible espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman's criticisms that the investigation prematurely focused
on Lee echo the more general findings of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, which earlier this month made public a report on
the China espionage probe. It said federal investigators erred
early on when they focused on Lee without having adequately
reviewed other possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The spy scandal erupted in March when the House select committee
on Chinese espionage, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
neared completion of a report charging that China stole secrets
about seven of America's most advanced warheads. Lee was not named
in the report when it was publicly released in May, but his
identity had emerged months before.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' earlier this month, Lee
said he was a victim of ethnic bias and that he had downloaded
secret files in order to protect them, a practice he said was
common at Los Alamos. He denied giving the material to anyone else
and denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Los Alamos director John Browne and
other lab managers strongly disagreed with Lee's explanations about
why he violated security regulations by transferring millions of
lines of classified computer code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that anyone has ever done anything like
this before at Los Alamos,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, a former case officer at the CIA, said Tuesday in
interviews and a two-page statement that federal investigators had
``not one shred of evidence'' that linked Lee to Chinese espionage.
He said he scrutinized the case for nearly three years, from June
1995 until he retired from Los Alamos at age 61 in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Vrooman strongly defended his actions,
accused the Energy Department of playing politics and said the
nation's nuclear weapons labs had been unfairly targeted in the spy
scandal. Though China has obtained secret weapons information, he
said, it is more likely it came from the military or defense
contractors than from weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not design information,'' he said of the lost secrets.
``It was engineering data. If you were a Las Vegas oddsmaker, you'd
put your money on DOD,'' the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   He said federal investigators had found that secret data on the
warhead at the center of the investigation, the W-88, the most
modern in the American arsenal, had been made widely available
throughout the federal bureaucracy to hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rather detailed description of the W-88 had a distribution
of 548 copies,'' he said, most to the Defense Department, the
military services, the National Guard, federal agencies and such
contractors as the Lockheed Missile and Space Corp. ``Please note

   HOUSTON _ Scientists have identified genetic changes that might
help doctors predict the risk of the potential spread of breast
cancer to other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   In a study that could have implications for better diagnosis and
treatment of breast cancer, a team of Baylor College of Medicine
researchers found that although there is a gene that usually
suppresses the spread of the tumor, the deletion of the gene
actually impedes the spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, something that spreads the disease is being thrown
away with the tumor-suppressor gene,'' said Dr. Peter O'Connell, a
professor of cell biology and the principal investigator of the
study, which was done at the University of Texas Health Science
Center in San Antonio. ``It's like throwing out the baby with the
bath water.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's team hopes to use the information to develop a
genetic test to assess the risk of particular cancers spreading.
Such knowledge would enable doctors to know how aggressively to
treat each cancer, O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer's spread to parts of the body away from the original
tumor is the greatest risk to breast cancer patients. Only 20
percent of patients survive five years when the cancer spreads to a
distant organ. Seventy percent survive five years when it only
spreads to the lymph nodes and 90 percent survive when it doesn't
spread at all.
</P>
<P>
   The findings on the team's study of the spread of breast cancer
are reported in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute. An editorial noting the importance of diagnosing
tumors while still local describes the O'Connell team's findings as
likely affording the opportunity to detect rare metastatic cells
within tumors comprising millions of cells.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at 76 breast cancer patients, 34 of whom had
had the cancer spread to the lymph nodes and 42 of whom had not.
Sixty-eight percent of those whose cancer had not spread lacked the
tumor-suppressing gene, compared with 24 percent of those whose
cancer had spread.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell and five of the six researchers who did the study at
UT-San Antonio recently became Baylor professors and members of the
new Breast Care Center at Baylor and The Methodist Hospital.

 &HT;    Pennies would be heavenly for some merchants
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A penny saved is not necessarily a penny earned. Just
ask Antoine Thomas, a shift manager at a downtown McDonald's. He
has been so short of pennies lately that he considered snatching a
handful from his children's piggy bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a single penny in this store, and we are losing
money because of it.'' Thomas said Tuesday. ``I can't get them from
any of the banks. I even put up a sign a week or so ago asking
customers to bring them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is not alone. A penny shortage first observed weeks ago
in the Northeast has apparently spread south, leaving many
merchants begging customers for pennies. Bank tellers accustomed to
having $40 to $50 worth of pennies in their drawers every day now
have only $15 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is unintentional hoarding. Plenty of pennies are in
circulation _ an estimated 114 billion, according to the U.S. Mint.
But during prosperous times, people rarely fret about redeeming
pennies, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of pennies to go around,'' said Pierce
Nelson, spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta. ``But in
some instances people may have them in a jar at home.'' To meet the
increased demand from merchants, the U.S. Mint has put more pennies
in circulation. Shipments from January through April ran 33 percent
above the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Philadelphia and Denver mints are manufacturing
pennies 24 hours a day, six days a week. They shipped 3.6 billion
of the coins during the first four months of 1999.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton completes a two-day Texas swing
in Houston Wednesday, raising money for her U.S. Senate campaign in
a few of the tonier neighborhoods in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Democrat, has formed an exploratory campaign for the
2000 U.S. Senate race in New York. Her trip through Texas is
expected to net about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the dominating presence of Republicans in Texas
statewide office and the conservative leanings of Harris County,
Houston remains a favored destination for national candidates from
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there still are a number of big Democratic
contributors here,'' said Sue Walden, a Houston GOP fund-raiser and
political consultant. ``It's not surprising at all she would visit
Houston and Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Houston, Clinton is scheduled to attend a
$1,000-a-person reception at the Memorial area home of Tilman
Fertitta, chairman of Landry's Seafood Restaurants and a major
supporter of state and national Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton will attend a $5,000-a-plate dinner at the River

BRUINS SEND KHRISTICH ON HIS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In theory, Dmitri Khristich, who was rendered an
unrestricted free agent Tuesday when the Bruins cut him free, could
play with the Boston spoked B on his chest this season.
</P>
<P>
   However, based on comments made by Khristich's agent Tuesday
night, theory and reality play on opposite ends of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dmitri has no interest whatsoever in going back to the
Bruins,'' said Larry Kelly, Khristich's Ottawa-based adviser.
``None.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Khristich, who on Sunday night saw his 1999-00
salary set at $2.8 million by an arbitrator, learned late Tuesday
afternoon that the Bruins would not abide by the award. Under the
provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in place since
January '95, Khristich immediately became an unrestricted free
agent, free to sign with any of the NHL's other 27 clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in league history that a player has been
granted what is commonly referred to as ``walkaway'' free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, however, retain the right to match another club's
offer, provided it is greater than $2.24 million (80 percent of the
arbitration award). If Khristich finds no takers, he has the right
to return to the Bruins by next Tuesday afternoon and play for
$1.95 million, the figure Boston offered in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't happen,'' said Kelly. ``Dmitri made it clear to me
at the end of the season, prior to the arbitration hearing, and
after the arbitration award, that he has no interest in going back
to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Khristich would have returned to the Hub if the
Bruins had agreed to pay the $2.8 arbitration award.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he would have given 110 percent on the ice,'' added Kelly,
``as he always does.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to cutting Khristich free in the afternoon, the Bruins
once more offered him the chance to play this season for $1.95
million, the salary he played for last season. Kelly promptly
declined the offer and, by 4:35 p.m., received a fax from Causeway
Street notifying him that the Bruins were walking away from the
arbitration award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't trade him,'' said Sinden, reached in his office
late in the afternoon. ``As a matter of fact, all the teams that we
talked to about trading him _ prior to the arbitration award _ kind
of lost all interest. We couldn't even get into any discussion like
maybe eating some of the salary in order to get a deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt other teams now might make similar decisions,
as salaries escalate, Sinden said, ``I don't know. It's different
for every team. We drew some comfort in the fact that we had
already signed (Dave) Andreychuk.''
</P>
<P>
   As of early last evening, Kelly said he had not been in contact
with any other NHL clubs about Khristich's services. He would not
offer an opinion as to whether the precedent set by Boston might
trigger similar walkaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a player of this caliber,'' said Kelly, ``if he
doesn't get offers, well, I really don't want to say much. It will
be interesting to see if this has been orchestrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom he may be referring to when he said ``orchestrated,''
Kelly said only, ``I'll leave that for you to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's decision to cut Khristich free really was not
surprising. Sinden verbally torched him in the moments immediately
following the Bruins' elimination in last season's playoffs,
remarks that clearly didn't add to Khristich's trade value. After
collecting 29 goals and 71 points in the regular season, he
performed poorly in the postseason, picking up only 7 points in 12
games. He looked out of sync, disinterested on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Khristich were unsuccessful.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Interactive Media has made a $30 million
investment and strategic partnership with online ticket-seller,
Tickets.com. The Atlanta-based CIM has invested $15 million and
will invest an additional $15 million subject to regulatory
approvals which are expected next month.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets.com will be the main provider of event ticketing for all
the CIM Web sites including AccessAtlanta. Cox Interactive Media is
a division of Cox Enterprises, parent company of The Atlanta
Journal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the CIM investment, Tickets.com also received a
$55 million investment from Excite(at)Home high speed search
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Giving users the opportunity to buy tickets from its portal
sites adds one more so-called ``sticky product'' to the CIM Web
sites making them competitive with national portals such as Yahoo
and Lycos. Sticky products are services like, search, chat, Web
sites, stock quotes or shopping directories that encourage users to
spend more time on a site rather than surfing to different sites
for each task.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for ways to help consumers manage their
busy lives,'' said CIM president Peter Winter in a statement.
``Tickets.com's event database is the most comprehensive ticket
information resource available.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Newport Beach, California, based Tickets.com provides
events ticketing and related information through its 1-800-TICKETS
phone number, retail outlets and over via its Web site,
www.tickets.com. In 1998, the company sold 5.3 million tickets in
1998 and received fees for its services, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets.com agreed to spend $13.5 million over three years
advertising with Cox newspapers, broadcasting and cable-television
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Tickets.com might also prove to be an excellent
complement to the company's recent investment in MP3.com, the
online digital music download site. CIM and MP3.com announced plans
to develop music-related Web sites together and having a link to an
online ticketing service would add value to any music sites.
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta is one of the most successful local portal sites,
ranking 11th in the Atlanta market according to Web measurement
firm Media Metrix.

APPIER HAPPY TO BE WITH PLAYOFF CONTENDER ATHLETICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Someone up there is looking after Kevin Appier. It's
about time. His escape from a desolate prairie town where there
used to be a powerful Kansas City franchise is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his 11-year major league career, the
31-year-old righthander is taking the mound in a uniform other than
that of the Royals, a small-market club that has become content
with being ``competitive'' with mostly untested talent. Appier
understands this, but he still doesn't know why it took so long for
him to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   If you recall, in the dreadful winter of 1994-95, Appier was on
the verge of joining the Red Sox, whom he will face Wednesday night
in the third game of this series. These were the days of the
baseball strike, when owners and players battled over the
definition of free agency. At one point, the owners implemented a
system of restricted free agency that included the right of first
refusal, similar to football's system at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A player like Appier, who had four years of service, could
change clubs with virtually no fear that the Royals would match the
offer from a large-market club. A deal was agreed to with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the players' union challenged the owners in court, and the
implemented system eventually was repealed by the National Labor
Relations Board, voiding Appier's deal. Owners ultimately agreed to
return a six-year period to qualify for free agency. Appier had to
wait two more years. He returned to Kansas City, where he had three
good seasons before suffering a shoulder injury (three torn
ligaments) in a freak accident in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Appier missed almost all of 1998, making only three starts after
returning from rehab. He survived the winter trading season and a
spring search for pitching by several clubs, including the Red Sox
and Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But just before the Aug. 1 trading deadline, Appier was dealt to
Oakland for three prospects, pitchers Blake Stein, Brad Rigby, and
Jeff D'Amico. Appier was elated. After years of seeing veterans
around the league traded to contending clubs, the system had
finally worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   Appier, who will be a free agent after this season, suddenly is
the ace on an Oakland team that is making a serious run at the
American League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful to be traded to a much better situation,''
said Appier. ``I don't know about being the ace of the staff. We've
got a lot of good pitchers here and a good starting rotation. I
just picture myself as one of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If his stuff on the mound is close to what it was in the mid
'90s, he could one of the guys for someone for a long, long time.
It happened for Bret Saberhagen, Tom Gordon, and David Cone, all
former teammates in Kansas City. They found fame and fortune
waiting for them upon their escape. Why not Appier?
</P>
<P>
   As a Royal, Appier toiled in relative obscurity, but baseball
people were aware of his talent. Appier was 15-8 in 1992, 18-8 in
1993 and 15-10 in 1995. Before the trade, Appier was 9-9 with
Kansas City. He has won all three of his starts with the A's, who
look to him for wins and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is very good,'' said young Tim Hudson, who was top dog
in the Oakland rotation until Appier and Omar Olivares were
acquired. ``They definitely added some depth to our staff. Every
time he and Olivares go out there, we have a chance to win. Not
only that, you have to appreciate the experience that they bring to
myself and the other younger guys on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Art Howe, ``Kevin is a great addition to our club
and we hope he'll be around for a long time. He's started three
games and won all of them. His stuff is still good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Appier, ``the Royals had some talent but they
were reluctant to mix in some veterans to make the group more
cohesive. But this team has not only youngsters but enough veterans
to make the puzzle fit together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing ever works out the way you think it will, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to go someplace,'' said Appier, ``but when the word
came down, I was actually surprised. I had been part of so many
trade rumors that never turned out to be anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was ready. I called up and said, `Oakland.' It
certainly wasn't one of the teams I'd heard about. I like our
chances. I definitely think we have a chance to catch Texas and
even pass them. But considering how good they are, I don't expect
that to be an easy task. Obviously, they have a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't have Kevin Appier.

ANIMALS ARE PEOPLE TOO, A LEGAL NICHE SEEMS TO SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.C., Pa.) (sw) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a generation after civil rights and environmental
lawyers took their battles to the courts, there are now lawyers who
say they are following in those footsteps on behalf of clients with
names like Freckles and Muffin and Rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for creatures like performing orangutans and dogs used
in experimentation, the lawyers are creating a new field of animal
law with far more ambitious goals than traditionally weak
anti-cruelty laws. They are filing novel lawsuits and producing new
legal scholarship to try to chip away at a fundamental principle of
American law that animals are property and have no rights.
</P>
<P>
   These lawyers are more than brief-writing counterparts of animal
activists who throw paint on fur wearers.
</P>
<P>
   And they are influenced by developing scientific and ethical
scholarship showing animals to have far higher levels of cognition
and social development than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the fledgling field of animal law took an important
step toward legitimacy when two of the country's most prestigious
law schools, Harvard and Georgetown, announced that they would
offer courses in animal law for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The animal lawyers have also gained a handful of court victories
in recent years, the most important of which was a federal appeals
court decision last year that gave a human zoo visitor the right to
sue to get companionship for chimpanzees. And since 1994,
legislatures across the country have given these lawyers a potent
new tool by sharply upgrading animal cruelty crimes from
misdemeanors to felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created a field of law,'' said Joyce Tischler,
executive director of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, an
organization based in Petaluma, Calif., with an annual budget of $3
million. ``We've learned our trade and now we are focusing on the
next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics ridicule animal law as the latest example of absurdity
in the legal system. They see it as an attack on the economic
system's reliance on animal products that could wreak havoc in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would even bacteria have rights?'' asked Richard A. Epstein, a
professor at the University of Chicago Law School. ``There would be
nothing left of human society if we treated animals not as property
but as independent holders of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The animal lawyers say the idea that animals are mere property
evolved centuries before modern notions of some animals as sentient
beings with perceptions and even emotions. The lawyers have been
moving on many different fronts to establish precedents that they
say could provide a foundation for direct attacks on the property
status of animals.
</P>
<P>
   In civil cases involving veterinary malpractice or pet deaths,
some lawyers have won verdicts and settlements of $15,000 or more.
Lawyers have also had success in battling what they call execution
orders, the sort of routine euthanasia that occurs when dogs bite
people.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., two lawyers who had worked in Ralph Nader
organizations started a firm specializing in animal law six years
ago. The firm, Meyer &AMP; Glitzenstein, now with five lawyers, handles
complex cases involving animal issues, like filings with federal
agencies concerning standards for the treatment of circus
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the firm's lawyers announced an important victory in
a legal battle that had gone to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The
organizers of an annual pigeon shoot in Hegins, Pa., canceled the
event. The animal lawyers were seeking an injunction to stop the
shoot, which has taken place for 65 years, on grounds of animal
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a groundbreaking ruling was issued in a case that
involved an apparently lonely chimpanzee named Barney. In its
decision, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. gave a
human zoo visitor the legal standing to sue the government to try
to force it to issue regulations assuring chimpanzees group living
arrangements and appropriate amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The suit involving Barney (and a female monkey named Samantha
who was alone in a cage near Barney's at the Long Island Game Farm
Park and Zoo) was filed under 1985 amendments to the Federal Animal
Welfare Act that had received little judicial interpretation. The
1985 law said that conditions of confinement must assure ``the
psychological well being of primates.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie J. Stanley, a lawyer who worked on the case, said the
law ``does not mean you throw them a toy and you give them an
orange once a month.'' The decision has been widely viewed as
giving people new powers to challenge the living conditions of
animals that are publicly displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is still being fought in federal court, but Barney was
shot to death by a zoo employee in 1996 after he escaped from his
cage, bit someone and uprooted a sign, which he threw at a
merry-go-round.
</P>

   Some animal lawyers say they are in the field to advance
philosophical beliefs, but some say it is an area of legal practice
that could grow in profitability. The lawyers in private practice
charge fees to human clients, like pet owners. Some groups, like
the Animal Legal Defense Fund, pay salaries to staff lawyers. And
lawyers for industry groups that battle the animal lawyers say
millions of dollars are available from animal welfare groups to pay
for legal work that advances their aims.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Critics of the animal law movement, including livestock groups
and representatives of pharmaceutical companies that rely on animal
experimentation, say such rulings are an alarming foot in the
courthouse door for advocates of animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to use the courts to put us out of business,
they've got a pretty effective tool,'' said Steve L. Kopperud,
president of the Animal Industry Foundation, a livestock and
poultry group. ``I look at this as an abuse of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal lawyers say civil rights and environmental lawyers faced
ridicule, too. In interviews, several animal lawyers noted
parallels with lawyers who began the fights for integration or
clean air.
</P>
<P>
   The new legal field, for example, has a single scholarly
journal, Animal Law, which has been published for five years by the
same law school that published the first environmental law journal
30 years ago, Northwestern School of Law of Lewis &AMP; Clark College
in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Law serves as a manifesto for lawyers in the field.
Steven M. Wise, the Boston animal lawyer who is to teach the course
this spring at Harvard Law School, has argued in articles in the
journal that rights to bodily integrity and liberty should be given
first to chimpanzees because they are so similar to people.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who once listed a captive dolphin named Rainbow as the
plaintiff in a suit against an aquarium, is one of a group of
perhaps 30 lawyers across the country who spend most of their time
on animal issues. Hundreds more, including lawyers at some of the
country's largest law firms, handle animal cases on a volunteer
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who taught animal law this summer at John Marshall Law
School in Chicago, said the legal work now being done on behalf of
animals is paving the way for change. ``It is a long-term
strategy,'' he said, ``to show that animals are not just things for
our use.''
</P>
<P>
   One example, he said, is a case he is currently handling in a
Massachusetts appeals court on behalf of the owners of seven pet
sheep who were killed by two dogs owned by a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Because animals are property under American law, damages are
generally limited to their market value. But in some cases animal
lawyers have persuaded courts to award added damages for loss of
companionship or for the emotional distress of the owner when a pet
is killed.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the slain sheep, Wise said, could help establish
that market value is not adequate compensation. The sheep owners, a
childless taxidermist and his wife, Wise said, were attached to the
animals. ``I am talking about people who let the sheep in the house
and baked them muffins,'' Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   The animal lawyers' strategy has included a campaign to increase
the criminal penalties for animal cruelty. In 1994, all but six
states regarded such violations as misdemeanors, with small fines
and short jail terms. Now 27 states make such violations felonies,
with fines as high as $100,000 and prison terms as long as 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   American anti-cruelty laws typically declare that people cannot
be prosecuted for standard farming practices, like beef
slaughtering. But there have been some felony prosecutions
involving malicious mistreatment or torture of farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in northeastern North Carolina, a district attorney,
Frank R. Parrish, announced that state's first felony animal
cruelty indictment. He took the case involving hog farm workers to
a grand jury after an animal welfare group, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, gave him videotape that one of its employees
had secretly recorded after he worked undercover at the hog farm.
</P>
<P>
   The animal activists and their lawyers said the tape clearly
showed hogs being beaten and skinned alive.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, who face sentences of as much as 15 months if
convicted, have not yet entered pleas. But the manager of the farm,
Fred Cunningham, issued a statement saying the the farm was
committed to humane practices and that scenes on the tape ``seem
certain to be staged.'' Neither the farm nor Cunningham, a
veterinarian, face any charges.
</P>
<P>
   Some animal lawyers say cases like the North Carolina
prosecution are legal milestones. But even among animal lawyers
there are sharp disagreements over strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gary L. Francione, a professor who teaches
animal law at Rutgers Law School, said animal lawyers should be
much more aggressive than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Francione, once a law clerk to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of
the Supreme Court, said they should, for example, file suit on
behalf of gorillas asserting that ``they should be declared to be
`persons' under the Constitution,'' with constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, most animal lawyers are adopting a more
incremental approach. The Animal Legal Defense Fund, for example,
has a staff lawyer who spends all her time studying precedents,
like the legal steps taken in the emancipation of human slaves,
that could be used on behalf of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many similarities to other legal movements,
some animal lawyers say there are differences too. For example,
several of them, like Ms. Tischler of the defense fund, said they
no longer ate animal products. ``My commitment,'' she said, ``is I
don't eat my clients.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Two Serbs were killed and five were
injured in a mortar attack on their village in southeastern Kosovo
on Monday night, the latest act of violence against the province's
dwindling ethnic Serb population.
</P>
<P>
   Silvana Spasic, 24 and Tihomir Radic, 26, were killed instantly
when mortar rounds exploded on the street in the village, Klokot,
just after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers buried them Tuesday, their coffins carried on two
trailers drawn by tractors. Women in black sat weeping beside the
coffins. The men of the village followed on foot in a procession to
the small church where a service was held.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred on the village _ part of the U.S. sector
under the peacekeeping agreement for Kosovo _ even while it was
guarded by a unit of the 1st Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.
The mortars landed right next to its command post in the village,
although no U.S. soldiers were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Shrapnel ripped right through a concrete fence. Tuesday, a pool
of dried blood in the white dust of the street marked the spot
where the young woman and man died.
</P>
<P>
   The mortar attack was not the first on the predominantly Serb
village. U.S. soldiers said there had been mortar attacks on Aug.
10 and 12. Both times, a number of rounds landed in or near the
village.
</P>
<P>
   After a preliminary investigation, U.S. peacekeepers said they
believed that the attackers had fired from a roadside _ a location
that is in the direction of a nearby Kosovo Albanian village _ and
had fled by car, taking the mobile mortar tube and base with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people behind this are Albanian _ they harass the
population to get them to leave,'' 1st Lt. Ryan Leigh, who was on
guard in the village, told The Guardian newspaper. ``As to who is
actually doing it, I couldn't really say.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the peacekeeping force, Maj. Roland Lavoie, said
he did not think the victims had been singled out as targets of the
attack. ``The mortar is an indiscriminate weapon,'' he said. ``It
is more harassment or intending to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was just one of a series of recent violent attacks.
Anti-tank grenades have been fired on the Serb quarter of the
northern town of Mitrovica over the last two weeks as Serbs and
Albanians have had a standoff over whether Albanian families could
return to homes in the quarter of the city controlled by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a series of hand-grenade attacks in the town of
Lipljan, and police have arrested a group of Albanian teen-agers
and charged them in the attacks. Two more grenade attacks near
Pristina, the capital, put three people in hospital Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if the attacks are random criminal or revenge
attacks, or a coordinated campaign by Albanians, or even the
guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, to force the remaining
Serb population to flee. Human rights organizations have blamed the
rebel group for much of the violence, although some incidents
appear to be more criminal in motive.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is clear though, that the peacekeepers have not been able to
prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although encouraged by the decrease in violence and other
criminal acts,'' the peacekeeping force ``remains vigilant in its
efforts to cut further the number of offenses, particularly those
committed against minorities,'' the press office reported in its
daily release on Tuesday. A few paragraphs lower down the page, it
reported the deadly mortar attack in Klokot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 percent of the prewar Serb population remains in
Kosovo. Well over 100,000 have fled to other parts of Serbia since
Serbian forces departed and NATO troops arrived to secure a
peaceful return for the Kosovo Albanians who were forced to leave
their homes by government troops during the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred Serbs remain in Pristina, where once 30,000
lived, and there are isolated pockets of a few thousand each around
the province. The largest number of Serbs are now found in the
villages of eastern Kosovo, although their safety is coming more
and more under threat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Serb villagers in Klokot remained defiant on Tuesday, saying
they were determined to stay on in their homes, but they are
evidently fearful.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping troops had to provide an armed escort for the
injured to go into the nearby town for first aid, and for the
villagers to fetch two coffins for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are staying _ we've got nowhere else to go,'' one villager,
Slobodan Peric, 53, told The Guardian. ``We want the Serbian army
and police to return to defend us. We can't work, we can't go
anywhere. There is no one to protect us. All the foreigners and the
Kosovo Liberation Army want is an ethnically pure Kosovo.''

SPORTS COLUMN: COUGHLIN'S RIGID RULE IS MELLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Coughlin has supposedly gone soft this year _ all hugs and
kisses. When he was named coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars five
years ago his players had to keep their chin straps buttoned at all
times and both feet firmly planted on the floor during team
meetings. His training camps were like eight weeks with the Marines
and players dropped like flies. Coughlin was respected and hated
all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Now his Jaguars are poised for a Super Bowl run and Coughlin has
grown up as a coach, the way his team has grown into a contender.
He has eased some of his stern rules and now allows players to
police themselves. This year during two-a-day practices under the
blistering sun, players wear pads for only half of the day,
something Coughlin had never done before.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think Coughlin is all cotton candy. This month after
an intense practice Coughlin and the Pro Bowl receiver Jimmy Smith
were involved in a heated 15-minute discussion after Smith dropped
a pass. Coughlin called Smith out in the front of the team and
Smith, who has more receiving yards the last three years than any
other receiver in the league, was visibly angry and yelled back at
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin was asked what led to the blowup. ``That was
personal,'' Coughlin said. ``He wanted to know where the best
places to eat in town were and I tried to help.''
</P>
<P>
   This year could see massive changes among the head coaches in
the National Football League. More than a half-dozen face dismissal
and a few more may retire. One person likely to walk away from
coaching after this year is the Jets' Bill Parcells. And there is
only one man who can carry on the Parcells traditions of brilliant
coaching, an unabashed ruthless nature, and an ability to command
so much respect that an owner will trust his franchise worth
hundreds of millions of dollars to one man.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal person to recreate the Parcells manifesto is Coughlin.
There is no better heir apparent. The defensive coordinator, Bill
Belichick, will most likely be the next Jets coach, as he should
be, but Coughlin is the true pupil of the Parcells doctrine that
says thou shall run a team with a relentless, smart, iron hand.
Coughlin, in other words, is the Parcells of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants play Jacksonville on Saturday and will get a close
look at one of the league's top five teams. Giants Stadium is a
familiar setting for Coughlin, who was an assistant under Parcells
when the Giants were being built into Super Bowl champions. The
stories about Coughlin's work ethic are legendary. Parcells once
caught him in the office paging through game plans on Christmas
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin runs the Jaguars the way Parcells runs the Jets.
Nothing is left to chance and everything is piped through their
offices. Like Parcells with the Jets, Coughlin is Jacksonville's
general manager, personnel chief, rules regulator and news media
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Like Parcells, Coughlin is a control freak. Several years ago,
offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride was so upset at Coughlin's
meddling in the offense, he threatened to quit; and Coughlin was
also tough on Gilbride's replacement, Chris Palmer, sometimes
vetoing play calls Palmer sent down from the booth.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin decided this year he didn't need an offensive
coordinator and will call the plays himself. One more title to add
to the resume.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other do-everything coaches in the league.
Denver's Mike Shanahan, Seattle's Mike Holmgren, and Miami's Jimmy
Johnson are a few. Like Parcells, Coughlin often forbids the news
media to speak to his assistants and the Jaguars players are
careful about what they say to reporters so as not to receive a
lecture from Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   But also like Parcells, the Jaguars' coach surrounds himself
with smart people. Parcells has Belichick, and now Coughlin has the
former Carolina coach, Dom Capers. Capers popularized the
mind-scrambling zone blitz defensive schemes with the Panthers and
though it will take some time for the Jacksonville players to
absorb all of Capers' packages, there is no question the team will
benefit quickly. Last week, in Jacksonville's 35-10 crushing
victory over the Panthers, linebacker Kevin Hardy got a sack on the
first play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's Jaguars are ready to make their Super Bowl run _ now.
They have an explosive offense led by quarterback Mark Brunell and
a rapidly improving defense that added the Pro Bowl safety Carnell
Lake. All Coughlin needs now is to get his players to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Just like his idol Parcells is doing with the Jets right now.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through a sleepless night, Mehmet Saracoglu kept
vigil by his phone in Sunnyside, Queens, thinking only of the
family he feared dead in an earthquake a continent away.
</P>
<P>
   He called Turkey every few minutes until midnight, but got only
busy signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the television, there was all destruction,'' said
Saracoglu, 26, the owner of Turkiyem, a neighborhood grocery store
on Skillman Avenue and 46th Street. ``I could not sleep; I was so
full of hope and fear.''
</P>
<P>
   His prayers were not answered until after 8 Tuesday morning,
when his phone rang with the faint whisper of his father's voice
crackling on the other end. His parents, Burhan and Hatice, and
three siblings, had escaped unharmed from their vacation spot in
Izmit, Turkey, near the epicenter of an earthquake that killed at
least 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives said they were safe at an uncle's house on the
Asiatic side of Istanbul, and were hoping to make it home to the
European side, across the Bosporus. They did not know if their
house had crumbled like so many others shown on Turkish television
that morning, but they were alive. The call faded out before
Saracoglu could give them his love.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's voice was so strange that, at first, I thought
someone had died,'' he said. ``But everyone was OK, so I was filled
with joy for a minute. Then I thought about all my other relatives
and friends in Istanbul and I wanted to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others in this heavily Turkish enclave of Queens near the
Queensboro Bridge were glued to their televisions, looking for a
glimpse of a relative's home, and worrying when the reception from
their satellite dishes began to fade. Others gathered in stores to
trade news, or buy phone cards with hopes of finally getting
through clogged phone lines to see if their families were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Kir, a 33-year-old employee at Sunny Grocery on 43rd Avenue
and 46th Street, said that friends in Turkey told him that power
was nonexistent as far as Giresun, a town far north on the Black
Sea. ``My family is there but no one can get through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The little grocery store is a way station for many new Turkish
immigrants seeking a new home in the United States. Through its
owner, Vedat Evren, the grocery has become the center of a social
network providing housing, jobs, food and sometimes money to new
Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it served a different role: a place of tense quiet,
where people could get the latest information from the
quake-stricken land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a mother and two children dead on Turkish television and
I was crying,'' said Irfan Bekdenir, 40, who had recently heard
that his sister and brother were safe in Ankara but remained
worried about his mother and other relatives in Istanbul. ``I don't
want to watch anymore, I just feel too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Aret Musaian, faulted Turkish officials for not
preparing for such catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was California, maybe 10 people would have been killed
in such an earthquake,'' he said. ``But the Turkish government has
let this happen by not making sure buildings are sturdy. Everyone
knew that an earthquake like this was coming sooner or later. Now
it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL END)
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of quiet until the door of the grocery opened
again, bringing with it another worried person looking for answers.
It was Murat Kaya. Rubbing at the bags under his dark eyes, he went
from one man to another, talking softly about his missing parents,
Bronx residents on vacation in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit at home and watch CNN but see nothing,'' he said. ``I
just hoped someone here could give me some good news.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Victim's wife sues three firms, Barton's estate
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first civil lawsuit filed in the Buckhead rampage
that left nine people dead and 13 people wounded claims a
securities firm frequented by mass murderer Mark O. Barton could
have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized
their traders more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Weinstock said All-Tech Securities Inc., one of
the companies where Barton traded regularly, should have known of
Barton's volatile personality, given the hundreds of thousands of
dollars he lost while trading there and his reaction to those
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed on behalf of Dr. Gulsham Harjee, whose
husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed by Barton while he traded at
All-Tech on the afternoon of July 29, also claims the firm should
have foreseen the killings because of the stressful nature inherent
in the day trading arena. Harjee declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite it's knowledge of the extreme pressures of day
trading, All-Tech did not screen its clients for criminal or
violent tendencies or emotional stability before allowing them to
participate as day traders at its facilities,'' the complaint read.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech officials should have known Barton especially posed a
threat to its employees and customers, Weinstock said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barton was no choir boy,'' Weinstock said. ``Shouldn't these
firms where so much pressure and high-risk trading is done every
day check these people out?'' Barton was losing a lot of money, and
the company chose not to check him out, Weinstock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They buried their head,'' Weinstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had not seen the 16-page complaint, All-Tech's chief
executive officer, Harry Houtkin, said he was not surprised by the
suit. ``This is a tragedy,'' he said, ``but in today's litigious
society, I expected this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Harjee is seeking undetermined damages from the Piedmont Center,
Barton Protective Services and Barton's estate. Barton Protective
Services, the company that provides security for the Piedmont
Center, a complex of 11 buildings where All-Tech's offices are
located, is not connected to Mark Barton. The security company's
chief financial officer, David Brazel, also declined comment on the
suit, as did officials of the Piedmont Center.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also alleges the four parties failed to maintain a
safe working environment for Delawalla and other victims and seeks
damages for wrongful death, negligence, violation of a private
duty, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional
distress and loss of consortium. Harjee also seeks assault and
battery damages against Barton's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech
and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was
a regular. The killings were initiated at Momentum, directly across
the street from All-Tech.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 other people also were wounded. In the two days
before the shootings, Barton also killed his wife and two children,
beating them to death with a claw hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated chemist-turned-day trader killed himself the
night of the multiple murders after two officers surrounded his
minivan at an Acworth gas station.

A LAND WITH RHYTHM AND BEATS FOR ALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I live in a country every map maker will respect. It is a place
with many languages, cultural differences and alternate histories,
as much a nation as ancient Rome or 19th-century England.
</P>
<P>
   A place my countrymen call White Imperialism, purposely invoking
all of the bloody acquisition and manifest destiny that enabled
nationalists throughout history to march to power. Our path to
nationhood has been paved by many fathers: Alexander the Great,
Napoleon, Cecil Rhodes, Hernando Cortes, General Custer and Pat
Boone. And now we are coming for hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Our army amassed at Woodstock '99. More than 200,000 troops
strong. When DMX _ who, more than most popular rappers before him,
orients his music toward a strictly black audience _ came on stage,
the almost entirely white crowd pumped its collective fist in the
air and sang along with every word, drowning out DMX himself as
they shouted the lyrics to ``My Niggas.''
</P>
<P>
   Then our brave troops watched the most popular white rock bands
of today _ Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Insane Clown Posse, Everlast,
Korn, Rage Against the Machine _ shamelessly plunder every trick in
the hip-hop book without ever trying to display (with the sole
exception of Everlast) any hip-hop credentials. And then our army
raped, pillaged and looted. That's what armies do.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the revolution was televised.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes: rap _ like most everything from the blues to
alternative rock before it _ has been officially embraced by those
who originally ostracized it, avariciously consumed by those it was
invented in part to declare independence from.
</P>
<P>
   At least this is one way to see it, chalking up the immense
popularity of rap among white musicians and fans to a tradition of
cultural theft going back to the days of minstrelsy, when white
entertainers would visit plantations to gather new songs and dances
from slaves. This may be part of the picture, but it's not the
whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   Because I also live in another nation. It is a country no map
maker, cultural critic, radio programmer or marketing consultant
will ever respect. A place where the language, culture and history
are always changing. A place many of my countrymen don't even know
they are living in.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world beyond racial boundaries and mythologies. It has
no name, but for now we can call it Gray, because it is neither
black nor white. Map makers and radio programmers are people who
need borders, but this world eludes them because it has no clear
borders, and we don't want it to.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation, the boundaries are more fluid and blurry than
many people would like to believe: white people are listening to
and using elements of rap not for theft but because they relate to
it, because the music is a legitimate part of their cultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white music fans are driving around flipping back and
forth between the local rock and rap radio stations, simply looking
for the best song.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation, white rappers like Eminem are moving freely
between urban and rock radio, between guest appearances on rap and
rock records, between hard rock and gangsta rap concerts without
changing a word or note.
</P>
<P>
   And in this nation black rappers are finding that it is now
possible to serve both the black and the white audience without
betraying either; they are finding that any adolescent who has ever
felt victimized can relate to most rap lyrics because pop music has
always communicated through metaphor, innuendo and fantasy; and
they are finding that certain common denominators transcend race,
as in the Jay-Z and DMX song ``Money, Cash, Hoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, not only is the most important and popular white music
being made derived from rap, but hip-hop is easily the most
important genre in America. It dominates popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from Europop to teeny-bop incorporates some elements
of hip-hop; even the genre's trailblazers, the Sugar Hill Gang,
have transformed into a lovable oldies act that just recorded a
kid's album and is currently touring with Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes the notion of race and rap an extremely
complicated one, in which creating a black-white dichotomy is an
oversimplification. The hip-hop nation, the imperialist nation and
the gray nation exist simultaneously and overlap one another (as
well as portions of many other nations, including Latin-American
and Asian-American ones, that have taken hip-hop to heart), all of
them muddled together in a society that remains on the whole a
racist one.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, rap has been integral to youth life style since
at least 1986, when for the first time a rap album (by the Beastie
Boys) crossed over to No. 1 on the Billboard charts. Back then,
when white kids _ the Beastie Boys, Rick Rubin and hard-rock bands
like Faith No More and Anthrax _ were getting into rap, it was a
genre they were just discovering.
</P>
<P>
   But today, rap (with 70 percent of its records sold to a white
audience) is like the Beatles. It is a birthright, something white
kids grow up listening to, a standard by which they calibrate their
lifetime notion of pop music. And as they grow older, the music
they want to make and hear is music that incorporates both genres
(just as Kid Rock says today that he was weaned on both Lynyrd
Skynyrd and Big Daddy Kane).
</P>
<P>
   White kids are also intrinsically attracted to hip-hop because
it is the only popular music genre that their rockist baby-boomer
parents just don't get. The great lie of hip-hop, what has enabled
it to remain vital for some 20 years, is that it is a heavily coded
dialogue made by and for the urban black community.
</P>
<P>
   But the more street and coded hip-hop becomes (as in the music
of Juvenile, DMX, JT Money or Trick Daddy), the more attractive it
is to a middle-class white audience. Not only do more insider rules
and street signifiers make the club more exciting to join; they
also increase rap's power as fuel for the escapist suburban dreams
that were formerly the domain of heavy metal.
</P>
<P>
   So, understandably, there is a lot of hand-wringing going on in
the rap community, because the music's mission to spread across the
land has succeeded all too well. White kids are walking around
calling each other nigger, wearing T-shirts that say ``pimpin'
ain't easy'' and flashing gang signs they don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the movie ``Bulworth,'' even Warren Beatty seems
possessed by a desire to be a young black man in America today. In
the meantime, scores of white bands are incorporating hip-hop DJs
while just as many are rapping, but most without paying more than
lip service to the culture the music came from.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So is all of this easing the difficulty of being black in
America or exacerbating it? The genre is slipping through the
fingers of those who need it most, and they understandably don't
want to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   But rest assured, as hip-hop leaves its original context, it
transmutes (just as gospel became rhythm-and-blues in a secular
environment and rhythm-and-blues became rock `n' roll when Alan
Freed didn't want it to seem as if his 1950s white radio audience
was listening to black music). The best hip-hop performers will
always be black, just as the best blues performers were.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Clapton plays the blues, he knows the blues, he feels the
blues, he even releases whole albums of the blues, but nonetheless
few people see him as a bluesman. What most white performers are
doing with rap is hijacking it, using it to breathe new life into
their music, not unlike what the Beatles and the Rolling Stones did
with the blues (or what Jamaicans like Coxsone Dodd and the
Skatalites did with American R-and-B).
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe it will even result in a genre as important as
what we now fondly refer to as classic rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a put-down to say that a white kid can't
sing a black man's music,'' the former Rolling Stones bassist Bill
Wyman said in a recent interview in The Oxford American. ``If you
really love the music, you can get pretty close and you can do it
your way _ you don't do it their way. You start off with their
ideas, and you just slightly adapt them to suit you.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already at least five genres of white rap: the
metal-rap of Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock; the post modern rap-rock
collage of Beck and Beta Band; the lewd, sophomoric joke-rap of the
Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid; the gentle, spoken kiddie rap of
1,000 Clowns and LFO, and the all-embracing, old-school-conscious
rap, punk and electro fusion of the Beastie Boys and Len.
</P>
<P>
   Since Vanilla Ice's spurious rap credentials were exposed, few
white bands have tried to claim hip-hop credibility. The best way
to gain acceptance is to show knowledge but admit outsider status,
as Kid Rock and Eminem do, using rap to speak about growing up
impoverished and white. In some cases, indulging in the same
mythomania that gangsta rappers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ain't never been to the ghetto, don't ever come to the
ghetto, because you wouldn't understand the ghetto,'' Naughty by
Nature warned off all pretenders in 1991. And for the most part
they stayed away, with Kid Rock boasting in 1999, ``I ain't
straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem, despite naming himself after a candy that can be any
color on the outside but is always dark on the inside, is quick to
acknowledge his precedents. In songs, he describes himself as a
``corny-looking white boy'' and puts himself in the context of
previous white rappers (including MC Serch of 3rd Bass and the
former House of Pain member turned rocker Everlast) with the
lyrics, ``I'm on a Serch to crush a Milkbone/I'm Everlasting/I'll
melt Vanilla Ice like silicone.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rap movie ``Whiteboys'' begins by depicting three
teen-agers from the cornfields of Iowa freestyle rapping and
beat-boxing in their bedroom. But in the end, the movie's white,
Jewish creator, Danny Hoch, imbues the film with the message that
whitey just doesn't get it: you have to live it to rap it. It is a
message that paradoxically gives him status as an insider (he gets
to rap with Snoop Doggy Dogg on the soundtrack).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Everlast admits his lack of rock as well as rap
credentials with the album title ``Whitey Ford Sings the Blues,''
and it was the predominantly white rap group 3rd Bass that
condemned Vanilla Ice the most, creating a video that depicted the
rapper getting beat up for faking the funk.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the thesis that you have to live it to rap it is
another fallacy, given the wide spectrum of class backgrounds that
successful rappers come from. All you have to do is rap it as if
you live it.
</P>
<P>
   So who owns hip-hop? Is it the sub-section of fans that rolls
blunts with Dutch Masters, uses up-to-date slang and knows what an
MPC 2000 is? Is it members of the white lower class, one of the
only minorities in America that it's still PC to denigrate, or is
it all African-Americans under 35? Is it bands like the Beastie
Boys and DJs like Craze, the X-ecutioners and Shadow, who keep
alive the less mainstream aspects of the hip-hop arts? Is it
corporations that use hip-hop to sell hamburgers, like McDonald's,
or clothes, like Tommy Hilfiger? Is it Seagrams, Time Warner and
Thorn-EMI, the multinational conglomerates that distribute most of
the music?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the black Chicago businesswoman with the Lexus and the
white kid flipping burgers, the Crip in Compton and the frat boy in
Arizona, the French mama's boy in a track suit with one leg rolled
up and the Kurdish teen-ager with a drawer full of every bootleg
American cassette he can find?
</P>
<P>
   Because there is rap music that speaks to all these people.
This, at the dawn of a new millennium, is the hip-hop empire: an
aggregation of many nations, under God, very divisible, with rhymes
and beats for all.

NEW FIGURES SOOTHE WORRIES ABOUT INFLATION

 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. economy may be rocking and rolling, but inflation
remains remarkably well behaved.
</P>
<P>
   That was the main message from a fresh batch of government data
on consumer prices, industrial activity and home building released
Tuesday. The new evidence further soothed investors who have been
worrying that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest
rates more than a quarter-point next week to slow the economy. Bond
and stock prices rallied.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index _ a broad measure of inflation that
reflects the prices of imports and services as well as those of
domestically produced goods _ rose just three-tenths of a percent
last month after registering no increase at all in May and June, in
line with forecasts. Better still, most of the increase reflected
higher energy costs _ which were widely expected and raised
everything from gasoline prices to airline fares _ and another big
increase in cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the so-called core rate of inflation _ which
excludes volatile food and energy _ was up only two-tenths of a
percent in July despite the jump in transportation and tobacco
prices. That core rate has been creeping up more slowly than at the
same point last year, 1.7 percent compared with 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew energy was going to be up,'' said Cynthia Latta, an
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. ``There's
nothing here that looks alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, two highly cyclical sectors of the economy,
manufacturing and housing, continued to expand briskly last month.
Industrial production, which had been merely inching up earlier in
the summer, 0.7 percent in July. While the nationwide heat wave
accounted for heavy energy use and a bumper crop of
air-conditioners and fans, overall manufacturing output rose
robustly, by 0.6 percent, despite a drop in car production. And
construction of single-family homes and apartments, which cooled in
June as mortgage rates climbed higher, rebounded sharply last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that's telling you is that even the interest sensitive
sectors aren't cooling off with higher rates,'' said Roseanne Cahn,
chief equities economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``The
pickup in manufacturing is plenty strong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's reports bolstered investor sentiment that the Fed will
not raise the overnight bank lending rate, known as the federal
funds target rate, more than a quarter of a percentage point. In
the wake of a strong jobs report earlier this month, there had been
speculation on Wall Street that the Fed might raise the rate by as
much as a half-point. But a report on Friday showing a modest
increase in prices at the wholesale level in July combined with
Tuesday's figures have eased those concerns. Even a quarter-point
increase is no longer regarded as a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 50-50 whether there will be a tightening this month,''
said Ms. Latta. ``If I had to put money on it, I guess I'd put my
money on an October tightening. But it's such a close call.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the moment, the inflation picture is one of crosscurrents. On
the one hand, a number of the forces that clearly helped hold
inflation down in the past are fading. The slump in Japan and
Europe, which drove down world prices for energy and other raw
materials, seems to be over. The strong dollar, which made imports
a bargain for Americans, has lately been weakening. The wholesale
shift by employers to health maintenance organizations, which
drastically slowed the rise in health care costs, is almost
complete. At the same time, as Alan Greenspan, the fed chairman,
has emphasized again and again, the U.S. labor market remains
extraordinarily tight, with unemployment at a 30-year low and job
growth strong.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, rapid productivity gains are holding down
production costs and there is very little indication that strong
demand is giving corporations much leeway to pass cost increases on
to consumers in the form of higher prices. While an earlier report
by the National Association of Purchasing Managers showed that most
manufacturers say they are paying higher prices, few report that
they are receiving higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   One exception, of course, is energy, which posted the biggest
increase in July since last April, 2.1 percent. As a result,
transportation costs also leaped. Gasoline prices jumped 4.3
percent in July, and air fares surged 6.5 percent. Another
exception is tobacco prices, which surged 3.3 percent. The price of
imports _ about one fifth of everything American consumers buy _
are also going up.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of other goods are falling or rising more slowly
than in recent months. Food was up just 0.2 percent in July.
Housing costs, which account for nearly 40 percent of consumer
outlays, rose just 0.1 percent in July, half the June rate. Medical
care costs rose 0.3 percent, a bit more slowly than in June.
Meanwhile, despite the predominance of imports, clothing prices
continued to fall in July, dropping a hefty 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of pricing power is not preventing businesses from
producing more. The July gain in industrial production was the
biggest monthly gain since March. Excluding cars, manufacturing
output was up nearly a percentage point. U.S. factories are pumping
out lots of big ticket items for American homes, including
appliances, home computers and, of course, air conditioners. But
they are also churning out a lot more business equipment,
especially computers, which are up 15.2 percent from a year ago,
but also heavy industrial gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slump in manufacturing that we saw early in the year is
over,'' Ms. Latta said. ``Exports have been deteriorating, so this
indicates very strong domestic demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in Tuesday's numbers _ given that mortgage
rates have recently climbed to 8.15 percent _ was the jump in new
housing starts. After dipping in June, housing starts rose 5.7
percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.661 million
units, soaring in the West and posting solid gains in the South and
Northeast. The rebound was particularly surprising given that
contractors nationwide have been reporting shortages of both labor
and building materials. And even more so because mortgage rates
have lately climbed over 8 percent to their highest level in two
years. Ms. Latta pointed out that many buyers are rushing to lock
in deals because they expect rates to go even higher while others
are switching to adjustable rate mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that the rise in rates doesn't have as big an
impact as you might think,'' she said.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At least 2,000 people have been reported
killed by the powerful earthquake that struck northwest Turkey
before dawn on Tuesday, destroying thousands of buildings and
giving rise to a vast archipelago of tent-cities erected by people
afraid to sleep indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, which struck at 3:02 am. local time on Tuesday,
ripped through villages and cities while most people were asleep.
Thousands were shaken out of their slumber to find walls
collapsing, windows shattering and roofs tumbling down on top of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Countless bodies remained trapped under pulverized buildings
early Wednesday morning. The most passionate plea from Turkish
government officials to neighboring countries has been for more
digging equipment and more dogs to help locate bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit was the industrial city of Izmit, about 55 miles
east of Istanbul, where as many as 1,000 people were killed, most
of them trapped inside huge apartment buildings that crumbled
within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, site of a naval base on the southern coast of the
Izmit Gulf, more than 248 sailors and naval officers were trapped
under collapsed buildings, with scores of people still unaccounted
for by late Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was by far the strongest on record in this area,
although the exact magnitude has not been determined. Turkish
seismologists said the quake registered a magnitude of 6.7, while
U.S. scientists first reported a magnitude of 7.8 but said
additional measurements of the quake's intensity could lower that
number.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, hundreds of buildings collapsed to dusty piles of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic, endless and exhausting race to dig out bodies from
beneath the wreckage, rescue crews used bulldozers, tower cranes,
front-end loaders and jackhammers to dig into piles of debris 20
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul on Tuesday night became transformed into a city of
tents and lean-to shelters as hundreds of thousands of people,
afraid of aftershocks, camped out across the city along highways,
in parks and in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is too afraid to stay indoors,'' said Aydin Ayaydin,
a member of Parliament who represents the Avcilar district of
Istanbul, an area where as many as 70 buildings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Jusuf Sever, a 54-year-old high-school teacher in Avcilar,
watched in shell-shocked dismay Tuesday evening as soldiers and
about 100 construction workers tried to dig through the mountain of
concrete that had been his apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fast asleep, along with my wife and my daughter, when we
woke up and the whole building was swaying back and forth,'' he
recalled, pointing to what remained of his bed on the fringes of
the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the ceiling was gone and we were looking at the
stars in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Sever's apartment was on the fourth floor of a six-story
building. The two floors above him were simply ripped off the top
of the building, which allowed the family to escape without injury
before the rest of the building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenarios played out across a wide swath of Turkey,
which included highly populated regions like Istanbul, with 12
million people, and Izmit, with nearly 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many people were already raising questions about whether
slip-shod construction practices had made a bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   In areas that were badly hit by the quake, many buildings with
little visible damage stood beside others that were utterly
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of buildings along the main road through the
Avcilar section were still standing, interspersed every few blocks
by apartment buildings that were heaps of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively new five-story apartment building with balconies
and satellite dishes looked as if it been pulled out of the ground
and tilted on its side. Each floor, from the front balconies to the
rear windows, remained parallel to the one above it but now sloped
at a 45-degree angle toward the ground.

ACLU TO SUE OKLAHOMA SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER STUDENT DRUG TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Okla., Ind., Idaho, N.C., S.C., Wyo., Fla., Wis., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a pointed challenge to a policy adopted by an increasing
number of the nation's high schools, the American Civil Liberties
Union said it would file suit Wednesday against an Oklahoma school
district that administers drug tests to students who want to
participate in extracurricular activities like the debate team,
chorus and Future Farmers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. Supreme Court refused last year, without
comment, to hear a challenge to a drug-test requirement for
after-school programs at an Indiana high school, the ACLU contends
that the Tecumseh School District in Oklahoma has gone a critical
step further: Many extracurricular activities are tied to courses
during the regular school day.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, according to the ACLU and the two teen-age plaintiffs it
is representing in the suit, anyone at Tecumseh High School who
refuses to submit to the urine test required for the choir, for
example, would have to drop the accompanying music course, which
provides a credit for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   And that, the civil liberties union argues, is a violation of a
student's right to a public education, as well as of the Fourth
Amendment protection against illegal search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Boyd, a lawyer for the ACLU's National Drug Policy
Litigation Project, wrote in papers that the group intends to file
that by ``targeting a group of students who are relatively unlikely
to use drugs'' and who are participating in activities with ``no
physical danger,'' the district was not addressing a ``proven
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In filing a complaint in federal District Court in Oklahoma City
against Tecumseh, the school district of a rural town about 45
miles to the southeast, the civil liberties union says it is
attempting to check a rash of tests for illegal substances that,
while largely accepted when applied to athletes, have recently been
applied to thousands of students involved in more cerebral
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Individual school districts in Idaho, North Carolina and
Wyoming, among other states, have implemented similar policies for
cheerleaders, language club members and chess competitors in the
last year, while other districts in Wisconsin, South Carolina, Ohio
and Florida are considering expanding such testing to nonathletes.
Proponents argue that an extracurricular activity is a privilege,
not a right, and should be open only to those who are demonstrably
drug- and alcohol-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts get blamed for a lot of different things,''
said Linda Meoli, a lawyer representing the Oklahoma district.
``Unfortunately, we have to be policemen, we have to be
psychologists, we have to be parents, and educators are far down
the list. Some school districts feel like they have to take a
proactive role in keeping children safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsay Earls, 16, one of the two plaintiffs in the Oklahoma
case, says the policy is less about safety than a humiliating
invasion into students' lives. On Jan. 12, she said in an
interview, she was pulled out of a choral rehearsal in the middle
of the school day and escorted to the girls' bathroom. There, she
said, a monitor stood guard outside a stall while she filled a cup
with urine.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay said that while she opposed the test philosophically,
she did not want to be dropped from the choir, and so she
consented. ``I would have been out of my activities, which is
unacceptable to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As in other districts _ including Winston-Salem/Forsyth in North
Carolina, and smaller localities like Campbell County, Wyo., and
Council, Idaho _ the policy in Tecumseh applies to ``illegal and/or
performance-enhancing drugs,'' including alcohol, marijuana and
amphetamines. Though the testing was random last year, when the
policy began, students were told to present samples before joining
activities this year, Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent of schools referred all questions to Ms.
Meoli, the district lawyer, who refused to answer any questions
about the policy's implementation, including whether any tests had
returned positive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the policy says that no student will be subject to
``academic sanctions,'' Lindsay said she knew of several students
who had to drop out of the choir, and its academic course, because
they refused to consent to a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the Oklahoma district's policy breaks with that
of Rush County, Ind., the district whose policy was challenged as
high as the Supreme Court last year, having been upheld by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Rush County, a district 45 minutes southeast of Indianapolis,
students who fail the drug test _ or decline to take it _ are
barred from after-school activities and concerts, as well as from
driving to school, but can keep any course credits by sitting in
with the band or debate team during meetings in the regular school
day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lyskowinski, the superintendent in Rush County, said that of
250 students tested in the high school last year, 30 tested
positive for tobacco, a substance barred by the policy, and one
student tested positive for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adopted this policy,'' he said, ``so students could say on
Friday night, `I don't want to drink, I don't want to smoke,
because next week I want to participate in an athletic contest or
whatever extracurricular activity, or drive to school.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because the Supreme Court declined to take up the Rush County
policy, it remains unclear how firm a precedent it will prove to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The program in Rush County goes considerably beyond a student
drug-testing policy that the Supreme Court upheld in 1995, in an
Oregon case that applied only to student athletes. In that case,
the court found that an existing drug problem and the role of
athletes as student leaders justified the policy.
</P>
<P>
   For Daniel James, 16, the other plaintiff in the Oklahoma case,
the district drug policy has put him in a predicament, making him
choose between his ``rights'' and his extracurricular activities;
he's a member of the academic team, which competes in statewide
quiz competitions, which he knows are valued by college admissions
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just really interferes with my academic goals,'' he said,
``to go to a competitive college and not some slacker college.''

   Baker, Menendez intrigue Falcons, but winning job won't be easy
</P>
<P>
   By Matt Winkeljohn
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Eugene Baker and Rondel Menendez play the
same position, and their stories are linked. The Falcons rookie
wide receivers even talk among themselves about their chances of
making the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's going to come down to numbers, and they're only
going to keep so many,'' Baker said. ``But mostly we talk about
learning the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a bigger issue for Menendez, who began playing football
as a senior at Louisville's Eastern High.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had two catches for 27 yards but also fumbled in Friday's
night's 35-31 preseason victory against the Lions. Menendez
returned two punts for 95 yards, including a 63-yarder for a
touchdown that proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker's the one with an inside track on making the team.
Menendez faces longer odds.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving as a fifth-round draft choice, the 6-foot,
167-pound Baker, 23, had a reputation as a slick route-runner with
soft hands. He's slightly built but quick and crafty enough to lead
the NCAA with 103 receptions as a junior at Kent University.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Monroeville, Pa., has lived up to his resume.
Still, he sees the NFL the same way most rookies do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from college because everybody's got speed,''
Baker said. ``You've got to realize (that) once you catch it
they're going to be right on you, so you've got to tuck the ball
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of NFL players doesn't jump out at Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons chose him in the seventh round, they got a
player who has run the 40-yard dash in 4.24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But playing at Division I-AA Eastern Kentucky, Menendez, 24, did
not see top talent often, and he's rougher around the edges than
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My college was predominantly run-oriented, and the way I look
at it, this is only my fifth year playing football, so I have a lot
to learn about playing receiver,'' Menendez said. ``These plays are
really difficult. The mental aspect is really hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players have worked mostly at split end, although Baker is
working this week at flanker. Even though the position calls for
more blocking, it's similar to the slot position Baker excelled at
in college.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez, who's 5-9, 183 pounds, caught 144 passes for 2,840
yards and 27 touchdowns in his final three seasons at Eastern
Kentucky, and his 19.7-yard average per reception was hard for
Falcons scouts to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his speed, Menendez remains a long shot. Veterans
Terance Mathis, Chris Calloway and Tim Dwight are certain to make a
team that probably will keep five wide receivers. Behind them,
Baker is grouped with six-year veteran Ronnie Harris; Jammi German,
last year's third-round choice; and recently signed four-year
veteran J.T. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons aren't looking for a No. 1 return man, either. Last
year, Dwight was one of the NFL's best as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Menendez plugs away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to work at everything to get better every day, even
staying after practice catching extra balls,'' he said. ``Whatever
it takes _ because if I get released here, and get picked up by
somebody else, I'm going to have to do the same things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it ... it's a dream just to be here,''
Menendez said. ``You never know when you might leave.''

CATASTROPHE IN AN ANCIENT LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time and again, the pictures from Turkey showed great slabs of
concrete tilted disconcertingly atop piles of rubble. A person's
leg protruded from a mass of debris; neighbors strained to free the
victim and get water to her unseen mouth. A woman virtually
entombed by masonry was given up for dead _ until she blinked,
setting off a frantic scramble by rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   Human drama was the story: a father tearfully kissing the
dirt-smeared infant son just pulled out alive; others mourning
family and friends lost in 45 terrible seconds that shook the life
out of hundreds of people and parts of several cities.
</P>
<P>
   One striking aspect of the Turkish tragedy is how urban it is.
Helicopter shots from Istanbul, a city of 12 million, and other
centers showed block after block of apartment and business
complexes collapsed in heaps as if they were made of cardboard. The
earthquake's victims in the cities were not swallowed up by
trenches split open in the earth's crust. They were crushed by
steel and concrete _ manmade artifacts shaken from the perches men
had so confidently given them.
</P>
<P>
   Although cities have their own dangers, we somehow feel they are
less vulnerable to the forces of nature. From childhood we learn
that brick houses are harder to blow down, and our mammoth urban
structures are stronger still. We think that for the most part,
floods inundate farmlands and hurricanes thrash tropical lands.
</P>
<P>
   We should know better, of course. The San Francisco earthquake
of 1906 devastated that city, although the death toll of 506 has
been exceeded often. Worcester was hit by a tornado in 1953, as
were Oklahoma City and Salt Lake City this year.
</P>
<P>
   Too often nature is not respected by those who build, especially
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, reports said centuries-old treasures such as the
Blue Mosque survived. While many of these buildings were
extraordinarily ambitious architectural and engineering
achievements, time has shown them to be more in concert with nature
than many of the reinforced, steel-beamed structures of modern man.

TEXAS APPEALS COURT GRANTS STAY OF EXECUTION TO MENTALLY ILL
INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Five hours before a convicted murderer, Larry Keith
Robison, was scheduled to die by lethal injection, the highest
criminal court in Texas on Tuesday granted him a stay of execution
to determine whether the mentally ill man is competent to go to the
death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-to-4 ruling by the Court of Criminal Appeals stunned
Robison's lawyer and his mother, who had already arranged for a
memorial service and had reserved a burial plot. Lois Robison said
she had visited her son on Tuesday morning at the state's death row
in Huntsville, Texas, before leaving in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it would be the last time I would see him,''
Ms. Robison said on Tuesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most executions in Texas, which no longer elicit much
public notice or outrage, the Robison case had attracted heightened
attention. With Gov. George W. Bush seeking the Republican
presidential nomination as a ``compassionate conservative,'' mental
health advocates from across the country had furiously denounced
the planned execution of a man who had been diagnosed as a paranoid
schizophrenic and who had fallen through the state's mental health
safety net before he brutally killed five people in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Had the court not intervened, Bush would likely have faced the
politically delicate decision of either granting Robison a 30-day
stay or making him the 99th death row inmate to be executed since
he took office in January 1995. His office released a short
statement on Tuesday that said, ``There is no appropriate action
for Governor Bush to take in this case at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the case will return to Fort Worth where a Tarrant County
trial judge will preside over a hearing to determine Robison's
competency. Under Texas law, a person who is deemed legally
incompetent cannot be executed. There is no such provision for
people who are considered mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just incredible news,'' said the Rev. Melodee Smith,
the lawyer representing Robison during his clemency appeals.
``We're terribly pleased and thankful that the court had the
courage to vote. This is a tough decision for this court.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Wetzel, executive administrator of the Court of
Criminal Appeals, said the court usually granted one or two stays
every year, but he cautioned that Robison had not yet escaped death
row.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the case of Joseph Stanley Faulder, a Canadian who
survived nine execution dates before he was executed last June. But
Wetzel said the Robison case was unique because of the order to
hold a competency hearing. If Robison is found incompetent, he
could be placed under medication in a state psychiatric hospital
and, if he is eventually deemed to be ``normal,'' he could then be
returned to death row.
</P>
<P>
   Michael M. Faenza, president of the National Mental Health
Association, a consortium of advocacy groups for the mentally ill,
said Robison ``was clearly psychotic when he committed these
terrible crimes.'' He offered his sympathy to the families of
Robison's five victims, but he also criticized the willingness of
Texas and other states to execute criminals diagnosed with mental
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible that we still put people with mental illness to
death who have committed crimes because of their mental illness,''
he said. Ms. Robison said her son was diagnosed as a paranoid
schizophrenic and admitted at least three times to state mental
hospitals in Texas, which ranked 48th nationally in services for
the mentally ill at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, she said, administrators told her that they could not
commit her son unless he became violent. In August 1982, Robison
beheaded, repeatedly stabbed and sexually mutilated his roommate,
then later killed four neighbors, including an 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   His first trial was overturned because of improper jury
selection but his 1987 retrial resulted in a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in the second case, Greg Pipes, said on Tuesday
that lawyers for Robison unsuccessfully raised an insanity defense
in both trials. But Pipes said a hearing was never held to
determine whether Robison was competent enough to help his lawyers
or understand the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   He said prosecutors would present testimony from medical experts
and other evidence to prove Robison is competent.

PLAYING POLITICS WITH POPULATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that India's population passed 1
billion last week, though it is difficult to set a precise date in
a place where 33 people are born every minute. At its current
birthrate, India is on track to pass China as the most populous
nation on earth within the next century.
</P>
<P>
   India illustrates the importance of addressing overpopulation as
a web of issues, including not just birth control but maternal and
child health, education, and the social advancement of women. As
long as the infant mortality rate in India remains at 72 per 1,000,
more than 10 times the rate in the United States, and children have
a 1-in-10 chance of dying before their fifth birthday, it will be
difficult to persuade India's women to plan smaller families.
</P>
<P>
   Many innovative approaches to reproductive health are being
tried in India, among them a comprehensive package of immunizations
and prenatal checkups in small villages. These are replacing the
old ``target- based'' programs that simply tried to sign up as many
women for birth control methods _ including sterilization _ as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But India cannot do it alone. Wealthier nations, including the
United States, must keep up their commitment to achieving a
sustainable population.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Congress broke for its summer recess, House members
reached an uneasy compromise on the $12.7 billion foreign aid
budget that might provide a way out of the logjam over abortion
language that has tied up population funds for years. In addition
to the usual strictures that would gag family planning
organizations from even discussing abortion, the House adopted an
alternative amendment this year. A House-Senate committee will have
to hammer out the differences.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative language in the House, sponsored by Nancy Pelosi
of New York, a Democrat, and Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, a
Republican, hews more closely to existing law, requiring that
family planning organizations certify that they are using US funds
``to reduce the incidence of abortion.'' Benjamin Gilman, a New
York Republican who is chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, called it ``a new bipartisan consensus on
family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope so. Partisan fussing over abortion is an outmoded
battle at a time when population workers on the ground are using a
more holistic _ and realistic _ approach. The people of India and
the developing world cannot wait much longer for the politicians to
catch up.

TWO MALE ICONOCLASTS WHO HAVE FUN MAKING FUN OF MALENESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two bare-chested men, wearing tartanless kilts and
effeminate jazz shoes, dance and play the saxophone; the same pair,
dressed in tuxedos, speak to each other through bullhorns, slap
each other's faces or grab each other's crotches without flinching,
all the while exchanging gentlemanly chitchat; finally, as two guys
in business attire, they wheel and deal on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   These are just some of the loaded images that the
choreographer-dancer David Dorfman and the composer-performance
artist Dan Froot have devised for their three comic duets, ``Horn''
(1990), ``Bull'' (1994) and ``Job'' (1996), respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 20-minute pieces have been performed several times
since their premieres as ironic accents in Dorfman's and Froot's
individual performances.
</P>
<P>
   Now they will present them as an evening unto themselves under
the title ``Live Sax Acts'' at Dance Theater Workshop. Eight
performances over three weeks, beginning Tuesday, are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made each of these pieces for free,'' said Froot. ``None of
them were commissioned, and there was zero overhead. They came from
a spirit of let's make a show and the joy of working together.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the work winks at ``Iron John'' stereotypes of
masculinity: physical endurance and aggression, psychological
manipulation and good old-fashioned bad behavior; how men often say
one thing but do something contradictory, then apologize. (Not by
accident, the show's promotional postcard looks like a boxing match
flier.)
</P>
<P>
   But the wallop of these dance-theater duets is their emotional
honesty. These two men have a lot in common. Froot, 39, and
Dorfman, 43, are Jewish, heterosexual and about 5 feet 7 _ although
Dorfman is stockier.
</P>
<P>
   Both are also admired in New York's downtown dance world as
iconoclastic artists and genuine nice guys. Onstage, they clearly
love each other and are not afraid to explore that intimacy through
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I would like to be working with other artists with
such a degree of forthrightness,'' Froot said. ``It's not easy.
I've only experienced that in nonwork relationships, where my
partner and myself have been willing to work things through.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman added: ``People take it for granted that we have an
easy, natural connection. We work at it, and when we get off the
stage, we're absolutely exhausted _ and often a little irritated
with one another. People tend to romanticize relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier two pieces are autobiographical; with ``Job,'' Froot
and Dorfman began playing characters, their dads, to explore issues
of maleness in a larger context. The two are now expanding that
study in ``Shtick,'' a work in progress based on vaudeville
routines that will address, they said, the question of why men have
a compulsion to perform.

SEEKING DEATH ON A DUSTY ROAD

   In the way of most films by the great Iranian filmmaker Abbas
Kiarostami, ``Taste of Cherry'' approaches large questions through
a constrained and fascinating tale. At the wheel of an old sport
utility vehicle, Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) drives slowly along
dusty, hilly roads, now and then stopping to inquire of people who
strike him as prospects for a job he needs filled.
</P>
<P>
   Badii is essentially looking for an accomplice. He plans to kill
himself by swallowing all his sleeping pills. Then he will lie down
in a shallow grave he has dug along the road. For 200,000 tomans
(what a soldier earns in a month), the person he hires is to visit
the site at 6 the next morning, call out to Badii to make sure he
is dead and, if there is no response, cover the body with 20
spadefuls of earth.
</P>
<P>
   Once one settles into the film's deliberate pace and thoughtful
silences, Kiarostami's story becomes an involving mystery. Badii is
a prosperous, good-looking man of about 50. His manner is pensive
but probing and, though he does not seek advice or solace from
those he encounters, slightly imploring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when a man can't go on,'' he tells a
seminarian he meets. ``He's exhausted and can't wait for God to
act.'' Beyond that, we know nothing about him or his situation.
But, finally, does that even matter? As he interrogates prospective
shovelers, his need for contact and understanding is what counts.
</P>
<P>
   The first candidate is a young army draftee, a Kurd whose main
interest is getting back to base on time. Badii's method of
screening people is to pull over to the side of the road and
interrogate passersby. ``Clear off or I'll smash your face in,'' a
laborer tells him. Others, like the soldier, are cautious, but
drawn by Badii's intensity and natural air of authority, they climb
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   They are like fish on a hook. A gentle but forceful man of high
intelligence, Badii draws them out with persistent questions about
their lives and beliefs. Then he makes his pitch. The Kurdish boy
is from farming stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretend you're a farmer and I'm manure to be spread under a
tree,'' Badii says. Shown the hole, the soldier sprints down the
hill toward his barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Badii drives on, sad but unperturbed. Giant machinery at a
cement plant shifts huge amounts of earth. All he wants is someone
to move 20 spadefuls. The seminarian would like to help, but he
can't abide suicide. ``God entrusts a man's body to him,'' he says.
``Man must not torment that body.'' Besides, being unhappy is a
sin. When you're unhappy, you hurt people.
</P>
<P>
   At last Badii succeeds. An elderly taxidermist agrees to bury
him (the old man needs the money for his sick child), but he tries
to dissuade Badii with a tale of his own suicide attempt over a
failed marriage many years ago. Now full of fight and life, the old
man tells of trying to hang himself from a mulberry tree but then
discovering its fruit and feeding it to hungry children. ``Have you
seen the moon?'' he asks Badii. ``Do you see the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   Badii remains impassive, but the taxidermist has made an
impression. Badii asks him not only to call out to him in the grave
the next morning but to throw some stones at him and shake him by
the shoulder. &QL;

RECALLING TWO VIOLINISTS WHO DIED IN THEIR PRIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series was
conceived to celebrate the past, but with a new CD devoted to the
violinists Michael Rabin and Ossy Renardy (MHK 60894), the label is
also paying homage to two artists cut down in their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were already superior musicians when they died, and
in certain circles their demise still elicits palpable regret.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, born in New York City in 1936 to musical parents, made
his professional debut in Cuba at age 10, under Arthur Rodzinski's
baton. By 1950, he was playing Carnegie Hall to enthusiastic
notices. That same year, Columbia Records (now Sony Classical)
produced an album in which Rabin played 11 Paganini caprices. Two
other Columbia disks followed before the violinist, in 1954, began
a six-year association with Capitol/EMI that would mark the summit
of his fame.
</P>
<P>
   The Masterworks Heritage CD includes Rabin's three Columbia
records in their entirety, revealing an artist at once technically
brilliant and interpretively sensitive. That Rabin was an
adolescent at the time makes his achievement even more spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rabin would famously record all 24 Paganini caprices for
Capitol in 1958, his partial set for Columbia holds special appeal.
Of course, he injects these short solo works with youthful vigor,
but more importantly, Rabin finds the music in these tortuous
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   In the No. 11 in C major, for instance, he juxtaposes meditative
phrasing with incisive attacks. And in the familiar 24th caprice,
in A minor, the violinist positively sings out: his tone sweet, his
bowing assured, his inflections graceful.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of showpieces with piano follow, including works by
Wieniawski, Kreisler and Dvorak. Best of all is a trifle by Carl
Engel titled ``Sea Shell,'' in which Rabin, in Efrem Zimbalist's
atmospheric arrangement, limpidly evokes the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Three works for violin and orchestra complete Rabin's Columbia
discography, Sarasate's durable ``Zigeunerweisen'' and two fiendish
works by Novacek and Paganini, both called ``Perpetuum Mobile.''
The Paganini, especially, reveals Rabin's prowess as a first-rate
virtuoso. But it's in ``Zigeunerweisen,'' with its throbbing,
sentimental charm, that the violinist's talents are more completely
on display.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, in 1972, less than 20 years after these records were
made, Rabin, 35, died in his Manhattan apartment. Over the years
there has been talk of depression and drugs, but none of it has
been substantiated; death by natural causes was the official
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rabin, Ossy Renardy died tragically. He was killed in a car
crash en route to a concert in 1953, at age 33. Born Oskar Reiss,
in Vienna, Renardy was an enormously talented artist whose vibrant
tone and innate poise earned him early accolades. The conductor
Victor de Sabata, for instance, engaged him at 14 to perform as a
soloist with the Vienna Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Though he made comparatively few disks, Renardy was the first
violinist to record all 24 Paganini caprices, for RCA Victor in
1940, albeit with interpolated piano accompaniment. And his 1948
account of the Brahms Violin Concerto for Decca, with Charles Munch
conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra, remains a benchmark
performance sadly in need of reissue.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers, then, to Sony for releasing a selection of Renardy's
first recordings, made in 1938, not long after his New York debut
at Town Hall. Here is an elegant exponent of the Old School
rendering Sarasate and Paganini with delicious dash. Neither sugary
nor schmaltzy, Renardy's playing brims with ineffable elegance,
summoning contented sighs, as a really good meal might.
</P>
<P>
   In the four Sarasate selections, which include ``Romanza
Andaluza'' and ``Zapateado,'' sparkle and ease characterize
Renardy's approach, even as tensions rise and double stops,
pizzicato and harmonics are employed. For Paganini's Sonata No. 12
in E minor, a more melancholy sound first emerges from Renardy's
gilded bow, followed by ebullience and bravura technique.
</P>
<P>
   Only the absence of Renardy's other Columbia disks, sonatinas by
Schubert and Dvorak among them, detract from the joy at having
these records once more at hand. Were there more space on this
nearly 79-minute CD, they doubtless would have been added.
</P>
<P>
   John Donne wrote: ``Yesternight the sun went hence, And yet is
here today.'' Sony seems almost to have taken his words to heart,
giving listeners a welcome sampling of two artists who perished
early, but not before bequeathing a precious legacy.

IS AT&AMP;T DEAL WITH MEDAIONE TOO LARGE TO BLOCK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As two federal agencies review the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s $58
billion bid to buy Mediaone Group, they face the central question
of whether the combination is, in essence, too large to block.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T executives say the acquisition is needed to establish a
cable network so vast and powerful that it will provide high-speed
Internet service, cable television and telephone service that can
compete with the regional Bell companies. Those companies have so
far managed to keep newcomers from challenging them in their local
phone markets.
</P>
<P>
   But three consumer groups said on Tuesday that the cost of
opening the local markets was not worth the price and urged the
government to kill the deal because it would permit AT&AMP;T to
dominate both the cable-television industry and the market for
high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed at the Federal Communications Commission and the
Justice Department, the groups asserted that the proposed
acquisition would violate a raft of antitrust and
telecommunications rules intended to limit concentration of
ownership in the cable and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators should never accept a massive concentration in one
market as a condition for increasing local competition in
another,'' Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer
Federation of America, said. ``This merger breaks all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's bid to buy Mediaone is quickly becoming an important new
test case of antitrust policy. It has also prompted a
re-examination of the current cable ownership rules, rules that
have been suspended for the last seven years because of litigation
between regulators and the industry.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T has recently set out to have some of those rules
rewritten, consumer groups maintain that the deal would enable AT&AMP;T
to dominate the markets for cable television and the new high-speed
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will result in inflated cable and broadband
Internet service prices for consumers and thwart the development of
vibrant competition in these markets,'' the three groups _
Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Media
Access Project _ wrote in a letter to the Justice Department on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In response, AT&AMP;T executives reasserted the central argument
they began making in May when the deal was announced: By growing so
quickly, the company will benefit many millions of telephone
customers nationwide by using the newly acquired cable lines to
break into local telephone markets that have been dominated by a
handful of Bell companies fiercely resistant to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extreme stretch to suggest that there's any antitrust
issue here,'' said James W. Cicconi, general counsel and head of
government relations at AT&AMP;T. ``There is no competitor to the
services we are offering that is being taken out here. Far from it
_ the whole purpose is to provide local competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be providing competition where it doesn't now exist,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Federal communications guidelines prohibit a single company from
holding a 5 percent active interest or 10 percent passive interest
in companies whose wires come close to 30 percent or more of the
nation's homes. But a federal district judge threw out some of
those rules in a case in which AT&AMP;T is not involved, and the FCC
voluntarily stayed the enforcement of those guidelines. That case
is now on appeal, and agency officials say they are in the process
of reviewing the cable-ownership rules, a review they hope to
complete before issuing a decision on the AT&AMP;T deal.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have contended that, after the merger, AT&AMP;T's
market penetration would reach 57 percent of the nation's
households. Executives at AT&AMP;T have said they think the market
penetration is nowhere near that, but they have also told analysts
they think it will be more than the 30 percent permitted under the
rules that have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The company has asked the FCC both to raise the 30 percent
threshold and to change its ownership attribution rules so that a
small ownership interest in a cable company would count less than
it now does.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, federal antitrust rules written
during the Reagan and Bush administrations generally make any
proposed merger suspect if it increases an economic index used by
the government by 50 to 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis by the three consumer groups says that the
proposed AT&AMP;T-Mediaone deal raises the index, the Hirschman
Herfindahl Index, in many markets by 700 to 3,000 points, even
including the proposed spinoffs AT&AMP;T has already announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T's proposed acquisition is a blatant blatant violation of
our nation's antitrust laws and our nation's competition laws,'
said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Cicconi of AT&AMP;T disputed the consumer groups' figures. He also
said that they had distorted the true size of the market and failed
to recognize that AT&AMP;T competes with other high-speed Internet
service offered by the regional telephone companies and with
satellite broadcasting companies.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in blocking a merger on antitrust grounds, ``one has
to show that market power is being used to constrain competitors,
which clearly is not the case here,'' Cicconi said. ``I'm not sure
where they are getting their antitrust advice from.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Lockheed Martin confronts protests, racism allegations
 &HT;    By Julie Bryant and Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A spark of alleged racism brought a firestorm of
attention Tuesday when a group of Lockheed Martin employees and
local civil rights leaders protested outside the state's fourth
largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Lockheed Martin workers spoke out against what they
say amounts to years of racial discrimination at the hands of
managers and employees, and unfair hiring practices within the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin president Tom Burbage said he is disturbed by
the allegations and has launched a full-scale investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time employees raise issues, we do investigate,'' Burbage
said during a press conference that came a few hours after the
rally. ``This is an important issue to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest brought to a head a year's worth of Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission charges filed against Lockheed Martin and
came on the heels of an alleged racial incident over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, 20 to 30 charges of discrimination have
been filed with the EEOC against Lockheed Martin, said Attorney
Josie A. Alexander of Atlanta-based Alexander and Associates.
Alexander represents some of the employees who say they have been
mistreated because of their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Banks, a 20-year union mechanic for Lockheed, said he has
repeatedly encountered discrimination at a company he said is still
run by ``the good-ole-boy system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Banks said, a co-worker discovered a noose
draped over Bank's work area and pointed it out to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't touch it. Leave it,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks said that he wrote a letter of complaint about the
incident and that Lockheed Martin employees came to his work area
and took pictures of the noose.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gable, vice president of Aeronautical Machinists Local
Lodge No. 709, said Banks is a union member. Gable said he didn't
know anything about the allegations of racism, but he said Banks
would normally make those charges through management because it
wasn't a union contract issue.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage said he had only just heard about the incident Tuesday
and was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Banks filed a discrimination lawsuit against
the company _ a suit he later lost _ he said he received an
intimidating note from what appeared to be a member of the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said, `You have been paid a social visit from the Ku Klux
Klan, don't let the next visit be a business call,' '' Banks told a
crowd of about 25 protesters congregated just outside the Walker
Street entrance to Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage said he has spearheaded a feedback campaign for
employees and has heard from about 90 percent of the work force.
Lockheed Martin employs more than 9,000 people, a little over 16
percent of whom are minorities, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage said that judging by the feedback he has received from
employees, he does not believe racial discrimination is a
widespread problem. He also debunked rumors of Ku Klux Klan
activities at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offensive to me. We do not tolerate that kind of
activity. No one has brought that to me as an issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said 18 charges had been filed over the past year
through the EEOC against the company and were mostly related to
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, that is about the norm for a company our size,''
said Lockheed spokesman Sam Grizzle.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials would not confirm exactly how many charges
against the company had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the rally, including members of Concerned Black
Clergy, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the Atlanta Labor Council and the Rainbow/Push Coalition,
said they will go forward with a class action lawsuit against
Lockheed unless workplace conditions change.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Earl Moore, presiding economic coordinator of the SCLC,
said a task force should be set up within the company along with
sensitivity programs to prevent racial discrimination. Fair hiring
practices also must begin, he said, for employees who have not been
appropriately promoted or received a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage said that he invited protesters to take a tour of the
plant Tuesday but that the offer was declined. Lockheed Martin and
local civil rights leaders have tentatively scheduled to meet next
week to discuss the discrimination charges.

   JASPER, Texas _ A dispute between a 14-year-old girl and an
older roommate escalated from cutting words to cutting hair,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The two combatants shared a mobile home with the teen's older
sister in a trailer park on Sam Rayburn Reservoir near the town of
Brookeland, officers said. Upset by harsh language used during an
earlier argument, the teen told officers she decided to take sweet
revenge early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 a.m., she crept into the roommate's room while she and a
boyfriend were in a deep sleep. Using a pair of scissors, the teen
cut off about 75 percent of the woman's waist-length light brown
hair and half of the boyfriend's lush moustache before her sister
woke up and made her stop.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened by the ensuing argument, the couple made a hasty
retreat to another location, where they called the Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked like Sinead O'Connor,'' Deputy Sheriff Kit
Stephenson said of the victim. Most of her hair was less than an
inch long, but part of it was waist length, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young clipper admitted the deed, showing officers the long
hair she'd collected in a large plastic drink cup, Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged with assault and has been placed in a youth
facility in Austin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the surprises of the year have been three unusual
full-evening ballets, one notable for its odd plot structure, the
others for their strangely dramatic plotlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky story-ballet was Rostislav Zakharov's ``Fountain of
Bakhchisarai,'' which, though dating from 1934, had never been seen
in New York until the Kirov Ballet brought it to the Metropolitan
Opera House this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fountain'' arrived with a strange reputation. Based on a poem
by Pushkin, it dates from when Socialist Realism dominated the arts
in Soviet Russia. So it was easy to fear that it would toe a dull
party line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, despite its occasionally trite score by Boris Asafiev,
it proved lively. Zakharov retold Pushkin's story clearly, with a
few unexpected compositional touches. For one thing, instead of
saving such a traditionally virtuosic showpiece for late in the
work, as some choreographers might do, Zakharov put the grand pas
de deux virtually at the start of the first act by having Maria, a
Polish princess, dance with Vatslav, her betrothed. Then,
surprisingly, Vatslav is killed by invading Tatars: the person one
might assume to be the romantic hero is dead before the first act
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Maria is abducted to the harem of Khan Girei, who becomes
infatuated with her. But she resists him. He in turn spurns Zarema,
who had been his favorite wife. Girei, not Vatslav, is the ballet's
leading man. And Maria and Zarema are major ballerina roles.
</P>
<P>
   But how odd these starring parts are. Girei's role is
essentially mimetic, plot complications preventing him from dancing
with either Maria, who shuns him, or Zarema, to whom he is
indifferent, even though she continues to pine for him. The very
inability of these people to get together gives the ballet its
dramatic tension.
</P>
<P>
   Other strong dramatic situations are hinted at in Jiri Kylian's
``One of a Kind,'' which the Nederlands Dans Theater offered at the
New York State Theater this summer, and William Forsythe's ``Eidos:
Telos,'' which the Frankfurt Ballet danced at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music last winter. Yet both productions are plotless.
</P>
<P>
   Plotless, or abstract, full-evening ballets present
choreographic challenges, for their creators must make sequences
fit together coherently and not seem mere hodgepodges of steps. One
familiar attempt at a multi-act abstraction is George Balanchine's
``Jewels,'' which entered the New York City Ballet's repertory in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Yet skeptics have argued that this is not one long ballet at all
but three independent short works to three composers: ``Emeralds''
(Faure), ``Rubies'' (Stravinsky) and ``Diamonds'' (Tchaikovsky).
Indeed, ``Rubies'' is frequently performed by itself on programs.
Yet the second act of ``Swan Lake'' and the last act of ``The
Sleeping Beauty'' have also been danced on their own, and no one
argues that these 19th-century classics are not true full-evening
ballets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even dancegoers who admire its three separate parts may
find something esthetically suspect about ``Jewels'' as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Often, successful multi-act abstractions are unified by some
prevailing emotional aura or type of movement. Thus, Kylian
emphasizes questing in ``One of a Kind'' and convulsive changes
occur throughout Forsythe's ``Eidos: Telos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of a Kind,'' to music by Brett Dean, abounds with
choreographic images suggesting uncertainty, struggle and
aspiration. What helps bind the scenes together is the presence of
a woman who, by remaining onstage at all times, creates the
impression that the various episodes are stages of her pilgrimage
through life.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian has stated that one inspiration was the Dutch
Constitution and its upholding of individual rights. Could
dancegoers have guessed this without reading the program notes?
Probably not. Yet those notes did seem apt, for the ballet can be
interpreted as a depiction of people striving to get along, despite
adversities.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe's ``Eidos: Telos,'' to a score by Thom Willems, also
had program notes, in this case long-windedly pedantic ones. But
the verbiage did reveal that in Greek, ``eidos'' means form, and
``telos'' means end, that an ``eidolon'' is an apparition or an
image of an ideal and that ``teleology'' is the philosophical study
of ultimate purpose.
</P>
<P>
   All these matters were relevant to Forsythe's tumultuous
choreographic visions of time, eternity, life, death and
transfiguration.
</P>
<P>
   Time dominated the first act in the form of clock dials and an
ever-ticking metronome. Trembling dancers sought to cram each
minute with activity, as if aware that time and life were rapidly
passing. Yet when a violin phrase recalled a theme from
Stravinsky's ``Apollo,'' that serene melody was a reminder that art
often tries to make images that transcend the temporal.
</P>
<P>
   In the compelling second act, a bare-breasted Dana Casperson
moved while reciting a monologue about a spider's efforts to arise
out of the earth. Both the dancer and the spider symbolized the
myth of Persephone, who was doomed to spend half of each year in
the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greek mythology equates Persephone's return to earth
with the coming of spring, Forsythe showed no interest in gentle
breezes or pretty flowers. Ms. Casperson's violent shakings implied
that rebirth can be as difficult as birth itself. Other dancers
whirled madly. Still others spoke monologues of their own,
including an obscene and aggressive harrangue. Forsythe appeared to
be verbally and kinetically conjuring up all the muck of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographic tension mounted in the third act as ominous
trombone music threatened to summon Doomsday. During this tumult,
Ms. Casperson laboriously struggled to shed her costume the way a
snake might shed its skin. Then, when she at last stood totally
naked, she appeared to have achieved rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eidos: Telos'' and ``One of a Kind'' told no stories. But they
certainly conveyed a sense of drama, a type of drama different
from, yet as exciting as, Pushkin's story of heartbreak in a harem.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ETrade Group Inc., the big online brokerage firm, and
Instinet, a stock trading network that serves institutional
investors, said Tuesday that they would team up to offer small
investors the opportunity to trade stocks after the major exchanges
close for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement shows that individual investors, long shut out
of the trading arena after the 4 p.m. closing bell, are demanding
more service and getting it from technology-knowledgeable trading
networks. Until now, after-hours stock trading has been monopolized
by institutional investors and Wall Street brokerage firms buying
and selling stocks on late-breaking news or early-morning tips.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in online investing and the development of electronic
trading networks have given smaller investors the power to ask for
greater access to the stock market and for tools to imitate the
professionals, who are predicting the emergence of a global
marketplace for stocks that never shuts down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another signpost on the way'' to round-the-clock
trading, said Henry M. McVeigh, an analyst who covers online
trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``A growing number of retail
investors prefer to enter their buy and sell orders after the
closing bell.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq stock market, have
talked about offering trading in an evening session in the next
year, but want to wait at least until they put year 2000 computer
problems behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But while the exchanges study the issue, electronic trading is
shaking up the establishment and pitting traditional brokerage
firms and stock exchanges against discount online brokers and
low-cost computerized trading networks.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade is not the first, but it is the biggest firm to extend
the trading day. Just weeks ago, Datek Online Holdings began
offering a similar Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade and Datek Online are moving swiftly to make available a
service that they say will ``change the rules'' and ``empower the
individual investor.''
</P>
<P>
   ETrade and Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group PLC, say that
beginning in September they will offer online trading in New York
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stocks between 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
creating an after-hours market that serves both institutional
clients and retail investors. It is the first time retail investors
will get direct access to Instinet, which has served institutional
clients since 1969. Eventually, the service's hours could be
extended.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear how much demand there is among small
investors for after-hours trading, executives at ETrade and
Instinet say that customers have been calling for extended trading
hours for some time and so they decided to allow it as an
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our customers want is access to opportunity and a level
playing field with larger institutional investors,'' said Christos
M. Cotsakos, chairman and chief executive at ETrade, which is based
in Menlo Park, Calif. ``It's all part of democratizing personal
investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Datek Online began offering a trading forum
from 4 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. through its electronic trading network,
the Island ECN, and says more than 50,000 accounts have signed up
for the service, which is free from commissions through the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about the start,'' said Robert O. Bethge, a
spokesman for Datek, which is based in Edison, N.J. ``We're just
keeping the store open for an extra hour and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, a number of hurdles. Light trading
activity could mean more drastic swings in stock prices, and not
all stocks may be available for trading. The Island system at Datek
is used only for Nasdaq stocks, while Instinet's system handles Big
Board stocks as well, though not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have cautioned the major stock exchanges to move
warily on after-hours trading formats and to take into account that
smaller investors may not be adequately informed about the risks.
Others are worried about bad executions, or pricing problems on
transactions, in a system that works on auto-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, however, see round-the-clock trading as
inevitable, and already there are signs of a mad dash. Discover
Brokerage, the online division of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has
already announced plans for extended hours, and so has Wit Capital,
which plans to team up with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other small electronic communications networks, or
ECNs, are also planning after-hours trading. And Wall Street
brokerage firms and other trading and software firms are scrambling
to form alliances to compete in the new electronic trading
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody and their grandmother are investing in ECNs,'' said
James Punishill, an online trading analyst at Forrester Research.
``The only one delaying this is Nasdaq and the Big Board, who don't
know what to do about this.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One institution that is moving aggressively is Instinet. It
faces stiff competition from fast-growing Island, which is popular
among day traders for its fast executions and its dominance of
Internet stocks. Instinet has begun a big advertising campaign,
acquired a stake in another ECN, Archipelago LLC, and held talks
with at least one major day-trading firm about acquiring new
software to reach the retail investor market.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching an exclusive deal with ETrade through the end of the
year, Instinet signaled it would plow ahead with its stated
ambition to enter the fast-growing retail marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Atkin, chief executive at Instinet, said Tuesday that
retail investors have been asking for access. He also said many
retail trades coming through ETrade may match up with small
institutional orders that are often sliced up into smaller pieces
by Instinet clients.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The next step? Datek already says it has plans to offer its
customers trading before the opening bell at 9:30 a.m. And
Punishill at Forrester says other online brokers will come forward
soon. In six months, everybody will be in this, he says.
After-hours trading is going to go universal.

BUSH'S EMPHASIS ON LAW AND ORDER HAS SERVED HIM WELL IN TEXAS

 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The issue of law and order has always been part
of George W. Bush's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his father, George Bush, benefited from televised images
of the furloughed murderer-rapist Willie Horton to attack Michael
Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush ran for governor of
Texas in 1994 with a series of grainy black-and-white commercials
depicting a man abducting a woman at gunpoint in a parking garage
and, a moment later, a police officer draping a blanket over the
woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann Richards, was
soft on crime, Bush promised to get tougher with criminals. That
stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the
nearly five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent
in pressing a law-and-order agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has presided over the nation's largest prison-building
program and a record number of executions in his tenure as
governor. He has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to carry
guns and has opposed gun-control legislation. ``For Governor Bush,
gun control is not yet part of crime control,'' said Travis County
Constable Bruce Elfant, one of the many law-enforcement officials
who have come to see gun control as important as fighting drugs and
gangs in the battle against crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a conservative state where being ``Texas tough'' is high
praise, Bush's positions have been popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Ann Richards was ousted was her opposition to the
right to carry handguns and being soft on crime,'' said state Rep.
Suzanna Gratia Hupp, a Republican from Lampasas, expressing a view
shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. ``George W. Bush is a
real Texan, someone who is very down to earth and tough on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   How Bush's record on criminal justice, particularly gun control,
will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested as he
campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. In Texas,
experts on criminal justice are studying another question: whether
his policies are responsible for the state's drop in crime
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined several requests for an interview on
criminal-justice issues. But his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said
his initiatives, especially those toughening punishment for
juvenile offenders and making convicts serve longer terms, had
produced a 20 percent drop in the Texas crime rate. ``Governor Bush
believes in tough laws and long sentences to keep criminals off the
streets,'' Ms. Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, crime
had already fallen 25 percent under Gov. Richards, from 1991 to
1994, as she pushed a multibillion-dollar-prison-building program.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was utter nonsense for Bush to attack
Richards for being soft on crime, when she presided over this huge
prison buildup,'' said Steve Martin, a consultant on prisons for
federal courts and a former chief counsel for the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in 1995, crime rates have also fallen as
much, or more, in most states as they have in Texas. This has led
governors and mayors across the country to take credit, even as
many experts point out that the widespread decline in crime rates
makes it less likely that any one policy can be credited. Longer
prison sentences are one factor in the overall decrease, experts
say, but so are an improved economy, a decline in the use of crack,
new police strategies and changing attitudes among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of Bush's Democratic opponents acknowledge that Texas
is a strong law-and-order state, where politicians must appeal to a
conservative electorate. But they question the governor's assertion
that he is a ``compassionate conservative'' when it comes to
criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to hold statewide office here, you have to appeal to
a very conservative electorate,'' said state Sen. Rodney Ellis,
Democrat of Houston. But Ellis went on to say, ``There is no
compassion on the governor's part when it comes to law and
order.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia quarterback drills: Backup plans
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Quincy Carter is a fairly patient person. But the
Georgia quarterback's patience is beginning to wear thin when the
subject turns to who is going to back him up this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a concern for me, nor is it a concern for our
football team,'' said Carter, who started all 12 games for Georgia
last year as a freshman. ``It kind of bothers me, to be honest with
you, to hear that all the time: `What if Quincy gets hurt? What are
we going to do?' We're going to have a backup who's ready to play
football, just in case, just like every other program.'' This time
last year, all the talk in Georgia's camp was about the logjam at
quarterback. But after Carter took the job with a record-setting
freshman season, three quarterbacks _ Daniel Cobb, Nate Hybl and
Mike Usry _ transferred and a fourth, senior Jon England, took a
high school coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Carter's backups now consist of three walk-ons and
three former high school quarterbacks who were signed to play other
positions. Carter's confidence notwithstanding, the Bulldogs could
be in trouble if their super sophomore goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good plan'' if Carter gets hurt, coach Jim Donnan
said assuredly.
</P>
<P>
   The contingency plan would rely on Cory Phillips, a redshirt
freshman walk-on from Hartwell; Regan Torbert, a freshman signee
from Peach County; Brent Parks, a third-year walk-on from South
Gwinnett; Chris Nash, a freshman walk-on from Stockbridge; and wide
receivers LaBrone Mitchell and Terrence Edwards, former high school
quarterbacks who have been taking snaps in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 200-pound Phillips, barely recruited in high school,
has all but won the No. 2 position. Understandably, he is somewhat
taken aback by his sudden rise to depth-chart prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time last year, there were nine of us (at quarterback),
and I wasn't even in the picture,'' said Phillips, a three-year
starter at Hart County High. ``So, yeah, it's a little surprising.
I'm just trying to learn everything I can as fast as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   As practices have progressed, the Bulldogs have become
increasingly comfortable with Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory's doing great,'' said Todd Donnan, a graduate assistant
who oversees quarterbacks. ``Obviously, the more snaps he gets
under center, the better he's going to be. He can make all the
throws. It's just a matter of making the calls once he's under
center, and that just comes with time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory's a very solid quarterback,'' Jim Donnan said. ``He
thinks he should be the starter. It really doesn't faze him (to be
the No. 2 quarterback), which I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips will be the first in a game if Carter has to come out.
But if the Bulldogs have to carry on without Carter for several
weeks, they probably would revamp the offense and go with Mitchell
or Edwards in an option-oriented attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has asserted himself as the leading candidate in that
scenario. The sophomore from Marietta spent his first season at
Georgia playing quarterback. He was redshirted and ran the scout
team in 1997 before moving to wide receiver in the spring of 1998.
So Mitchell has a strong working knowledge of Georgia's system. And
at 6 feet 1, 203-pounds, he has the size for the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back a lot of memories,'' said Mitchell, who passed
for 3,838 yards and 35 touchdowns in three seasons at Marietta
High. ``I'm getting back in sync with a lot of things. It's really
not that hard. Once you've learned the offense, it all comes a lot
easier. All I can do is get as many reps as they can give me.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with moving Mitchell or Edwards to quarterback is
the loss of receivers for the Bulldogs. Edwards, in particular, is
emerging as the big-play end Georgia so desperately needs this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I won't have to play (quarterback), because that
means Quincy would have gone down, and we don't want that,''
Edwards said. ``I'd rather be on the receiving end.''

   ON GUNS: Battling Crime, Not Firearms  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By nature, friends here say, Bush prefers to avoid taking stands
on difficult issues. He is neither an ideologue nor
confrontational, they say. But perhaps more than on any other
issue, events in Texas have pushed him into defining his position
on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The first step came in his race against Gov. Richards, when he
pledged to support the concealed-weapons bill. When, as governor,
he signed the bill into law in 1995, he declared, ``This is a bill
to make Texas a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been championed by the National Rifle Association,
but was opposed by the police chiefs of Texas' largest cities, who
were concerned that the law would lead to more violent
confrontations between individuals armed with guns and a greater
risk to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of 31 states that allow people to carry concealed
weapons, though lately public opinion in other states has been
shifting against the policy. In Missouri last April, in the only
referendum ever taken on the issue, voters rejected a proposal to
allow concealed weapons. After the shooting rampage by two students
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April, lawmakers
in both Colorado and Michigan abandoned bills to allow concealed
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Texas bill had predicted it would lead to a
rash of shootings. Supporters said it would sharply cut crime.
Neither seems to have happened.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control advocacy
group, found that since the Texas law took effect, 15 people with
concealed gun permits had been charged with murder or attempted
murder and 103 with assault or aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon. But that is a tiny proportion of homicides and other
violent crimes in Texas. Similarly, there is little evidence that
people with concealed guns have prevented many crimes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, people have carried guns for a century,'' said Tony
Fabelo, the director of the Texas Criminal Justice Policy Council
and Bush's top criminal justice adviser, seeking to explain the
law's limited impact. ``Now they just carry guns with a license.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This spring Bush was pushed into further defining his position
on guns when the National Rifle Association, in response to the
filing of lawsuits against the gun industry by a number cities and
counties, began urging state legislatures to pass laws barring such
suits. No Texas city suggested it was considering such a lawsuit,
but the Legislature passed a law barring cities in the state from
suing the gun industry and Bush signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities were filing suit as a backdoor attempt at gun
control, to take away our guns,'' said state Rep. Hupp, a cosponsor
of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said the governor signed the
bill because ``he does not believe that manufacturers of a legal
product should be held liable for criminal misuse of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states, mostly in the South and West, have adopted such
legislation. After the Littleton shootings, lawmakers in Colorado,
Florida and Michigan withdrew similar bills, and Arizona Gov. Jane
Dee Hull, a Republican, vetoed one.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went against the police chiefs of Texas' seven largest
cities this spring by opposing a bill to require background checks
on all prospective firearms buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, gun shows are the leading source of guns for criminals
and juveniles in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requiring background checks died in committee April 20,
a few hours after the killings in Littleton, which were carried out
with guns bought at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, only licensed dealers at gun shows are
required to conduct background checks on buyers. Other people can
sell guns at the shows without even asking for identification.
Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said the governor thinks there
should be background checks on buyers at gun shows but that the
loophole should be closed at the federal level. Congress has
debated the issue this year without result.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some states have acted to tighten gun-show sales: California has
a system for checking the background of buyers at the shows, and
last year Florida voters approved an initiative authorizing its
cities to require background checks on buyers at the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disagreements on gun control policy, Bush remains
popular with police. ``I know the governor,'' said Dallas Police
Chief Ben Click. ``We run together. He is a very nice, sincere
person and I like him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In states where voters favor gun control, however, Bush can
expect challenges on the issue.In July in New Jersey, a small group
of gun-control advocates demonstrated outside a hotel where Bush
was speaking at a fund-raising event. Afterward. Bush defended his
record supporting gun owners' rights and predicted it would not
hurt him. ``That's what elections are for,'' he said. ``But I'm
proud of my record.''

<P>
   Under Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the
country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or
parole, a point of pride to many Texans, said Fabelo, the
governor's top criminal justice adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents,
second only to Louisiana's 736. By contrast, Minnesota, with the
lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov.
Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took
office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the state prison system had 41,000 beds. When the
buildup is completed next year, it will have 150,000 beds. The Bush
administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion, while
some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued
growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun
to question that state's prison-building program. Republicans worry
about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats
argue that the program has taken money away from the state college
and university system.
</P>
<P>
   The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending
for public education, one of Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna
Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy
Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a definite trade-off,'' Ms. Castro said. State
spending for public schools was 36.4 percent of the budget in 1999,
compared with 41.3 percent in 1989, while spending for prisons was
7.8 percent, up from 5.2 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said that to cope with the
growing number of inmates who will eventually be released from
prison, the governor is counting on programs like a voluntary
Christian boot camp pioneered by Charles Colson, once the special
counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, and who served a federal
prison term on Watergate-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes Bible study as well as courses on personal
responsibility, parenting and financial management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely convinced this program will work,'' Bush said
after visiting a pilot project at a prison near Houston. ``The best
recidivism program is a changed heart.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's major planks in his race against Ms. Richards was
a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of
skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as governor, Bush has transformed
the juvenile justice code. One result: a tripling of the number of
young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush can do for the United States what he has
done for Texas, no one can lick his boots,'' said Dallas Juvenile
Court Judge Hal Gaither, an adviser to Bush who describes himself
as ``the most conservative man in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the
main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best
interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison
system in which punishment is emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be
sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the
maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a
one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The new code does provide flexibility, Gaither said. Juveniles
given long sentences can either be sent to an adult prison when
they turn 16, or they can have their sentence reduced if their
behavior has improved. Many of these changes have been enacted in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE DEATH PENALTY: Leaving Appeals To Higher Power  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has
presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, whose death-row
conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev.
Pat Robertson and other religious leaders. She was only the second
woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court
allowed the resumption of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   This appeal from the Christian Right gave Bush
``maneuverability'' to commute Ms. Tucker's sentence without
offending his conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington,
director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of his most publicized moments as governor, Bush
chose not to intervene, saying: ``In every death penalty that comes
to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or guilty? And I will
tell you of all the death penalties we have had in our state, I am
confident that those that have been put to death have been
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms. Tucker becoming
born-again, Bush said, ``I have concluded judgments about the heart
and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In August the Tucker execution again became an issue for Bush,
because of a profile in Talk magazine that quoted him as mocking
Ms. Tucker's pleading for her life. His campaign officials have
denied the profile's characterization of the governor, saying his
comments were misread.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush did halt one execution, that of Henry Lee Lucas, one of the
nation's most notorious multiple murderers, who had already been
given several life sentences for other killings. Citing evidence
that Lucas had been nowhere near the scene of the crime for which
Texas was about to executive him, Bush commuted his sentence to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Americans support the death penalty by a large majority, with 71
percent in favor and only 21 percent opposed, according to a Harris
Poll released in July.
</P>
<P>
   Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators
introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally
retarded. Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in
Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to
the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   After the bill passed the state Senate, Bush announced his
opposition, saying, ``I like the law the way it is right now,''
with juries having the right to make the decision. The bill died in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   In another measure to deal with the number of executions and the
growing number of inmates, the Texas Senate and House unanimously
passed a bill this spring to create a state public defender system,
guaranteeing that indigent defendants be assigned a lawyer within
20 days of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Currently defense lawyers are appointed by elected local judges,
often from among their campaign contributors, leading to charges of
cronyism, delays and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vetoed the bill. ``While well-intentioned,'' he said, the
bill proposed ``drastic changes'' that would have lowered the
quality of representation and posed a danger to the public by
requiring that defendants be released if not assigned a lawyer
within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle, in an editorial, said Bush should have
signed the bill, since virtually alone among the states ``Texas has
no system at all'' for public defenders. When lawyers appointed by
judges are competent, the paper said, they have an ethical
conflict, since the judges who pay them want a speedy trial, not an
aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the state senator from Dallas who sponsored the bill,
said Bush had given in to lobbying by judges who did not want to
lose their patronage system. ``One can be a proponent of the death
penalty, as I am,'' said Ellis, ``but also sane enough to realize
we need a real public defender system.''

DEMONSTRATING HOW EXCITING THE STILL LIFE CAN BE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Holland _ Some might argue that 17th-century
still-life paintings are something of an acquired taste,
appreciated by artists for their technical virtuosity but more
likely to remind ordinary mortals of abandoned oils discovered in a
great-aunt's attic.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, in an age of blockbusters, displays of bouquets of
flowers, bowls of fruit and slabs of meat may not immediately
spring to mind as guaranteed crowd-pleasers.
</P>
<P>
   A new show at the Rijksmuseum here, ``Still Life: Paintings From
the Netherlands, 1550-1729,'' goes a long way toward challenging
any such prejudice. With 70 carefully selected paintings, many on
loan for the occasion, it claims to be the first exhibition to
display all the different types of still life from the golden age
of Dutch and Flemish painting. And it succeeds in demonstrating why
they were so popular in their day and why they are attracting new
interest today.
</P>
<P>
   The show runs in the Rijksmuseum's South Wing through Sept. 19
and will then be on display from Oct. 31 to Jan. 9 at the Cleveland
Museum of Art, which has a rich collection of still life of all
periods and is a co-organizer of this exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Still-life paintings, of course, existed before and after the
17th century, yet something remarkable happened in the Netherlands
around that time. Rembrandt may have been painting in Amsterdam and
Rubens and Van Dyck in Antwerp, but the truly popular genre was
still life.
</P>
<P>
   During the period covered by this show, it is estimated that no
fewer than 250,000 still lifes were produced in a territory with a
population of just four million. And in his day, Jan van Huysum,
for instance, could fetch more for a still life than, say, a
Rembrandt portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Van Huysen? Well, Rembrandt's only known still life is in the
show (although even here he adds a figure) as is one of myriad
floral arrangements by Jan Brueghel the Elder. But many still-life
painters who were household names in their lifetimes, their works
coveted by European royalty as much as by wealthy merchants, are
now known only to experts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 18th century, when fashion turned away from still
life, once-valuable paintings were stored away, their artists
forgotten. And when interest in Netherlandish still life revived in
the 1920s and '30's, it focused on the genre more than the artists.
</P>
<P>
   For the curators of this exhibition _ Wouter Kloek of the
Rijksmuseum and Alan Chong, formerly of the Cleveland Museum of Art
and now with the Art Gallery of Ontario _ the real challenge was
how to pick a representative handful of works from the tens of
thousands that are available. They have done so skillfully,
choosing paintings that cover the whole period in question and
illustrate how artists came to specialize in very specific types of
still life.
</P>
<P>
   Netherlandish still life was born of religious paintings, which
frequently included fruit as metaphors for Nature. Indeed, the
first work in the exhibition, Pieter Aersten's ``Meat Pantry of an
Inn, With the Virgin Giving Alms'' (1551), would appear to be
religious, but red meat, a cow's head, sausages and the like crowd
the foreground, with the Virgin visible only through a window in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Some still lifes also carried inscriptions of a metaphysical
nature. On his ``Self-Portrait With an Allegorical Still Life,''
David Bailly notes, in Latin, the Old Testament admonition ``Vanity
of Vanities, All Is Vanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art historians are forever arguing whether every dead bug,
every dead bunny is a religious symbol,'' Chong said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the potential symbolism of, say, flowers (altar
pieces), books (knowledge) and skulls (death), the marketplace,
rather than piety, soon played the central role in encouraging
artists to concentrate on still lifes. And the fact that still
lifes were favored by the likes of Emperor Rudolf II further
stimulated local collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings became not only required furnishings in bourgeois
homes but also, in their portrayals of tables laden with food, of
silver jugs, even of herring, bread and beer, reflections of the
prosperity of both the northern and southern Netherlands. In his
paean to the Dutch herring, for example, Joseph de Bray even added
a poem to his still life ``Praise of Pickled Herring'' (1656).
</P>
<P>
   With so many artists at work, competition led to specialization
and tremendous concern for quality. Thus, Floris van Dijk excelled
at cheeses: in ``Laid Table With Cheese and Fruit'' (1615),
half-wheels of old and new cheese carry the knife marks of a recent
snack.
</P>
<P>
   Adriaen Coorte, renowned for his depiction of shells, berries
and asparagus, catches the transparency of ripe fruit in
``Gooseberries on a Table'' (1701). Willem Heda's ``Laid Table With
Ham and Roll'' (1635) is famous for capturing the lightness of a
slice of ham beside the weight of the ham from which it was cut.
</P>
<P>
   Willem Kalf's valued talent was to catch the reflection of light
off silver, glass or pottery. ``Chinese Bowl and Nautilus Cup''
(1662), one of three of his works in the exhibition, has a dark
background, with light bouncing off a half-peeled orange
strategically placed to draw attention to a hand-painted and
decorated Chinese bowl and the near-transparency of a glass cup.
</P>
<P>
   Willem van Aelst, in contrast, was a feather man: in ``Dead
Birds and Hunting Gear'' (1664), the soft plumage of the dead
partridge and pheasant is almost tangible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Still lifes were virtuoso tests of an artist's skill,'' Chong
writes in a catalog essay. ``The intricacies of composition,
arrangement of space and rendering of materials were all problems
to be conquered. From its very beginnings, Netherlandish still
lifes were praised as tours de force.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many artists were highly secretive about their
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jan van Huysen reportedly refused to accept pupils and would
not admit visitors to his studio for fear of having his secrets
stolen,'' Kloek writes in another catalog essay. ``He worked in
solitude and apparently without a workshop assistant, so in his
case there is no fear of workshop assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely perhaps, while the artists were trying to make the
inanimate objects in their paintings as lifelike as possible, their
compositions were stylized to the point of being artificial. In
other words, they were interested not in portraying a real
food-covered table, but rather one where the fruit or the meat or
the cheese were posed.
</P>
<P>
   A video accompanying this exhibition shows one such table being
prepared, with a hand constantly moving things around until the
mise-en-scene is satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, flower paintings showed careful, and at times
impossible, arrangements. Both Jan Brueghel and Ambrosius
Bosschaert, for example, portrayed bouquets of fresh flowers that
blossom at different times of the year (they might have worked from
botanical prints or watercolors or perhaps even artificial silk
flowers).
</P>
<P>
   Some artists even included tropical flowers, which were now
becoming known through voyagers to the New World and Asia but would
hardly still look fresh in a jar in Antwerp. Insects and
butterflies on petals were in turn pure artistic license.
</P>
<P>
   It could of course be argued that all still lifes were trompes
l'oeil, but the trompe l'oeil also became an important category of
its own. The exhibition includes ``Letter Board'' (1666-1678) by
Samuel van Hoogstraten, which shows how the game was played. On a
17th-century letter board, objects were held down by strips of red
ribbon nailed to the board.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the exercise, though, was to demonstrate the
painter's skill in rendering a variety of items, in this case a
comb, a pair of scissors, a quill pen, a medallion, a letter with
red sealing wax and so on. Hung on a wall, it was meant to look
like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelis Brize came even closer to reality with his painting of
``Account Ledgers of the City Treasury of Amsterdam'' (1656), which
depicts bunches of papers hanging from eight knobs on a wooden
wall, the papers variously identified as ``travel money,'' ``legal
actions,'' ``building works,'' ``special accounts'' and the like.
The papers come in all states and sizes, some folded, others
crumpled, many yellowing. Since this is how they were kept in the
City Treasury of Amsterdam, it seemed appropriate that Brize's
version of them should also hang in the City Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Netherlandish still-life movement ended in the early
18th century remains a mystery, particularly since still lifes
continued to be painted elsewhere in Europe. Kloek offered that
``still lifes became too complicated, and the genre was
abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that fewer young men were pursuing
artistic careers and that therefore less outstanding talent was
apparent. But Arie Wallert, a curator of painting at the
Rijksmuseum, pointed to the market for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interior design changed,'' he said. ``Instead of paintings,
people wanted entire walls to be decorated. And remember that the
Amsterdam bourgeoisie was very rich. It was all a question of
fashion. When the wall paintings went out of fashion, they were in
turn painted or papered over.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Netherlandish still lifes may remain a matter of personal
taste, but they have recovered their place in the history of art.
``A virtual torrent of scholarly interest in the last two decades
has been matched by the soaring value of still lifes on the art
market,'' Chong noted.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for admirers of the genre, this show is reason
enough, as Kloek puts it, ``to succumb to its magic and to sing its
praises.''

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Huffy Corp. is shuffling top administrators after
the resignation of Carol A. Gebhart as president and general
manager of the the company's San Diego-based Washington Inventory
Service unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always disappointing to lose a friend and certainly Carol

Frederick, vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
``But I understand people make decisions and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gebhart's decision to leave was her own and she is not
immediately taking a job with another company. She worked 18 years
for Huffy.
</P>
<P>
   Her job will be filled by I. Edward Tonkon II, formerly
president and general manager of Huffy Service First.
</P>
<P>
   Paul R. D'Aloia takes over the Huffy Service First job, after
serving as president and general manager of Huffy Sports Co.
</P>
<P>
   Randy R. Schickert, Huffy Sports Co. vice president of global
operations, is being promoted to president and general manager of
the sports unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that our management succession is working,'' said
Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   He said the changes do not signal a change in direction for any
of Huffy Corp.'s units.

   WASHINGTON _ During the 1988 Democratic primary, after Al Gore

<P>
   In 1992 Bill Clinton's supporters accused the press of going too
far in pursuing the particulars of the candidate's restless libido,
saying it was in the past and it did not matter. As it turned out,
it wasn't in the past and it did matter. Now those same supporters
are goading the media to dig into George W. Bush's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's a legitimate question,'' said the Senate minority
leader, Tom Daschle, when asked if W. should answer the question
about cocaine. Bush has resolutely ducked the issue, saying he
won't play the game of rumor-mongering, even though he has
``learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want payback. And Republicans have been throwing
stones from glass houses for so long, they can no longer recognize
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's affair with a young Capitol Hill aide was an
open secret in Washington all during impeachment, and all through
his pompous lectures about America's cultural and moral decline.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of W.'s campaign is the notion that voters made a
mistake when they turned out his father for a hedonistic Bill
Clinton. The Bushes, the subtext goes, will uphold the moral
authority of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, before he was a candidate, W. told of how troubling
the Oval Office sex scandal was for young people and volunteered
that he had been faithful to his wife, Laura. ``In my case,'' he
said, fidelity is an important prerequisite for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But that puts W. in a bind: He stresses some personal history as
relevant to his election, even as he dismisses other personal
history as rudely beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe he would be so coy about cocaine if he
could just say, in a simple declarative sentence, that he had never
tried it. W.'s Clintonesque evasiveness contrasts starkly with the
simple No's of the 11 other presidential candidates asked.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields'' show last weekend,
Rowland Evans asked Bush to say ``flatly if these rumors are or are
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of trying to force me to prove a negative and to
chase down unsubstantiated, ugly rumors has got to end,'' Bush
replied, adding: ``What people need to know about me is that when I
swear in, I will swear in to not only uphold the laws of the land,
I will swear to uphold the dignity in the office, of the office to
which I had been elected, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   So now W. is trying to say that the only behavior that's
relevant is what happens after you're sworn in as president. Fine _
except that he's already boasted that fidelity is relevant before
you're sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine issue is trickier than the marijuana issue because,
as Jesse Jackson points out, there is a disparity between the way
rich kids and big shots and suburbanites get treated when they are
caught with cocaine, and the way poor people are treated when they
get caught with crack.
</P>
<P>
   And as Time notes this week: ``If Bush did try cocaine, how does
that square with his support of Texas legislation putting those
caught with less than a gram of the drug in jail?''
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over a controlled substance is, of course, distracting
from the deeper question of the other kind of substance.
</P>
<P>
   W. is the kind of guy who doesn't want to know more than he has
to know _ the president of the fraternity who thought it was not
cool to study too much or work as hard as the geeks in the library.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have good instincts, and he knows how to get good
advice. But does that qualify him to lead the country? That's the
substance abuse we should worry about.

 _ SF CHRON   Fee Increases Recommended for Pac Bell 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Pacific Bell could double the cost of directory assistance calls
to 50 cents each, and reduce the number of free 411 calls customers
get each month from five to three, under a decision recommended to
state regulators yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation by a state administrative law judge would
also let Pac Bell raise rates for customers who want to check if a
busy line is working to $1.20, up from the 50 cents now charged.
And Pac Bell could raise the cost of an emergency interrupt to
$1.25 from $1.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission will consider the
proposed decision at its September 16 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While substantial, the recommended increases were not as large
as Pac Bell had requested.
</P>
<P>
   The company had wanted to institute a rate cap of $1.10 on 411
calls. If it had, Pac Bell could have raised rates to that amount
just by giving the state Public Utilities Commission 30 days
notice. The company said it had no plans to charge $1.10, however.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell had requested permission to charge $2 for each busy
line verification and $4 for each emergency interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumer advocates said the proposed decision is harmful
to customers and said they'll fight for its defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does a lot for Pac Bell shareholders but nothing at all
for ratepayers,'' said Paul Stein, an attorney with The Utility
Reform Network.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said Pac Bell has not shown that its costs for providing
411 service are so high that it should be allowed to charge 50
cents. And he said limiting the number of free 411 calls per month
amounts to another rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another example of Pac Bell being allowed to raise
rates at a time when rates are supposed to be falling,'' Stein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has generated a lot of interest since Pac Bell filed
its request last year. Consumer groups had lobbied heavily against
allowing Pac Bell to raise its rates and the PUC received more than
4,000 letters and e-mails from customers, most of whom said the
cost for directory assistance should not go up.
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell officials say they need the increases to help cover
costs. John Britton, a spokesman for Pac Bell, said the company is
losing money on directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decision that allows Pac Bell to cover its costs and
still gives customers the best bargain in California,'' Britton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some long-distance carriers, such as AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom,
offer local directory assistance at higher rates, usually around $1
per call.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company is ``grateful'' for the 25-cent
increase on 411 but said it may fight for more than the proposed
increases &UR;  &LR; for busy line verification and emergency interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Boyd, senior telecommunications analyst with the Office of
Ratepayer Advocates, said any increase is not justifiable because
Pac Bell's costs to provide 411 service have been falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calls take less time because a lot of it is automated. There
are fewer 411 operators and fewer 411 centers where calls are
answered, so how could it cost more?'' Boyd asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed decision, written by Michael Galvin, said Pac
Bell had shown that its 411 costs were higher than what it is
allowed to recover. Galvin also said the monthly reduction in free
411 calls should not be an issue because ``almost 80 percent of
residential customers make no more than three directory assistance
calls in a given month.''

 Another Providian Review
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Federal bank regulators have launched a review of consumer
complaints lodged against San Francisco's Providian Financial,
potentially opening another front in the credit card giant's legal
problems, according to people who have been contacted as part of
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency finds any
violations of law, regulators could order Providian, the nation's
ninth-largest credit card company, to halt improper practices,
consumer law specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   Providian spokesman Marc Loewenthal described the OCC review as
routine, ``part of the normal regulatory process.'' He said it's no
different than if the agency had decided to look into the company's
preparations for the potential year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   The OCC began its review of Providian's marketing and
collections practices in June, sources said. That month, the OCC
examined complaints against Providian filed with the Better
Business Bureau, said Pat Wallace, who heads the bureau's Oakland
office.
</P>
<P>
   He said an OCC examiner spent more than a day poring over the
bureau's Providian file. ``She asked me what types of complaints we
had,'' Wallace said. ``What she seemed to be looking for was
disclosure problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the Better Business Bureau has received nearly 900
complaints about Providian in the past few years. Many allege that
the company used high-pressure methods to sell products such as
credit protection or auto club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   The OCC review of Better Business Bureau complaints came shortly
after Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke, the agency's chief,
denounced ``seamy ... unfair and deceptive'' tactics used by some
lenders. His remarks were made in a speech to an industry group in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke delivered his broadside several weeks after the San
Francisco district attorney's office confirmed it was investigating
Providian for alleged consumer fraud and unfair business practices.
That was followed by a spate of federal and state lawsuits charging
the card issuer with such abuses as deceptive sales practices and
fee-gouging.
</P>
<P>
   The OCC never comments ``on the specifics of an individual bank
case,'' said spokeswoman Janis Smith. At the same time, she noted,
``Anytime we are made aware that there is a third party that
receives consumer information, we do review it.``
</P>
<P>
   Providian has repeatedly said it considers its sales practices
to be legal. However, it also said it would review all sales
materials to make sure that terms are clear to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates two banks that it uses to extend credit to
cardholders. The OCC has authority to look into possible violations
of state or federal law by nationally chartered banks. It also is
responsible for ensuring that lenders comply with laws requiring
them to fully disclose loan terms.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer experts said it appears that the agency's review of
Providian is not part of the periodic examination process banks go
through once every year or two, but a special effort to gather
information on the company's marketing and collection practices.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not unusual for the OCC to examine bank consumer
practices, the review of Providian appears to be particularly
vigorous and focused, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very heartening news for consumers,'' said Linda Sherry,
a credit card specialist with the San Francisco advocacy group
Consumer Action.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Providian said in its quarterly filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it couldn't estimate the
extent of its potential liability in more than a dozen consumer and
shareholder lawsuits seeking class-action status in state and
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``An informed assessment of the ultimate outcome or potential
liability associated with these matters is not feasible at this
time,'' the company said in its filing.

LANCASTER, SANTA CLARITA BANKS TO JOIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Valencia Bank &AMP; Trust of Santa Clarita, north of
Los Angeles, is acquiring First Valley National Bank of Lancaster,
for $6.1million in an all-stock transaction, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent bank in Santa Clarita is buying First
Valley to expand its business in the Antelope Valley, which is
located 55 miles northeast of Los Angeles. First Valley branches
will keep their name.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for First Valley shareholders to exchange their
shares for Valencia Bank stock, which works out to $13.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The stock prices of both community banks were up sharply Tuesday
at the news: Valencia Bank rose 9 percent to $15.75; First Valley
jumped 20 percent to $9 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a win-win situation for both organizations,''
said John Reardon, Valencia Bank's chief executive officer. ``On a
combined basis, our legal lending limits increase as a result of
merging.''
</P>
<P>
   As a larger institution, the combined company will raise the
ceiling for its largest loan to $4 million, up from $2.5 million
for Valencia and $600,000 for First Valley. Since both community
banks primarily serve the small-business lending market, the higher
loan cap strengthens their business potential.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials hope to finalize the merger by year-end,
providing they receive regulatory and shareholder approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Thedeal would give Valencia Bank branches in Palmdale and
Lancaster and $38 million in assets. The combined entity would have
$185 million of assets and five branches.
</P>
<P>
   Two of First Valley's directors will join Valencia Bank's board.
However, it's not yet clear what role, if any, First Valley's chief
executive officer, C. Ellis Porter, will play.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia Bank officials also aren't ruling out any plans to
shutter any First Valley branch. They also expect to have some
layoffs, but the extent of downsizing is not yet known. Valencia
employs 55 people and First Valley has 30 workers. Valencia Bank
officials say they will try to minimize any layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage combines two profitable banks: Valencia Bank earned
$1.2 million, or 95 cents a share, in 1998 compared with $750,888
(65 cents) in the previous year. First Valley made a profit of
$98,684 (23 cents) in 1998 compared with net income of $230,470 (55
cents) a year ago. Lower loan activity accounted for the drop in
earnings, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Rubens, a banking consultant for California Research Corp.
in Santa Monica, said Valencia Bank landed a sweet deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the acquisition price is on the low side,'' he said,
calculating the price-to-book ratio as 1.43. It's more common to
see 2 and higher. ``Valencia Bank got a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reardon explained that both banks benefited from the
transaction. In addition, First Valley's size makes it difficult to
compete in the marketplace.

   STRESS IN EMERGING MARKETS TRIMS YEAR'S BIG GAINS
</P>
<P>
   The world's emerging markets are showing some signs of stress,
from currency problems and a bank scandal in Indonesia to a
political and economic mess in Russia, military tensions in China
and dwindling interest in Latin American stocks. After soaring a
collective 40 percent in the first half of the year, their stock
markets have fallen 7 percent more recently, and the mutual funds
that invest in them have little cash on hand. Market Place.

which, he said, caused him to have a nervous breakdown. The firm
did not comment on the suit, which adds to its legal burden as it
juggles two other high-profile discrimination cases.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Granting Financial Wishes Under One Roof  
 By Peter Sinton 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Niman Ranch was able to move its meat-packing plant from San
Francisco to Oakland and is hiring 35 new workers because it
received $1.2 million in low-interest loans from it.
</P>
<P>
   Marcela Davison Aviles also went there to get $550,000 in
financing to launch her Blackboard Entertainment multimedia company
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   And Wanda Lovette has it to thank for $48,000 it needed to open
Wanda's Cofe Barista at the Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   These businesses and scores of others have found answers to
their financial dreams at the Oakland One Stop Capital Shop. It is
one of 15 U.S. centers sponsored by the Small Business
Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development
in concert with local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1996, the Oakland One Stop Capital Shop handed out
about $24 million in guaranteed SBA and city loans to about 125
businesses in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The shop was originally set up specifically to address the needs
of three areas in the city (West Oakland, East Oakland and
Fruitvale) that were part of an economic empowerment zone under an
initiative of President Clinton to help inner cities and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, any entrepreneurs in Northern California with
good business plans and a willingness to locate in economically
depressed areas can go to the sixth floor of 519 17th St. in
Oakland and find most everything they need _ from information to
counseling to capital _ under one roof. Financial institutions such
as Bank of America and Citibank even lease space in the offices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The goal is to provide support for new and existing small
businesses and bring economic prosperity to underserved
communities,'' said SBA Program Manager Michael Elkin.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the plan is to create jobs. The city of Oakland
figures that the $2.6 million it has pumped into 15 small
businesses from January 1998 through March of this year created
82.5 jobs and retained another five.
</P>
<P>
   The average investment per job of $29,714 is a bargain compared
to some other programs, according to Oakland One Stop Capital Shop
program manager Greg Garrett. In addition, the program is creating
sustainable businesses and tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recent beneficiary of the SBA program in Oakland is
Niman Ranch, which for 20 years has been selling hormone-free,
grain-fed, Marin-raised cattle to top restaurants. But as demand
for the gourmet beef, and also pork and lamb, has mushroomed into a
$9 million annual business, Niman Ranch outgrew the processing
space it leased from Golden Gate Meats in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, the company worked with the city of San Francisco
and the Small Business Administration to find a new location in San
Francisco, but it was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat plants have all been torn down and the property
values are very high,'' said Mike McConnell, who co-owns Niman
Ranch with Rob Hurlbut and company founder Bill Niman. The company
found a potential location in a former furniture factory at
Minnesota and 23rd Streets in San Francisco that it could acquire
for $1.2 million at favorable interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But it would have taken another $1 million to turn it into a
packing plant and McConnell also worried about potential conflict
with owners of four new nearby apartment complexes over truck
traffic at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He checked out other meat-packing plants in the Bay Area and
learned about the old Tesio Meats facility near the Nimitz Freeway
in Oakland. In December, on a visit to Oakland to check out
business licenses, McConnell heard about the One Stop Capital Shop
and paid it a quick visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' he recalled. ``It took about an hour for
officials to say `Here's what we can do for you,' and propose a
package of financing.''
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than that to iron out the details, but Niman
Ranch moved into the Oakland plant in January and received $600,000
in financing at a 7.5 percent interest rate from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to buy the building and make some
improvements. It received another $600,000 in federal economic
development funds at a 3.5 percent interest rate for additional
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Niman Ranch has hired 20 new employees since the beginning of
the year, mainly Latino butchers who know how to carve up whole
carcasses. The company is committed to hiring another 15 employees
in Oakland in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   That should not be a problem of the growing demand for Niman
Ranch's meat, which now supplies 45 steers, 70 lambs and 350 hogs a
week. The company is expanding &UR;  &LR; its market by selling sausage and
other packaged products at Trader Joe's and other stores. It also
is selling some of its fresh meats through retailers like
Webvan.com, which charges a whopping $11.97 for a pound of Niman
Ranch prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   Marcela Davison Aviles approached scores of venture capital
firms to win financing for her Blackboard Entertainment multimedia
company before going to Oakland's One Stop Capital Shop last year.
</P>
<P>
   With a law degree from Stanford, an undergraduate degree in film
history from Harvard and a desire to create an alternative to
often-violent and mindless children's programming, Davison Aviles
would seem to have the right stuff. But the venture capital
community was not interested in her independent video vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture capital companies tend to focus on high-tech, dot-com
and biomed,'' Davison Aviles observed. ``If you are outside their
universe, getting financing can be a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Blackboard Entertainment was not looking for huge
amounts of money. That could have worked against it because VCs
increasingly are looking to make larger bets on more developed
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Davison Aviles said that dealing with the One Stop Capital Shop
was ``very straightforward.'' The city of Oakland put up $250,000
for seven years at an attractive 7.5 percent interest rate. In an
innovative arrangement, the city also took a 5 percent stake in her
company. Wells Fargo Bank loaned an additional $300,000, secured by
Davison Aviles' East Bay home.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Blackboard Entertainment leased space in a loft
that once served as the laundry room of the defunct St. Joseph's
hospital in Oakland's Fruitvale district.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 10 employees and recently branched out from
``You Can Ride a Horse'' and a series of other ``You can''
educational videos for kids. Davison Aviles' new ventures include:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Magic Media, a 50-50 joint venture with Magic Johnson Entertainment
that is creating a curriculum-based reading series in comic book
format. It stars three-time NBA MVP Earvin ``Magic`` Johnson and by
the end of next year hopes to be in one-quarter of U.S. schools.
Magic Media also plans to expand into games, housewares, home
furnishings, greeting cards and school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Bag It,'' a pilot TV show that Davison Aviles describes as ``an
urban `Hardy Boys''' show. The program has been sold to the Disney
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A new, and as-yet-unnamed, Spanish-language television show for
children featuring animation, live action and puppets from the same
people who brought viewers in this country ``H.R. Pufnstuf'' in the
1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Lovette was managing the Everett &AMP; Jones barbecue stand at
the Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland when she asked herself,
``If I can run someone else's business why not run my own?''
</P>
<P>
   But the onetime 21 dealer in Las Vegas didn't simply gamble on
getting into business, she did a lot of homework.
</P>
<P>
   Before settling on espresso drinks and pastries and the name
Wanda's Cofe Barista, Lovette went to Starbucks and other coffee
vendors, checked out their menus and prices and talked to managers
and clerks. She boned up on the coffee trade at free seminars
offered by Peerless Coffee in Oakland and took evening classes on
how to write a business plan that were sponsored by the University
of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   She learned about the One Stop Capital Shop at the business
course as well as from a bank she approached for financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought in all the information One Stop needed, like the
cost of equipment and supplies and the lease for the (Network
Associates) Oakland  &LR; Coliseum, which takes 15 percent of
revenues,'' said Lovette. ``They saw my vision and worked with me
every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda's Cofe Barista won $48,000 in financing. Slightly over
half of that went for equipment, including an $18,000 cart that
Lovette plans to take to downtown Oakland as soon as she gets a
permit.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The issue of law and order has always been part
of George W. Bush's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for governor of Texas in 1994 with a series of grainy
black-and-white commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at
gunpoint in a parking garage and, a moment later, a police officer
draping a blanket over the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann Richards, was
soft on crime, Bush promised to get tougher with criminals. That
stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the
nearly five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent
in pressing a law-and-order agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has presided over the nation's largest prison-building
program and a record number of executions in his tenure as
governor. He has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to carry
guns and has opposed gun-control legislation. ``For Governor Bush,
gun control is not yet part of crime control,'' said Travis County
Constable Bruce Elfant, one of the many law-enforcement officials
who have come to see gun control as important as fighting drugs and
gangs in the battle against crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a conservative state where being ``Texas tough'' is high
praise, Bush's positions have been popular.
</P>
<P>
   How Bush's record on criminal justice, particularly gun control,
will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested as he
campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. In Texas,
experts on criminal justice are studying another question: whether
his policies are responsible for the state's drop in crime
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said his initiatives,
especially those toughening punishment for juvenile offenders and
making convicts serve longer terms, had produced a 20 percent drop
in the Texas crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, crime
had already fallen 25 percent under Gov. Richards, from 1991 to
1994, as she pushed a multibillion-dollar-prison-building program.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in 1995, crime rates have also fallen as
much, or more, in most states as they have in Texas. This has led
governors and mayors across the country to take credit, even as
many experts point out that the widespread decline in crime rates
makes it less likely that any one policy can be credited. Longer
prison sentences are one factor in the overall decrease, experts
say, but so are an improved economy, a decline in the use of crack,
new police strategies and changing attitudes among young people.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush ran against Gov. Richards, when he pledged to support
a concealed-weapons bill. When, as governor, he signed the bill
into law in 1995, he declared, ``This is a bill to make Texas a
safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been championed by the National Rifle Association,
but was opposed by the police chiefs of Texas' largest cities, who
were concerned that the law would lead to more violent
confrontations between individuals armed with guns and a greater
risk to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents had predicted it would lead to a rash of
shootings. Supporters said it would sharply cut crime. Neither
seems to have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went against the police chiefs of Texas' seven largest
cities this spring by opposing a bill to require background checks
on all prospective firearms buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, gun shows are the leading source of guns for criminals
and juveniles in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requiring background checks died in committee April 20,
a few hours after the school killings in Littleton, Colo., which
were carried out with guns bought at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the
country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents,
second only to Louisiana's 736. By contrast, Minnesota, with the
lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov.
Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took
office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the state prison system had 41,000 beds. When the
buildup is completed next year, it will have 150,000 beds. The Bush
administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion, while
some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued
growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun
to question that state's prison-building program. Republicans worry
about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats
argue that the program has taken money away from the state college
and university system.
</P>
<P>
   The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending
for public education, one of Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna
Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy
Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's major planks in his race against Ms. Richards was
a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of
skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as governor, Bush has transformed
the juvenile justice code. One result: a tripling of the number of
young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush can do for the United States what he has
done for Texas, no one can lick his boots,'' said Dallas Juvenile
Court Judge Hal Gaither, an adviser to Bush who describes himself
as ``the most conservative man in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the
main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best
interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison
system in which punishment is emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be
sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the
maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a
one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has
presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, whose death-row
conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev.
Pat Robertson and other religious leaders. She was only the second
woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court
allowed the resumption of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   This appeal from the Christian Right gave Bush
``maneuverability'' to commute Ms. Tucker's sentence without
offending his conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington,
director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush chose not to intervene, saying: ``In every death
penalty that comes to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or
guilty? And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had
in our state, I am confident that those that have been put to death
have been guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms. Tucker becoming
born-again, Bush said, ``I have concluded judgments about the heart
and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators
introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally
retarded. Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in
Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to
the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   After the bill passed the state Senate, Bush announced his
opposition, saying, ``I like the law the way it is right now,''
with juries having the right to make the decision. The bill died in
the House.

WASHINGTON TALK: SUMMER WIND ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the time of year when many Americans take
vacations. After a summer of barbecue, balloons and a midsummer
straw poll to forecast the result of a midwinter straw poll, Roger
Salazar and Elizabeth Dole have done their fellow campaigners the
service of showing that presidential campaigns need vacations, too.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, took the first
step when he misstated his boss' position on abortions for poor
women. He told The Des Moines Register last Saturday that Gore
opposed spending federal money on such abortions except when the
mother's life was in danger. That may have been Gore's position
once, but at least since 1992, when he became a vice-presidential
candidate, he has supported an end to all restrictions on when
Medicaid can pay for a poor woman's abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dole went on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' on
Sunday, exhilarated after 3,410 Iowans (14 percent) had voted for
her in a straw poll in Ames, and said she had won a ``wonderful
victory.'' But then she would not say what she would do about drugs
from Mexico, whether she thought the Boy Scouts should admit
homosexuals, what cuts she would make in domestic programs or
whether she thought the theory of evolution should be taught in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she believed in ``continuing the ban on federal
funding'' for abortions. The next day, she told The Washington Post
the same. But when a reporter told her that federal law now allowed
Medicaid to pay for abortions in cases of rape, incest or to save
the life of the mother, she said: ``I have been in favor of
continuing what we are doing now. I just want to be sure exactly
what the situation is. Let's don't pursue that further now, because
I need to check that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sniping consultants suggested that this displayed a
shocking lack of depth, perhaps even a failure to read her own
letter on the subject, written to supporters last April.
</P>
<P>
   She had a simpler explanation. According to her spokesman, Ari
Fleischer, she said, ``I made a mistake'' by not remembering what
current law was. Such an admission, while not unprecedented, is
truly rare among presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you know, someone will admit to having changed
his mind about a serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, Bill Bradley has already done that by conceding that he
had been wrong when, as a U.S. senator from New Jersey, he said
subsidies for ethanol were wasteful. Now that he is running for the
Democratic presidential nomination in Iowa, he has seen the error
of his past view.
</P>
<P>
   The real message of Dole's week _ and one she seemed to have
learned by Tuesday, when she promised a tax reform plan ``in the
fall'' _ is that it's all right to take some time off and study up
on a problem. It's called vacation reading. And she is taking next
week off.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley took his vacation in July, but even so he is still
deciding what he thinks about health care and similar problems.
Gore is planning to see family and hit the beach, without an
announced reading list.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar struck a blow for all campaign staff members by showing
that it is not just the candidates who could profit from some time
to clear the straw from their brains.
</P>
<P>
   Here again Bradley set an example. On Friday, July 16, while he
was off for 10 days, he gave his staff one day off. That's about
the ratio the working stiffs in the other campaigns should expect.

U.S. APPEARS PREPARED TO INDICT 4 GUN DEALERS IN CHICAGO STING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sting operation that led last year to Chicago's $433-million
lawsuit against the gun industry is expected to result as well in
federal indictments on Wednesday against four firearms dealers in
the city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments are to be announced by the U.S. attorney in
Chicago, Scott R. Lassar, whose office has been investigating
evidence collected by the Chicago police in that sting. The
operation made targets of 12 suburban gun stores that federal data
showed had sold the highest number of guns recovered from crime
scenes in the city or seized by the police there.
</P>
<P>
   Lassar's office said in a statement on Tuesday that he would
hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce a variety of
federal firearms charges against a number of defendants. A
spokesman declined to comment, but one law-enforcement official
said four of the 12 stores that were investigated would be among
those charged, and The Chicago Sun-Times reported on Tuesday that
Lassar had told Chicago officials that there was enough evidence to
prosecute at least four stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the undercover operation, mounted last year, Chicago police
officers, posing as gang members, told gun dealers that they wanted
to buy handguns to take back to Chicago, where it has been illegal
since the early 1980s to own a new handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Some undercover agents boasted to store owners that they needed
to buy guns because they had lost their weapons when chased by the
police. In other cases, the agents had partners act as stand-ins,
or so-called ``straw purchasers,'' after telling gun store clerks
that they did not have the state license required to buy a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the evidence gleaned from the sting operation,
Chicago filed its lawsuit accusing the 12 suburban stores, along
with several gun makers and wholesale gun dealers, of creating a
public nuisance by failing to keep thousands of guns a year from
being taken into Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   All the accused have denied wrongdoing, but one dealer, not
among the 12 investigated, has closed his store and is cooperating
with Chicago officials.
</P>
<P>
   The federal charges on Wednesday could mark a new front in the
nation's effort to control illegal gun sales. Hampered by adverse
court decisions, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has
not conducted routine undercover sting operations at gun stores
during the last decade to determine whether dealers are breaking
any laws. But if the Chicago action results in successful
prosecutions, it could prompt the agency to reconsider.

 &HT;    WOMAN IN FETUS CASE DIES AFTER LIFE SUPPORT HALTED 

</HEADLINE>

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A woman being kept alive through court order so that
her unborn child could survive died Tuesday after a judge said her
family could remove life support.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at Memorial Hermann Northwest Hospital turned off
the machines, and Tammy Martin, 34, was allowed to die shortly
after 5:30 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Probate Judge Rory Olsen signed the order earlier
in the afternoon to discontinue life support efforts for a comatose
pregnant woman and her 17-week old fetus. The fetus, declared dead
by court-appointed doctors last week, was the center of conflict
between Martin's family and Martin's common-law husband, Scott Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no victory here today. We just want to bury my
sister the proper way,'' said Lonnie Martin, the woman's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ends a monthlong legal feud by Law against the
Martins and the hospital. Law, 35, sued Memorial Hermann Northwest
July 23, saying it conspired with Martin's family to allow her and
the fetus to die.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had been in the hospital since July 18 after suffering a
blow to the head. The family said doctors told them there was
little chance the fetus would survive and asked that treatment be
stopped. A judge that day issued a two-week restraining order
preventing the hospital from withdrawing life support.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tuesday hearing, Dr. Thomas J. Mims testified that on the
night of Aug. 9 doctors were preparing to perform a tracheostomy on
Martin and noticed the fetus had no life signs.
</P>
<P>
   A sonogram was then conducted and no heartbeat or other vital
signs could be detected, Mims said.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the sonogram, Olsen ordered that doctors not
affiliated with the hospital should perform further tests of the
fetus and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed doctors examined Martin the next day and
declared that she was brain-dead and that the fetus had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no purpose to keep life support for Miss Martin,''
said Mims, who testified by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Law has said that Martin was injured when, as he was backing out
of a driveway July 18, his pickup lurched out of gear and an open
truck door hit Martin in the head.
</P>
<P>
   He said she seemed fine after the accident and went to sleep,
but hours later she started throwing up and was rushed to the
hospital unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family said it believes that Law was criminally
negligent and Harris County investigators said last week that
criminal charges could be filed in the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Law was called to testify Tuesday and said he agreed that Martin
was brain dead and that the fetus had died and that life support
should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's brother, who has pleaded with the courts and public for
weeks to allow his sister to die, said Tuesday that issue has been
an emotional ordeal for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like we had to suffer through two deaths. She had to die
twice,'' Lonnie Martin said, ``and the fetus is in there too, so it
is really three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we have been wronged in a way because it took
four and half weeks for somebody to finally make a decision to let
us have our family member buried,'' a tearful Lonnie Martin said
outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say if the family would pursue any legal action
against Law in connection with his sister's death.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a recent hot afternoon, Albert Brooks could be
found in his office at Universal Studios, getting worked up over a
snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means nothing!'' exclaimed Brooks, when asked about the
lone item tacked to a cork bulletin board on his wall _ a
photograph of him standing alongside Elton John, who composed the
score for Brooks' latest movie, ``The Muse,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Swept by a gust of paranoia, Brooks got up from behind his
mahogany desk and stuck his face just inches from the picture.
After a couple of seconds, Brooks reared back, looking dismayed, as
if he'd just noticed a rip in his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know why it's up there!'' he wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, it would be a reporter's brief jotting on a notepad
that would set him off. Interrupting himself mid-sentence, he
barked: ``What are you doing? Are you taping and writing?'' Then,
only half-jokingly, he implied that he felt ignored. ``Are you
writing a letter to someone?'' he asked in that tone of hangdog
injury he shifts into so frequently in the six movies that he has
written, directed and starred in: ``Real Life,'' ``Modern
Romance,'' ``Lost In America,'' ``Defending Your Life,'' ``Mother''
and now ``The Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   So kvetchy, exaggeratedly accusing and out of context were
Brooks' outbursts that it was impossible not to wonder if they were
just bits in the making. For nearly two dozen years, after all,
gabbing into a tape recorder has been how Brooks and his longtime
collaborator, Monica Johnson, capture the ideas, dialogue and
scenarios that are later shaped into their feature film scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed in chronological order, perhaps Brooks' oeuvre can be
taken as time capsule chapters in the life of a funny,
curly-haired, emotionally fitful man as he moves from his late 20s
to his early 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defending Your Life'' is the sole exception. In this 1991
film, Brooks' alter ego dies in a car crash and in the afterlife
discovers not heaven but Judgment City, where he is put on trial to
answer for his shortcomings and, in the meantime, falls in love
with a saintly woman (Meryl Streep).
</P>
<P>
   Written by Brooks alone, ``Defending Your Life'' came into being
after he had cast Ms. Johnson out of their Shangri-La of neurotic
shtick in a business dispute. It was at a screening of ``Defending
Your Life'' that the two resolved their differences and threw
themselves back into what they consider to be their niche _
wringing laughs out of the psychological concerns of their
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been proud of the fact that as far as comedy goes,
we're maybe the only people tracking the baby boomer thing,'' said
Ms. Johnson. ``Our movies have evolved as we have. Basically, the
story we pick is about wherever we are in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' character in ``The Muse,'' Steven Phillips, a dejected
Hollywood screenwriter, is definitively middle-aged _ softer of
body, lower on energy and aghast to find himself part of an age
bracket that could be considered obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The film starts out credibly enough: a young Paramount executive
tells Phillips that he's being released from his contract because
he has lost his creative edge. But as he tries to re-ignite his
career in Hollywood, the movie enters fairy-tale territory as
Phillips stumbles upon the closely held secret of A-list filmmakers
like Martin Scorsese and James Cameron (in cameo appearances): They
employ a living, breathing, perks-obsessed Muse (Sharon Stone) who
provides top-quality inspiration and boasts about being a
descendant of the Greek god Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``The Muse'' is an examination of youth worship,
artistic jealousy and self-doubt. Still, when Brooks submitted the
script to the brass at Paramount, where he had a deal, they chose
to pass on the project for reasons that still get a rise out of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry Lansing gave me a complimentary call, but she didn't
seem to want to go into detail,'' he said. ``I heard things like
`too inside' and stuff like that _ stuff that means nothing to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even about Hollywood!'' he said. ``That's just the
location!''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks stared down at his newspaper-strewn desktop. ``You know
what? I sort of feel like it's almost an accident when they do make
my movies. I guess my concepts don't fit standard studio movies.
But that's why I exist! I couldn't make `The Thomas Crown Affair'
if you put a gun to my head. I seriously wouldn't know how to do
it. I work from a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his father, Brooks' difference was stamped on him at
birth. Unable to pass up the chance at a joke, Harry Einstein, a
Greek-dialect radio comedian known as Parkyakarkus, named the
youngest of his and his wife, Thelma's, three children Albert.
(Brooks' brother Cliff is an advertising executive; his other
sibling, Bob, is the mock-daredevil comic Super Dave Osborne.)
</P>
<P>
   Even something so simple as morning attendance could be a
challenge for the slightly built boy who had to answer ``Here''
when the teacher got to ``Albert Einstein?''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner, the actor-director who makes a quick appearance as
himself in ``The Muse,'' said of Brooks: ``He was quite defensive
about his name _ and I'm sure that's part of what created his
humor.'' By his teens, Reiner was spending ``every waking minute''
with Brooks. They met in a drama class, the only hour that Brooks
truly looked forward to at Beverly Hills High School. That was when
Brooks got hooked on the spotlight, playing parts like Bottom in
the school production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' or, Reiner
recalled, performing freestyle riffs for his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew that Albert was head and shoulders above
everybody else, a genius,'' said Reiner, who went on to recount the
many times since then when he has seen Brooks silence a roomful of
humor-mongers not known for willingly yielding the floor. ``I'm
talking people like Chevy Chase, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal
basically acknowledging that you couldn't touch this guy. Whenever
Albert started in, everyone pretty much backed off and just let him
go.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's all part of the Legend of Albert, a story which has him
making a living as a standup comic on television variety shows at
age 19. By then he was already considered one of Los Angeles'
gifted eccentrics, a guy so confident of his talent that unlike
many of his colleagues, he did not rely on the reaction of a
nightclub crowd to gauge whether his material was broadcast-worthy.

 LOS ANGELES: broadcast-worthy.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead, Brooks rehearsed at home before a mirror, confident
that if he could make himself howl, others would react similarly.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he longed to see what it was like to be like everyone else
_ or maybe he just wanted a second opinion. Either way, one day in
1969, Brooks was at Reiner's just a couple of hours before
appearing on ``The Dean Martin Show''; he was road-testing his act
on his best friend's father, the comedian Carl Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to lie,'' Brooks said of Carl Reiner. ``He
said, `This isn't good.''' Nevertheless, pressed for time, Brooks
drove straight to the NBC set in Burbank and unleashed the very
same bit. ``The audience roared,'' he recalled. ``And I remember it
as one of those experiences that really teaches you a lot about
life. It was one of those moments where I went, `I know more about
myself than Carl Reiner does. Wow!'''
</P>
<P>
   What he knew was that his real destiny lay not in telling jokes
but in playing parts. Perhaps that was why, in 1975, Brooks
shrugged off the chance to be the permanent host of ``Saturday
Night Live'' in favor of making, and starring in, six off-beat
short movies for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about a film school,'' Brooks said of his crash
course in writing, editing, casting and being the one who yelled
``Action!'' (albeit mostly to himself). ``That was my film
school.'' Within a year, Brooks was in pre-production on his
feature debut, the media satire ``Real Life.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Brooks' approach has not changed much. ``He
basically wears every hat,'' said Sharon Stone, who did not praise
Brooks so much as fire off a 21-gun salute of superlatives. ``He is
the most prepared, most professional individual I've ever worked
with in any category of filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone also hopes to become the latest beneficiary of Brooks'
career-broadening casting policy, following Debbie Reynolds, for
one, who played his exasperating parent in ``Mother.'' In ``The
Muse,'' Ms. Stone reveals her goofy side by sending up her
real-life reputation as an acquisitive diva. ``If this works for
me,'' she said, ``maybe I won't have to hear that
`she's-too-old-let's-get-Cameron-Diaz' routine anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Brooks, there is a sense that he still gets a kick out of
every aspect of his chosen profession. Except, of course, the parts
that involve the film critics, test audiences or studio executives
who cavalierly alter his vision, knowing they will not be the ones
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever noticed how no executives' names are ever
mentioned in a bad review?'' asked Brooks, while sitting slumped on
his office sofa, one blue-jeaned leg crossed over the other. ``That
would be a hell of a thing to do! Mention all of the executives
involved! It would be like printing pictures of drunk drivers!''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks laughed out loud. At that moment, everything his friends
said about him seemed true: That his marriage two years ago to
Kimberly Shlain, 33, a Web site designer, had helped him create the
kind of home life that puts work in its proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life, in general, used to be very lonely,'' he said. ``I see
people who remain single and immerse themselves in their work and I
don't know how they do it. It's very important to be grounded
somewhere.'' Ten months ago, Brooks became a father, a personal joy
he'd like to make even fuller. ``We'd like to have another child.
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   This, coming from a former recluse known for not letting even
those closest to him see the inside of his house. Judging from his
baby pictures, Jacob Eli Brooks is a beautiful, blue-eyed boy. But
as with other late-bloomer dads, it's his son's reaction to him
that is everything to Brooks. ``We've got a great relationship.
Right from the time he was born, I've been the one who can get him
to stop crying immediately,'' he said, with a touching hint of
swagger. ``I just pick him up and he stops! Instantly! It's so
cute!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's not the only mature auteur pushing a stroller.
Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn have recently made the news with an
infant daughter. Brooks, as it happens, has long been called the
West Coast Woody Allen. It's a compliment _ both men are known for
their modest, wry, angst-y comedies. Still, Brooks seemed weary of
the title. When he was asked if he would like to come up with a
better designation, his shoulders actually drooped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I have to be called something?'' Brooks complained.
Then he perked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about `The Living Stanley Kubrick'?''

IS AT&AMP;T DEAL WITH MEDIAONE TOO LARGE TO BLOCK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct spelling of `Mediaone' in hed)  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As two federal agencies review AT&AMP;T Corp.'s $58
billion bid to buy Mediaone Group, they face the central question
of whether the combination is, in essence, too large to block.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T executives say the acquisition is needed to establish a
cable network so vast and powerful that it will provide high-speed
Internet service, cable television and telephone service that can
compete with the regional Bell companies. Those companies have so
far managed to keep newcomers from challenging them in their local
phone markets.
</P>
<P>
   But three consumer groups said on Tuesday that the cost of
opening the local markets was not worth the price and urged the
government to kill the deal because it would permit AT&AMP;T to
dominate both the cable-television industry and the market for
high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed at the Federal Communications Commission and the
Justice Department, the groups asserted that the proposed
acquisition would violate a raft of antitrust and
telecommunications rules intended to limit concentration of
ownership in the cable and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators should never accept a massive concentration in one
market as a condition for increasing local competition in
another,'' Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer
Federation of America, said. ``This merger breaks all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's bid to buy Mediaone is quickly becoming an important new
test case of antitrust policy. It has also prompted a
re-examination of the current cable ownership rules, rules that
have been suspended for the last seven years because of litigation
between regulators and the industry.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T has recently set out to have some of those rules
rewritten, consumer groups maintain that the deal would enable AT&AMP;T
to dominate the markets for cable television and the new high-speed
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will result in inflated cable and broadband
Internet service prices for consumers and thwart the development of
vibrant competition in these markets,'' the three groups _
Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Media
Access Project _ wrote in a letter to the Justice Department on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In response, AT&AMP;T executives reasserted the central argument
they began making in May when the deal was announced: By growing so
quickly, the company will benefit many millions of telephone
customers nationwide by using the newly acquired cable lines to
break into local telephone markets that have been dominated by a
handful of Bell companies fiercely resistant to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extreme stretch to suggest that there's any antitrust
issue here,'' said James W. Cicconi, general counsel and head of
government relations at AT&AMP;T. ``There is no competitor to the
services we are offering that is being taken out here. Far from it
_ the whole purpose is to provide local competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be providing competition where it doesn't now exist,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Federal communications guidelines prohibit a single company from
holding a 5 percent active interest or 10 percent passive interest
in companies whose wires come close to 30 percent or more of the
nation's homes. But a federal district judge threw out some of
those rules in a case in which AT&AMP;T is not involved, and the FCC
voluntarily stayed the enforcement of those guidelines. That case
is now on appeal, and agency officials say they are in the process
of reviewing the cable-ownership rules, a review they hope to
complete before issuing a decision on the AT&AMP;T deal.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have contended that, after the merger, AT&AMP;T's
market penetration would reach 57 percent of the nation's
households. Executives at AT&AMP;T have said they think the market
penetration is nowhere near that, but they have also told analysts
they think it will be more than the 30 percent permitted under the
rules that have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The company has asked the FCC both to raise the 30 percent
threshold and to change its ownership attribution rules so that a
small ownership interest in a cable company would count less than
it now does.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, federal antitrust rules written
during the Reagan and Bush administrations generally make any
proposed merger suspect if it increases an economic index used by
the government by 50 to 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis by the three consumer groups says that the
proposed AT&AMP;T-Mediaone deal raises the index, the Hirschman
Herfindahl Index, in many markets by 700 to 3,000 points, even
including the proposed spinoffs AT&AMP;T has already announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T's proposed acquisition is a blatant blatant violation of
our nation's antitrust laws and our nation's competition laws,'
said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Cicconi of AT&AMP;T disputed the consumer groups' figures. He also
said that they had distorted the true size of the market and failed
to recognize that AT&AMP;T competes with other high-speed Internet
service offered by the regional telephone companies and with
satellite broadcasting companies.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in blocking a merger on antitrust grounds, ``one has
to show that market power is being used to constrain competitors,
which clearly is not the case here,'' Cicconi said. ``I'm not sure
where they are getting their antitrust advice from.'' &QL;

EXPOSING ROCK'S WAGES OF SIN, BUT THERE'S A PAYOFF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   (af)  
 By KAREN SCHOEMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bret Michaels of Poison was a bit peeved when he saw his band's
episode of ``Behind the Music.'' Like most installments of the VH1
series, this one went straight for the traumas. It dealt with the
fact that Michaels, Poison's lead singer and an icon of '80s
heavy-metal debauchery, has been a diabetic since he was 6 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   No problem there. It talked about the guitarist C.C. DeVille's
life-threatening cocaine addiction and his subsequent 100-pound
weight gain. But that was to be expected. It quoted a former
groupie on the band's sexual escapades and flashed dozens of
fuzzed-over images of women's bare breasts. True, all true. No,
what got under Michaels' skin was something that always gets under
his skin: critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Poison were a bit of a joke, because the
whole thing is, they couldn't play,'' says a photographer, Ross
Halfin. ``The saddest thing about Poison is that they really
thought they were the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels and the rest of the band were on their tour bus
watching when ``Poison: Behind the Music'' had its premiere on July
11. And at that moment, Michaels almost managed to provide fodder
for ``Poison: Behind the Music II,'' should VH1 ever care to make
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross Halfin is a friend of mine _ I thought,'' Michaels
ranted. ``The guy has been on the road with us for, like, months at
a time. Why did he make all this money off our band taking photos
if he hated our guts? He's the hypocrite, not me. You didn't even
want to be on the bus when I went on my Ross Halfin tirade. If he
knew half of what I thought I was going to do to him after I
watched that show, they would have just put me in jail then and
threw away the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, he had just one worry. ``We didn't come off too
sappy, did we?'' he asked. Um, no. ``Good. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Close call, but count another convert to ``Behind the Music.''
Michaels isn't the only person who's a fan in spite of himself. In
the two years since it was first broadcast, ``Behind the Music''
has become the music industry's closet compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the media elite may not blithely volunteer the
information, but just start asking and you'll be amazed at how many
people admit to watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music'' is ``Entertainment Tonight'' without the
heavy cheese factor, ``Biography'' minus the historical
pretensions. It's a simple, brilliant formula: a one-hour
documentary about the ups and downs of music careers, with subjects
from Fleetwood Mac to David Cassidy to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music'' could be trash television _ it comes that
close at times _ but it's well reported, thoroughly researched,
rarely slavish and often winkingly funny. And it gets unusually
close to the comic-tragic essence of life in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   In the TLC episode, Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes is explaining why she
burned down the house of her former boyfriend, the football player
Andre Rison. He had bought 20 pairs of tennis shoes, she says, and
none of them were for her. ``I'd been drinking,'' Ms. Lopes
explains, sighing, ``and there's no size 4. I just, I don't know,
man, threw a pair of sneakers in the tub and lit them.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days the real story is behind ``Behind the Music.''
The show began as one of VH1's periodic attempts to find an
identity apart from its sister station, MTV. But this time
something clicked. ``Behind the Music'' is now the network's
highest-rated show (the Shania Twain episode in October 1998
reached 4.6. million viewers), and ratings are up more than 160
percent since it went on in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Because the program is on every weeknight (with premieres on
Sunday), each episode is in heavy rotation, running about 40 times
a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's intense exposure. At a time when the concert business is in
the doldrums, radio is stagnating in the hands of corporate giants
and MTV is willfully unconnected to anyone over the age of 15,
``Behind the Music'' does something fundamental: it sells records.
Bands and performers profiled on the show see an immediate uptick
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Def Leppard had a `Greatest Hits' album that was nowhere,''
said George Moll, one of the show's executive producers. ``When we
did `Behind the Music,' it climbed into the top 10 on Billboard's
album chart.'' The show also brings fans out to concerts: Lynyrd
Skynyrd's box-office receipts jumped 45 percent after ``Behind the
Music'' told the band's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a part of the marketing scheme for many artists,'' said
Moll. ``Artists now approach us, which in the early days was
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music'' has a reputation for being
tragedy-obsessed, but the producers are taking pains to get away
from that. ``The easy swipe is, `I'm not going to get on the show
because I didn't lose a limb,''' said Moll.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gaspin, another executive producer, said: ``The bookings
got a lot easier after we got Madonna. Because when people would
say, `That series is for losers,' we'd say, `Is Madonna a loser?'''
</P>
<P>
   The show has branched out beyond individual careers into shows
about events, like Woodstock and Lilith Fair; also in the works are
shows about important behind-the-scenes figures, like the '50s disk
jockey Alan Freed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the best episodes are the shamelessly emotional ones. The
more buffoonish a band's public image, the more it's going to whomp
you when the members confront the nuances of private turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In an episode about the heavy-metal band Motley Crue, a former
lead singer, Vince Neil, discusses the death of his 4-year-old
daughter from kidney cancer. Wearing a leather vest, his tattoos
showing, Neil reaches up to wipe a tear from his eye. ``It's like a
smack in the face,'' Gaspin said. ``You watch it and go: `Oh my
God. I cannot believe I was laughing at these guys, and now I'm
crying with them.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is another of the show's secrets: you don't have to like
the band to get sucked in. Most of the show's producers come from
news backgrounds, so they're more concerned with finding great
human interest stories than with being reverent. And once you're
roped in, watch out: it's hard to be condescending toward someone
you've just tearfully bonded with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find yourself having respect for someone you thought was a
joke your whole life,'' said John Sykes, the president of VH1.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, ``Behind the Music'' goes beyond just selling
records or concert tickets: it revives entire careers. For
once-beloved performers now past the peak of fame, ``Behind the
Music'' is the new chic stop on the comeback trail, the
rock-and-roll equivalent of a tell-all hour with Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   The show's first episode, in 1997, was devoted to Milli Vanilli,
the '80s dance-pop duo shamed into oblivion when it was discovered
that they hadn't sung their own songs. The two had been so
crucified in the press that it took three months of wooing before
one of them, Fabrice Morvan, consented to an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hanging out with the producer, trying to find out what
kind of person she was,'' Morvan said. ``Eventually I was invited
to her house, so I knew where she lived.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Morvan was starting to perform his own material in
clubs around Los Angeles, and the show gave him credibility beyond
his wildest expectations. Ask him where he's playing now. ``The
last performance I did was at Dodger Stadium on June 12, in front
of about 55,000 people,'' he said. ``It was a Wango Tango.'' The
Wango Tango is a Los Angeles radio station festival. And yes, he
really sang.
</P>
<P>
   But the most ardent spokesman for ``Behind the Music'' is Tony
Orlando. The voice of ``Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak
Tree'' was slogging away in Branson, Mo., playing up to 400 shows a
year, when he was approached by VH1. Orlando's exhaustive interview
touched on his cocaine problem, his relationship with the comedian
Freddie Prinze, his days as a '60s teen-age idol and his mentally
handicapped younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All told,'' he said, ``it took about four days.'' And the
process wasn't entirely smooth. ``He was really nervous,'' said
Moll, the executive producer.`` One of the points of contention was
having his ex-wife in the show. I got warnings from his attorneys
that if I broadcast anything libelous or defamed him in any way, I
was a dead man.'' Orlando said: ``At the time, I was like. `What?'
But in the end I was happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy may be an understatement. Orlando's concert bookings
increased to the point that he decided to close up his theater in
Branson. The producers of ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' invited him to
Broadway for a limited run. He's now scheduled for a millennium New
Year's Eve concert in Atlantic City. Plus he has three offers for
book deals and an offer to do a network television movie based on
his life and career.
</P>
<P>
   ``All off that show,'' Orlando said. ``Isn't that crazy? Now
isn't that incredible?''

CAMPAIGNING FOR TOP JOB AT UNESCO, AN EGYPTIAN DEFIES SECRECY
TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An iconoclastic Egyptian working at the World
Bank has begun a public campaign for the top job at Unesco, in
defiance of the secrecy that now surrounds the choice.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Ismail Serageldin, has a Harvard Ph.D. and has
written books on topics as diverse as Shakespeare and
biotechnology. He is being supported by a lengthening list of
Middle Eastern intellectuals and some American scholars who would
like to see Unesco get more international recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Serageldin, an architect by training and now a vice president of
the World Bank, has proved he can give a higher profile to global
scientific issues. He is good at publicity, a rare talent in the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will have no influence in the election of a new
director- general because the United States left the organization
under President Reagan and has never rejoined.
</P>
<P>
   Unesco _ officially the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization _ is based in Paris and has 2,500
employees there. It chooses a director-general in a secret ritual
worthy of Byzantium: officials will not release the names of
candidates, thought to be 11. Serageldin is one of those but has
the disadvantage of not being put forward by his home country,
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The cutoff date for nominations is Sept. 6, and in later weeks
Unesco's board will meet to pick a nominee to send to the general
membership for approval, also in secret.
</P>
<P>
   In the informal system of geographic rotation that prevails,
Asia _ a term that in this case encompasses countries from the
Middle East to the Pacific _ is claiming the job, a six-year
appointment. The two regional countries most actively promoting
their candidates are Japan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are as open as Serageldin about their nominee,
Koichiro Matsuura, the Japanese ambassador in Paris and a former
director-general of Tokyo's Economic Cooperation Bureau, which
handles development issues worldwide. Something of an insider, he
is chairman of Unesco's World Heritage Committee, which selects and
tries to preserve important natural sites, architectural treasures
and monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis, by contrast, have been busy behind the scenes on
behalf of their nominee, a diplomat and poet, Ghazi Al-Gosaibi, who
is now ambassador in London. To the distress of Serageldin and his
backers, the Saudis have lined up most of the Arab world, including
Egypt, behind Al-Gosaibi.
</P>
<P>
   Serageldin openly called on Middle Eastern intellectuals to
protest. ``The writers, authors, intellectuals should be heard,''
he said in an interview. ``I tell them, write to your leaders.''
His backers say that Saudi Arabia, with its cultural restrictions
and lack of a free press, is hardly qualified to lead in the world
of ideas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League envoy who now directs the
Center for the Global South at American University in Washington,
said he supports Serageldin because the independent Egyptian has a
wide intellectual range. He is also well known in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever gets elected has to bring back the United States,
because that is a major, major resource and also because it is a
bridge between the global North and South in education, culture and
so on _ the most revolutionary country in technology,
communications and science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Unesco _ at that time mismanaged, corrupt and toying
with a New International Information Order that would have hobbled
journalists _ was jolted by the withdrawals of the United States,
Britain and Singapore. By 1987, it found a reforming
director-general in Federico Mayor of Spain. He improved
management, even some of the sharpest critics say. Two years ago,
Britain returned to the organization, which now has 185 members.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also decided to return, but President
Clinton backed away after Unesco drew hostile criticism from
Republicans, some outraged that an organization of foreigners had
dared to designate American landmarks as World Heritage Sites or
natural regions as important biospheres without consulting
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was another case of the Clinton administration not
wanting to have a fight,'' said John Bolton, executive vice
president of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a
former assistant secretary of state for international organizations
in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton opposes rejoining Unesco, saying it has not reformed
enough. In any case, he said, the rest of the world has given up on
American participation and no one is interested in Washington's
views.

HILL VS. THOMAS, AGAIN IN THE COURT OF SENATE OPINION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ What more is there to say about the 10 days of
riveting Senate confirmation hearings in October 1991 whose two
main participants _ Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill _ seem, even
now, enigmas?
</P>
<P>
   Much more, say the makers of ``Strange Justice,'' a Showtime
movie that has its premiere next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks they know what happened because the television
footage is so imprinted in our memory,'' said Ernest Dickerson, who
directed the film. ``It always struck me that there was probably a
lot going on that we didn't know. What was going on inside Clarence
Thomas' head? What about Anita? These two complicated people were
thrust into the limelight, into national exposure, without ever
wanting to be there. It was traumatic for both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 10 days in October _ when Clarence Thomas, a conservative
black federal judge, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee
on national television, only to be publicly accused of sexual
harassment by Ms. Hill, a former colleague _ is the backdrop for a
drama that seeks to explore the very issues raised at the hearings:
race, sex and political expediency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars Delroy Lindo as Justice Thomas and Regina Taylor
as Ms. Hill. Mandy Patinkin also plays a central role, as Kenneth
Duberstein, a Washington insider who had been hired by President
George Bush to lead the political and public relations campaign for
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The drama, written by Jacob Epstein, is based on the book
``Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas,'' by Jane Mayer
and Jill Abramson of The Wall Street Journal. (Ms. Mayer is now a
writer for The New Yorker and Ms. Abramson is Washington editor of
The New York Times.)
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the film followed a circuitous route. TNT was
supposed to make it but dropped out. The Fox network then intended
to take on the project but scuttled it after Rupert Murdoch,
chairman of the News Corp., which owns Fox, objected to it. People
close to the situation said that Murdoch was a friend of Thomas and
believed that Thomas had been railroaded at the confirmation
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Offsay, Showtime's president for programming, said he had
picked up the project because after reading the book and the
adaptation, he realized how little was actually known about the two
conflicting and conflicted characters, Thomas and Ms. Hill. Beyond
this, he said, echoing the view of the filmmakers, the public
hearings were merely a sideshow to the maneuvers of the Bush White
House and its manipulation of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of people, I thought I knew what happened,'' said
Offsay. ``I didn't. We were hoaxed, basically, by both sides of the
aisle. This is, basically, Washington behind closed doors, the
story you didn't see in the glare of the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   What the story depicts is not so much who was lying and who was
telling the truth but how the White House manipulated the Senate
hearings, from which key witnesses were excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, the writer, said that although he was more sympathetic
to Ms. Hill than to Thomas, he saw both as caught in a political
maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, both of them were victims of a savage and
manipulative and corrupt process,'' Epstein said. ``Anita Hill was
genuinely aggrieved, and came forward out of a certain
guilelessness and was tarred and feathered in the process by these
Washington politicians. And Thomas was swept up by a very tactical
and ruthless team of political strategists. And he was very nearly
destroyed by the process. I was surprised at how naive both of them
were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington process, with its strategists and politicians, is
the centerpiece of the film. Far less sympathetically and
compellingly portrayed are the senators, Republican and Democrat,
most notably the Democrat Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the
judiciary committee.
</P>
<P>
   He is depicted as caving in to the White House strategy of
bulldozing the nomination through the Senate when he bars public
testimony by two witnesses who were crucial to Ms. Hill's claim of
sexual harassment. (The Senate later narrowly confirmed the Thomas
nomination by a vote of 52-48.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators were operating out of fear, and that was one of
the issues that was not really explored at the time,'' said
Dickerson, who was director of photography on six Spike Lee films
and whose own feature films include ``Juice'' and ``Surviving the
Game.'' ``The senators were afraid of attacking Clarence Thomas
because nobody wanted to appear racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was a brilliant chess move on the part of the Bush
White House. They were appointing a black conservative who
vehemently opposed a lot of the gains made by the civil rights
movement, and they knew that anyone who attacked him would face
charges of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the real-life drama, as depicted in the film,
was Duberstein, a likable, shrewd moderate Republican consultant
who had been a chief of staff in the Reagan White House. He handled
the Thomas nomination for the Bush administration. ``With
Duberstein, we tried to find the moral center, the person holding
the different pieces together,'' Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As portrayed by Patinkin, Duberstein had his own doubts about
Thomas' veracity, but he remained a good soldier. ``I didn't try to
play _ or be _ the real Ken Duberstein,'' said Patinkin, a familiar
Broadway performer who is also returning to the television series
``Chicago Hope'' this fall. ``I was playing an individual who was
hired to do a big job. And in the course of that, the individual
realized that the person he represented was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   None of the actual participants in the Clarence Thomas-Anita
Hill story have seen the film or participated in the making of it.
Patinkin said Duberstein had sent him a friendly letter offering to
meet, but Patinkin refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was asked to play a historical figure was in
the film `Heartburn,' where I was playing Carl Bernstein,'' said
Patinkin. ``I met with Carl and with Bob Woodward. And then Mike
Nichols, the director, fired me and hired Jack Nicholson, whom he
wanted from the very start.'' He laughed. ``It was not on my agenda
ever again to meet the historical person I was to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone connected with ``Strange Justice'' watched
videotapes of the Senate hearings numerous times, read the
transcripts and reviewed newspaper and magazine articles about it.
Lindo, who has appeared in films like ``Clockers'' and ``Malcolm
X,'' visited Thomas' hometown, Pinpoint, Ga., near Savannah, and
spoke to people who knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to one gentleman who was raised with Judge Thomas and
who told me that even as a child Clarence was different, he always
had his head in a book, he was always very disciplined, didn't play
much with other kids,'' said Lindo. ``This suggested a person who
saw himself, even as a kid, different from other kids, who saw
himself not bound by the environment in which he grew up. That
suggested to me an interesting element to his psychological makeup.
I decided to develop that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindo said he had struggled to erase his own personal judgments
about Thomas (``His politics are not my politics'') but to create a
balanced portrait of a complicated man. ``Anita Hill didn't want
these hearings public and neither did Clarence Thomas,'' said
Lindo. ``They were both forced into it. And basically he was forced
into defending himself with every bone and fiber in his body. Here
was a man like a cornered animal. It got to a point where I
understood why he conducted himself the way he did. I don't think
he had any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor, who plays Anita Hill, said she had struggled to find
what lay behind the cool, seemingly unflappable mask that Ms. Hill
presented on television. ``There was an overriding intelligence and
grace and dignity, a great deal of control that you saw on the
tapes,'' said Ms. Taylor, best known for her starring role in the
critically acclaimed NBC series ``I'll Fly Away.'' She has also
appeared in films like ``The Negotiator'' and ``Courage Under
Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Ms. Taylor also came away with, in her depiction of Ms.
Hill, was a woman struggling to keep herself in check. ``I think
there was a seething, a sadness, a loneliness, a defiance about
her,'' Ms. Taylor said. ``There was also some self-deprecating
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her; I've always had a great affinity for her,'' she
continued. ``But I did take great pains to show her as a living
human being. I didn't want to think of her as a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``She's a human being; let's see her as one. And she
was in this because it was something she ultimately felt she had to
do. And she was out there alone _ against all odds. The Republicans
had their agenda; the Democrats had theirs. No one could protect or
defend her effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, who is also the film's executive producer, said he had
worked with little else but the public record and the book in
creating the drama. ``Our goal was never to do a docudrama; our
goal was always to try to find some meaning in the events that the
whole country watched, and to give that a larger truth,'' he said.
``What I've done is created dialogue for scenes that I know took
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The film itself, while sympathetic to Ms. Hill, avoids making
judgments about Thomas or his accuser. ``We don't say that one side
was right and the other side was wrong,'' said Epstein. ``Our goal
wasn't to point fingers at either of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film clearly points fingers at a Washington
establishment, made up of both parties, that demands expediency at
any cost. ``These two people were caught up in the culture wars
that define our government and our politics now,'' said Epstein.
``And they were exploited by people desperately trying to keep
their own side in power.''

BOEING TO COOPERATE IN RACE BIAS INQUIRY, LABOR DEPT. REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Labor Department announced on Tuesday that the Boeing Co.
had agreed to cooperate with its investigation into charges of
racial discrimination at several Boeing operations, partly
resolving an unusual confrontation between the government and the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department filed three complaints with an
administrative law judge last month because, it said, Boeing, which
is the world's largest aerospace company, had refused to provide it
with records from its operations in Seattle; Mesa, Ariz.; and
Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   As a military contractor, Boeing is obliged to supply the
documents, the government contended. But the company refused,
calling the government's requests unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings before the judge, Stuart Levin, were scheduled to begin
on Thursday. As part of the settlement, Boeing agreed to give the
department all the documents it had requested from its Mesa
Training Systems operation and its commercial airplane division in
Seattle. But the third complaint brought by the government,
requesting employment records at two Boeing plants in Wichita, was
not resolved and is scheduled to be heard next month.
</P>
<P>
   The department began its investigation after a black worker
complained to the department in December that there was widespread
discrimination at the company. In January, Boeing announced a
$15-million settlement of a separate, private class-action suit
charging the company with discrimination. The deal has since been
challenged by some Boeing workers and has not yet been approved by
the judge in the case.

EDITORIAL: BENEATH THE RUBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 18:
</P>
<P>
   There is no immediate consolation for the victims of the
earthquake that struck western Turkey, including Istanbul, early
yesterday. It was, in a way, the worst possible combination of
circumstances, a brutally powerful quake striking at night in an
urban region that appears to have built well beyond its capacity to
respond to a civic disaster on this scale. But an earthquake of 7.8
on the Richter scale, originating so close to a population center,
is near surpassing the ability of any region to respond swiftly
enough to limit the immediate loss of life. The number of dead and
injured, already counted in the thousands, will surely rise in the
days ahead as debris is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   After the earthquakes of recent years in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, we all know the grim routine _ the probing under rubble,
the almost delicate demolition of abruptly collapsed buildings and
bridges, the stories of unexpected, unimaginable survival and the
stories that end in ways that are equally unimaginable. What
follows now, too, is a temporary form of cooperation among nations
and aid groups that cannot be reproduced except in crisis. Turkey
will need billions of dollars in emergency financial assistance,
extensive medical aid, including field hospitals, and specialized
rescue equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lessons that will be drawn from this earthquake will
be drawn by engineers and geologists, who will extract the only
true meaning that an earthquake possesses. The remaining lessons,
personal ones, will be drawn by humans who witness, some for the
first time, the limits of suffering and strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth seeks its own equilibrium _ the result is an
earthquake _ and in doing so it radically unbalances humans. In a
tornado or a hurricane, there is something roaring and visceral out
there, something embodied, something approaching, a force acting on
a human scale of time and amenable to a human sense of narrative.
An earthquake is simply too swift, too impersonal. It offers no
sense of sequence, just a dramatically compressed time-scale,
before and after. That is especially true in this earthquake, when
everyone awoke only to the sequel. Restoring the survivors to a
sense of living continuity, a sense of Earth's stability, will be
as hard as rescuing the missing.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At least 2,000 people have been reported
killed by the powerful earthquake that struck northwest Turkey
before dawn on Tuesday, destroying thousands of buildings and
giving rise to a vast archipelago of tent-cities erected by people
afraid to sleep indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, which struck at 3:02 am. local time on Tuesday,
ripped through villages and cities while most people were asleep.
Thousands were shaken out of their slumber to find walls
collapsing, windows shattering and roofs tumbling down on top of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that nearly 11,000 people were injured
by the earthquake and that they expected the death toll to rise.
Countless bodies remained trapped under pulverized buildings early
Wednesday morning. The most passionate plea from Turkish government
officials to neighboring countries has been for more digging
equipment and more dogs to help locate victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many living people who still have not been saved
from beneath collapsing buildings,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said on Turkish television Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter was near the industrial city of Izmit, about 55
miles east of Istanbul, where as many as 1,000 people were killed,
most of them trapped inside huge apartment buildings that crumbled
within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, site of a naval base on the southern coast of the
Izmit Gulf, more than 248 sailors and naval officers were trapped
under collapsed buildings, with scores of people still unaccounted
for by late Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was by far the strongest on record in this area,
although the exact magnitude has not been determined. Turkish
seismologists said the quake registered a magnitude of 6.7, while
U.S. scientists first reported a magnitude of 7.8 but said
additional measurements of the quake's intensity could lower that
number.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, hundreds of buildings collapsed to dusty piles of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic, endless and exhausting race to dig out bodies from
beneath the wreckage, rescue crews used bulldozers, tower cranes,
front-end loaders and jackhammers to dig into piles of debris 20
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenarios played out across a wide swath of Turkey,
which included highly populated regions like Istanbul, with 12
million people, and Izmit, with nearly 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary destruction, most of Istanbul's
stunning mosques and their minarets survived the disruption and
appeared to remain in fairly good condition. Even while the vast
majority of apartment buildings were dark, both because of power
failures and residents' widespread fear of staying indoors, the
mosques remained well lighted and eerily serene against the late
summer sky.
</P>
<P>
   The treasured landmarks of the city, including the Blue Mosque,
Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia, were spared any visible damage.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul on Tuesday night became transformed into a city of
tents and lean-to shelters as hundreds of thousands of people,
afraid of aftershocks, camped out across the city along highways,
in parks and in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is too afraid to stay indoors,'' said Aydin Ayaydin,
a member of Parliament who represents the Avcilar district of
Istanbul, an area where as many as 70 buildings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Jusuf Sever, a 54-year-old high-school teacher in Avcilar,
watched in shell-shocked dismay Tuesday evening as soldiers and
about 100 construction workers tried to dig through the mountain of
concrete that had been his apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fast asleep, along with my wife and my daughter, when we
woke up and the whole building was swaying back and forth,'' he
recalled, pointing to what remained of his bed on the fringes of
the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the ceiling was gone and we were looking at the
stars in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Sever's apartment was on the fourth floor of a six-story
building. The two floors above him were simply ripped off the top
of the building, which allowed the family to escape without injury
before the rest of the building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many areas were without electricity or water late on Tuesday. A
large oil refinery not far from Izmit exploded and burned
uncontrollably for hours, pouring black smoke over the area.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. energy secretary, Bill Richardson, was in Istanbul at
the time of the quake and was unhurt. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also visiting Turkey and
offered help such as helicopters, tents and blankets from U.S.
bases there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many people were already raising questions about whether
slip-shod construction practices had made a bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In areas that were badly hit by the quake, many buildings with
little visible damage stood beside others that were utterly
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of buildings along the main road through the
Avcilar section were still standing, interspersed every few blocks
by apartment buildings that were heaps of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively new five-story apartment building with balconies
and satellite dishes looked as if it been pulled out of the ground
and tilted on its side. Each floor, from the front balconies to the
rear windows, remained parallel to the one above it but now sloped
at a 45-degree angle toward the ground.

   Telephone service within Turkey was disrupted in many areas but
seemed to be functioning normally by the end of the day. But people
trying to telephone from abroad found it almost impossible to reach
anybody in Turkey for most of the day. In part, that was because
countless thousands of callers with relatives and friends in Turkey
were jamming the international phone links into the country. But at
least part of the problem appeared to be due to the limits of the
telephone network.

governments from Europe, the United States, Israel and Iran pledged
to send medical supplies, equipment, rescue workers and other forms

condolences and indicated it would send an airplane to help out.

rubble under the glare of spotlights throughout the night,
thousands of people kept a weary vigil in the hopes of finding
friends and family members.

USC'S MacKENZIE FRUSTRATED, HAMPERED BY HAMSTRING 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ The knee is fine, but now it's the hamstring
that is bothering USC tailback Malaefou MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   After missing nearly a year with torn knee ligaments, MacKenzie
is playing football again for the Trojans. He is expected to be a
key performer, but his training-camp work has been slowed by a sore
hamstring, the result of too much running in the hills near his
house in Mission Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated. It's just tight. I'm overcompensating,''
MacKenzie said. ``The knee's 100 percent. That's what's so
frustrating. I'm not worried about the knee.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie this year will be playing the ``rocket'' position,
which is basically the fullback position in a split-back formation.
He also will line up some plays at wide receiver, which all of the
tailbacks are doing as USC tries to diversify its offense.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie is practicing only once a day at UC Irvine and said he
feels rusty trying to come back from the knee injury he suffered
against Purdue last August in the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the most frustrating years of my
life,'' he said. ``It was just a freak thing. A freak play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel like I'm behind, but I'm going to be ready
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker shuffle: True freshman Aaron Graham might not
redshirt as expected. He's No. 2 on the depth chart at middle
linebacker, as redshirt freshman Armand Holland sits out this week
and possibly next with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The luxury of redshirting may not be the case,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said. ``Especially if he's No.2 going into the Hawaii
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another position that's been depleted is defensive end.
Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed is suspended from the season opener, and
his backup, Matt Childers, is out with a sore back. That leaves
Bobby DeMars as the No. 1, but Childers is expected back in time
for the Hawaii game.
</P>
<P>
   Steele delayed: Long Beach City College did not fax linebacker
Markus Steele's transcripts to USC on Tuesday, delaying his arrival
at least another day.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Craig Mitchell, who is awaiting a pair of junior
college transcripts, is not expected before Monday.
</P>

Mayfair High tailback Michael Williams, who is also being recruited
by Michigan, Arizona State, Notre Dame and UCLA.

<P>
   The idea of delivering welfare benefits through the existing
commercial networks of cash machines is an attractive one. But the
plan's execution has been botched in ways that have hurt welfare
recipients while negating many of the advantages the system seemed
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was that welfare benefits would eventually be available
to recipients at cash machines throughout New York state, enabling
them to get as much or as little cash as they needed at any one
time. That would encourage better money management habits and at
the same time reduce the risk that welfare recipients would become
victims of muggers after they cashed their checks.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve those ends, recipients need to be encouraged to take
out only the cash they need, and they should get help in keeping
track of their money. Instead, under the contract the state signed
with Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, New York welfare recipients
must pay fees if they make more than four cash withdrawals in a
month _ and they may face fees on every withdrawal if they make
them from machines other than the relatively small number of
Citibank machines that are available without fees. Moreover, until
Citigroup changed its policy following a report in The Times on
Monday, the machines did not provide account balances. Now they do.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame lies with Citigroup, which receives a monthly
fee from the state for each welfare recipient. Until now, Citigroup
has resisted paying the fees to other banks that would allow
welfare recipients to use other machines in the NYCE network, which
includes most banks in the state. Now it has reached an agreement
to allow access to the NYCE machines, though other banks may still
levy fees if welfare recipients use their machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the state must shoulder the primary blame. It negotiated a
contract with Citigroup that allowed for the fees and did not do
enough to require access to a large number of cash machines.
Citigroup says it has complied with the state's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare recipients should not have to pay fees to get at their
money. Before the new system came into effect, recipients had to
stand in line at check-cashing offices, but the state paid the
check-cashing services and there were no additional fees for the
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   New York state should renegotiate its contract with Citigroup to
assure reasonable access for recipients to their money. That means
they should be able to make more than four withdrawals per month,
at machines that are readily available, without having to pay fees.
If that forces the state to pay more to Citigroup, so be it.

RED SOX SHOULD LOOK TO THE YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Since the Oakland A's and their fans aspire to be the
American League's wild-card team, I have a few words for them:
Congratulations, guys. Some people are unrealistic about their
goals, but not you. This system was created for those who dream as
you do.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Red Sox and their fans have also mentioned the
wild card a few times, I have some words for them as well: Yo,
what's wrong with you?
</P>
<P>
   The wild card is to baseball what welfare is to the rest of the
United States. If you're on it, you are certainly glad the option
is available, but you don't want to be weaned on it forever.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the A's and Sox played the second game of their
four-game series at Fenway Park. The A's pounded the Sox. There
were 31,246 fans in the park and many of them could have easily
recited the wild-card standings if you asked for them. Those who
couldn't only needed to pick up the newspaper, where the standings
have their own special area in the sports section. Even the poll of
the day on Major League Baseball's website focused on the wild card
(the Sox had gained 46 percent of the early vote, followed by the
A's and Blue Jays).
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am not a wild-card hater. It gives hope to painfully
mediocre teams such as the A's, who this month went five games over
.500 for the first time since 1995. The A's also have a slim
payroll and a hefty, hockey-playing right fielder named Matt
Stairs. Stairs says there is a good reason he keeps his arms
lowered during his stance: One night a few years ago, he went out
drinking. The next morning, he was so groggy that he could barely
pull his stocky arms over his head. Thus the stance.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, the A's are fun. They are a team that this
set-aside system was made for. But the Sox? They have made the
playoffs three times in the 1990s. It could have been four if they
hadn't taken the first six weeks off in '96. The Sox have no
business looking behind them at wild-card competitors. They need to
be looking south to the Bronx, where the Yankees reside. They
should be looking there because testing themselves against Oakland
and Toronto will only prepare them for a first-round postseason
bruising. That's because the A's and Jays are not true playoff
teams. The Jays are 10-20 against the Sox, Yankees, Indians, and
Rangers. The A's are 18-19 against the same competition. The Sox
are 17-13 against the A's, Yankees, Indians, and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Let the A's think about going in the side door. Can the rest of
us get some Yankee talk going? The New Yorkers have a 6 1/2-game
lead. Isn't it a bit early to concede the division to them?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still a goal of ours,'' Sox catcher Jason Varitek said.
``We are still trying, as a team, to catch the Yankees. But the
good thing about the wild card is that it allows a good team _ like
us last year _ to go to the playoffs, even though another team in
our division had a phenomenal year.''
</P>
<P>
   I hear Varitek. I believe his words are sincere. But I have
heard more players and fans buzzing about the A's and Jays than the
Yankees. New York won 114 games in '98, good enough for a 22-game
margin over the second-place Sox. They officially secured the AL
East at Fenway, splashing champagne all over the visitors' locker
room. Maybe that episode damaged the Sox and prevented them from
seeing the '99 Yankees as they are: a team that can be caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are a formidable team, but we feel we have a club
with good depth,'' Sox general manager Dan Duquette said. ``We'd
still like to win the division. That's our primary goal.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, they should arrive at the park today and
totally disrespect the A's. Each team has won a game in the series,
but the Sox should be thinking that they are entitled to win the
final two games. And when they play the A's twice next month, they
should be telling themselves that those games belong to them, too.
They were embarrassed by the A's in an eight-run seventh and should
be thinking of putting them away tonight and tomorrow. Playing for
a division lead brings out that type of confidence. Playing for a
wild card encourages a scrappy, second-tier type of philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Yankees, the Sox should be eager to test them. The
New Yorkers have not been involved in a true division race since
1997. It is clear that they have more talent than Boston, but no
one has any idea how this team responds to pressure. The Sox and
Yankees play a three-game series in the Bronx beginning Sept. 10.
If the Sox are only five games back then . . .
</P>
<P>
   All of this wild-card talk reminds me of a Chris Rock monologue.
The comedian tells a story of a man who brags about caring for his
children. ``Well,'' Rock says, ``you're supposed to take care of
your kids. What do you want, a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   I could say more about the bottom half of the playoff race. But
I'm sure you understand when I say I'd rather pay attention to the
top.

TRYING TO IMPROVE TRAINING, ARMY TURNS TO HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Movies like ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
``Platoon'' have been acclaimed for portraying the experience of
war in a gruesome, realistic and emotional way. Now the Pentagon is
preparing to tap some of that Hollywood talent to make military
training simulators more realistic and engrossing.
</P>
<P>
   The Army will announce on Wednesday that it is giving $45
million to the University of Southern California over the next five
years to create a research center to develop advanced military
simulations. The research center will enlist film studios and video
game designers for the effort, with the promise that any
technological advances can also be applied to make more compelling
video games and theme park rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never hope to get the expertise of a Steven Spielberg
or some of the other film industry people working just on Army
projects,'' said Louis Caldera, the secretary of the Army, who will
announce the new project at a news conference here. But the new
institute, Caldera said, will be ``a win-win for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the new center, to be called the Institute for
Creative Technologies, reflects the fact that although Hollywood
and the Pentagon may differ markedly in culture, they overlap in
technology. Moreover, military technology, which once trickled down
to civilian use, now often lags behind what is available in games,
rides and movie special effects.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Army has simulators that allow hundreds of
soldiers in different locations to engage in a tank battle on the
same virtual battlefield. Some games played on the Internet,
though, allow thousands of personal computer users to interact in
the same virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing it on million-dollar simulators, and they're doing
it on $400 PC's,'' said Michael R. Macedonia, chief scientist at
the Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command in
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military has already experimented with using some
video games as low-priced training tools, Macedonia said tapping
commercial technology could save the Pentagon money and speed its
technology development.
</P>
<P>
   Film and game companies that participate in the new research
will be expected to contribute financing to it, and it is not clear
how many of them will want to do so, since recruitment has only now
begun. Executives at the Walt Disney Co. and Sony Pictures who were
mentioned by USC officials as being interested did not return
calls, while Spielberg was said by his spokesman to be out of the
country on vacation. The industry will be represented at the news
conference on Wednesday by Jack Valenti, president of the Motion
Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle could be the cultural differences between the
buttoned-down, procedure-oriented military and the open-shirted,
informal entertainment community; the Army hopes that USC, which
already has ties to Hollywood through its film school and to the
military through research programs, will provide a comfortable
neutral ground.
</P>
<P>
   Movie studios and game companies might also be reluctant to
participate in something involving weapons at a time when they are
facing public scrutiny over any role that violent programs or games
might have played in the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard D. Lindheim, executive vice president of the
Paramount Television Group, welcomed the effort, saying, ``It's a
pretty bold step on the Army's part to come to Los Angeles and open
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has already been doing some simulation research for
the Defense Department, Lindheim said, and has ``found that the
focus was very anti-violent, not violent _ to solve problems
diplomatically rather than with all guns blazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in the new institute said its primary focus
would be not on shooting simulations, though some will be done, but
on more complex exercises that reflect the changing role of the
Army, which these days is sometimes dispatched on short notice to
places like Kosovo and Bosnia for peacekeeping operations that
involve little fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Such operations require soldiers to be trained rapidly in local
customs and conditions and, once on the ground, to interact with
local citizens and navigate among different factions.
</P>
<P>
   An Army training center in Germany already employs actors to
play the part of local people as a way of training soldiers for
such duty. But the Army hopes to develop computerized simulators to
help soldiers learn local culture, to practice negotiating with the
mayor or with an angry mob, or to move into a hostage situation and
immediately tell friend from foe. At present, such simulations are
beyond the state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense simulations are not very good at modeling humans and
modeling human behaviors,'' said Michael Zyda, a professor at the
Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. ``We can't do things
other than shoot-'em-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Hollywood comes in. The Army hopes the filmmakers
will make the characters in simulations more realistic and create
story lines that get the soldiers emotionally involved in the
simulation, because emotions can affect how decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces mission has a great deal of emotionality in
it,'' said James H. Korris, a television writer and producer who
directs an entertainment technology research program at USC and
will also be the creative director of the new institute.
</P>
<P>
   Korris said the goal would be to ``inject elements of
personality and feeling into what is today dispassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   John Milius, a screenwriter whose work includes war movies like
``Apocalypse Now'' and ``Red Dawn,'' said the new institute would
be ``another link between Hollywood and the military that seems to
have been broken over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Milius, who said he would be pleased to work with the institute,
noted that in World War II, Hollywood was often called on to make
training and propaganda films, as well as documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new institute springs from a report, issued by the National
Research Council two years ago, that called for the defense and
entertainment industries to cooperate on simulation technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some cross-pollination has already occurred. With the shrinking
of the aerospace industry since the end of the Cold War, some
displaced engineers have moved to designing rides or movie special
effects. Bran Ferren, a top research scientist at Disney, is on the
Army's scientific advisory board, and Disney and the Army are
collaborating in a limited way, said Macedonia, of the Army's
simulation command.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a ceremony at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary
William Cohen presented Spielberg the department's highest civilian
award for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which Cohen said had helped the
American people appreciate the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia views that movie as more than entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very realistic simulation,'' he said, ``that made
people sweat.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 18:
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past 40 years the South Korean economy has been
dominated by the chaebols, a handful of conglomerates with
political connections that gave them access to cheap capital. Many
of them expanded willy-nilly into new industries, seeking growth
and assuming that profits would eventually follow.
</P>
<P>
   The chaebols succeeded in growing very large, but they did so
with relatively little equity and a lot of debt. They seem to have
assumed that if things went wrong, the Korean government would bail
them out. That was probably true in the past, but now it is not.
Daewoo, one of the largest of the chaebols, is being forced to sell
off most of its subsidiaries to pay debt.
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging that the government of Kim Dae-jung did not
come to the rescue of Daewoo, although the failure will cost the
government plenty as it bails out some of the banks and other
domestic companies that lent to Daewoo. Daewoo employs 150,000
workers, and accounts for about 5 percent of the country's economy.
Some of those workers are going to lose jobs, and Korea's recovery
from last year's financial crisis may be set back. But the
alternative of propping up the company would have only delayed the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   As Daewoo is broken up, it is virtually certain that the
company's assets will prove to be worth less than the huge debt _
estimated at around $50 billion _ that it has built up. That means
losses for creditors, and it is important that those losses be
fairly shared. So far, however, foreign creditors have been largely
kept in the dark while domestic creditors _ many of them controlled
by the government _ have seemed to have better information and more
influence. Korea's reputation will be hurt if the process of
dismembering Daewoo is not a fair one to all creditors.

FOR DAUBACH, FANS, THE DREAMS ARE SWEETER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Sometimes you must draw close to hear Brian Daubach
clearly. The Red Sox hero-of-the-moment has the unpretentious habit
of talking softly toward his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the clubhouse Tuesday with his right foot propped
against his locker stall, the rookie quietly engaged reporters with
stories from his baseball past. Daubach does not shy away from
retelling the now-familiar tale. A Midwestern upbringing and nine
years in the minor leagues have made him too polite to turn down
interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   He candidly recounts his long conversion into a power hitter,
who at 27 leads American League rookies in extra-base hits,
doubles, and home runs and ranks near the top of the freshman class
in hits, RBIs, and multihit games. In his last 11 games going into
last night, Daubach has batted .478 with eight home runs, seven
doubles, one triple, and 24 RBIs. He mentions with all modesty that
when he started as a professional in 1990 with the New York Mets
organization, he was unable to hit or run well. And the rookie
claims he still can't run.
</P>
<P>
   But the reigning American League Player of the Week stops short
of saying he enjoys all the attention recently heaped upon him. His
three-run, game-winning double Monday against Oakland and his
heroics against Seattle over the weekend changed the rookie's world
without giving him much time to take measure of his growing
popularity or celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether people on the streets recognize him, Daubach
said, ``I think a little bit more, especially when I'm leaving the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I don't really care about any of that. I just enjoy
being here a lot. I like the fans here. They've been great to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new. In the minor leagues, there's not that much
coverage. Here, especially us being in a wild-card race, it's a new
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go along and enjoy it. Actually, during the games I
don't notice it that much. It's easier to relax during the games.
It's a bit overwhelming, for sure. I've come a long way and the
fans here love the players so much. They're behind us so much. It's
definitely an experience that I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Being new to the hero role, Daubach did not hold a special
celebration Monday night. He did not call home to Belleville, Ill.,
and relive his latest career highlight with his parents, who watch
almost all of his games on satellite television. And he had no
trouble falling asleep or reporting for designated hitter duties
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed the same,'' said Daubach. ``Nothing was different.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the rookie assessed his new situation correctly.
The Fenway autograph-seekers still clamor for Nomar Garciaparra and
wear jerseys with No. 5 on the back. Parents have to point out the
man shagging ground balls at first base and list his recent
accomplishments before a glimmer of recognition crosses their
children's faces.
</P>
<P>
   During last night's game, however, Daubach was greeted with a
standing ovation before his first two plate appearances. The same
fan enthusiasm accompanied his six-minute at-bat Monday night. For
many recently converted Daubach admirers, the attraction lies in
his low salary ($230,000), his long road to the major leagues, and
the element of surprise he has provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep myself in my seat and stop myself from
going over there to get an autograph,'' said Karen Hart of West
Boylston, who made her first trip to Fenway last night in large
part to see Daubach. ``I saw an interview with Brian on one of the
local channels when he first came up. He was so humble and shy. I
was just taken with him right away because he did his time in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the fact that he's older. I love the fact that he's
making just a minimum salary. I love the fact that it's all
storybook quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent feats by the rookie had even general manager Dan Duquette
sounding downright giddy. He likened Daubach's Monday night hit _
on a full count, in the ninth, with two outs, the bases loaded, _
to the stuff of Little League dreams, the ultimate childhood
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely do you see a ballplayer compose himself the way
Daubach did after he hit a ball (foul) out of the park,'' said
Duquette. ``He composed himself and went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The GM sees little reason to send the AL Rookie of the Year
candidate back to winter ball. A break from the game will be a
change for Daubach, who has spent past offseasons selling shoes and
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he'd have to work on,'' said Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   That compliment comes a year after Boston considered picking up
Daubach from Florida. Originally, the Red Sox thought they could
sell the lefthanded hitter to a Japanese team. Instead, the Marlins
released the career minor leaguer in the fall with an early-morning
phone call. The news woke up Daubach. As he remembers, he fell back
asleep, only to have the reality of his situation set in later.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach can insist that nothing is different after the last
week, but no doubt his dreams are sweeter.
</P>

EARNINGS AT DELL RISE 47 PERCENT AMID ROBUST INDUSTRY SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl) 
By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. reported a 47 percent gain in quarterly
earnings Tuesday, exceeding analysts' estimates, as the company
continued to gain market share from rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said sales were exceptionally strong in its fiscal quarter,
which ended July 31, among consumer and small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell reported its results after the close of the stock market.
In regular trading, its shares closed at $41.125, down 31.25 cents,
off about 25 percent from a 52-week high of $55. In after-hours
trading, the shares were quoted as high as $43.125.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that in the quarter it surpassed the rival
Compaq Computer Corp. as the No. 1 supplier of personal computers.
It based its contention, which was not independently confirmed, on
a comparison of its product shipments with analysts' industrywide
estimates. Compaq remained ahead worldwide, according to industry
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts found little not to like in Dell's report. Coming after
reports of strong PC sales by Hewlett-Packard and IBM, Dell's
results confirmed that the market is seeing healthy growth and some
firming of prices. Dell's direct-sales model, in which it builds
each computer to order, has allowed it to grow much faster than the
industry as a whole. But Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard have also
benefited from the continuing troubles at Compaq, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems at Compaq have helped HP, and the general trends
in the market help Dell and Gateway,'' said Seymour Merrin, of
Merrin Information Services. ``There has been a lot of reinforcing
of the high end because people who bought low-end machines on sale
realize they got burned. Now they want more.''
</P>
<P>
   For its second fiscal quarter, which ended July 31, Dell
reported earnings of $507 million, or 19 cents a share, up 47
percent from $346 million, or 12 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier. Sales rose 42 percent, to $6.14 billion from $4.33
billion. The per-share figures reflected a reduction in the amount
of stock outstanding because of Dell's share-repurchase program.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Round Rock, Texas, said it saw a
100 percent gain in the sales of consumer products, an area it had
not previously emphasized. Sales of network servers, work stations
and storage products, which Dell collectively referred to as
enterprise systems, increased 85 percent from an already strong
position a year earlier.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The whole enterprise segment is really on a tear for us,''
said chairman and chief executive Michael Dell in a telephone
interview. ``We're the No. 1 provider of work stations in the
world, Unix and NT combined,'' he said, referring to the two
operating systems commonly used on such machines.
</P>
<P>
   Since Silicon Graphics announced last week that it would seek a
manufacturing and marketing partner for its Windows NT-based work
stations, speculation has centered on Dell as the likely candidate.
But Dell said he had little interest in such a deal. ``Quite
frankly, I don't think we need them,'' he said. ``We're doing it
without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell again led industry growth in unit shipments, revenue and
earnings. Shipments increased 55 percent, twice analysts' estimates
of total industry growth. Dell's operating income was 11.3 percent
of revenue, up from 11.1 percent a year earlier, as operating
expenses declined nearly a full percentage point. Gross profit was
22 percent, up from 21.5 percent in the April quarter but down from
22.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they're pretty much still on a roll,'' said
Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``But this is where
you have to be really careful: What can they do for an encore, and
how much of this is Compaq being pretty much out of commission?''

   LOS ANGELES: for or against an annexation.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual restrictions are especially significant because of
the economic and political importance of the Marketplace. Among the
issues circulating around the $111million development:
</P>
<P>
   The city is pushing to annex the Marketplace over concerns that
it consumes city services without paying for those services with
tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Stevenson Ranch are pursuing a possible annexation
into Santa Clarita, a move that supporters say would give the area
better access to city services, including police protection and
road maintenance. But since residential areas usually cost more in
services than they provide in property taxes, city officials want
the Marketplace included so the plan can pay for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered effort to lure Nordstrom here with a $20
million-plus incentive _ already delayed by lukewarm negotiations
between Newhall Land and the city _ may hinge on whether or not the
city can annex the Valencia Marketplace to pay for the services
that Newhall Land officials say the city must pay to lure the
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land spokeswoman Lauffer said the Marketplace is a
separate issue from Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Valencia Marketplace or Stevenson Ranch could be
annexed to the city of Santa Clarita, the county and city would
need to agree on a property tax sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   And if owners of between 25 percent and 50 percent of the area's
total assessed value opposed an annexation, there would be a vote
among property owners. Votes would be weighted based on the
assessed value of parcels.

RESHUFFLED REVOLUTION CAN GAIN SOME GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Revolution customarily have reacted ineffectively
to the pressure of crucial games. They usually display a lot of
effort, they are willing to run incessantly and make hard tackles.
But they usually end up being outmaneuvered by an opposition more
concerned with patience and possession.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution have a chance to change their habits as they
have fallen out of the playoff zone. They have 11 matches remaining
to finish in the top four in the Eastern Conference, and three of
the next seven will be against fourth-place Tampa Bay and
third-place Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important game of the season for us,''
Joe-Max Moore said while preparing for Wednesday's match against
the Mutiny. ``This is a 6-point game and if we win we will go ahead
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the solution could be Leonel Alvarez and Jeff Baicher,
acquired in trades in an attempt to halt a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two guys who will contribute to the team, two
experienced players who will fit in with the team,'' Moore said.
``They are players who can change the game. You can see in training
how they keep possession. They have a lot of skill and experience,
they know how to control the game and they will allow us to keep
possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez and Baicher are slated to join the starting midfield,
which could go far in altering the very fabric of the Revolution.
Alvarez, who has performed in several hundred top-level matches for
teams in Colombia, Mexico, and Spain, will be expected to impose
his will on the game, as he did with the Dallas Burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive about the future of the team and our playoff
chances,'' Moore said. ``Our attitude in training was very good and
I have a good feeling about this game. It's important to stay
positive and not let the negatives take over, like we've done in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, though, will have to persist with their pressing
style of play. This can knock the opposition off balance and,
possibly, limit the influence of Mutiny midfielder Carlos
Valderrama. But it is a system based on intensity and
interchangeable roles. When the Revolution's intensity drops or
they fail to compensate for each other, they become very
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to do a better job of picking the right time to
press,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez and Baicher arrived in a convoluted way, as the
Revolution were attempting to bolster their defense. They seemed on
the verge of adding central defender Joseph Addo last month, but
instead ended up with striker Ariel Graziani. After three games,
Graziani was traded to Dallas for Alvarez and midfielder Jair was
sent to San Jose for Baicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two great players who are willing to work and
contribute,'' midfielder John Harkes said. ``Only time will tell
with chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a must-win game and we will see how we do under
pressure. We had the right attitude in the last two games against
Colorado and San Jose. After those games guys were pissed off,
angry, and that's great. Because if we didn't react, we wouldn't
have the passion.''

NEWHALL LAND CONTROLS MALL ANNEXATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Staff Writer Gregory Wilcox contributed to this story 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Newhall Land and Farming Company has
apparently kept control of an unusual _ and highly prized _ piece
of a retail complex it sold last year: its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land, the biggest developer in the Santa Clarita Valley,
located 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles, sold the
720,000-square-foot Valencia Marketplace last year for $111
million. The strip mall, located along the Golden State Freeway,
includes a half-dozen big box retail stores such as Wal-Mart and
Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   But according to property records obtained by The Daily News on
Tuesday, Newhall Land still has control over whether or not the
Marketplace _ and the huge sales taxes it generates _ remains in
the unincorporated county or is annexed into the city of Santa
Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   That control gives the Santa Clarita-based developer significant
economic and political leverage in this fast-growing region,
especially considering that the Valencia Marketplace may be the
linchpin for the future jurisdiction of development west of the
freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jirovsky, a senior vice president at Kosmont &AMP; Associates, a
commercial real estate consulting firm in Los Angeles, said that
Newhall Land's control over the annexation issue is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard (of a situation) where a seller would
retain voting rights regarding annexation,'' he said. ``It's kind
of a brilliant stroke on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said Tuesday the company
maintained control of the parcel's fate to ensure the county would
keep interest in a project that it shuttled through regulations and
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stance has been that if any annexations are going to occur
on the west side of the freeway, the city needs to work with the
county,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics question Newhall Land's effort to limit the
annexation of the Marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a former owner care about how much tax revenue the
county retains?'' asked Keith Pritsker, president of the town
council in Stevenson Ranch, an unincorporated housing tract west of
the Marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think this is fundamentally about is not the Valencia
Marketplace,'' Pritsker said. ``It's all about Newhall Ranch and
Westridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two developments are on county land west of the freeway.
Both have been approved in general plan form by county supervisors,
but both are being challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Pritsker said the specific plans of each development would face
more scrutiny and opposition if the city of Santa Clarita annexed
nearby land west of the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're most likely to get the least interference from local
residents in how they build out those projects if the decisions
being made are made in downtown Los Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita city planner Jeff Lambert agreed that crossing the
freeway would mean more than just a larger city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the city closer to areas that still need approvals,''
Lambert said, ``and we would have a stronger stake in what those
developments look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Vannatta, planning deputy for county Supervisor Michael
Antonovich, whose district includes Santa Clarita and the bordering
unincorporated land, said the annexation of the Marketplace would
preclude the formation of another city west of the freeway and
would force the county to give up a prime tax generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, annexations of major commercial entities are a
problem for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lari Sheehan, assistant administrative officer for the county's
chief administrative officer, said Valencia Marketplace won't be
annexed until the owner expresses an interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Marketplace manager DSB Properties Inc. declined
to comment Tuesday. Owner Samuel Mevorach, an Arcadia businessman,
was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual annexation restriction is contained in a declaration
filed by Newhall Land on June 4, 1998, with the county recorder's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Article 8 of the document, titled ``Annexation,'' states that
the Valencia Marketplace owner ``shall not vote in favor of, lobby
for, enter into any agreement or take any steps to facilitate or
promote the annexation or incorporation of all or any portion of
the Property into any city, municipal entity, owner's association
or special improvement or assessment district'' without Newhall
Land's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Article 8 also states that the mall's owner shall, at the
request of Newhall Land, either vote for or against an annexation.

TREASURIES RALLY ON MODERATE RISE IN CONSUMER PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
(js) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bonds rallied sharply Tuesday after a Labor
Department report showed that consumer prices rose in July at the
level that Wall Street had expected. Investors signaled their
relief that prices had risen only moderately, making it likely that
the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee would raise short-term
interest rates only slightly when it meets next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond gained 1 2/32, to a price of 101
20/32, dropping its yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
to 6.01, down from 6.08 percent Monday and its lowest level in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic data released today did not deter market participants
from the expectation of a quarter-point Fed tightening move,'' said
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. He
said the increase ``could well incorporate a rise in the discount
rate in addition to the lifting of the federal funds rate target.''
The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for
overnight loans, while the discount rate is what the Fed charges
member banks.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of a
percent last month, led by a rise in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market rallied on the news mainly in relief that the
CPI increase did not exceed expectations,'' Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports issued Tuesday showed strength in the housing
sector and in factory production. Combined with recent strong data
on jobs, wages and auto sales, they point to continued strong
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders said Tuesday's market gains fed on themselves as
the day's economic reports soothed what had been overblown fears of
an aggressive raising of interest rates by the Fed next week and in
the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a lot of buying after the CPI number and very little
selling,'' said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director
of the fixed-income department at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in
Boca Raton, Fla. ``The fact that there was no follow-through buying
in equities was also a definite positive for bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the market, supply was a factor as the Treasury
sold $10 billion of new one-year bills at an auction that was
weaker than expected and DaimlerChrysler priced its $4.5 billion
global offering through underwriters led by Credit Suisse First
Boston and Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The global sale came in three parts. The company sold $1 billion
of a floating-rate issue due in 2002 and priced to yield 27 basis
points over the three-month London interbank offered rate. Another
$1.5 billion of five-year notes were priced to yield 6.935 percent,
or 115 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. And
$2 billion of 10-year notes were priced to yield 134 basis points
more than a comparable Treasury. A basis point is one-hundredth of
a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   It was DaimlerChrysler's first U.S. dollar-denominated global
issue to be used to refinance older debt, and it attracted a broad
range of investors, of which 15 percent were international, mostly
European and some Asian. Insurance companies and mutual funds were
large buyers of the securities, which came in with a strong name,
global presence and a good credit rating. Investor demand drew
about $9 billion in bids.

USC'S MacKENZIE FRUSTRATED, HAMPERED BY HAMSTRING 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ The knee is fine, but now it's the hamstring
that is bothering USC tailback Malaefou MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   After missing nearly a year with torn knee ligaments, MacKenzie
is playing football again for the Trojans. He is expected to be a
key performer, but his training-camp work has been slowed by a sore
hamstring, the result of too much running in the hills near his
house in Mission Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated. It's just tight. I'm overcompensating,''
MacKenzie said. ``The knee's 100 percent. That's what's so
frustrating. I'm not worried about the knee.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie this year will be playing the ``rocket'' position,
which is basically the fullback position in a split-back formation.
He also will line up some plays at wide receiver, which all of the
tailbacks are doing as USC tries to diversify its offense.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie is practicing only once a day at UC Irvine and said he
feels rusty trying to come back from the knee injury he suffered
against Purdue last August in the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the most frustrating years of my
life,'' he said. ``It was just a freak thing. A freak play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel like I'm behind, but I'm going to be ready
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker shuffle: True freshman Aaron Graham might not
redshirt as expected. He's No. 2 on the depth chart at middle
linebacker, as redshirt freshman Armand Holland sits out this week
and possibly next with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The luxury of redshirting may not be the case,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said. ``Especially if he's No.2 going into the Hawaii
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another position that's been depleted is defensive end.
Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed is suspended from the season opener, and
his backup, Matt Childers, is out with a sore back. That leaves
Bobby DeMars as the No. 1, but Childers is expected back in time
for the Hawaii game.
</P>
<P>
   Steele delayed: Long Beach City College did not fax linebacker
Markus Steele's transcripts to USC on Tuesday, delaying his arrival
at least another day.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Craig Mitchell, who is awaiting a pair of junior
college transcripts, is not expected before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Recruit watch: Among the visitors at Tuesday's practice was
Mayfair High tailback Michael Williams, who is also being recruited
by Michigan, Arizona State, Notre Dame and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing double: USC's two Westlake High players, DeMars and tight
end Joe Boskovich, are wearing No. 91.
</P>
<P>
   Boskovich, a freshman walk-on, was assigned the number, which
DeMars has worn the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you go to Westlake, you have to wear 91 around
here,'' DeMars said.

   NEW YORK _ Currency problems and a bank scandal in Indonesia. A
political and economic mess in Russia. Military tensions in China.
Dwindling interest in Latin American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The world's emerging markets are showing some small signs of
stress. After soaring a collective 40 percent in the first half of
the year, their stock markets have fallen 7 percent more recently,
leaving investors to wonder whether the rally is over.
</P>
<P>
   One other gauge also gives pause.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds that invest in emerging markets now have the lowest
levels of cash on hand in the three years that records for these
funds have been kept. At the end of June _ the most recent reading
_ the funds had cash equal to just 3.9 percent of their assets, or
less than $700 million, according to the Investment Company
Institute, the fund trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Cash was probably further depleted as investors pulled about 2
percent of assets out of emerging markets funds in the four weeks
ended last Wednesday, according to AMG Data Services, a fund
tracking company in Arcata, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The redemptions suggest that fund managers have little money
left to invest in stocks and to fuel a rally in emerging markets,
and that they may even have felt pressure in recent weeks to sell
stocks to meet investor redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of cash ``by itself is disturbing to me,'' said Henry
Kaufman, the former Salomon Brothers chief economist who is now
president of Henry Kaufman &AMP; Co., an economic forecaster in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   For many years mutual fund cash levels were considered an
important contrary indicator of market performance, playing off the
historic inability of portfolio managers to time the market. When
cash levels were low _ meaning fund managers had put all their
investors' money into stocks _ poor market performance often
followed. Conversely, high levels of cash often signaled a market
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   But many fund managers today are loath to go heavily into cash,
no matter their instincts. Even acclaimed managers like the former
Fidelity Magellan skipper Jeffrey N. Vinik and Foster S. Friess of
the Brandywine Fund were harshly criticized for moving their funds
into cash and missing out on strong gains in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   So, although cash levels remain important to managers, they have
become less useful as market indicators. The United States stock
market has risen even as cash has remained low at stock funds for
three years running. The Investment Company Institute says cash
levels at the average equity fund have ranged from 3.9 percent to
12.9 percent the last 30 years and now stand at about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But cash levels in emerging-markets funds have swung wildly
while their domestic counterparts have held steady. Lately, those
sharp moves have tended to move inversely with the performance of
the Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging-markets index.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, for example, cash in emerging-markets funds
plunged to 5 percent, and the Morgan Stanley index subsequently
fell by 25 percent in four months. In January 1998, cash increased
to 11.5 percent, and the index rose by 15 percent. A few months
later, in April, the index turned down again, though this time cash
was at about 8 percent. But cash peaked at 14.3 percent of assets
at the end of last August, right at the beginning of a major rally
in the emerging stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Cash levels of funds within certain categories, like
emerging-markets or small-cap funds, are still a valuable contrary
indicator, Kaufman said, even if overall industry measures have
proved less useful.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he sees reasons other than plunging amounts of cash to
be concerned about emerging markets. Given indications of
improvement in the economies of Japan and other developed nations,
these countries may begin to ``reassert their demand for credit at
a time when United States monetary policy may be tightening,''
Kaufman said, referring to concerns that the Federal Reserve will
again raise interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not bode well for emerging countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the cash situation does not bother Arjun Divecha, who
manages $1.3 billion in three Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo &AMP; Co.
emerging-markets funds, including two of the best performers in the
category for the last year. ``Those kinds of things are important
in the short term, perhaps, but they have no bearing looking out
five years,'' Divecha said. He added that emerging markets had been
driven higher this year because of investments by locals _ not
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Long term, Divecha said, emerging markets, particularly in Asia,
should do well as the national economies improve and as more
companies revamp and adopt shareholder-friendly policies. In the
near future, however, the emerging markets will more likely track
the domestic stock market. ``If the U.S. market continues to pull
back,'' he said, ``they will be affected.''

OFFICER UNLIKELY TO GET CONVICTION VOIDED AS WRONGFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the former police officer who pleaded guilty to
torturing Abner Louima contends that another officer was wrongly
convicted of aiding in the assault, legal experts say that the
second officer would have a very difficult time trying to have his
conviction overturned, regardless of his guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Volpe, who admitted to shoving a stick into Louima's
rectum in the bathroom of a Brooklyn police station two years ago,
has told federal authorities that the second officer who was in the
bathroom was not Charles Schwarz, the man convicted of aiding him,
but another officer, Thomas Wiese. Wiese was not charged in the
bathroom attack, but was acquitted of related charges in the Louima
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a conviction overturned on the kinds of arguments
available to Schwarz is extremely difficult,'' said Vivian Berger,
a law professor at Columbia University who is a former prosecutor.
``Now, this particular set of circumstances is very, very unusual,
but still, it's a hard row to hoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that, based on Volpe's account, prosecutors could
probably charge Wiese again, raising the bizarre prospect that he
and Schwarz could serve time in prison, simultaneously, for an act
only one of them committed. The federal prosecutors who handled the
case have not signaled whether they would try to prosecute Wiese
again.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's statements, made public this week by his lawyer, Marvyn
Kornberg, have deepened the mystery surrounding one of the most
notorious crimes in recent New York history: Who was the second man
in the bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house, and what did he
do? The prosecutors say they have their answer, but the questions
may never be answered to the satisfaction of either the public or
the police.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday, Schwarz's wife, Andra, and officials of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association held a news conference to plead for his
conviction to be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was arrested after a fight
outside a bar, suffered a torn bladder and rectum in the bathroom
attack and was hospitalized for two months. He said that an officer
held him down in the bathroom while Volpe assaulted him with the
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Louima did not directly identify Schwarz, but said that the
officer who held him down during Volpe's attack in the bathroom was
the same officer who had driven him to the station house. Police
records show that Schwarz was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asserted that that man was Schwarz, relying in part
on the testimony of other officers who said they saw Schwarz
leading Louima, handcuffed, his pants around his ankles, into the
bathroom. On June 8, a federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Schwarz
of violating Louima's civil rights _ he faces a sentence of up to
life in prison _ and acquitted Wiese and two other officers of
related charges.
</P>
<P>
   But during the trial, as Volpe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate
a plea deal, he told prosecutors that they had the wrong second
man, a claim repeated publicly by Kornberg.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg began the case by asserting that Volpe was innocent,
and suggesting that Louima's injuries could have resulted from
consensual anal sex with another man _ a suggestion that he never
returned to with any evidence. Then, on May 25, as the trial was
under way, Volpe pleaded guilty, admitting that he had done what
the prosecution charged. He said a second officer was in the
bathroom but did not take part in the attack, but he did not name
that officer, and his lawyer repeated the claim several times to
reporters while the trial of the other officers was still under
way.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Kornberg said his client had told federal prosecutors
that the second officer was Wiese, not Schwarz, and reiterated that
Wiese had merely watched the assault and done nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors have never accepted anything that
Kornberg or Volpe had to say, noting the lawyer's original theory
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury verdict, Schwarz petitioned Judge Eugene
Nickerson for a new trial on the basis that the prosecution had not
divulged Volpe's statement that Schwarz was not in the bathroom
with him. But the judge rejected the motion on the basis that those
statements were known during the trial to the other defendants, and
that they were free to call Volpe as a witness, but chose not to.
Legal scholars say that ruling was correct.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for someone who is convicted to ask for a new
trial based on new evidence, but several lawyers said that Volpe's
latest statements did not differ enough from what his lawyer was
saying at trial to constitute new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz has fired his trial lawyer, Stephen Worth, and hired a
new one, Ronald Fischetti. Experts say Schwarz is probably
preparing for an appeal on the basis that he received ``ineffective
assistance of counsel'' _ bad lawyering _ at trial. The argument
would most likely be that Schwarz's only hope was to call Volpe as
a witness, and that he failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court has held that to have a conviction thrown
out for poor legal representation, a defendant must make two
difficult showings: first, that the lawyer's performance was not
reasonably competent, and second, that a different approach could
have yielded a different verdict. Experts say Schwarz might pass
the second test _ arguing that calling Volpe could have changed the
outcome of the case _ but that he would probably fail the first.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``On the face of it, what Schwarz's lawyer did wasn't crazy,''
Ms. Berger said. ``He took a reasonable gamble. I mean, you don't
want to use as the basis of your defense someone who has admitted
to as disgusting a crime as you can imagine. So it's going to be a
very, very hard sell to say that the lawyer was ineffective. It was
a reasonable judgment call.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, however, questioned the strategy of Worth's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most lawyers I know questioned the judgment of Schwarz's
lawyer in not calling Volpe,'' said Chester L. Mirsky, a professor
of clinical law at New York University, and director of the
school's Federal Defender Clinic, who closely followed the case.
``Of course, I'm not there in the courtroom, but I said to myself,
`I think this is an error on the part of the lawyer.' Volpe could
have exonerated Schwarz, and that would have been Schwarz's best
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Worth made the wrong decision, he said, Schwarz
probably does not have a legal claim of ineffective counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg has said that Worth, as the lawyer for the PBA, had a
conflict of interest in representing Schwarz at trial. That
argument, too, could be used to petition for a new trial, but
experts said it would almost certainly fail, either because no
conflict could be shown, or because Schwarz was aware of any
potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to overturn the conviction would raise the question
of Volpe's motivations in saying that Wiese, not Schwarz, was
present during the bathroom assault. Schwarz's defenders say Volpe
is simply coming clean; prosecutors and Wiese might argue that he
only wanted to help a fellow officer in trouble, Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers say that there is legitimate reason to have doubts
about Volpe's word, and that prosecutors have no obligation to aid
Schwarz, particularly if those doubts are genuine. Prosecutors are
renowned for being unwilling to reopen convictions, and the courts
have generally stood by them.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has so far dismissed Volpe's statements, but
experts say those statements could conceivably be used to charge
Wiese as the second man in the bathroom attack.

HOPING FOR REPEAT SUCCESS, AUTOMAKERS BUILD A HYBRID
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pickup trucks are popular and automakers cannot
build sport utility vehicles fast enough, so three automakers have
separately come to the same conclusion: It is time to start
building sport utility pickups.
</P>
<P>
   At an annual convention here to show dealers the offerings for
the new model year, the Ford Motor Co. introduced the Explorer
Sport Trac, to go on sale in January. Like similar vehicles planned
for next year by the General Motors Corp. and the Nissan Motor Co.,
the Sport Trac has the passenger compartment of a four-door sport
utility vehicle but also has a short, open truck bed in back.
</P>
<P>
   New classes of automobiles come along rarely, and it is a
particularly unusual example of parallel automotive evolution for
three companies to try to create the same market at the same time.
The coming proliferation of sport utility pickups is a sign that
the light truck market is starting to resemble the car market, in
which automakers are forced to bear the cost of designing dozens of
vehicles of various shapes and sizes to compete in ever-smaller
market niches.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph C. Collins Jr., Ford's brand manager for sport utility
vehicles and minivans, said that 21 new sport utility vehicle
models would be reaching the market in the next year and a half, so
Ford had to come up with new designs like the Sport Trac to
distinguish itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a plethora of SUV's in the marketplace,
and that's a problem and a challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dealers here were enthusiastic about the new vehicle,
saying it would appeal to people who perceived pickup trucks as too
plain but still wanted to be able to carry big objects like chairs
or camping equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can name 10 customers off the top of my head who are willing
to buy this truck,'' said Laura Martin, a Ford dealer from Bremen,
Ind., who attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But auto analysts say that sport utility pickups are not
different enough from sport utility vehicles and pickups to prompt
Americans to flock to dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't going to expand the market the way the Explorer did''
when Ford introduced it in 1990, said James Hall, the president of
industry analysis at Auto Pacific Inc., a market research firm
based in Santa Ana, Calif. ``It'll parasite sales from compact
pickups and sport utilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles have become the lifeblood of the auto
industry in recent years, with profits of $5,000 to $15,000 each,
because they can be built cheaply like pickups but are in such
demand that they can be sold with big markups.
</P>
<P>
   As more models crowd the market, these margins are starting to
fall but remain far higher than for any other types of automobiles.
The auto industry hopes that it can charge the same markups on
sport utility pickups as on sport utility vehicles, in which case
profit margins would actually improve for customers who switch to
the new vehicles from pickups.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility pickups, like normal pickups and sport utility
vehicles, will be regulated as light trucks, so they will be
subject to more lenient fuel economy, pollution, safety and tax
rules than cars. As is the case for many sport utility vehicles,
Ford decided to produce the vehicle in 1996, before criticism of
sport utility vehicles over safety and pollution concerns began to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Because most sport utility vehicles are essentially pickup
trucks with fancy interiors and more sporty exteriors, the new
sport utility pickups are not as expensive to design as new
vehicles would be. The Sport Trac, for example, combines two Ford
vehicles that already share a common underbody: the Explorer sport
utility vehicle and the Ranger pickup.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac will be the first high-volume sport utility
pickup on the market. Nissan has been working on a similarly sized
sport utility pickup that will combine two of its vehicles that
also have a common underbody, the Xterra sport utility vehicle and
the Frontier pickup. According to industry consultants, GM's
Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac units are working on combinations of a
Suburban sport utility vehicle and a Silverado pickup. GM refuses
to discuss the vehicles yet for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first sport utility pickup to reach the market will be yet
another Ford Motor product, the Lincoln Blackwood, a combination of
a Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle and an F-150 pickup. The
Blackwood, which will come with a wood-lined bed and is expected to
sell for $40,000 or more, is scheduled to go on sale later this
autumn but is purely a niche vehicle, with Ford only planning to
build a few thousand each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac has more rear seat room than a Ranger, but only a
four and a half foot bed, not the Ranger's six-foot bed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac is likely to cost close to $23,000, although no
price has been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will market the Sport Trac to men and women in their 30s
with outdoor lifestyles, said Jan Klug, Ford's marketing and
advertising manager for Ford brand cars and light trucks, people
who, ``want to be able to throw all the stinky stuff in the back
and have the people in the front.''

OFFENSE LENDS SECONDARY A HELPING HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From trick plays to unusual motivational ploys,
Bruins coach Bob Toledo has never lacked for creativity. But his
plan to fortify UCLA's depleted secondary may be difficult to top.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Toledo using his best offensive players _ tailback
DeShaun Foster and receivers Danny Farmer and Freddie Mitchell _ on
defense, but quarterback Drew Bennett has taken a few snaps at
safety, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would actually use his starting quarterback on
defense, Toledo didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not? I'm using the other guys,'' he said. ``With our depth
problems, there's a real good chance they'll play in passing
situations (when the Bruins use five or six defensive backs). It
might happen four or five times a game.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes each practice, Foster, Farmer, Mitchell and
Bennett don yellow jerseys and shuffle to the secondary. They seem
to know what they're doing, too. Foster played safety in high
school and Mitchell played cornerback. Farmer is a fabulous
volleyball player, and Bennett, with a 38-inch vertical jump, may
be UCLA's best athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' Mitchell said. ``The first couple days,
the defense was a little wary, like, `Can these guys do it?' But
then they saw us breaking up plays, and they were cheering us on.
We just had to win their trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Early impressions:
</P>
<P>
   _For decisions and accuracy, redshirt freshman Cory Paus has
been the most consistent quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   _The best freshmen: cornerback Ricky Manning Jr., tight end Mike
Seidma}in, and linebackers Marcus Reese and Asi Faoa. Watch for
them to play immediately. Four redshirt freshmen who look good:
cornerback Joe Hunter, defensive end Rusty Williams, guard Mike
Saffer and left tackle Blake Worley.
</P>
<P>
   _The defensive line is UCLA's most improved unit, and one of its
deepest. The second team, with Travor Turner, Anthony Fletcher,
Steve Morgan and Sean Phillips, averages 275 pounds. Gone are the
days of Jeff Ruckman and Weldon Forde manning the line at 240
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _Tight end Gabe Crecion, a Northridge native, clearly benefited
from his redshirt year. He's stronger and tougher and hasn't lost
his great hands. Tight end Chris Jackson has switched positions.
He's now a linebacker, just like his dad, Michael, the former
Seattle Seahawk.
</P>
<P>
   _Joey Strycula, who holds on place kicks, probably will start at
safety until Ryan Roques returns from suspension.
</P>
<P>
   _Hart High grad Jerry Owens has impressed at receiver, but given
UCLA's depth, he'll probably redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   This and that: If the season opened today, Foster would start at
tailback over Jermaine Lewis.... For all the questions and concerns
on defense, Toledo's biggest worry is the offensive line. Until
Oscar Cabrera and Jim Ghezzi return from suspension, the Bruins are
an injury away from playing a freshman.... Spaulding Field
spectators describe the punting situation with one word: Incoming.

PADDY DEVLIN, 74, OF BELFAST, MODERATE CATHOLIC POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paddy Devlin, who was active in the founding of Northern
Ireland's moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, its most
popular Catholic party, died on Sunday. He was 74 and a resident of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   He died after a lengthy hospitalization, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin, whose full name was Patrick Joseph Devlin, was a big,
shaggy man, a trade unionist and a Socialist, and he came to be an
an energetic foe of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a flour-mill worker, he was born and grew up in
Belfast and quit school at the age of 14. He became an operative in
the Irish Republican Army, and was interned by the British from
1942 to 1945, a period during which he became an opponent of
sectarianism.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II he quit the IRA and also became a flour-mill
worker, and a union organizer. He was an active member of the
Northern Ireland Labor Party, a Belfast city councillor and a
member of Northern Ireland's parliament for a time, beginning in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 the Social Democratic and Labor Party was founded, and
Devlin strove to give it roots in Belfast. The party has always
received the largest number of votes from the Catholic minority in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He also became minister for health in what had been Northern
Ireland's only joint Protestant-Catholic government, which was

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The former head of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico said Tuesday that American
scientist Wen Ho Lee, the suspect in the Chinese atomic spy case,
was unfairly singled out for federal investigation because of his
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a key factor,'' Robert Vrooman, who himself is to be
disciplined for his handling of the case, said in an interview.
``There were 83 people who went to China'' from the New Mexican
weapons lab in the 1980s, any one of whom might have leaked
secrets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Caucasians'' were not investigated, Vrooman said,
even though they had access to weapon secrets. ``And they made
contact with the same people that Lee was in contact with,'' added
Vrooman, who investigated the case for nearly three years and is
still a consultant to the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Though intelligence experts eventually discovered that Lee had
downloaded secret weapons-related computer codes onto an unsecure
computer, Vrooman said Tuesday that Lee's ethnic background ``was a
major factor'' in initially making him the key suspect. Lee has not
been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who says he is innocence of the spy charges, is a
Taiwan-born scientist who worked at Los Alamos for more than two
decades before being fired in March for violating security rules.
Investigators then discovered that he had transferred vast amounts
of secret nuclear data from Los Alamos' classified computer system
to an open network. The data included the legacy codes,
mathematical approximations of nuclear weapons designs.
</P>
<P>
   Counterintelligence experts say racial focusing is not uncommon
in spy investigations because foreign intelligence services often
target people who may have sympathies with foreign states.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman is apparently the first investigator in the case to
raise the issue of racial bias publicly, though some
Chinese-American rights groups had done so previously. Vrooman's
remarks were first reported Tuesday in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and managers at Los Alamos have
denied that Lee's Asian ancestry sparked suspicions that he was
involved in possible espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Richardson called for Vrooman and two other Los
Alamos officials to be disciplined for failing to handle the lab's
spy probe properly. Vrooman was not named in the Energy
Department's news release, but officials disclosed his name to
reporters. Vrooman was criticized specifically for allowing Lee
continued access to nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos officials said Tuesday that a decision on any
disciplinary action would probably not be made for weeks.
Richardson has recommended terminating Vrooman's contract as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Vrooman strongly defended his actions,
accused the department of playing politics and said the nation's
nuclear weapons labs had been unfairly made targets. Though China
has obtained secret weapons information, he said, it is more likely
it came from the military or defense contractors than from weapons
labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not design information,'' he said of the lost secrets.
``It was engineering data. If you were a Las Vegas oddsmaker, you'd
put your money on DOD,'' the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal investigators had found that secret data on the
warhead at the center of the investigation, the W-88, the most
modern in the American arsenal, had been made widely available
throughout the federal bureaucracy to hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rather detailed description of the W-88 had a distribution
of 548 copies,'' he said, most to the Defense Department, the
military services, the National Guard, federal agencies and such
contractors as the Lockheed Missile and Space Corp. ``Please note
that I am referring to 548 mailing addresses, not people.''
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman's criticisms that the investigation prematurely focused
on Lee echo the more general findings of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, which earlier this month made public a report on
the China espionage probe. It said federal investigators erred
early on when they focused on Lee without having adequately
reviewed other possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The spy scandal erupted in March when the House select committee
on Chinese espionage, led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., neared
completion of a report saying China stole secrets about seven of
America's most advanced warheads. Lee was not named in the report
when it was publicly released in May, but his identity had emerged
months before then. All along, he has maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' earlier this month, Lee
said he was a victim of ethnic bias and that he had downloaded
secret files in order to protect them, a practice he said was
common at Los Alamos. He denied giving the material to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Los Alamos director John Browne and
other lab managers strongly disagreed with Lee's explanations about
why he violated security rules by transferring millions of lines of
classified computer code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that anyone has ever done anything like
this before at Los Alamos,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, a former case officer at the CIA, said Tuesday in
interviews and a two-page statement that federal investigators had
``not one shred of evidence'' that linked Lee to Chinese espionage.
He said he scrutinized the case for nearly three years, from June
1995 until he retired from Los Alamos in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman said the Energy Department's Office of
Counterintelligence had identified Lee as ``the prime suspect based
on, at best, cursory investigation at only two facilities.'' They
were Los Alamos, the birthplace of the bomb, and the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, the nation's other
main center for the design of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation lacked intellectual rigor,'' he said. ``They
missed a lot of people. It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last week in recommending the disciplinary action against
Vrooman, the Energy Department pointed to Lee's continued access to
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's inspector general reported to Richardson
last week that in 1997 the Albuquerque field office of the FBI told
Vrooman that there was no longer any investigative reason to keep
Lee in his position with access to classified information. Vrooman
did not take any action to move Lee and did not tell the managers
at Los Alamos about the FBI's finding, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Vrooman said his decision to continue Lee's access
had been made in concert with officials of the FBI and the Energy
Department's chief intelligence officer, Notra Trulock. Trulock,
who first raised the alarm about China's theft of nuclear secrets,
did not return calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to note that Executive order 12333 specifies
that the FBI has responsibility for counterintelligence
investigations within the United States,'' Vrooman said in his
statement. The internal security office at Los Alamos, he added,
``can only provide support to the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman said he had followed the Energy Department's
counterintelligence code of ethics to try to protect Lee's identity
but other Energy officials had not, ``as evidenced by the trial and
conviction by rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman added that he had been made the target for disciplinary
action because he opposed the Energy Department's view that the
Chinese espionage had occurred in its warrens rather than
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials have ``put constraints on us that are going to
destroy'' the Los Alamos lab, Vrooman said. ``This is a national
treasure. I don't want to see it destroyed based on false
allegations.''

OUTPUT RISES IN BRAZIL BUT ANXIETY LINGERS AND MARKETS SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil's economy showed fresh signs of
recuperation Tuesday in a government report indicating that the
broadest measure of economic activity expanded for the second
consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of
0.93 percent in the second quarter. In the first three months of
1999, the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report showed that output growth weakened compared
with the corresponding period a year earlier, Tuesday's figures
still reflected a gradual recovery from a recession caused in part
by an outflow of investments from many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial companies _ like Embraer S.A., a leading manufacturer
of small passenger jets _ led the recovery with growth of 2
percent, according to Brazil's statistics agency. A plunge early
this year in the value of the Brazilian currency has benefited big
exporters like Embraer by making their products more affordable and
competitive in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry showed a lot of muscle in the second quarter, making
it apparent this isn't a recuperation based on fluctuating
agricultural fortunes,'' said Masaru Nakayasu, the chief economist
here with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while companies like Embraer are doing well, many other
Brazilian businesses are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing real growth, but you have to put it into
perspective,'' said Marcelo Allain, chief economist at Banco
Inter-American Express. ``The economy is emerging from a very weak
period in the second half of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many signs of continued economic distress. For
instance, companies seeking to secure financing in international
markets, where interest rates have been lower than in Brazil, are
facing the worst borrowing conditions in five years. According to
the Brazilian Association of Investment Banks, international
borrowing by Brazilian companies fell to $6.4 billion in the first
half of this year from $17.1 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from some minor exceptions, I don't see strong demand
for primary issues out of Brazil and the rest of Latin America,''
Carlos Novis Guimaraes, head of Latin American investment banking
at Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The country's financial markets are reflecting a general feeling
of anxiety over the course of the economy, Latin America's largest.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian currency, the real, has come under renewed
pressure, weakening 4 percent so far this month. And the benchmark
Bovespa stock index has declined 13 percent in the last month. On
Tuesday, the index fell 1.92 percent, as the gross domestic product
figures were overshadowed by concern that political infighting in
the capital, Brasilia, could delay congressional approval of budget
cuts.

 &HT;    Johnson returns to golfing world after tragedy
 &HT;    By Bucky Albers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Five weeks removed from a tragedy that took the
life of her troubled husband, Chris Johnson was back in the midst
of her golfing friends Tuesday at a place where she could reflect
on happier days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who hasn't played in an LPGA Tour event since July 11,
was at Country Club of the North preparing for the Firstar LPGA
Classic _ a tournament she won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good (to be back),'' Johnson said. ``You know your
friends are out here. You know what to expect out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been in seclusion since May 15 when Bill K.
Shearman, her husband since 1990, murdered a former neighbor in
Willcox, Ariz., and then shot himself to death after being cornered
by police following a 60-mile chase at speeds up to 120 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was estranged from Shearman, was in New York
working with her golf advisers when Shearman, a horse trader and
former rodeo bronc rider, allegedly filled his pickup truck with
guns and ammunition and drove to the home of attorney John R. Evans
where he killed Evans and shot Evans' wife, Shelley, in the hip.
</P>
<P>
   During the chase that followed, Shearman shot at and wounded a
motorist who was merging into traffic. Agents in pursuit used
spikes on the road three times before Shearman crashed into a guard
rail and took his own life before he could be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a private person even during the good times, politely
declined to answer any questions about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she has been doing for the last month, she said,
``I've been taking care of business.'' She left the impression that
she hadn't played golf until last week when she began practicing in
earnest for her return to competition.
</P>
<P>
   She is, no doubt, hoping that golf will occupy her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a lot of people do when they're dealing with
stuff,'' she said. ``They just throw themselves into their work. I
always look forward to getting back out. It's nice to like your
job. A lot of people don't just don't like their job. I like my
work. I've got a nice office.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 41, said she decided to play the next three weeks
because she knows the tournaments well and two of the three are
54-holes instead of 72.
</P>
<P>
   She has fond memories of 1995 when she shot 67 in the final
round at CCN and came from six strokes back to win. They were
rekindled as she played nine holes Monday evening and nine more
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the good shots I hit,'' she said. ``I want to
remember those. As I play my practice round, I remember a lot of
those good shots. They're kind of in a catalogue for me.''

 &HT;    Cowboys' Sanders, Smith, Williams out with injuries
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Chan Gailey looked at his dwindling list
of healthy cornerbacks, wondering how his Dallas Cowboys will line
up on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good scenario,'' the second-year coach said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey already has accepted the notion of playing at least two
regular-season games without the NFL's best cover corner, Deion
Sanders. Add to the injured list Kevin Smith and Charlie Williams,
a pair of veterans the Cowboys are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Charlie out and Kevin Smith out and Deion out, it creates
a tough-looking scenario right now,'' Gailey said. ``We're supposed
to get Charlie back , we're supposed to get Kevin back and Deion is
going to get back sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner than later?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey would not elaborate on the condition of his All-Pro
cornerback, but Sanders' right big toe has been one of training
camp's greatest mysteries. Team owner Jerry Jones recently said
Sanders will miss two games in September, but some wonder whether
the defensive star will return in time for the Sept. 12 opener
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has been in Wichita Falls for most of camp, running and
playing basketball, hoping to strengthen the toe. With 25 days
remaining before the season starts, there is still time for some of
the walking wounded to return.
</P>
<P>
   Yet injuries have had such a major impact in training camp that
Gailey has been forced to cut practices short almost daily. The
Cowboys are down to two players at some positions, meaning they get
worn out quickly in the 100-degree heat. More than 20 players who
started camp July 25 were not in uniform in Sunday's 10-3 loss to
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, trainer Jim Maurer said running back Chris Warren
missed practice to see a specialist in Colorado. Warren has had
hamstring trouble, Maurer said, and Tuesday's visit was viewed as
precautionary.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cornerbacks, Williams has been sidelined by a broken
arm, but returned for non-contact drills. Smith has been bothered
by a bad back and was given an injection last week for back pain.
Neither will play in Saturday's preseason game at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey does not worry much about Smith, saying, ``I already know
what he can do.'' But Gailey does not know the extent of Smith's
injury and cannot guarantee the former Texas A&AMP;M cornerback will be
ready for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerback slot is in such disarray that Gailey was asked
whether the Cowboys will bring in a veteran to fill the void. ``Not
today. I'm not saying that's out of the question. We're always
keeping our eyes open, but we're not going to pull the trigger
today or tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   If the season started today, the starting cornerbacks would be
third-year pro Kevin Mathis and Duan Hawthorne, a rookie from
Northern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Another pressing problem is the condition of running back Beau
Morgan, who has a broken second toe. Morgan was given a good shot
to make the 53-man roster, but he might not make it if he doesn't
return before the exhibition season is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' loss to Oakland was their second straight defeat of
the exhibition season. That hardly bothers this team. In their last
43 preseason games, the Cowboys are 13-29-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that preseason games are preseason games,''
Gailey said. ``We have to let guys play and make mistakes. We don't
know where they are until we let them play. They either play well
or play poorly. That's all part of (the evaluation process).''
</P>
<P>
   On a brighter note, Gailey said defensive tackle Brandon Noble
continues to play well. The former NFL Europe player has improved
his chances of making the team with his performance in preseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will practice at 8:45 a.m. today at Midwestern State
and at 8 p.m. at the Wichita Falls High School stadium.

EMPLOYEE'S LAWSUIT ACCUSES MORGAN STANLEY OF RACIAL BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ga.)   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An employee on extended leave from Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter has sued the firm, accusing it of racial
discrimination, adding to its legal burden as it juggles two other
high-profile discrimination cases.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Damon Harvey of Brentwood, Tenn., a black financial analyst
on disability leave, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan on Tuesday. He contends that his superiors in Morgan
Stanley's real estate finance division assigned him more ``grunt
work'' than they assigned white people with similar jobs. He also
contends that superiors used the term ``boy'' when referring to
black employees.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey contends that race-oriented abuse caused him to have a
nervous breakdown. He was placed on paid disability leave in May
1998 and has never returned to the firm. He seeks $80 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are similar to some made against the firm in May
by Christian Curry, another former Morgan Stanley analyst. In fact,
the two have similar stories. They began their working lives as
junior analysts in real estate finance in the summer of 1997 after
graduating from college. Their desks were next to each other. And,
in less than a year, both had left the firm. They are represented
by the same lawyer, Benedict Morelli of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's suit against Morgan Stanley also involved allegations of
false arrest. Morgan Stanley paid $10,000 to an informant who was
instrumental in the arrest of Curry a year ago, when police said
they caught him conspiring to plant fake racist e-mail messages on
Morgan Stanley's computers to bolster a planned lawsuit. That
payment prompted an investigation into Morgan Stanley by the
Manhattan district attorney. The investigation was recently dropped
without charges being filed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney earlier dropped charges of computer
trespassing against Curry.
</P>
<P>
   A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment on Harvey's
lawsuit Tuesday, saying that the firm had not yet seen it. The firm
has said previously that Curry's lawsuit is without merit and has
vowed to contest it in court.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took Morgan Stanley
to court in July to force it to release data on its employment
practices for senior female employees. The action stemmed from a
complaint filed with the commission by a Allison Schieffelin, a
principal in the firm's equity division who contends that she was
passed over for managing director because of her sex. Ms.
Schieffelin has not sued Morgan Stanley, but the complaint was a
necessary first step to filing such a lawsuit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Harvey, who graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta, said he
was among several analysts Morgan Stanley recruited from black
colleges to diversify its work force. But the lawsuit says that he
received regular verbal abuse that he attributed to his race.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that supervisors called him ``lazy'' and ``a
slacker'' when he took breaks. He also contends that a supervisor
once asked whether he planned to order fried chicken for dinner.
Once, when a superior was looking for Curry, he asked of Harvey,
``Where's your boy?'' the lawsuit says.

 &HT;    Slump for Applied Materials comes to end
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Applied Materials Inc., the world's largest
maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, reported record
sales and earnings Tuesday, signaling its complete recovery from a
3-year-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported sales of $1.43 billion in the third quarter
ended Aug. 1, up 62 percent from a year ago. Net income for the
Santa Clara, Calif.-based company was $244.4 million, or 61 cents a
share, compared with $47.5 million, or 13 cents a share, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were well above analysts' consensus forecast of 53
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Applied employs 3,200 workers in Austin, where 90 percent of its
products are made. It was just a year ago when the company laid off
2,000 workers _ including 600 in Austin. Today, it has 200 job
openings locally.
</P>
<P>
   Applied's stock closed up $1.25 a share at $71.75 in Nasdaq
trading, but the stock fell in trading after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   New orders for the quarter reached a record $1.46 billion, up 5
percent from the second quarter and up 140 percent from last year.
The order backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.34 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gross margin widened to 48.7 percent from 46.3 percent in the
second quarter and from 44.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. Gross
margin is the percentage of sales remaining after the costs of
production are subtracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely pleased,'' Applied Chief Executive James
Morgan said in a statement. ``Our customers are experiencing the
early stages of a broad-based recovery, fueled by low inventories
and strong demand across all product categories, particularly in
communications and consumer electronics products.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipmakers are buying new equipment to boost production, acquire
the manufacturing tools needed for next-generation chips and fill
their research laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the turnaround in the equipment industry has
happened quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``As recently as April, some of the equipment guys were
hurting,'' said analyst Fred Zieber with Pathfinder Research in San
Jose, Calif. ``Then the orders starting coming in very fast.
Applied is increasing its dominance over the equipment business.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied increased its market share in all its product segments
and began shipping equipment for making high-speed chips with
copper interconnects. Most of Applied's production machines cost $1
million or more apiece. Applied competes against other makers of
equipment, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., Lam Research Corp. and
Novellus Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for new equipment was strongest in North America and
Taiwan, but Applied also reported strong demand from Japan and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he believes the equipment industry is in shape for a
sustained recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He expects equipment industry sales could double over five years
because:
</P>
<P>
   _New equipment is needed to make more complex chips.
</P>
<P>
   _Equipment is needed to make chips with new materials, including
copper
</P>
<P>
   _The industry is getting prepared to shift toward processing
larger silicon wafers. Those larger wafers will require new
manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Global sales of semiconductors are forecast to rise 12 percent
this year after three straight years of declines, according to the
Semiconductor Industry Association.

AD COLUMN: LOTS OF POTENTIAL, LITTLE SUCCESS FOR INTERNET
ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advertising on the Internet, like most uses of this new medium,
is still in the early stages of a long and presumably fruitful
evolution. In other words, it is long on potential but, so far,
short on success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that although the Internet has gathered a
mainstream audience, many companies have yet to figure out how to
use it effectively for advertising. As a result, they have been
reluctant to pour money into Web ads: just 1 percent of the $200
billion spent on advertising last year was spent online.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report to be released Wednesday, however, that
figure is about to rise. Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research firm, projects $11.5 billion in spending for online
advertising in 2003, compared with $2.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter projects that in four years the Internet will rank
fourth among advertising media in total ad spending, jumping ahead
of cable television, magazines and yellow pages and vying with
radio for the No. 3 spot behind broadcast television and
newspapers. The report follows similar projections made last week
by Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter report is based on projections of growth in both
overall advertising spending and the online audience. And the
company's research indicates that two crucial players in
traditional advertising _ car makers and consumer goods
manufacturers _ are finally warming up to the Internet. The report
predicts that in 2003, automotive companies will devote 13 percent
of their advertising budgets to the Internet, compared with 5
percent this year, and consumer goods makers like Procter &AMP;
Gamble &UR;  &LR; will spend 7 percent of their ad budgets on the Internet,
compared with 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter predicts that the online audience in 2003 will be 64
million U.S. households, compared with 38 million now. But
according to Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising
Bureau, an industry trade group, expectations for higher Web
spending also reflect fundamental shifts in the perception of the
Internet as an advertising medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995 and '96, advertisers were putting up sites for their
products, and looking at it as a sales channel,'' LeFurgy said.
``But that was confusing for advertisers who couldn't sell their
products online, like soft drink makers, so that was a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do consumer packaged goods companies lack the expertise
_ and in some cases, the desire _ to sell directly to consumers
over the Internet, but consumers would not be likely to go to
Coke's online store, for example, to buy soda, he said. ``These
companies couldn't figure out why they should be advertising
online,'' LeFurgy said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, however, companies have recognized the Web's
potential for brand advertising, as opposed to direct sales. So
instead of sending consumers to their own Web sites to buy goods,
companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble are spending money on branding
campaigns to build awareness. And through cooperative advertising
efforts, they can send consumers to, say, an online grocery store
where buyers can find their products alongside the products of the
other cooperating marketers, LeFurgy said.
</P>
<P>
   As more companies migrate toward brand-based advertising, they
are also looking less at the number of people who actually click on
a Web ad, LeFurgy said. He said that a user's propensity to click
on an ad is not necessarily the best way to gauge its effectiveness
in building brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing strategies must also change if companies are to
succeed online, said Patrick Keane, an analyst with Jupiter. The
tendency of many companies to view their Web initiatives as somehow
separate from their core businesses has helped perpetuate the
theory that Internet advertising does not work, Keane said. When
marketers do set aside money to advertise online, he said, ``their
online campaigns too often look different and feel different from
their off-line campaigns _ and that's just not an effective way to
manage a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Advertisers are going to realize that they have to
integrate their campaigns across all media,'' instead of merely
adding a Web site address to ``a TV ad or whatever else they're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Keane said, ``the fragmented nature of media
consumption means marketers will need to hit consumers at multiple
media points.''
</P>
<P>
   LeFurgy also noted that an abundance of new Internet businesses
rely on ad revenue. In recent months, Internet service providers
and PC makers have used advertising revenue as a means to lower
their prices, giving consumers the chance to get cheaper machines
and Internet access if they agree to look at advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Internet advertising builds momentum, spending on
other media may suffer, Jupiter predicts. Keane said the Internet's
anticipated cannibalism of other media is, in fact, taking place as
people spend more time online. Internet users spent an average of
7.1 hours a week online in 1998, according to Jupiter, which
predicts that will increase to 10.2 hours a week in 2003. ``And
they'll use other media less because there's only so much time in
the day,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been a little myopic about online advertising,
just looking at the fact that the dollars are smaller,'' he added.
``It's not about the numbers. It's about how the Internet is
reinventing advertising.''

ASYLUM WON BY GHANAIAN WOMAN WHO FEARED MUTILATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adelaide Abankwah's ordeal is over.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted her petition
for political asylum, on the ground that she feared being subjected
to genital cutting if she returned to Ghana, her homeland. She is
only the second woman granted asylum in the United States because
of genital cutting, which millions of African women undergo each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah, 29, requested asylum more than two years ago when
she arrived at Kennedy International Airport from Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she quickly found herself under arrest for trying to
enter the country with false immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
   Her appeal for asylum was denied by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. And she was detained for more than two
years at the Wackenhut Detention Center in Queens, where both her
health and her emotional state deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Her release came July 19, 10 days after the 2nd Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a decision supporting her
petition. It was the first time a federal court had supported an
asylum petition based on a fear of genital cutting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Board of Immigration Appeals had the last word on
asylum, and Ms. Abankwah's supporters said the fear that she could
be returned to her country still hung over her.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's decision, that fear is gone. Mandy Sullivan, the
campaign director for Equality Now, a feminist organization that
campaigned for Ms. Abankwah's release, said Ms. Abankwah was
speechless about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's relieved that it's all over,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ``It's
very hard for her to comprehend _ that it's all over and no one's
going to come snatch her back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah has been living in the Bronx with Victoria
Otumfuor, a Pentecostal minister who was born and raised in Ghana
and who befriended Ms. Abankwah while she was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since her release, Ms. Sullivan said, she has been visiting
doctors and volunteering at Equality Now. And she has been waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Her detention, and the denial of her asylum petition, sparked
widespread protests this spring among immigrant rights groups and
legislators from New York, including Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep.
Carolyn Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said the INS's position on Ms. Abankwah's case
demonstrated that the agency was not committed to protecting asylum
seekers who flee sex-based persecution.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Female genital cutting was outlawed in the United States in
1996. That year the INS also recognized the practice as a valid
form of persecution for immigrants seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in that case, based on the petition of another
African native, Fauziya Kassindja, who is from Togo, became part of
a series of guidelines on sex-based persecution that were issued to
immigration judges.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration judges are not required to rule that persecution
based on an applicant's sex constitutes a valid claim for asylum.
Advocates say they rarely do so without public pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service did not return a phone call requesting
comment Tuesday, and the board did not explain its reversal other
than to refer to the federal court's decision and a review of the
record.
</P>
<P>
   But for Ms. Abankwah, the most important words were there,
telling her that her asylum application was being granted and that
``exclusion proceedings are terminated.''

 &HT;    Ruling upheld in timber harvesting case
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A federal appeals court has sided with
environmentalists, upholding a 2-year-old injunction against timber
harvesting in Texas national forests.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans issued the
ruling Monday, keeping national forest logging in East Texas at a
standstill, U.S. Forest Service Public Affairs Specialist Gay
Ippolito said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten to absorb it,'' she said Tuesday after
getting word of the 31-page ruling. She said any further appellate
decision ``rests with the Department of Justice attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   The injunction stems from a 1996 lawsuit in which the Sierra
Club, Wilderness Society and Texas Committee on Natural Resources
sued the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas, challenging
their timber harvesting practices. U.S. District Judge Richard A.
Schell suspended 67 timber contracts in the Angelina, Davy
Crockett, Sabine and Sam Houston forests in August 1997, with a
$25.8 million impact to loggers.
</P>
<P>
   The forest service appealed the injunction in October 1997, and
that appeal died Monday. When asked what this week's decision
meant, Ippolito said, ``I don't know what it indicates.''
</P>
<P>
   George Russell, who is forest practices chair for the Lone Star
Sierra Club and on the TCONR board of governors, called the
decision one of his cause's few victories against ``a lawless
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeals judges obviously can see the forest service has a
blatant disregard for the law,'' Russell, of Huntsville, said.
``The forest service has been a chronic violator of the law and the
trust of the American people. It's an evil force in America.''
</P>
<P>
   He alleges the federal agency has manipulated native forests for
commercial use, harassing the public with an ``armed paramilitary
force'' along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few victories we've had,'' he said. He
claims native hardwoods are being eliminated in East Texas to make
room for rows of imported pines, which he says ``are good for one
thing alone, and that's toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of national forest timber receipts are returned to
the county where harvesting occurs, benefitting local school
districts and road budgets near the forests. In 1996, Trinity and
Houston counties received more than $1 million for national forest
timber sales. After the 1997 injunction, receipts fell in Trinity
to $90,409 and Houston to $125,168 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Logging is allowed for insect and disease control, fire
protection and ``forest health,'' Ippolito said. Fourteen of the 67
contracts were allowed to resume as part of a post-injunction
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service maintains 637,386 acres of timberlands
in a dozen East Texas counties.

LITTLE SUPPORT LEFT FOR FEDERAL CROP CONTROLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In April 1996, President Clinton signed the Republicans'
``Freedom to Farm'' bill, ending production controls on wheat,
corn, cotton, soybeans and rice. For the first time since the New
Deal, farmers were free to decide how many acres of these crops to
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The law replaced price supports with cash handouts, which were
to end after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The law also set up the Commission on 21st Century Production
Agriculture, which was to see how the new regime worked. That
commission met in Spokane, Wash., on Saturday to take testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest message was about pd-U tion controls: Nobody
championed their return. Fred FlemingXk]9er of a seed business and
a wheat farmer near Spokane, said he and other younger farmers,
``the children of the Roosevelt Democrats,'' had turned against
production controls and were glad to see them go. If they are
brought back, he said, world competition ``will blow us away.''
</P>
<P>
   This a time of distress on the farm, and there were many pleas
for the helping hand of Uncle Sam. A few asked for direct aid, but
most asked for other things: more tolerance of pesticides or an end
to the inheritance tax. Few spoke for a return to a permanently
subsidized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   One who did was Ken Maki, president of the Montana Farmers
Union. Maki, who runs cattle near Great Falls, said: ``We've got to
get at the idea that the farmer can stand on his own. Because he
can't stand on his own.'' Maki called for ``food security'' to
become a defense issue.
</P>
<P>
   The only other person to use the term ``food security'' was the
president of the Idaho Sugarbeet Growers, Steve Martineau. ``Sugar
is an essential ingredient in our nation's food supply,'' he said.
Beet sugar is also an industry that cannot stand on its own, having
to rely on a federal quota to keep out cane sugar from Cuba and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   To have such protection means to be shut out of world markets.
Nobody else at the hearing had that kind of deal, and nobody asked
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they could be globally competitive if they had a
``level playing field'' _ a term subject to some interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat farmer Linda Marler of Pullman, Wash., asked for an end to
food embargoes on Cuba and Iran, and a curbing of the Canadian
Wheat Board. Judy Rea, president of the Oregon Wheat Growers
Association, called for a zero-for-zero tariff deal and
zero-for-zero subsidy deal at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But she wanted to keep the Department of Agriculture's
export-credit guarantee program, which has moved Washington wheat
into such places as Pakistan. Phil Isaak, chairman of the
Washington Wheat Commission, also said the guarantee program is
``not a subsidy.''
</P>
<P>
   Few discussed the touchy question of whether the obvious
subsidies will really end in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hesse, a farmer and director of taxation for the
accounting firm LeMaster &AMP; Daniels, Moses Lake, argued that the
cash payments should be allowed to expire. A permanent subsidy, he
said, just gets rolled into the price of land: An extra 50 cents
per bushel would push up the price of an average wheat acre by
$500. ``The next generation to purchase the land has to pay an
inflated price, and continues to require the subsidy in order to
make the payment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that some family farmers would go under if the
subsidies end. ``I get in trouble for saying this,'' he said, ``but
there are people who need to go out of business. It gives the
neighbors the opportunity to spread their overhead on a larger
number of acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Going cold turkey sounds terribly radical, but all it does is
put wheat on the same basis as most other crops. Of the 10 top farm
commodities in Washington, only two have federal support programs:
milk and wheat. Many farmers benefit from such indirect aid as
cheap irrigation and federal crop insurance, but there are no
direct subsidies for the production of cattle, potatoes, grapes,
cherries, hay, nursery plants or Christmas trees. Nor is there a
federal program for the state's No. 1 crop, apples.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody from the apple industry attended the hearing in Spokane.
It was too far away, it was a beautiful Saturday in August, and the
apple folks haven't been into farm-bill politics.
</P>
<P>
   That may change. Apple growers are being pounded by low prices,
and are asking for aid from the 1999 farm bill.
</P>
<P>
   But not a permanent program: ``This is a stopgap, a Band-Aid,''
says aid proponent Jim Hazen, president of the Washington State
Horticultural Association. ``We do not want a permanent subsidy
program.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next century, there may not be any such programs _ at
least, not any new ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Thirty-five years ago, the National Museum of
Anthropology here was on the cutting edge of museum design and
acclaimed as a treasure trove of pre-Columbian art and cultural
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum has remained almost precisely as it was on
opening day in 1964. It has become a sort of museum of a museum,
with dark paneled walls and dim, shadowy lighting that were once
believed to enhance a sense of dignity and seriousness, and boxy,
home-aquarium-style display cases that let the art speak for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The stodginess and fading glory of the museum began to bother
Mexican authorities. And now, despite years of economic turmoil,
the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo has embarked on a
sweeping renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The project is going to cost about $13 million and is supposed
to be completed in December 2000 as Zedillo turns over power to a
new president.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the updating is overdue. But with such
basics as running water and electricity unavailable to many
Mexicans, not everyone thinks that so much money should be sunk
into a museum, even one that is internationally acclaimed and that
helps pay for itself by contributing to the country's important
tourist business.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Lopez y Rivas, a first-term congressman in the
center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution and an
anthropologist by training, practically stammers when he talks
about the project.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, he said, the museum, where he once worked, is a
great showcase of Mexico's past. But he said it was ``an insult
that you can spend that kind of money while so many of the
country's Indians are living in absolute poverty, with dirt floors
and no water.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems to be far more applause than criticism of the
make-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if we have to look at this as a trade-off,
where do you spend your money?'' said Federico Estevez, a political
science professor in Mexico City. ``In the end, a lot of people
will prefer to spend it on the museum. Maybe you need to pave roads
or build something in a small town somewhere. But the museum is
something that can be seen and enjoyed by everyone. It's a big,
gorgeous place with all this history.''
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Tibol, an author and art critic for the weekly Proceso
magazine, said the right thing was being done for the wrong reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every president,'' she said, ``increases the number of
projects like this at the end of his term. They all spend their
last year in office dedicating hospitals, factories, bridges,
museums, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tibol said the museum was built ``too fast'' so that the
outgoing president at the time, Adolfo Lopez Mateos, could dedicate
it. A result was too little administrative space, she said, and
inadequate climate control in storage areas.
</P>
<P>
   No one, she said, should be put off by the cost. ``Look at the
cost of corruption, or the cost of these political campaigns that
are going on right now,'' she said. ``That is what is really
outrageous in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenters and painters are to finish the first six galleries by
late September and three more by the end of the year, leaving 14
display areas to be completed next year. Some skeptics question
whether meeting the December 2000 deadline is possible. And they
worry that if there are delays and cost overruns, a new
administration may have other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new design for the museum transforms it from a passive,
sometimes somber viewing experience to one with exhibits that will
draw visitors along paths through sections of villages and burial
grounds, combining displays of centuries-old pottery and stone
sculpture in reproductions of the kinds of homes and temples in
which they were used.
</P>
<P>
   Touch-screen computers are being sprinkled in alcoves so as not
to distract from the antiquities but to provide instant historical
details. Bell-shaped acoustical devices will be suspended above
some of the paths so people can pause under them and listen to
long-ago regional music and voices speaking in early forms of some
of the country's more than 50 indigenous dialects. A huge panel
covered with a drawing of the Tlatelolco marketplace, where Hernan
Cortez, the Spaniard who defeated the Aztecs, reported seeing daily
crowds of up to 30,000 people, is being turned into a video screen
where three projectors will play constantly changing images.
</P>
<P>
   Relenting to longtime criticism, museum officials are going to
provide legends identifying objects not only in Spanish but in
English as well.
</P>
<P>
   Besides all the technological wonders, the museum is literally
changing the face of some of its proudest exhibits based on new
information from a surge of more than 200 archeological digs in
Mexico in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, several revisions are being made to the big
sand-table model of the ceremonial center of the Aztec capital,
Tenochtitlan, where Mexico City now stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1965, people invented a serpent wall around the whole
thing,'' said Felipe Solis Olguin, a deputy director of the museum.
``That didn't exist. In reality, there was a large platform wall
with many staircases to ground level. Some temples and the ball
court were in the wrong position. And five or six buildings had
been left out. The archeologists found evidence of how it really
looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the Christmas Day theft here in 1985, in which more
than 100 priceless gold, jade and stone artifacts were taken, still
pain museum officials. Nearly all of the pieces were later
recovered from a home in Mexico City and two men were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the government said museum guards had apparently
been sleeping off the effects of a Christmas Eve party. But Teresa
Franco, the director of the National Institute of Anthropology and
History, which runs the museum, said that it was not really a
matter of anyone having had too much to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main fault,'' she said, ``was our security system.'' Now,
she said, there are about 85 guards, nearly triple the size of the
security force in 1985. Since the theft, the museum has also fitted
alarms to display cases and installed video cameras and a central
monitoring room.

CARLOS CACHACA, 97, BRAZILIAN SONGWRITER WHO POPULARIZED SAMBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Carlos Cachaca, one of Brazil's most
prolific and beloved songwriters and a founder of the samba troupe
whose creativity made Rio de Janeiro's annual pre-Lenten Carnival
an international attraction, died here on Monday. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Cachaca, whose real name was Carlos Moreira de Castro, grew up
in a poor hillside neighborhood in Rio that is today the slum
Mangueira. His stage name, which refers to a fiery sugar cane
liquor popular among Brazil's poor, was given to him at jam
sessions with the same friends who joined him in founding the
Mangueira Samba School and Recreational Society in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe soon became renowned for the clever and propulsive
songs it sang every year during Carnival celebrations. Many of the
songs were written by Cachaca and his brother-in-law Cartola, who
died in 1980, and gained a huge popular following. Cachaca received
few royalties from his efforts, taking a job as a railway worker to
earn a living, but compositions like ``Dawn,'' the lilting waltz
``Clotilde'' he wrote for his wife and ``I Don't Want to Love
Anyone'' remain popular even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote sambas that will be eternally modern,'' Alcione, one
of the most popular of the current generation of samba singers,
said. ``I'm glad to have have had the chance to work with and learn
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, more than a score of other samba schools were
founded, each trying to emulate the style Mangueira created and to
duplicate Cachaca's sardonic lyrics. Their annual competition,
initially frowned upon by Rio's high society as a vulgar
manifestation of the country's African roots, eventually grew into
a multimillion-dollar industry and an internationally admired
expression of Brazilian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the roots and trunk of Mangueira,'' which means mango
tree in Portuguese, said Elmo Jose dos Santos, the president of the
society, which has thousands of members and millions of fans in
Brazil. ``If Mangueira is what it is today, we owe it all to him
and Cartola.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Cachaca was publicly honored for his role as an
originator of the samba and Rio's modern Carnival, parading in the
competition in a wheelchair atop a float decorated with Mangueira's
green and pink colors as thousands of onlookers applauded from box
seats. Fittingly, his group won top honors that year.
</P>
<P>
   After a wake at Mangueira's rehearsal hall, Cachaca, who was the
troupe's honorary president, was buried late Monday. He is survived
by three daughters and several hundred songs.  &QL;

SEARS' NEW SLOGAN TO EMPHASIS CORE PRODUCTS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Conn., Ill.)  (nk) 
 By WESTRAY BATTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending its ``Softer Side'' campaign, which has been running
since 1993, the Sears &AMP; Roebuck Co &UR; .  &LR; introduced a new slogan
Tuesday, ``The Good Life at a Great Price. Guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the change, Sears, the country's largest department store
chain, is signaling a renewed emphasis on its core products, an
independent analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, Burt Flickinger, managing director at Reach
Marketing, a strategic business consultancy based in Westport,
Conn., said the `Softer Side' campaign was ``one of the most
brilliant breakthroughs in the last five years of advertising''
because of the way it stimulated clothing sales at a company once
known as an appliance and tools-oriented retailer, while other
large, mid-tier retail outlets like Montgomery-Ward and JC Penney
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   But that campaign lost its steam two years ago as consumer
buying patterns changed, with consumers shifting from large retail
outlets to specialty stores, like The Gap, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, and
Target.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign, Flickinger predicted, would ``re-establish
Sears as a primary place for the family to shop for all its
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cohen, executive vice president for marketing at Sears in
Hoffman Estates, Ill., said the new tag line would attempt to
position Sears, which started the 20th Century with one of the most
successful and enduring ventures in American business _ it
introduced the Sears Catalog in 1894 _ alongside families ``in
their quest for the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The new slogan ``focuses on Sears' commitment to quality, value
and our guarantee on all of our products,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sears campaign was created by a rare collaboration of
two agencies: Oglivy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in Chicago, part of the WPP
Group P.L.C. and Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will appear the first week of September and will focus
on back-to-school time for families. Approximately 60 new ads will
be created for the broad campaign, which will include print,
television, radio, Internet and direct marketing.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, Sears plans a multi-million dollar push
later to advertise and sell its owned-brands, including Kenmore
Appliances and Craftsman Tools, online. Sears sells more than
one-third of all appliances in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sears refused to say how much the company
planned to spend on its new marketing effort, but trade magazines
have estimated last year's advertising spending at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sears will support the fall campaign with its sponsorship of the
Backstreet Boys North American Tour, a national sweepstakes and
gift-with-purchase programs at all of its 850 department stores and
2100 special retail locations.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts said the efforts could re-position Sears as a
dominant force in the retail industry.

<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Bill and Hillary, welcome to paradise.
</P>
<P>
   If they haven't already, people here will tell you there may be
no more congenial place on Earth than Westchester County. As you
know, it is plush, flush and up-to-date. It has stout houses, leafy
lanes, and decorous neighbors. It has fine restaurants and ethnic
eateries, yet when Bill's craving for junk food strikes he could
hop into a minivan _ the vehicle of choice in these parts _ and
cruise Central Avenue or Boston Post Road. They are rivers of
McDonald's and Burger Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful. The county is also a minefield.
</P>
<P>
   With most major problems taken care of _ schools are good and
crime is low _ people obsess on small things. Neighbors have
stopped talking to one another over what kind of fence separates
their properties and some have hauled each other into court over a
fallen tree; the village judges have so routine a case load that
they can spend an hour on such matters. Luckily, Hillary is beyond
the car-pooling stage. The tiffs over which mother backed out of
what driving assignment can be breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Republicans. They are everywhere, and though
the county executive is a Democrat, the Republicans still control
the levers of power in cities like Yonkers and horsey towns like
Bedford. In particular, beware the Republican district attorney,
Jeanine Pirro. She's fiercely ambitious and she's likely to be mad
at Bill, since he appointed the federal prosecutor that recently
indicted her husband on charges of tax evasion. That prosecutor
embarrassed Ms. Pirro by asserting that one improper business
deduction was for a leased Mercedes-Benz she used.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for garbage. One way or another, your garbage will be
recycled by Suburban Carting, which in 1997 pleaded guilty to
charges that linked it to organized crime. Somehow county political
leaders have been unable to shake this company, which is now
operating under the scrutiny of a federal monitor. As the nation's
former first family, you don't want headlines saying your garbage
is collected by the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Where you live is going to matter. Ghosts of scandals past haunt
many of the deceptively serene towns. You were looking in Edgemont
the other day, but that's where two schoolteachers, Carolyn Warmus
and Paul Solomon, carried on a torrid affair that ended in Ms.
Warmus being convicted of murdering Solomon's wife. Scarsdale
became famous a couple of decades ago when a celebrity diet doctor
was murdered by his lover, Jean Harris, a private school
headmistress, after she discovered that he was dating a younger
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for Mamaroneck too. That's where Kenneth Starr's wife
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill chooses to work, he can't beat Westchester. It's a
half-hour commute to Grand Central Terminal and a brisk walk from
there to a bevy of good jobs _ law firms, universities, three
television networks, any one of which would be happy to have either
of you as talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   But commuting has its rituals and some can be harder to figure
out than Slobodan Milosevic. When you arrive at a station in, say,
autumn, you will see clumps of trench-coated men and women spaced
equally apart along the platform. They are not members of a cult.
They are fastidious suburbanites who have determined precisely
where the train doors will open.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has been saying how easy it will be for Bill to play
golf, but country clubs can be tricky. While Westchester is proud
of its tolerance, most clubs, for historic reasons, are divided
along religious lines. There are Protestant clubs, Catholic clubs,
Jewish clubs. They are virtually all white, though it should be a
relief to know that private golf clubs have been recruiting blacks
so their courses will qualify for professional tours.
</P>
<P>
   If you settle in New Rochelle, you may find that the city is not
as politically correct as you think. Sure, New Rochelle is one of
Westchester's few racially mixed towns, but it is mixed in the same
way as Washington. The outlying neighborhood you're looking at is
affluent and white, just like northwest Washington. Most of New
Rochelle's black and Hispanic residents live nearer the scruffier
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But in this lotus land, even that problem may have its sunny
side. The houses in northern New Rochelle have been snapped up by
Orthodox Jewish families. That will give Hillary a great
opportunity to explore her recently revealed Jewish roots.

FORMER OREAD CEO RETURNS TO LEADERSHIP AND ANNOUNCES LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ W. David Kimbrell is back on top at Oread
Inc., and his plans to turn the company around include 200 layoffs
in Lawrence, Kan., and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Lawrence contract drug development firm
touted the fact that Kimbrell had been named a second runner-up in
the 1998 Ernst &AMP; Young National Entrepreneur of the Year program.
</P>
<P>
   That was about two weeks before Oread's board ousted Kimbrell
from his job as president, board chairman and chief executive
officer. The privately held company refused to say why Kimbrell was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrell owned 48 percent of the company's stock at the time of
his termination.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kimbrell is once again Oread's chairman and CEO, and he has
regained 100 percent voting control, replacing JP Morgan Capital
and Syntex (USA). He declined to give details about how he regained
control of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big challenge ahead of us,'' Kimbrell said in a
phone interview Tuesday. ``We have to correct a lot of mistakes, a
lot of ills of the recent past. But we have a very strong
management team and very loyal, dedicated employees. With
everyone's help, we look forward to a very bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of those employees are losing their jobs. Kimbrell said
Oread had been losing money in his absence, after earning a
``significant profit'' on $83 million of revenue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrell said Oread was laying off about 200 of its
approximately 850 employees around the country this week. In
Lawrence, where Oread has about 300 employees, the job cuts will
result in 50 to 60 lap}ULM1Zimbrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not our choice; this is something we inherited,''
Kimbrell said. ``This trimming of expenses should have been done a
long time ago. Since I left, hiring went up, revenues flattened,
other expenses went up and overall spending went up. We've just got
too many people for the amount of work we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrell said that former board Chairman Daniel Azarnoff had
left the board and that a new board was being formed. Former
President Jack L. Armstrong has been terminated along with several
other managers, Kimbrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Azarnoff and Armstrong could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrell formed Oread Inc. to buy Oread Laboratories in 1994.
The company develops and manufactures drugs for major
pharmaceutical firms. Oread has drug development operations in
Lawrence; Palo Alto, Calif.; Farmington, Conn.; Fairfield, N.J.;
and Atlanta. The company's manufacturing operations are in Palo
Alto.

MARTIN WONG IS DEAD AT 53; A PAINTER OF POETIC REALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Wong, a painter whose meticulous visionary realism is
among the lasting legacies of New York's East Village art scene of
the 1980s and a precursor of the identity-driven work of the 90s,
died last Thursday at his parents' home in San Francisco. He was 53
and had lived in San Francisco since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He died of AIDS-related causes, said Barry Blinderman, a close
friend and director of Illinois State University Galleries in
Normal, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the heyday of the East Village, where the local styles tended
toward graffiti art, neo-Expressionism and late Conceptualism, Wong
carved out a territory all his own. His art was as culturally
complex as his appearance, which was usually distinguished by a Fu
Manchu mustache and a cowboy hat. And it certainly lived up to his
background, which included a degree in ceramics, a stint with a gay
performance street troupe in San Francisco and expertise in such
diverse areas as Asian painting, calligraphy and decorative arts;
American antiques; the gift shop souvenirs of San Francisco's
Chinatown, and graffiti art, which he acquired in such abundance
that in 1993 he donated 300 works to the Museum of the City of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Wong's stage-set-like depictions of the Lower East Side of
Manhattan's crumbling tenements and gated storefronts offer the
viewer enthralling fusions of the decorative and the real, the
documentary and the fantastic, the religious and the erotic. His
images are erected on remarkably clear geometries that evoke the
simple architecture of the Italian primitives or the flatness of
early Jasper Johns. But his surfaces teem with exquisite details
that hover between trompe l'oeil accuracy and folk art
obsessiveness.
</P>
<P>
   There are expanses of finely wrought rubble and brick-by-brick
walls inflected with gold and sometimes festooned with bits or
blocks of language: dialogue, poetry or graffiti. Night skies are
shot with red, as if lighted by distant fires, but can also be
dotted with gold constellations or, als in gold, words spelled out
in the manual alphabet of sign language. The fat stylized hands
Wong deployed for these messages are crunched together like
letters; they pay homage to graffiti artists' tags but also suggest
some rog5e form of Persian script. And throughout there was a sense
of romantic longing and desire that the artist sometimes made
explicit, as when he painted kissing firemen dressed in full gear.
</P>
<P>
   Wong was born in Portland, Ore., in 1946 and grew up in San
Francisco, where his parents worked for Standard Oil and the
Bechtel Corp. After earning a degree in ceramics from Humboldt
State University in Arcata, Calif., he gravitated toward the Angels
of Light, a mystically oriented gay street performance troupe in
San Francisco. At 30 he decided to become a painter and, not
wanting to return to art school, began an arduous process of
self-education.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in New York in 1978, settling into an apartment on
the Lower East Side and supporting himself with a job in the
bookstore of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He first exhibited his
work in 1981 at ABC No Rio on Rivington Street on the Lower East
Side in an exhibition organized by Colab, an artists' group known
for its impromptu ``first come, first hung'' shows, which were open
to anyone while space lasted. At the opening he met Miguel Pinero,
the poet and prize-winning playwright of ``Short Eyes'' and a
well-known figure on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years Pinero was Wong's close friend and
mentor, introducing him to the underbelly of the local art, poetry
and drug scenes and providing entree to the local Hispanic
community that figures so prominently in his paintings of the 80s.
Wong made many portraits of Pinero, based several paintings on his
prison experiences (the inspiration for ``Short Eyes'') and
incorporated poems by Pinero into several paintings, which he
considered collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Wong showed at Blinderman's Semaphore Gallery spaces in SoHo and
the East Village in 1984, 1985 and 1986 and then at the P.P.O.W.
Gallery in SoHo, where he had his last exhibition in 1998. That
show coincided with a retrospective organized by the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo and the Illinois State University
Galleries. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Bronx Museum of Art, the Syracuse University Art
Collection and the City of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Wong focused increasingly on Chinese, or
more specifically Chinese-American subject matter, fashioning a
fluid but characteristically hybrid style that drew on classical
sources, childhood memories, Hollywood movie stereotypes and his
collection of Chinatown gift shop souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   After he learned he had AIDS in 1994, he moved back to San
Francisco but continued to paint and made frequent return trips to
New York and the Lower East Side. He is survived by his parents,
Benjamin and Florence Wong Fie.  &QL;

GRAF IS THE BEST, OF COURSE; JUST DON'T ASK HER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the talk turned to her place in history, Steffi Graf, the
most dominant female tennis player of this century, usually averted
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let other people be the judge of that,'' said Graf, who
carried her lack of interest in statistics, feuds and records along
with her into her abrupt and unheralded retirement last week.
Didn't she want to be remembered as the greatest player in history?
As the only woman to win all four Grand Slam events at least four
times, and as the only player, male or female, to own the No. 1
ranking for 186 weeks consecutively and 377 weeks in total, how
could she possibly avoid it?
</P>
<P>
   One way to deflect the unwanted attention from herself was to
laud her respected rival and predecessor at the top, Martina
Navratilova, as the century's most notable player. Tuesday, Graf,
whose decadelong rivalry with Navratilova ended in a 9-9 stalemate,
did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me she is the uncontested No. 1. She has left a mark on
the sport like no one else,'' Graf told the German news agency DPA.
Needless to say, Graf never mentioned anything remotely like that
to Navratilova, who retired in 1994 with a record 167 titles, 18 of
them in Grand Slam singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of her to say that, but I don't see how you can
really come out and say point blank who's the greatest,''
Navratilova said from her home in Aspen, Colo. ``When I first
started out, I wanted to be No. 1, and then I wanted to be the
greatest of all time, but the closer I got, I realized it was a
bunch of baloney.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's true is that there is a definite group of great
players, and she's in it, and I'm in it. Chris is there, and Billie
Jean, and Margaret Court. But I can't pick between myself and
Steffi. When people call me the greatest player ever, I get
embarrassed, and when I hear them call Steffi the greatest, I say,
`Hey, wait a minute, what am I, chopped liver?'''
</P>
<P>
   Great, greater, greatest: It's a debate that Graf, who won her
22nd Grand Slam singles crown at the French Open in Paris two
months ago only to retire from tennis in Heidelberg last Friday at
30, managed to sidestep during her 17-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Greatness was not the intangible that concerned Graf. Perfection
was. But when she became convinced she wouldn't produce any more
perfect seven-round performances at the Grand Slams, she quit on
the virtual eve of the U.S. Open. It is an event she won five times
but where, to the shock of several rivals, she won't try to reach a
third straight 1999 Slam final later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always a threat at every tournament, but it'll be
different at the Grand Slams,'' said Lindsay Davenport, who
defeated Graf last month in the Wimbledon final. ``I was expecting
her to end her career at the U.S. Open. To take away such a huge
threat is kind of really bizarre. Hopefully we can sustain this
loss on the tour; it's kind of amazing to think that she's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was 6-8 in career encounters with Graf. But the fate
Graf doled out to Davenport was the rule, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the generation, Graf was a nemesis. No one could
ward off her bludgeon of a forehand with any consistency, and no
one could hit the ball hard enough, or place it strategically
enough, to thwart her footwork. The New Age power players despised
her slithering backhand slice and envied her icy composure and
racehorse physique. The generation that preceded her simply bowed
to her power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi was faster, stronger, and moved better,'' said Pavel
Slozil, who coached her when she made her initial ascent to No. 1.
``Martina Navratilova moved the game two steps forward with her
athleticism and attacking game, and then Steffi took it one step
further than that. I don't see anybody repeating what they did, and
it's a very difficult decision to choose between the two of them,
but in my eyes, Steffi was the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody worked harder every hour, every minute, every second:
she was never satisfied. The work she did in practice would have
killed someone else, but the work she did in practice was why she
was always in perfect position to hit the ball during matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Chris Evert, the player she defeated in 1986 for the
first of her 107 titles and the only player with a career winning
percentage superior to her .887, Graf lost six straight matches
before turning the tables and coming out on top, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Against Gabriela Sabatini, the contemporary originally cast as
her archrival, she was 29-11.
</P>
<P>
   Against Monica Seles, the player who displaced her at No. 1,
Graf went 10-5, the last of her victories a 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-4
semifinal comeback this year at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   And for the best of the teen-agers who followed her, and who
occasionally referred to her as over the hill, Graf had a ready
answer: Against top-ranked Martina Hingis, Graf wound up 7-2.
Graf's stirring 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 throttling of Hingis at the French
Open final this June was perhaps the most emphatic parting shot,
and statement of defiance, the game has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   It created a memory so perfect, said Graf, that she knew she'd
never play another French Open for fear of tarnishing it. Too, that
match made a lasting impression on the loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great legend: All she brought to the game is amazing,
the athleticism, the way she handled herself,'' Hingis said Tuesday
from Toronto. ``Nobody is like her; nobody ever will be like her.
But I think it's difficult to compare players from different times,
so I couldn't say if she was the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But the redoubtable King, a k a Mother Tennis, who counted 12
Slams among her 67 titles and put the machismo into women's tennis
by beating Bobby Riggs 26 years ago, had no such reservations:
``Steffi is definitely the greatest women's tennis player of all
time.''

SODA FOUNTAIN PART OF THE TRUMAN HISTORY IN INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOBBY WHITE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Harry worked there a long time ago. Sweeping
floors and serving shakes, he made three bucks a week. Jim Clinton
hired him, and Harry later said that the experience shaped his
outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping floors and serving shakes can shape a man's life?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that first job helped shape Harry S. Truman, the 33rd
president of the United States. He said it taught him the value of
a dollar and the importance of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Soda Fountain and Gifts still stands on Independence
Square. On the corner of Maple Avenue and Main Street, it still
attracts the same kind of crowd. They still come for the
hamburgers, the phosphates and the malts, the ice cream sodas and
the shakes, and the nostalgic feel of the place.
</P>
<P>
   Truman worked there in 1898 for about a year. Since then,
Clinton's has gone through some changes. It was a Crown Drugstore
for some time. It was also a shoe store and jewelry shop.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Martin converted it back to a soda shop in 1986. She ran
it for 12 years and then donated it to the Jackson County
Historical Society. Now operated by the society, Clinton's is
adorned with goods of the past and Truman's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any community where there is a president that grew up,
people are going to be interested in different aspects of his
life,'' said Debra Parsons, the society's education director.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said the store, which opened as a historic site July 13,
1998, had done well. It would have done better, she said, if not
for the cost of remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   The society spent $20,000 on the changes, including new floor
tiling and furniture. It also placed pictures of Truman, which were
taken from the society's archive, along the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's is one of three sites the society owns. The 1859 Jail,
Marshal's Home and Museum in Independence and the Wornall House in
Kansas City also are run by the society.
</P>
<P>
   The society wants Clinton's to be self-sustaining, unlike the
two museums. Officials plan to combine education and retail and
form a profitable business.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said she liked what the society had done to the old soda
fountain. She opted out of running the store, she said, because it
was labor-intensive and she began to have health problems. She said
she considered selling Clinton's but decided against it because
many who inquired had no wish to continue the soda fountain legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to Clinton's, you know what you're eating or
drinking took some work,'' she said. ``It's an art form. Something
to take pride in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's has the feel of a living history museum. Drugstore
memorabilia are the front window. Behind the counter in a display
cabinet, old bottles embossed with ``Coca-Cola'' sit side by side
with rusted tin boxes that once housed antiseptic wipes.
</P>
<P>
   At the counter where patrons lounge, the old soda shop feel is
most evident. Swiveling stools, and a back bar that extends high to
the ceiling, evoke a feel from the '50s or earlier. Shakes and
malts are served in tall and heavy glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You step into a place like this, you slow down, no
pre-packages, no Styrofoam, no drive-through. It's different in
here,'' said Jeremy Drouin, manager of the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's was opened in 1880 by Jim Clinton. Back then it sold
medicines, dry goods and shaving utensils. After a while it also
served a mean Dr Pepper malt. Drouin said some soft drinks
originally were tonics and medicines with added taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then people used to complain about the taste of medicine.
So manufacturers began to make flavored tonics.'' Drouin said.
``After a while people began to see that it was also refreshing as
a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Drfn said the medicine tonic became the phosphate, where
flavored syrup was mixed with seltzer water and a few other
ingredients. He said he usually gave these brief history lessons
whenever someone inquired.
</P>
<P>
   Many times tourists who are checking out places that Truman had
been come by and talk with Drouin and his staff. So the lessons are
always on hand.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not always the tourist who wanders into Clinton's.
Lanin Watkins of Independence and her two sons, Hunter, 3, and
Addison, 4 months, stopped by recently to get a drink and relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom used to bring me here,'' Watkins said. ``It's fun to
take the kids and show them old things.''
</P>
<P>
   It's frequent that parents or grandparents come by with
children, to show them how things used to be, Drouin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like people keep old pictures of their kids, these places
need to be kept around,'' he said. ``It's a part of America.''

KC DISTRICT STUDENTS SHOW LITTLE IMPROVEMENT ON STANDARDIZED
TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City School District students scored
poorly on two standardized tests last spring, which could damage
the district's efforts to win freedom from federal court control.
</P>
<P>
   Students scored below the national average in grades three,
five, eight and 11 in reading and math on the Iowa Tests of Basic
Skills and the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency. The tests also
showed that the score gap between white and black students remained
unchanged in some areas and grew in others, even though white
students fared worse in most cases than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, only fifth-grade reading and 11th-grade math scores
showed minimal improvement from 1998 scores. In all other grades,
students performed the same or worse than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not acceptable,'' John Murphy, chairman of the
Desegregation Monitoring Committee, said about the draft results
made available last week. ``This can't continue to be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The school board received the final results just prior to
Tuesday night's board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The test results showed that Kansas City even trailed the
average for other large-city districts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy partly blamed the poor results on the instability
surrounding the district during the past year. The district closed
several schools, scaled back its magnet program and shifted
thousands of students to different buildings. Several top-level
administrators resigned, and the school board engaged in a divisive
search for a new superintendent before deciding on Benjamin Demps
Jr.

consistency, and I'm extremely o &QC; P[Z.]Z,H:hX: ther]

ABSENCES OF SANDERS, LETT CONTINUE TO DOG COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Eight days of training camp remain for
the Cowboys and the preseason's two biggest questions remain
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still have no idea if and when suspended defensive
tackle Leon Lett and injured cornerback Deion Sanders will return
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And those concerns have only intensified in the past three weeks
at Midwestern State University as a result of a back injury to
cornerback Kevin Smith and poor play from defensive tackle Michael
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Cowboys not know if Lett and Sanders will be in
the lineup for the season opener Sept. 12 against the Washington
Redskins, but they have no idea who will start in their places.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerback situation is the most serious of the team's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Team trainer Jim Maurer said Sanders' rehabilitation from April
toe surgery is progressing as expected.
</P>
<P>
   However, what is certain, Maurer said, is that Sanders won't be
back before the end of training camp. And what is not certain, is a
firm date for his return, which could be as late as October, though
Maurer is shooting for the season opener
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hoped to get by in the interim with Smith, who was
replaced in the lineup by Kevin Mathis last season after seven
years as the starter. But Smith has been sidelined for the past two
weeks by a bulging disk in his back, and his availability is iffy,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been in Dallas since Aug. 10 getting treatment from
Dr. Andrew Dossett. Maurer said Smith responded positively from an
epidural injection in his back last week, but the bulge has not
been completely reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Smith underwent more tests yesterday, and Maurer said Smith will
either get another injection to try and reduce the bulge in the
disc or another form of treatment will be prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   As with Sanders, Maurer is optimistic about Smith's presence for
the opener, but he said he couldn't make any promises.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the situation has the coaches worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big concern,'' Cowboys defensive backs coach Mike
Zimmer said. ``It was once a position of strength. Now, we are
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he was not going to
panic until ``we get some more definitive information.'' He said
that signing a veteran cornerback is a possibility, but will wait
until closer to the start of the season before ``pulling the
trigger on something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got some good news yesterday when cornerback Charlie
Williams, the only other player on the roster with starting
experience at the position, returned to practice for the first time
since suffering a forearm fracture in the May minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not \Rbeen\S a good scenario with Charlie out and Kevin
out and Deion out,'' Gailey said. ``But we are supposed to get
Charlie back. We are supposed to get Kevin back. And Deion will
hopefully be back sooner than later. We'll have to wait and see how
this works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is wearing a cast on his left forearm, played with
the first unit yesterday, but he won't play in the preseason game
Saturday at New England. Gailey said Williams will likely get his
first action of the preseason against Denver on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Cowboys can say their problems at cornerback are
out of their control.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case at defensive tackle, where Lett has been
suspended indefinitely by the league for violating the NFL's
substance-abuse policy. His status remains in limbo until NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue makes a decision on the length of the
suspension, which should come before the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a second-year pro who played defensive end last year, was
projected to fill in until Lett returned. However, two bad
preseason performances against Cleveland and Oakland _ no sacks, no
tackles _ apparently have the Cowboys rethinking the position.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the team said if the season started tomorrow
that former Altanta second-round pick Nathan Davis would be the
starter at Lett's tackle spot. However, Myers practice with the
first team yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two games, we haven't seen him,'' the source said of Myers'
play.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey wouldn't go that far. But his assessment of Myers' play
against the Raiders spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't play as good as he did the week before,'' Gailey
said, apparently not remembering that after the Browns game he
said, ``\RMyers\S didn't have his best game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey did say the starting spot is wide open at tackle. And
that anything is possible, including moving defensive ends Greg
Ellis or Alonzo Spellman inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try to get our best football players on the
field,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Davis has had the best camp of the other
tackle candidates, and the Cowboys like his size, which is a
drawback for Myers (6-2, 288). Other contenders are NFL Europe
veteran Brandon Noble and fifth-year pro Darren Benson.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had hoped they could finally count on Benson, a 6-7,
308-pound former project this season; they gave him a two-year
contract in the off-season. However, sore knees have limited his
play in training camp. He practiced yesterday agt!might play
against the Patriots, a game that could be crucial to his retaining
a roster spot.

COMETS PLAY, CRY AS THEIR LAUREL WITHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Cynthia Cooper and the Houston Comets, it had been a hard
day's night.
</P>
<P>
   And when the game clock wound down Monday night and the choir of
10,000 fans began to chant _ ``We-love-you-Kim, we-love-you-Kim'' _
there was nothing more to do but pray and cry.
</P>
<P>
   For two championship seasons, Kim Perrot, 32, was the Comets'
point guard and spark plug. She is Cooper's closest friend.
</P>
<P>
   It was in late January that Perrot heard the grim diagnosis that
the cancer she was carrying in her lungs had moved into her brain.
She had vowed that day to return.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Perrot in the WNBA and from her childhood home in
Lafayette, La., wanted to believe that. Athletes, of all people,
aren't supposed to die young.
</P>
<P>
   We read about cyclist Lance Armstrong's stirring triumph over
cancer, and we watch baseball's Eric Davis comeback, and we want to
believe. But cancer ignores the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was never sick _ the kind who was never injured even one
day when she was a player here,'' said Sherry LeBas, the senior
women's athletic administrator at the University of Southwestern
Louisiana, Kim's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   But the laurel, for some reason, always withers quicker than the
rose.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Perrot was flown from Mexico, where she had
been receiving special treatment, to a Houston hospital. It was
left to Comets coach Van Chancellor to inform his team and the
media that ``they're trying to keep her as comfortable as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked and grief-stricken, his team went out Monday and,
buttressed by Kleenex, defeated the Utah Starzz. Chancellor didn't
know how, because the Comets hadn't practiced, nor had they slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is draining everybody on our basketball team,'' he
said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston fans, 10,014 strong, had worn white ribbons in
Perrot's honor or pink hearts that bore her name. When the national
anthem was played, Cooper's eyes filled with tears. Her mind was
elsewhere, even as she scored a season-high 42 points. The WNBA
record, held by Cooper, is 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have just witnessed one of the most incredible basketball
games in history,'' Chancellor said, pondering the emotional
weight.
</P>
<P>
   On TV, Chancellor looked, too, like a coach who had been awake
all night.
</P>
<P>
   We want to believe that things like this don't happen. But most
of us have had cancer strike somewhere in our families, and we know
it does. Cancer's grip can claim the star player or the bench
warmer, the first-place team or the last.
</P>
<P>
   A former Ranger, who shall remain nameless, once told me that he
didn't care for the movie, ``Bang the Drum Slowly'', at all. ``No
way,'' the player observed, ``that Robert DeNiro could ever have
been a catcher.'' He also had a problem, as I recall, with DeNiro's
Hollywood-labored batting swing.
</P>
<P>
   The story, of course, uses baseball as a backdrop but is more a
tale about caring and dying. Somehow, the Ranger missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, a Hollywood world, all stricken athletes are
supposed to recover and ride triumphantly down the Champs Elysees.
In their own minds, they are immortal. Sadly, some believe they can
head-fake both the law and the Grim Reaper.
</P>
<P>
   Would somebody please explain to me how the Yankees' Darryl
Strawberry, recovering cancer patient, can be caught in a vehicle
with cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's illness began as lung cancer, but friends say she never
smoked or drank. Her lone vice, her teammates said, was playing
dominoes against the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came into this program and gave it all her energy,'' LeBas
said from Louisiana. ``She was the type of person who was never
down, but always up. She believed that anything could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot finished at USL in 1990 as the school's all-time leading
scorer. She once scored 58 points in a game and led the nation in
scoring as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that most of the USL family saw Perrot was last
year, when the school invited her back to retire her uniform
number. As news of her condition spread, LeBas had had a photo of
the ceremony enlarged and made into a giant, autographed greeting
card, which was mailed to Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has given so much integrity to women's athletics,'' LeBas
said. ``I just have a heavy heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Perrotgs)Comets teammates played and won a basketball
game on Monday night. Just a day before, they had learned the
inevitability of their friend and point guard's illness.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, where WNBA crowds draw a formidable average of
11,000 fans, this is going to be a tough week.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't cancer ever finish in last place?

 &HT;    Dell beats analysts' earnings forecast
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp., which rarely surprises Wall
Street, stepped out of character Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In earnings announced after the market closed, Dell beat Wall
Street's expectations by 2 cents a share. The Round Rock-based PC
maker reported profit of 19 cents a share, or $507 million, for the
second quarter ended July 30.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since at least 1995 that Dell exceeded
expectations by more than 1 cent, said First Call/Thomson
Financial, a company that polls analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 47 percent increase in earnings, revenue
jumped to $6.1 billion, 42 percent higher than the second quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   While still shy of the 50 percent growth that many investors had
become accustomed to, it was better than the 38 percent revenue
growth in the fourth quarter, ended January 29. Those results
spooked institutional investors when they were reported in
February, resulting in a drop in Dell's stock price that shares
still have not regained.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares declined $0.31 1/4 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday,
closing at $41.12.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts saw little to criticize Tuesday in Dell's
second-quarter performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blew the cover off the ball, I would say,'' said Lou
Mazzucchelli of the New York investment house Gerard Klauer
Mattison, whose estimate of 18 cents a share was among the most
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be harder for the naysayers to keep (the stock)
down,'' he said. ``We're entering the strong part of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was repeated often by Dell executives in interviews
and in a conference call with analysts as they went beyond their
standard confidence about the company's prospects during the
remainder of this year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith outlined Dell's vision of
becoming a $50-billion PC company by growing more aggressively in
the consumer and small-business market, in computer services, by
increasing market share in other countries and by selling more
powerful and expensive servers to big corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will enable Dell to grow from $20 billion to $50 billion
simply by doing in every market what we today do in a few,''
Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's assault on the high-end PC business, where systems can
fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars, will be powered at first by
eight-way servers, which string together up to eight new Intel
Corp. processors. Dell will face stiff competition in that market
from Compaq Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Those higher-end machines will help stabilize a decline in
average selling prices for Dell as well as for its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   At $2,200, Dell still has the highest average price in the
industry, but the number is down $1,000 from the first quarter,
said Meredith. Part of that drop reflects declining component
costs, which Dell passed on to customers in price cuts to boost
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's gross margin, however, increased half a percentage point
to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Steve Dube of Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York
said all PC makers face the same pressures, in part because of
cheap computers that many companies offer with a contract for
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Internet sales averaged $30 million a day in the quarter,
up from $18 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the company's biggest disappointment was the 24 percent
increase in sales in Europe, the world's second-biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's general manager for Europe, Jan Gesmar-Larsen, announced
in July he would take a personal leave of absence after revenues
grew just 29 percent in the first quarter. He has been replaced by
John Legere, who was Dell's president for Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I think you can tell by our tone we think (Europe
sales) can grow quite a bit higher,'' said Chief Executive Michael
Dell.

VICTORIA, B.C., GETS FLUNKING GRADE FOR SEWAGE TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study calls the discharge of raw sewage into Canadian
waterways a ``national disgrace'' and cites Victoria as the worst
offender, flunking British Columbia's capital with an ``F minus''
grade for continued dumping into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sewage Report Card to be released on Wednesday is a
successor to a 1994 study and finds that treatment has improved in
eight Canadian cities out of 21 surveyed. One is Vancouver, which
has upgraded two plants on the Fraser River from primary to
secondary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Its lowest grades are reserved for Victoria as well as St.
John's, Newfoundland, and Dawson City in the Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, a
Vancouver-based environmental group, on behalf of the United
Fishermen and Allied Workers Union and Georgia Strait Alliance. All
are critics of Victoria's sewage discharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sewage problems are comprehensive and countrywide, from
sea to stinking sea,'' concluded the report, which looked at
communities ranging from Toronto, with a population of 2.4 million,
to tiny Dawson City with only 1,700 year-round residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halifax and St. John's on the east coast, and Victoria on the
west coast, have no sewage treatment at all,'' it reported.
``Together, they discharge about 122 billion litres (about 35
billion gallons) of raw sewage into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Halifax, Nova Scotia's capital, escaped an ``F'' because it is
developing plans for treatment plants and diverting toxic
substances out of its sewage system.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria dumps more than 20 million gallons of untreated waste
each day into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, an international waterway
shared by the United States and Canada. It does screen large solids
out of its sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage comes from 322,000 people in the British Columbia
capital and nearby suburbs, which constitute one of the
fastest-growing areas in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although no toxicity testing is required, Victoria-area
municipal governments have insisted that discharges from the
Macaulay Point and Clover Point outfalls cause only ``minimal''
environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment released last spring, the Capital Regional
District, an umbrella organization of local governments, said:
``Water quality at beaches in the vicinity of the outfalls is not
adversely affected by the two outfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim is vigorously disputed in the Sierra Legal Defense
Fund's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although sewage effluent is discharged into a large body of
water with strong currents and tidal movements, bacterial and metal
pollution extends from one to two kilometers (.62 to 1.25 miles)
away from the MacAulay Point outfall,'' it reported.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that ``an extensive area'' in the Strait
of Juan de Fuca has been closed to shellfish harvesting by order of
Canada's fisheries ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Capital Regional District has committed since 1986 to
acquire land for construction of a sewage treatment plant. Eleven
years ago, it began discussing land acquisition with Canada's
Department of National Defense for a treatment plant near Macauley
Point, located in Esquimalt just west of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   But the district has yet to set aside land for a sewage
treatment plant ``nor does it appear to have any intention of doing
so,'' according to the report card.
</P>
<P>
   The district has recently negotiated a deadline extension until
July 2000 for delivery of a waste management plan, designed to
include a schedule for upgrading to primary and secondary
treatment. In 1991, Canada's environment and fisheries ministries
first instructed the district to upgrade at least to primary
treatment of Victoria-area sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Cost estimates for treating Victoria's sewage have ranged from
$90 million to $600 million (Canadian), and neither the provincial
nor Canadian federal governments have shown any eagerness to pay
much of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The status quo has a powerful defender in David Anderson,
Canada's minister of the environment and Victoria's member of the
federal parliament in Ottawa. In a recent interview, Anderson
argued that cold, fast-moving waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
effectively disperse and oxygenate the sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sewage is treated naturally,'' Anderson said. ``Within
meters of the discharge outfalls, you have sailboarders. Within 400
meters, the sewage is barely detectable. It is one of the few
places in the world where this occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a discussion with Seattle Post-Intelligencer
editors, Anderson added: ``The best wind surfing we have in
Victoria is off Dallas Road, right between the two outfalls. They
don't glow as they walk down Government Street. They don't drop
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1983, however, the fisheries ministry closed down
shellfish harvesting in waters near the discharge outfalls in
Victoria and Esquimalt. The closure area now totals more than 30
square miles of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Sierra Legal Defense Fund sought to bring a
private prosecution _ which is legal under Canadian law _ against
the Capital Regional District for violating federal fisheries law
as well as British Columbia's waste management act.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage report card gives a ``C minus'' grade to Vancouver.
It notes upgrading of the two Fraser River treatment plants, and a
sharp reduction in sewage overflows.
</P>
<P>
   But Vancouver's largest treatment plant, at Iona Island, offers
only primary treatment and ``is the single biggest source of
pollution in Georgia Strait,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sewage is not just human waste,'' added the report. ``Studies
show that typical municipal sewage contains some 200 synthetic
chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary sewage treatment, a process adopted by U.S. cities on
Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, kills bacteria and
removes both solids and nutrients from sewage. It requires
construction of a treatment plant, which holds ponds in which
solids are settled. The remaining liquid sewage is treated with
micro-organisms, which remove objectional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Across the strait from Victoria, Port Angeles, Wash., has spent
more than $31 million on a secondary sewage treatment system. Port
Townsend, Wash., has estimated its costs at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria is looking at several options for treatment. One is
simple screening, in which sewage is chopped up. Another is sand
filtering. A third is treatment with chemicals.

HALLMARK GOAL: TRIPLE ITS ANNUAL SALES BY DECADE'S END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc. on Tuesday said it wanted
to triple its annual sales to $12 billion by 2010 but was vague on
how it intended to accomplish its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark's plan is for sales to increase 10 percent a year, far
more than the greeting card giant has accomplished in recent years.
The company's 1998 sales were up 5.4 percent from 1997, and in 1996
sales were up 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting card analyst E. Gray Glass III said the revenue growth
would be a real stretch for the Kansas City company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely aggressive goal for a greeting card
company, and I'm not sure how (its) existing businesses get it to
that kind of a growth rate,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark is a behemoth in the greeting card industry, but
increasingly that business and others owned by Hallmark are being
aggressively attacked by competitors. Those rivals include other
card companies, makers of collectibles and ornaments, and
electronic greeting card sites on the World Wide Web that offer
free e-mail cards.
</P>
<P>
   A Tuesday news release announcing Hallmark's goal said the
company would ``build emerging businesses''; ``create incremental,
profitable growth...''; and ``expect a high level of synergy among
the platforms.'' It said little about strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Julie O'Dell said Hallmark did not have many
specifics on how the company that sells sentimentality was going to
get to $12 billion a year in sales by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've really done is announce our strategy, and now it's
the new organization's job to get busy and figure out what we're
going to do to get there,'' O'Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization refers to the recent promotion of Don Hall
Jr. to the newly created job of corporate vice president of
strategy and development. It also includes the hiring of Jan L.
Murley, a former top Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. executive who is joining
Hallmark in another newly created post _ group vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark plans to pump up sales in each of its six ``platforms''

HERNANDEZ MYSTIFIES HIS TEAMMATES AND ROYALS IN 5-2 WIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His teammates don't always understand some of what
Orlando Hernandez does. Sometimes he will stop on the mound and
begin motioning with his hand, touching his chest, as he did in the
fourth inning last night, and his teammates _ having absolutely no
understanding of what he is trying to communicate _ will begin to
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``His signs,'' said Derek Jeter. ``I have no idea what they
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Hernandez pitches as he did Tuesday night, they don't
care about any of the other stuff. Hernandez shut out the Kansas
City Royals for seven innings, long enough for the Yankees' offense
to break out with a late rally, in a 5-2 win before 31,631 at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Royals scored twice in the eighth inning, the
Yankees' pitchers had amassed 18 consecutive shutout innings, an
achievement of some note in this era of home runs and middle
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had just one hit in the first six innings, then
scored four runs on five hits in the seventh inning. Leyritz had
the Yankees' only hit against Jose Rosado as he led off the seventh
inning; he had doubled in the fourth inning. This time, Leyritz
smashed a line drive to left, where Johnny Damon turned and ran to
his left, twisting as he and the ball intersected; it glanced off
his glove, skipped against the wall and rolled away; Damon fell
down.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran, the Royals' center fielder, had been moving
slowly toward the play, and by the time he recovered, picked up the
ball and threw back toward the infield, Leyritz was well on his way
to third, with his first triple since 1990. Leyritz had held the
longest streak without a triple of any active player in the big
leagues, a distinction he assumed when Mark McGwire tripled against
San Diego earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada then dropped a single to center field, to drive
home Leyritz. Shane Spencer pulled a double down the left field
line, and after Rosado retired the next two batters, Chuck
Knoblauch singled home two more runs, giving the Yankees a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (13-6) faced two batters in the eighth inning before
giving way. His final line: six hits, one walk and two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched great,'' said Knoblauch. ``The Royals are hitting
.290 as a team, and to be holding them scoreless over seven innings
is a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is particular, sensitive, willful, intense and
competitive on his own terms. Once, he and several other
Spanish-speaking teammates chatted within earshot of reporters
about how to pitch to a particular opponent, Hernandez tried
curtailing the conversation; the reporters will hear us, he said
insistently, and his teammates attempted to convince him that the
reporters didn't understand what they were talking about and that
even if they did, it really mattered little.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez recently became quite upset when it was written that
American League hitters have adjusted to him and he to them; to
Hernandez, who thrives on deception, there was something wrong in
suggesting hitters had adapted to him in any way.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning last night, Hernandez and catcher Jorge
Posada had some trouble agreeing on a pitch; Hernandez stepped
back, and after making motions with his hands, he began clearing
dirt from his spikes by stomping on the rubber demonstratively.
Some of the Yankees' infielders grinned but could hardly contain
their laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness, they understand, is part of what makes him
successful. After a lackluster outing against Oakland last week,
Hernandez spoke sullenly, in frustration, seemingly dissatisfied
with himself _ and usually, when El Duque is this way, he
resolutely rebounds in his subsequent outing.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez did Tuesday night. Against the Athletics last week,
Hernandez's control was poor; he reached the count of three balls
and one strike _ a situation which greatly favors the hitter _ to
nine of the first 17 hitters he faced. Facing Kansas City Tuesday
night, Hernandez did not reach a 3-1 count all night.
</P>
<P>
   He used his efficiency to pitch out of trouble all night. Mike
Sweeney doubled leading off the second inning, and Hernandez
retired the next three batters; Kansas City runners reached scoring
position with two outs in both the fourth and fifth innings, and
Hernandez escaped.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnny Damon weakly slapped a roller past third base and
down the line for a double while leading off the sixth inning,
Hernandez foiled Rey Sanchez's bunt attempt by firing a fastball
high and inside, causing Sanchez to pop out to Posada. Hernandez
walked Carlos Beltran, but fooled Sweeney with a fastball _ when
Sweeney appeared to be looking for a slider _ to generate an easy
fly to right, and Jermaine Dye popped out to second, closing the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City was 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position in the
first six innings, no easy feat for Hernandez. The Royals ranked
second in the league in batting average, coming into this series,
and fifth in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Into the late innings, however, the Yankees fared even worse
than the Royals' hitters. Jose Rosado, a member of the AL All-Star
team this year, allowed a single hit in the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado threw just 16 pitches in the first two innings, working
quickly, then retired the first two batters in the third inning
before walking Scott Brosius. And then Chuck Knoblauch and Derek
Jeter slowed the game, as if it were caught in bumper-to-bumper
traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch fouled off four two-strike pitches, and on the 10th
pitch of his at-bat, Knoblauch took a pitch high and out of the
strike zone, drawing a walk. Jeter fell behind in the count 0-2,
before he fouled off five pitches. Jeter struck out on the 11th
pitch of his at-bat, but in scraping through, Rosado had thrown 33
pitches in the half-inning, 21 to consecutive batters. He appeared
somewhat drained at the start of the Yankees' fifth, throwing
pitches high and out of the strike zone, a sign of a tired pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosado shut down the Yankees in the fourth inning and held
them scoreless into the seventh.
