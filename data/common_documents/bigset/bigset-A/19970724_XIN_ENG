<HEADLINE> UNICEF Lauds Indonesia's Children Protection Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Funds (UNICEF) lauded Indonesia's national children protection
drive which President Soeharto launched here today during the
national children's day celebration.
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Woodhouse, head of the UNICEF Representative Office
for Indonesia, said that the campaign is timely as
children-related problems emerging now are becoming complex and
multi-dimensional, and require inter-disciplinary measures and
involvement of various sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said UNICEF welcomes the Indonesian government's move to set
up a children's protection agency.
</P>
<P>
The government data also show that 60 percent of the 71,000
prostitutes being rehabilitated in government centers are aged
between 15 and 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse said that although the condition is not as bad as
those in other countries, precautionary measures are needed to
address the problems as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Social
Affairs Minister Inten Soeweno said today that the government will
pay more attention to child protection through provision of
guarantees that protect abused, exploited and neglected children.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- After getting promise of
concessions, the European Commission today gave go-ahead to the
planned merger of two giant American aerospace companies, Boeing
and McDonnel Douglas.
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, EU commissioner responsible for competition
policies and the main negotiator on the EU part, told reporters
that he believed this was a successful story of the "solidarity"

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Boeing-McDonnell Douglas Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concession could ensure that the U.S. market remains open
to competition from its main European rival, the French consortium
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Other concessions include maintaining Douglas Aircraft as a
separate subsidiary to minimize Boeing's advantage in bidding for
contracts to replace the aging McDonnell jets in service
worldwide, licensing key patents and intellectual property for
airliner components to competitors, and providing greater details
of government aid to European regulators.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant step toward completing the merger of
these two great aerospace companies," Boeing Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Phil Condit was quoted as saying in Seattle
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In another press conference held here on the same day, Richard
A. Albrecht, executive vice-president of the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, indicated that Boeing paid more attention to the
"long-term interests" of their customers, suppliers, shareholders
and more than 200,000 employees of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
The European approval of the deal, valued at around 14 billion
U.S. dollars, has averted the possibility of a damaging
trans-Atlantic trade war centered on Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by Van Miert at the press conference,
President of the European Commission Jacques Santer said he was
"satisfied" with the result of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were reportedly interwined with high-level
political interventions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton threatened trade
retaliation against Europe if the merger was blocked while
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright lobbied on Boeing's behalf
in a call to German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.

<HEADLINE> Net Foreign Assets of Nepali Banking Sector Up 1.4 Pc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Net foreign assets of the
banking sector in Nepal increased by 1.4 percent to 38.235 billion
rupees (about 670 million U.S. dollars) during the first nine
months of the fiscal year 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
This percentage is 1.2 down compared with the same period of
the previous fiscal year, said the latest Economic Survey for
Fiscal Year 1996-97 ended July 14.
</P>
<P>
During this period, total internal credit rose only by 7.6
percent to 95.348 billion rupees (1.67 billion dollars), as
against an increase of 18.2 percent during the previous fiscal
year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that there has been a decline in the growth rate
of banking credit to the private sector, which accounts for a
two-thirds share in the total internal credit, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Due to a decrease in industrial production and non-gold
imports, credit from commercial banks for industrial and
commercial purposes declined, leading to a sluggish growth of
banking credit to the private sector, the survey added.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Assault Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
was attacked by Jewish settlers in the West Bank today, according
to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Zaki, member of the legislative Palestinian Council, was
attacked near Gilo Settlement while he was driving on his way to
the headquarters of the Palestinian council in Ramallah. The
settlers smashed the windshield of Zaki's car.
</P>
<P>
Zaki is also member of the central committee of Fatah, the
mainstream group of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident involving Fatah officials in two
days. Marwan Barghouteh, general secretary of Fatah and three
other senior Fatah activists were arrested by the Israeli
military authorities near Shilo in the West Bank Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
They are known to have ongoing contacts with the Israeli
left. Now they are reportedly detained at the Israeli army
headquarters in Beit El near Nablus. Israel has yet to comment on
the reason for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
The four Fatah officials had participated in a gathering
organized by Fatah in Nablus calling for the release of
Palestinian police officers. Hundreds of Fatah members gathered
outside a prison where Jihad Masini, a senior Palestinian police
officer, suspected of ordering attacks against Jewish settlers,
was being held.
</P>
<P>
Masini's arrest, which came reportedly under Israel's pressure,
particularly angered Fatah supporters. "The arrest of Fatah
fighters is a red line," said Taysir Nasralla, a Fatah
leader.

<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A mid-night fire gutted the interior
of the French Monument Museum and burnt down a great part of its
roof from Tuesday night to early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The damage was estimated at "million of francs," said museum
director Guy Cogeval.
</P>
<P>
Gas cylinders for welding placed at a repair work over-riding
the building were blamed for the cause of the fire, which
destroyed some plaster replicas of medieval Gothic art and damaged
some others.
</P>
<P>
The museum, situated at the Chaillot Palace across the Seine
river from the Eiffel Tower, displays French and European
monuments dating from Medieval Times to the 19th century, mainly
church reliefs, sculptures and statues.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Cinema, which is sheltered in the same compound
and next to the monument galleries, was spared from the fire. But
all the films in it were evacuated to a nearby garden by
fire-fighters and its projection hall devastated by water.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighters from 21 barracks were dispatched to the scene to
put down the fire, which burned for about four hours.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Reform Higher Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A report from British National
Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education (NCIHE) is published on
Wednesday aiming to reform higher education system and put it at
the heart of national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"In the next century, the economically successful nations will
be those which become learning societies,"said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of education is life-enhancing...This recognition
of the purpose of higher education in the development of our
people, our society and our economy is central to our vision,"
added the report.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that it should be a clear objective of
national policy to be of world class in the business of learning
at all levels and in a range of research of different kinds.
</P>
<P>
The committee seeks to create a new compact between higher
education and society which would mean higher education entering
into specific obligations to students and investing in staff and
students accepting an obligation to contribute more to the cost of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
It would also mean government providing greater stability in
funding and providing the support higher education needs to ensure
it is world class and institutions of higher education building up
partnerships with the social and commercial communities which they
serve.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging and comprehensive analysis of the future
national need for a world class higher education system, the
committee looks to higher education expanding by up to 40 percent
over the next 20 years and proposes tough measures to safeguard
standards.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the report, NCIHE Chairman Sir Ron
Dearing mentioned the situation in 1963 when the last major higher
education review launched: "In response to calls to double
participation by the year 2000, it has achieved the target four
years early...It earns 1 billion pounds a year in foreign
exchange."
</P>
<P>
"But, the core issues now are how to ensure that higher
education in this country is world class, adequately funded, cost
effective," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 1700-page report was asked to look 20 years into the future
and to make recommendations on the long list of issues.

<HEADLINE> Beiping-Tianjin Campaign Memorial Hall Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Memorial Hall of the
Beiping-Tianjin Campaign, a famous military episode in China's
Liberation War, was formally inaugurated here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President and Chairman of the Central Military
Commission Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and vice-chairmen of the
Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian
and Chi Haotian wrote inscriptions for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The inscription of Jiang Zemin, also general secretary of the
Chinese Communist Party, reads: Eternal glory to the martyrs who
died heroically during the Beiping-Tianjin Campaign.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's inscription reads: Strengthen education on
revolutionary traditions, and inspire the people's enthusiasm of
loving the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing wrote: The victory of the Beiping-Tianjin Campaign
represents a great victory in people's war.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, attending the inauguration ceremony, extended
congratulations on the opening of the memorial hall on behalf of
the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said in his speech that though the Beiping-Tianjin
Campaign took place nearly half a century ago, people cherish the
memory of the revolutionary veterans with Mao Zedong as their
leading representative -- at a time when the nation has made great
achievements in building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
</P>
<P>
"The aim of building the memorial hall was to glorify the
historic deeds of the revolutionary veterans and to teach the
younger generation not ever to forget this part of our history,
and to pass on from generation to generation the revolutionary
spirit enriched with the martyrs' blood and lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that it is an important historic mission for the
country and its armed forces to stride into the 21st century with
a splendid new image.
</P>
<P>
"Let us unite closely around the CPC Central Committee with
comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and work hard with one heart and
one mind to greet the convening of the 15th CPC Congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony of the memorial hall was presided
over by Li Laizhu, commander of the Beijing Military Area Command.
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall is located by the Ziyahe River in the
Hongqiao District of Tianjin City. It covers an area of 12,800 sq
m.
</P>
<P>
The Beiping-Tianjin Campaign was one of the three massive
campaigns of the Liberation War period, which helped quicken the
pace of China's liberation.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Back Britain's EMU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's business leaders called
on the British government here today to make an early pledge to
take the country into the European Monetary Union (EMU), but
insisted Britain should stay away from the first wave of the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said in a political
statement that Britain should join a single European currency when
conditions were in place for it to be sustainable, including
inflation and fiscal convergence and flexible labor markets.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that UK's economic and business interest is best
served by membership of EMU under the right conditions. It is
vital for our economic interests that EMU is a success and Britain
must be involved in working for that goal," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI leaders noted that there were "doubts" over
whether the economic conditions for all the potential EMU entrants
would be in place by its planned start date of January 1 1999.
</P>
<P>
Although these business leaders thought it was likely that a
single currency would go ahead on that date, they made it clear
that "It is unlikely that our position in the economic cycle will
make entry on 1st January 1999 -- even if the others go ahead."
</P>
<P>
The CBI statement noted that consultation with its members
nationwide suggested only 6 percent were opposed to Britain's EMU
membership for the foreseeable future with 42 percent in favor of
signing up to the project.

<HEADLINE> SIB Approves New London Stock Exchange Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Investments
Board (SIB) today approved plans by the London Stock Exchange to
move to immediate publications of all trades once completed. This
represents a significant increase in transparency.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, published
today, the SIB said that high levels of transparency were a
foundation for fair and efficient markets and promoted investor
confidence.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the proposed trade publication rules for
securities to be traded on the London Stock Exchange's new
order-driven trading service -- SETS -- should set a framework for
the London Stock Exchange to be as transparent as any leading
equity market in the world.
</P>
<P>
The proposed rules for SETS will require immediate publication
of all trades on execution and establish a new worked trade
regime for very large trades (eight times normal market size).
</P>
<P>
The result of the new rules should: --confirm the London Stock
Exchange as one of the most transparent of the world's leading
equity markets;
</P>
<P>
-- significantly improve the transparency of trading
information and so make for a fairer market;
</P>
<P>
-- provide a new and practical approach to the trading patterns
likely to develop in the new market structure;
</P>
<P>
-- encourage investors to use the new system, enhancing the
liquidity of the order-book and the quality of the price-formation
process.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the SIB states that the freedom that member
firms will have to deal outside the order-book makes it especially
important to ensure that all market users have immediate access to
information on trades once completed, whether on or off the order
book.
</P>
<P>
The SIB welcomes the London Stock Exchange's undertaking to
keep the new regime under close surveillance and to be ready to
make modifications if it is either not working effectively or not
being used as intended.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the London Stock Exchange will keep under review
the need for a minimum size of order which qualifies for trading
on the order-book.
</P>
<P>
The SIB has reached the conclusions set out in its report
following discussions with the London Stock Exchange and informal
but extensive consultation with other interested parties over
recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes Bill to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- In a controversial vote,
Israel's Knesset (Parliament) passed today the first reading of a
bill that requires the majority of 80 votes for giving up the
occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor and Meretz parties cried foul of the way
the vote was conducted, charging the ruling coalition for playing
dirty tricks in order to get the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which required the majority of 80 votes for amending
the 1981 law to annex the Golan Heights, passed the first reading
with a vote of 43-40 in a stormy session.
</P>
<P>
The snap vote was called by Likud's Speaker Dan Tichon, who
took advantage of the opposition lawmakers' joy about defeating a
similar bill that required a majority of 60 votes and national
referendum for giving up the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
After the first Golan Heights bill failed to pass the first
reading, the Knesset became chaotic as opposition lawmakers burst
into joyful celebration, some of whom even left the house.
</P>
<P>
At this time, Tichon called a snap vote on the second
bill. And instead of calling the name of every member for their
decision like in the first vote, the speaker decided to conduct an
electronic vote on the second one.
</P>
<P>
The scene was that of Pandemonium as some opposition members
were too jubilant to participate in the new vote and one of them,
Meretz lawmaker Haim Oron even mistakenly voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier at the podium, Likud's Justice Minister Tzahi
Hanegbi also played a trick to mislead the opposition by saying
that the government was against the bill. But in the formal vote,
all coalition lawmakers in fact voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
In protest, opposition lawmakers walked out the Knesset after
the vote to boycott the rest of the session.
</P>
<P>
Shevach Weiss, Labor's former Knesset Speaker, decried today's
vote as "terrible," which he said was unprecedented either in
Israel or any other western countries. Labor leader Ehud Barak
strongly condemned the government for playing dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the opposition which demanded for a
second vote on the bill, Tichon late agreed to consider whether to
conduct a re-vote within 24 hours because of "technical reasons."
</P>
<P>
The status of Golan Heights, which was taken from Syria by
Israeli troops in the 1967 War, has been at center of the
disputes between Israel and Syria. Syria is demanding Israel's
full withdrawal from the heights in exchange for a peace treaty,
but Israel's hardline Likud government has stated that it would
never return the whole Golan heights for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and Syria have been totally
frozen since the Likud government came to power in May last
year.

<HEADLINE> German Jewish Leader Gives Cautious Nod to Swiss Banks' Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the German Jewish
community today cautiously welcomed today a move by Swiss banks to
run advertisements worldwide in search for heirs to
unclaimed bank accounts left over from the era of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Michel Friedman, an executive committee member of Germany's
Central Council of Jews, said Wednesday that the efforts to find
the heirs to the dormant accounts in Swiss banks came late, "but
better late than never."
</P>
<P>
It was good to finally see Swiss banks playing an active, not
merely a reactive role on the issue, Friedman added.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that the move should only be viewed as the
first step by Swiss banks to clarify their own war-time history
and to be responsible for Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
Swiss banks have come under sharp international criticism since
last year for failing to help trace back billions of dollars of
lost assets presumed to be held by Nazi victims during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, Swiss banks on Wednesday launched an
advertisement campaign in major newspapers around the world
searching for the heirs to the war-time accounts.
</P>
<P>
The money would be paid back quickly after legitimate heirs
have been found and any assets left unclaimed will be given to
charity, said the Swiss banks' advertisements carried by major
newspapers in Germany, France, Britain, the United States, Israel,
South Africa and Eastern European countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Rival Community Leaders to Meet Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will meet here
next Monday to discuss humanitarian matters, said Government
Spokesman Manolis Chistofides at his daily press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
Early today, the spokesman for the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus Waldemar Rokoszewski announced that a meeting between
Clerides and Denktash will take place on Monday at the residence
of U.N. Resident Representative, Gustave Feissel, situated in the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was agreed upon Tuesday during separate meetings
Feissel had with Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said that the meeting will tackle the issue of
persons listed as missing during Turkish invasion in 1974 and
the plight of a Greek Cypriot teacher, who is prevented from
returning to her home in the Turkish-controlled northern part of
the island by the Turkish Cypriot regime.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the meeting will have an open agenda, the spokesman
said the talks will focus on humanitarian issues but did not rule
out the possibility of discussing confidence building gestures
relating to a specific humanitarian issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that other meetings may follow after Monday's
encounter, before the two leaders resume their second round of
direct talks in Switzerland, scheduled for August 11 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The first round of U.N.-led direct talks between Clerides
and Denktash took place at Troutbeck, near New York on July
9-12. The two leaders decided to meet in Cyprus to discuss
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides and Denktash will meet on their own on
Monday and possible participation of others at these meetings in
Cyprus will be decided at a later stage," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite this
Eastern Mediterranean island nation as bi-communal, bi-zonal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Resume Arms Sales to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will resume
arms sales to Rwanda, a senior official said in Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was prompted by the changed circumstances in
Rwanda and the need for the country to restore peace and order,
Kader Asmal, Chairman of National Conventional Arms Control
Committee told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
South Africa suspended its arms export to Rwanda in November
last year pending the return of the stability to the central
African region and after indications that Rwandan armed forces
made cross-border incursions into former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
At that time, South Africa said the suspension would be
reviewed once cross-border violations by Rwanda ceased and a
clear understanding emerged that its armed forces were using
weapons for self-defense only.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noticed that Pretoria made the decision to
resume arms sales to Rwanda after Rwandan Vice President Paul
Kagame visited South Africa early this month when the two sides
pledged to promote comprehensive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Asmal, also Water Affairs and Forestry Minister, confirmed
that his committee approved last August a contracting application
from arms manufacturer Denel for the sale of a number of advanced
artillery pieces to a Middle East country.
</P>
<P>
However, Asmal, who declined to name the country, noted no
export permit had as yet been approved.
</P>
<P>
According to Asmal, the South African government was to carry
out what he described as a far-reaching policy of maximum
disclosure on arms sales.
</P>
<P>
Disclosure to the general public would include the total value
of contracts, and general descriptions of the weapons supplied.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Namibia to Share Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Johannesburg
Stock Exchange (JSE) and Namibian Stock Exchange (NSE) today
signed an agreement on information sharing here in the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a move toward building closer working links
and boosting investment within the Southern African region, JSE
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Today's signing is within the framework of a regional
initiative of cooperation between stock exchanges within the
Southern African Development Community," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for the exchange of information between
exchanges to improve surveillance and protection to their
investors, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Several companies with large investment in Namibia were listed
on the JSE and dual-listed on the NSE, while many financial
groups and market participants had operation in both countries.
</P>
<P>
JSE President Russell Loubser pointed out that "the successful
development and advancement of independent national capital
markets and especially stock exchanges within our region will
boost the liquidity and efficiency of the markets and attract
more foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
Bob Meiring, Chairman of the NSE Executive Committee, also
spoke highly of the role of JSE, saying the JSE could play an
important part through supporting the development and cooperation
of southern Africa's stock exchanges.

BONN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab ambassadors in Bonn today
expressed "surprise and regret" at Germany's abstention from a
vote in the UN General Assembly last week which condemned Israel's
policy to build Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as a "negative message" to the Arab world, Arab
diplomats said Germany's abstention had raised the question about
the country's future policy towards the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement to the German Foreign Ministry issued by
the Saudi Arabian embassy on behalf of the Arab world, the
ambassadors also noted that the fact that Germany was the only
European Union country which abstained in the UN vote would also
have a negative impact on the efforts made by the EU as a whole to
seek peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly last week passed a resolution
condemning Israel's settlement construction in East Jerusalem by a
vote of 131 to three with 14 abstentions.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Unionists Vote Against Arms Surrender Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The pro-British unionists today
voted against crucial arms surrender plans, a setback for the
government to make a political settlement to the Northern Ireland
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that all the three unionist parties had
voted against the plans at peace talks in Belfast this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The government's plan has been rejected," David Adams of the
Ulster Democratic Party told reporters emerging from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland had proposed that both pro-British and
Pro-Irish guerrilla groups surrender their arms during peace
talks, rather than before or after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Unionist leaders are angry that a new ceasefire by the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) will allow its political wing Sinnn Fein to
participate in the substantial all-party peace talks scheduled for
September without an IRA commitment to surrender its arms. The IRA
truce took effect on Sunday, a crucial step towards a political
solution to the decades-old conflict in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said earlier in
the day that the likely defeat of the arms plan by the unionists
was not a disaster but clearly a setback.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said that even if the government loses the
vote, the peace talks on Northern Ireland future could still go
ahead either on a bilateral basis or as "proximity" talks in
separate rooms.

Monetary Union and the enlargement the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
British government officials quoted Cook as telling Vedrine
that Britain was unlikely to be in the first wave of countries to
join the single currency, but London would do its duty when it
takes over the EU presidency in the first half of 1998. Endiem

<P>
AMMAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
received an invitation from Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani to attend the summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) due in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended to the king by visiting Iranian
Minister of Industries Mohammed Reza Nematzadeh, Radio Jordan

It said that except for issues related to the Muslim world,
the invitation also dealt with Jordanian-Iranian ties and
bilateral cooperation.

Tuesday. They held talks on issues of economic cooperation with
their Jordanian counterparts Tuesday at the Jordanian Ministry of
Industry and Trade.

Nematzadeh told reporters after the talks that the joint
Jordanian-Iranian economic committee, which is due to hold its

<HEADLINE> Arab Experts Discuss Combating Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab experts debating an
international agreement for combating desertification and its
impact on the Arab world wound up their work here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 experts in agriculture, desertification and land
reclamation from different Arab countries discussed ways to fight
desertification in the Arab world during the two-day meeting at
the Arab League (AL) General Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
They also explored the possibility of increasing the acreage
of cultivable land under an international agreement signed by
most of Arab countries, including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed in Paris, France, in October, 1994 on
combating desertification is aimed at reining in the grave
impact of desertification on fauna and flora worldwide through
enhancing the Arab environmental awareness.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program (UNDP) alerted, in its latest
report, that the Arab region is one of the most parched parts of
the world and that land reclamation operations should be given
maximum priority in Arab countries, Fatmah el-Malah, director of
the Environment Department at the AL told the opening session
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Desertification is considered the gravest environmental
problem menacing the Arab world where large parts of land lie in
the dry and semi-dry zones," she warned.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Arab countries consume mammoth quantities of their
water resources in an irrational way while nine other countries
are suffering a lack of drinkable water, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened at a time when a number of Arab
countries, with Egypt in the fore, are exerting diligent efforts
to increase their agricultural areas and cultivate the desert.

<HEADLINE> 20 Percent UK People Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's 20 percent population, or
11 million people, lived in poverty in 1990, up from 14 percent or
7.5 million people in 1983, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The study, by Bristol University researchers and MORI, bases
its classification of poverty on a person's access to a list of
items and services which the general public believe as the minimum
necessary for an acceptable way of life.
</P>
<P>
The report, Breadline Britain in the 1990s, finds that 10
million people could not afford adequate housing because their
homes were unheated or damp, or because older children must share
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that 2.5 million children were forced by poverty
to go without necessities such as three meals a day, toys and
school outings.
</P>
<P>
About seven million people went without essential clothing,
such as a warm waterproof coat, and five million were not properly
fed, having only two meals a day or insufficient fresh fruit and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Around 6.5 million could not afford one or more essential
household items, such as a fridge, telephone or carpets, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of respondents said that the government
was doing too little to help to alleviate poverty and the report
also blames poverty for inequalities in mental and physical
health.
</P>
<P>
The poor were more likely to feel isolated, to be depressed and
to feel looked down upon. They were more likely to have a
long-standing illness or a disability, it says.
</P>
<P>
The survey concludes that Britain has become an increasingly
polarized nation.

<HEADLINE> UK Abortion Rate up 8.3 pct in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of abortions carried out
in Britain rose to 177,225 last year, an increase of 13,587, or
8.3 percent, on 1995, according to figures released today by the
Office of National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The rise is the first time in five years and although there
were increases in every age group up to 44, it was highest among
teenagers in the age group of 16 to 19-year-olds, at 15.2 percent,
with a total of 28,746 abortions.
</P>
<P>
There was a rise of 11.3 percent in abortions undergone by
girls under 16 last year, from 3,270 to 3,639.
</P>
<P>
Among older women aged 35 to 39, the increase was 12.1 percent,
giving a total of 16,086 abortions in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The findings made family planners call for an urgent review of
contraceptive services to determine whether they are meeting
women's demands.
</P>
<P>
The Family Planning Association said it was "very concerned"
about the disappearance of family planning clinics.
</P>
<P>
Life, the pro-life charity, said the figures were "deeply
shocking" and what the government should be doing is thinking the
whole of current sex education theory and practice instead of
pouring money into condom and abortion agencies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Health Department said: "We are not sure
why the figures have gone up and the Office of National Statistics
is undertaking a review. We have to look at this in the longer
term to see if there is a changing pattern or if this is a one
year blip."

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Attacks Israeli Patrol in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas
announced that they launched an attack today on an Israeli patrol
in south Lebanon, killing and wounding several Israeli soldiers,
but Israel denied any casualties were caused to its forces.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Islamic Resistance, military
wing of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that
one group of its fighters carred out the attack at Wadi Al-Slouki
in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" earlier this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas used machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades
in the attack, "leading to the killing and wounding of several
elements of the Israeli forces," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman confirmed the pre-dawn guerrilla
operation in the buffer zone, but denied that any casualties were
caused to the Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also announced that its Shiite Muslim fighters
attacked today a patrol of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia on the road between Beit Yahoun and Konin in the
border strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces did not stop their daily
bombardment, and fired seven 155mm artillery shells today at
suspected guerrilla targets on hills opposite the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets also dived down from the blue sky over Beirut
around 11:00 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), making an explosive
noise by breaking sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Israeli soldiers have been killed and nearly 50 others
wounded in clashes with Hezbollah in south Lebanon since this
year, reminiscent of a battlefront between Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 in an attempt to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese militants.

<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Ambassador to the United
States Edith Ssempala said here today the connection between
Africans and African-Americans has since the beginning of the
decade been getting deeper and broader, solidifying social,
political and economic links.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an Africa African-American summit meeting,
Ssempala said this was happening at a critical moment for the
Afro-American relations when the continent was being viewed as a
partner rather than a recipient of aid.
</P>
<P>
The closer Afro-American relations had led to more initiatives
for investment in Africa by people from this and other
continents, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ssempala said she was pleased that the international community
was beginning to recognize and respond to the investment
potential in Africa.
</P>
<P>
To this end, she urged participants at the summit to cooperate
to help develop the continent.
</P>
<P>
The fourth bi-annual summit which began here Tuesday seeks ways
''to develop Africa and create business opportunities for
Africans and African-Americans''.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei today called on Muslims the world over to
distinguish friends from foes.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei issued the call while addressing a large audience of
visitors who are in Tehran on the occasion of the ongoing 10th
Islamic Unity Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Shiites as well as Sunni Muslims must have a
realistic view of the current international situation and be
able to distinguish friends from foes."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian supreme leader stressed that "the world Muslims
must exploit their geographical and their other God-given
resources for their religious goals in their march to progress
and in their fight with international arrogance and Zionism."
</P>
<P>
He said that the unity of the Muslim world is the key to
solving the problems that are plaguing Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
Historically, he said, the enemies of Muslims had always
feared the unity of world Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"The international enemies of Muslims have wrongly accused
Iran of supporting terrorism and human rights abuses with a view
to destroying the good relations between the Iranian government
and the rest of the Muslim world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is to host the eighth summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) in Tehran in December and has been
actively involved in overseas missions to invite leaders of the
Muslim countries to attend the summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations today issued a presidential statement, calling for
the Angola Government and the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to end conflicts and observe their
commitments under the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its grave concerns over the increasing tension in
the northern part of the country, the Council called upon both
parties to refrain from any use of force, in accordance with their
commitments under the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Council also urged the parties to continue to work closely
with the Joint Commission, and in particular UNITA, to cooperate
fully with MONUA (the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola)
and ensure the freedom of movement and the safety of its personnel
as well as of international humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its belief that the
long-awaited meeting within the territory of Angola between the
President of Angola and the leader of UNITA could greatly
contribute to the reduction of tension and to the process of
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed its readiness to consider the
imposition of measures unless UNITA takes irreversible and
concrete steps immediately to fulfil its obligations under the
Lusaka Protocol.These Steps should include demilitarization of all
its forces, transformation of its radio station Vorgan into a
non-partisan broadcasting facility.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, UNITA has seized back several towns it lost
in May and June when the government tried to extend its control
over the entire country.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's D-8 Policy to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey announced today that it
would continue to push forward the D-8 Group movement which was
initially launched by former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Omer Akbel said that the D-8 Group was part of Turkey's
state policy rather than that of the government.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Group, which consists of Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia, was established at
the initiative of Erbakan, who was regarded as a pro-Islamic prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Akbel quoted Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem as saying that the Turkish government attached
importance to the D-8 Group.
</P>
<P>
"It is of our interests how D-8 Group would be used and
implemented for the benefit of all concerned countries," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Akbel told the briefing that there was no plan for the time
being to admit Turkic republics to the bloc of developing Muslim
nations.
</P>
<P>
He, however, added that new Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and
other cabinet members attached great importance to the Central
Asian regions.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Group summit was held in Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, just three days before the June 18 resigning of the
Erbakan-led coalition government.
</P>
<P>
There are rumors here that the D-8 Group will end up
with nothing definite since the Yilmaz government might not be
so interested in the policy that the former government had
pursued.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that though the current government
pledged its adherence to the Muslim bloc, no efforts as great as
the Erbakan administration did could be expected.

TUNIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian National Assembly
passed today the Ninth Five-year Development Plan (1997-2001),
aimed at achieving a 6 percent annual growth rate compared
with 4.6 percent in the previous one.
</P>
<P>
Parliament sources said that Tunisian Minister of Economic
Development Taoufik Baccar delivered a speech at the start of the
parliamentary session, revealing the outlines of the plan and
future expectations to make Tunisia to the same level as advanced
countries by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Baccar said the plan aims not only to achieve a favorable
growth rate, but also to consolidate the country's economic
structures and potentials.
</P>
<P>
With regard to external financing of the plan, the minister
indicated that a significant portion of the required funds can be
obtained, citing the good intentions expressed by Tunisia's
financial partners during the recently-held international
symposium in Tunis on the prospects of financing the plan.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the growth rate during the period, the Tunisian
minister asserted that the annual growth rate of 6 percent in the
coming five years may be achieved through a growth rate
of 4.3 percent in the agricultural sector, and a rise in other
non-agricultural sectors from 5.8 percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the private sector, Baccar said the
implementation of the new five-year plan depends on the
integration of the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector is to take care of production,
creation of job opportunities and investment, adding that it
will contribute 56 percent of the total projected
investments in the plan.

<HEADLINE> House Speaker Calls for End to Leadership Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of U.S.
House of Representatives, on Wednesday called for ending turmoil
in the Republican Party over his leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly encourage every Republican to participate in this
dialogue," Gingrich said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize: I will not allow another chapter to be
written in this tiresome and overwrought saga. This discussion
will be the end of the story," he said.
</P>
<P>
He issued the statement before a closed-door Republican
conference originally designed to discuss strategy for passage of
balanced budget and tax cut bills, central goals of the party for
this congressional session.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting was overshadowed by the leadership issue, which
has plagued the Republican-controlled House since reports surfaced
last week of an attempt to oust Gingrich by dissatisfied members
-- including some leaders -- who felt he had lost the political
initiative to President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
The 228 Republican House members have also been called by
Gingrich to another meeting on Wednesday evening to "hold a family
discussion on how we can continue to move our party forward as a
family."
</P>
<P>
In his statement Gingrich said, "We must ensure that every
member understands both the responsibilities of leaders of the
conference and the equally important and commensurate
responsibilities of the members of this conference."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Gingrich asked members not to seek the resignation
of any leaders who might have been involved in the attempt to oust
him.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regrets Vote on Disarming in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. said today it
regretted a vote by Northern Ireland unionist parties against
disarming guerrillas in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Three unionist parties in Northern Ireland voted earlier today
against proposals by the British and Irish governments that the
Irish Republican Army and the pro-British guerrillas groups should
both disarm while taking part in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that vote," State Department spokesman James Foley
told reporters. "I think the important point, though, is that the
process will continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The British and Irish governments have expressed commitment to
this process leading to a negotiated settlement. We don't see this
vote as an end of that process," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA called a ceasefire at the weekend which will admit its
political wing, Sinn Fein, to the talks in September if Britain
deems the truce genuine.

<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister to Visit Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine will pay a visit to several Middle East countries by the
end of August or in early September.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine told Radio-Television Luxembourg (RTL) this afternoon
that he will visit Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon,
Libya and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important occasion to see exactly where we are as
regards this peace process which is clearly stalled, and what
France can be of use, in close liaison with its European partners,
to give substance to this process again," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would "listen, better understand, and perhaps
give proposals later" instead of giving "revealed truth" to the
leaders of the countries once engaged in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the talks held on Tuesday between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, Vedrine said that
"the only useful element is that they meet each other."
</P>
<P>
The talks between Arafat and Levy did not bring any concrete
result. Levy said after the meeting that Israel does not plan to
freeze its project to build housing in an Arab district of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli plan to build the settlement has paralyzed peace
talks between the two sides since March.

<HEADLINE> Largest Gas Vehicle Fleet Launched in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain today launched its largest
fleet of natural gas vehicles and a filling station to serve them.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, including 9 small vans, 9 buses and 6 trucks, were
produced by a partnership of gas utility Centrica plc, joint
venture Iveco Ford and the Energy Savings Trust.
</P>
<P>
Gas vehicles were cleaner to run, produced less noxious
emissions, and were quieter, said Peter Lehmann, Commercial
Director of Centrica.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Environment Minister Michael Meacher
said the most challenging objectives in the program involved
reducing levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulates. Natural gas
vehicles produce less of these emissions than conventional
vehicles, he added.
</P>
<P>
But there are two main barriers, the high cost of vehicles and
the lack of infrastructure for refuelling, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meacher told reporters that Prime Minister Tony Blair had
ordered the conversion of his family car to run on liquefied
petroleum gas.

<P>
LUANDA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos warned here today of another military conflict that's
likely to break out soon in the country.
</P>
<P>
Santos made the first ever open remark since the regional
fights loomed nationwide, while meeting his visiting Namibian
counterpart Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
He said that people should be realistic in realizing the war
that's likely to break out, but the government would try hard to
avoid any armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) have unilaterally suspended the Lusaka Peace Accord
signed in 1994, and thus ushered in worries of another civil war,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UN observer group should do their best to
help keep the peace process continue in the country.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Namibian president said that he wished the
Angolan government and UNITA to observe the Lusaka Peace Accord
and avoid further military actions.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma arrived in Angola this morning for a brief visit aiming
to discuss the bilateral trade cooperation issues.

HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The women's assembly at the
African African-American summit taking place in Harare today
called on African governments to take steps to let women to work
together, protect children from abuse and enhance women's
position in the society.
</P>
<P>
The assembly was addressed by, among others, Coretta Scott
King, wife of the slain U.S. black civil rights activist Martin
Luther King, and Botswana first lady Gladys Masire.
</P>
<P>
Masire said there was need for governments to analyze all
policy programs to establish their effects on women, many who
continued to be discriminated against and lived in abject
poverty.
</P>
<P>
''Our governments should stimulate economies that create
opportunities and employment for women and guarantee ownership of
land to women and improve their access to credit,'' said Masire.
</P>
<P>
King, who received a standing ovation for her speech, said
women had a crucial role in creating a non-violent environment
for children to grow up in.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged the teaching of conflict prevention and
management to children so that they could live in a peaceful
world while girl children needed to be taught self-confidence and
to be peace makers.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''The primary cause of violence is the decadence of
moral values in society. We must teach our children correct
values and we must lead an exemplary life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today called for increased economic ties between Africa and the
United States when he officially opened the Fourth African
African-American Summit here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Africa needs a strong partnership with America which will
embrace trade, investment, cultural and other forms of closer
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation should assist in the development of vibrant
economies in Africa, perhaps in a much shorter period than most
of us might imagine," Mugabe told delegates to the four-day
summit started on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Africa's new struggle is now focused on
rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 delegates from Africa, America and Europe
attended the summit, including Senegalese President Abdou Diouf,
Botswana President Ketumile Masire, Ethiopian President Meles
Zenawi, Angolan Prime Minister Van Dunem and Gabonese
Vice-President Didjob Divungi Bi Ndinga, Secretary General of the
Organisation of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Leon Sullivan, convener of the summit described the meeting as
a milestone in the progress of African-African American unity.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the continent as the last frontier of
development, he implored the U.S government to become more
actively involved in Africa's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, who ceded chairmanship of
the summit to Mugabe, commended U.S President Bill Clinton for
his initiative of "partnership for growth and economic
opportunities for Africa" which will allow certain African goods
to enter the American market duty free.
</P>
<P>
"We also praise the involvement of most industrialized
countries gathered at the Denver summit from June 20 to 22 to
place Africa and its development at the center of world agenda,"
Diouf added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Georgia to Achieve Lasting Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today said that the primary responsibility for revolving the
differences in the Georgian/Abkhaz issue and finding a lasting
political settlement rested with the Georgian and Abkhaz sides.
</P>
<P>
In a message at the opening of the three-day Georgian/Abkhaz
talks in Geneva, Annan said that assistance, economic support and
the peacekeeping force could come from others in the international
community, but it was up to the two parties themselves to develop
direct dialogue and to make the necessary compromises to achieve a
lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
During this process it was essential that the two sides
maintained their commitment to the non-use of force or threat of
the use of force against each other, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United Nations had been involved in the
Georgian/Abkhaz peace process for four years and had been
physically present on the ground with military observers since
August 1993, joined later by the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
While the military situation in the area had remained
relatively stable, there had been little progress in finding a
lasting political settlement, he added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the current talks should mark a continuous
process of contact, exchange and negotiation to resolve this
painful conflict.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Georgian/Abkhaz talks are chaired by Liviu Bota,
special representative of the UN secretary-general. Participants
include Foreign Minister of Georgia Irakli Menagarishvili, head of
the Abkhaz delegation Sergei Shamba, Russian Ambassador Lev
Mironov, Ambassador Michael Libal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and representatives of the
Friends of the Secretary-General on Georgia, namely Britain, the
United States, France, Russia and Germany.

<HEADLINE> OAU Asks U.S. to Build True Partnerships with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Africa needs genuine partnerships with
countries such as the United States to help build its economy,
secretary general of the Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed
Salim said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the opening ceremony of the fourth African
African-American summit, Salim said although Africa was adjusting
itself to play meaningful role in the global economy and to become
self sufficient, it was aware of the need of foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
''We expect a genuine partnership to come from the U.S.. Africa is
prepared and has committed itself to transform its economy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
''Let's work together to give Africa a chance. Let's double our
efforts to build a new image of Africa and to help Africa become an
equal partner in the global village,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the establishment of the African Economic Community
(AEC) showed the seriousness of the continent to improve itself.
</P>
<P>
The AEC launched at the OAU summit in Harare in June held its
first trade and investment meeting in Mauritius recently where a
series of measures to promote foreign investment in Africa were
formulated.
</P>
<P>
Salim said africa's image as a continent for conflicts, hunger and
poverty was slowly changing, and it was through such summits that
this was being made possible.
</P>
<P>
The majority of African countries were now enjoying peace,
security and relative stability and most were registering modest
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, ''African leaders have committed themselves to moving
forward with the process of democratization, good governance and
respect human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Criticized for Intervening in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's True Path Party (DYP)
today obscurely criticized the military for intervening in party
politics, saying Turkey needs no "savoirs."
</P>
<P>
The DYP, led by former deputy prime minister Tansu Ciller,
made the remark in a statement issued here following a two-day
high-level meeting of the party.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forced termination of the former coalition
government by the army a month ago, the statement pointed out that
this result would be not only harmful to the present but also to
the future.
</P>
<P>
It is very unfortunate that the Turkish people have to protect
the country's democracy although the country has a
half-a-century-long multi-party politics, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the guarantee of the country's democracy was
the republican system itself, the statement noted that the
Republic of Turkey needed no "savoirs" at all.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the DYP criticism was apparently
directed against the military led by Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi, which forced the former Necmettin Erbakan
government to step down.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military, which describes itself the defender of
Turkey's secularism and democracy, held that the Erbakan
government would encourage the growth of the fundamentalism,
which was termed as the fatal threat to the republic.
</P>
<P>
"As is very much the case for our religious beliefs, no one has
the right or power to exploit our republic for political
considerations, " said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also rebuffed the spy accusations that Ciller had been
working as an agent for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), describing it as "unprecedented" in the history of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The General Staff has reportedly ordered a probe into the
alleged Ciller agent case initially launched by Dogu Perincek,
Chairman of the Workers' Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today hailed a
U.S. House of Representatives resolution on the Cyprus problem as
"very positive."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. resolution called for the
demilitarization of the divided island and the withdrawal of the
35,000 Turkish occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
If the points contained in the resolution constituted active
elements of U.S. foreign policy, then a permanent and viable
solution of the Cyprus problems could be attained, Greece's
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that similar texts had in the past been
adopted by representatives bodies of the United States, but they
were not implemented in the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied northern Cyprus in the wake of a Greek Cypriot coup
engineered by the then military junta ruling Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash recently held their first round of direct talks in
Troutbeck, near New York, for a solution to the protracted Cyprus
problem. They are expected to hold another round of talks in
Switzerland in August.

AMMAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The first flight by Palestinian
Airlines arrived here today, thus starting once-in-two-week
Palestinian flights between al-Arish, Egypt and Amman.
</P>
<P>
On board were 34 passengers, including director general of
Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) Fayez Zaidan and some
other Palestinian officials, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The maiden flight should have taken off from Rafah, the Gaza

arrival at the Queen Ali International Airport here.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the summer, Palestinian commercial flights
are also expected to reach Turkey and Saudi Arabia, the
director general added.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Cyrus and Jordan are the
only countries in the region that have agreed to allow Palestinian
Airlines to operate to and from their territories.
</P>
<P>
The PCAA decided to launch the route from al-Arish, near
Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, after Israel refused to let
them open a new airport in Rafah in the southern tip of the
strip.

WUHAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
aroused 800,000 people to fight flooding caused by torrential
rains from July 12-16.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 counties and cities in Hubei had more than 100 mm of
rainfall, and three had as much as 300 mm during the period.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at some sections of the Yangtze River and 28 of
the large and medium-sized reservoirs have exceeded the danger
mark.
</P>
<P>
Flooding has struck plains and lakeside areas, toppling nearly
40,000 housing apartments and inundating 740,000 ha of
farmland. It has caused a direct economic loss of 1.4 billion yuan
(168.67 million US dollars) and victimized 7.64 million people.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government organized the task force to reinforce
embankments, discharge flood water and relocate flood victims.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,600 pumps have been used to discharge water from
flooded farmland.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Chief Proposes Scrapping Youth Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard today proposed the abandoning of the newly adopted
obligatory defense training program for youths under 18, called
"Citizens' Rendez-vous."
</P>
<P>
Richard told the daily Le Monde published today that he plans
to replace "Citizens' Rendez-vous" with a one-day "preparation"
lesson to inform the youths about their country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of abandoning the five-day obligatory defense
training could reduce the high costs which will result from
gathering all of the country's youths above 16 for medical
checkups and travels as are required by the program.
</P>
<P>
The French government is desperately fighting to cut the
country's high public deficit to meet the criteria for joining the
European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Richard also suggested that programs be provided for the youths
who volunteer to join more sophisticated military trainings, so as
to establish a reserve force for the French army.
</P>
<P>
The former French National Assembly adopted in February the
bill on "Citizens' Rendez-vous," which was aimed at storing up
medical, social and professional information of French youths,
helping handicapped youths to better integrate into the society,
and encouraging youths to engage in volunteer jobs at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac declared in February 1996 that
France would abandon its 200-year conscription practice by 2001,
as it no longer fits the present security and defense needs.
</P>
<P>
Under conscription, all French youths are required to serve in
the army for 10 months.

<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- France today reaffirmed its support
for Syria's claim of sovereignty over Golan Height, one day after
the Israeli parliament adopted a government bill aimed at banning
any withdrawal of Israeli troops from the height.
</P>
<P>
"Since the annexation in December 1981 of Golan Height, our
position remains that the negotiation between Israel and Syria
should resume as soon as possible on the basis of pertinent
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, and the principle of
exchanging land for peace," said French foreign ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that only a return of the sovereignty over Golan Height
to Syria can bring a solution to the security problems existing
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government bill requires the parliament to vote in
an ultra-absolute majority (80 votes out of a total of 120) to
pass any law in the future which can jeopardize the annexation of
Golan Height.

<P>
NANJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
experienced an all-round economic growth in the first half of
this year, official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the foreign trade volume of
Jiangsu, an economic powerhouse of China, jumped nearly 23.7
percent on a yearly basis in the first six months to more than
9.036 billion US dollars. Of the amount, exports reached 6.78
billion US dollars, up 26.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, foreign direct investment in Jiangsu
increased 25.6 percent to 2.56 billion US dollars. Investment from
Hong Kong and Macao, Japan, the United States, Singapore, and the
province of Taiwan exceeded 200 million US dollars each. The
Republic of Korea, Germany and the Netherlands invested more than
100 million US dollars each in Jiangsu in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
As overall overseas investment in Jiangsu rose, average

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 24 (Xinhua/OANA) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
experienced an all-round economic growth in the first half of this
year, official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the foreign trade volume of
Jiangsu, an economic powerhouse of China, jumped nearly 23.7
percent on a yearly basis in the first six months to more than
9.036 billion US dollars. Of the amount, exports reached 6.78
billion US dollars, up 26.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, foreign direct investment in Jiangsu
increased 25.6 percent to 2.56 billion US dollars. Investment from
Hong Kong and Macao, Japan, the United States, Singapore, and the
province of Taiwan exceeded 200 million US dollars each. The
Republic of Korea, Germany and the Netherlands invested more than
100 million US dollars each in Jiangsu in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
As overall overseas investment in Jiangsu rose, average
investment in each project also went up in the first six months, a
provincial official noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's economic and technological cooperation with overseas
parties also expanded rapidly in the first half, as a total of 562
agreements for cooperation were signed during the period, with

<HEADLINE> US Jobless Claims Last Week Lowest in A Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of American workers
filing first-time claims for jobless benefits declined last week
to the lowest level in nearly a year, U.S. Labor Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that new applications for unemployment
insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 299,000 during the week
ended July 19, lowest since the week ended July 27, 1996. The drop
of 42,000 followed an even larger 45,000 decline the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Much of the huge decrease may have been due to auto plants
reopening after their annual new-model retooling and the end of
auto strikes.
</P>
<P>
The weekly jobless claims in the U.S. are quite volatile, but
if they were to persist at around 300,000, it likely would be a
sign of tightening labor markets in the country. And a tight labor
market could raise inflation fears if employers were forced to
raise wages to attract qualified workers and were able to increase
prices to cover the added expense.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Forge Stronger Ties with Africa: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. president Bill Clinton today
renewed his country's commitment to forge stronger and more
constructive ties with Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a letter handed to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe by
U.S. secretary for transportation Rodney Slater, Clinton said the
African African-American summit had taken place at a time when
his country was renewing its commitment to forge closer ties with
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was touring stands at the trade and investment
exposition which runs concurrently with the summit.
</P>
<P>
The four-day summit which began on Tuesday presented another
forum for the U.S. and Africa to expand their ties and work
towards mutual objectives, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "my announcement on June 17 along with a bipartisan
group from congress of our intent to pass legislation that will
forge new economic and commercial ties to African countries
pursuing growth oriented reform policies underlines our interest
in pursuing dynamic partnerships with African countries that are
working to build their own futures.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton said opening markets, increasing investment, improving
technical skills, decreasing debt burdens and encouraging growth
oriented reforms were important elements for helping African
nations grow and reap the benefits of economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., he said, was encouraged by the numerous positive
changes in Africa, especially the adoption of democratic and
economic reforms by many countries.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the Denver summit had committed themselves to
support African efforts to promote democracy and good governance,
Clinton said, including improving public institutions and
strengthening civil society.
</P>
<P>
They had also agreed to improve access to markets for African
exports and support its integration into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe said during the tour that although the
summit was being hosted here, the benefits would be reaped by the
whole southern African Development Community (SADC) region, and
he reiterated his call for Americans to invest in the continent.
</P>
<P>
While he encouraged them to invest in the continent, he hoped
they would invest in southern Africa as this would enhance the
capacity to develop the region.

city in southern Afghanistan, with the leadership of the Islamic
Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Holl's two-hour talks with Taliban's Governor of Kandahar

the Taliban, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets former US President Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today told former US President Jimmy Carter that maintaining and
developing a healthy and stable Sino-US relationship is necessary
for world peace and prosperity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting here today with Carter, Jiang praised the
ex-president for his contributions to the bilateral ties, while he
was in office and after his term as president.
</P>
<P>
The main reason the diplomatic relations were established between
China and the United States nearly two decades ago is that the
Chinese and US leaders at that time were aware of the vital common
interests existing between the two countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Despite great changes in today's international situation, he
noted, the common interests between the two great countries, China
and the US, in maintaining world peace, and promoting economic
growth and social progress are expanding rather than diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, Jiang said, the Sino-US relations have
steadily improved and expanded. He added that the current
bilateral ties are experiencing an important opportunity for further
growth.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China and the US would continue to
make concerted efforts to build a long-term stable and healthy
bilateral ties with an eye to the 21st century by increasing
mutual trust and strengthening cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Carter said the US-China ties are of great importance, and that
the two countries share the responsibility of promoting world
peace, security and development, and should forge a partnership
based on mutual understanding and trust, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is very important to intensify mutual understanding, Carter
emphasized, and the US should try to understand China from an
objective point of view and acquaint itself with China's
development.
</P>
<P>
Carter described Jiang's state visit to the United States this
fall as a major event in US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Carter told Jiang that his trip to China is meant to realize
the initial objective of forging of diplomatic ties between the
two countries: To bring about the sustainable and all-round growth
of bilateral relations between the US and China.
</P>
<P>
He said he will continue to work for this end.
</P>
<P>
Carter and his party were invited by the Chinese Institute of
Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Outline Agreement Reached on New CFE Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The 30 nations revising the
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) here on Wednesday reached a
framework agreement to further reduce the conventional arms
stationed in Europe, said a report of the Austria Presse Agentur
(APA).
</P>
<P>
The 16 NATO members and the 14 countries which used to form the
rival Warsaw Pact agreed that there would be significantly less
equipment permitted in the area of application in Europe than
there was under the original treaty.
</P>
<P>
The original treaty allowed one overall amount of equipment for
NATO members and an equal amount for the Warsaw Pact, with a
system setting national ceilings.
</P>
<P>
The new treaty would fix ceilings on the amount of equipment
that a given country could station anywhere within the CFE area,
which goes from the Atlantic to the Urals.
</P>
<P>
It would also set ceilings on the amount of equipment that
could be stationed by a country, or its allies, within any given
country, or in certain cases, parts of a country.
</P>
<P>
Washington hailed the outline agreement as ushering in an era
of "cooperation not confrontation," the APA report quoted sources
from the White House as saying.
</P>
<P>
Robert Bell of the U.S. National Security Council said
"cooperation not confrontation" marked the Vienna talks, which
began in February. He added that a final agreement was expected to
be concluded within a year.
</P>
<P>
The CFE negotiations represented a key tool in persuading
Russia to accept NATO's expansion to include former Warsaw Pact
members -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Russia sees it as a means to make sure NATO will not build up
its forces along its eastern flank.

<HEADLINE> Somali Clan Clashes Kill at Least Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and two others wounded in Somalia when fighting erupted
Tuesday evening between militiamen from the Hawadle Clan and
others belonging to the Rer Aw-Hassan clan at Abalei Village, 45
km north of the central town of Beletuein.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the region, about 30 heavily armed
Hawadle clansmen in two battle wagons attacked on Abalei
villagers in the evening, and were faced with serious resistance
from the militiamen of the village who had most probably been
aware of the attack to come.
</P>
<P>
Travelers to the capital Mogadishu from the area said today
that eight people including militiamen were also missing as many
people jumped into the river in an attempt to escape the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
A lorry driver who passed by the village immediately after the
fighting said he saw two donkeys bleeding from bullet wounds just
outside the village which looked like a deserted place.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word from either side over the cause for
the fighting. However, reports said the two sides have long been
arguing about the ownership of a farmland at the river bank near
the village.
</P>
<P>
The less-armed community of Rer Aw-Hassan claimed that the
land is theirs and that the Hawadle attackers wanted to take
their farms at gunpoint, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Hawadle men attack their village,
said the Rer Aw-Hassan clan.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the two sides have left Beletuein district, 300 km
north of Mogadishu, to see what had happened in Abalei village.
</P>
<P>
The elders include traditional leaders and religious men who
want to exert effort in ending the dispute between the two sides
with the help of the Islamic sharia judgement.

CAIRO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo-based non-governmental
organization today strongly denounced the move taken Wednesday by
the Israeli parliament to maintain occupation and settlements in
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Afro-Asian Solidarity Peoples' Organization (AAPSO), in a
statement, described Israeli Knesset's approval of the draft bill on
banning withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territory as an
"irresponsible, provocative and serious move."
</P>
<P>
It is a flagrant violation of the principles of international
law and all relevant United Nations and Security Council
resolutions, said AAPSO in the statement carried by the Egyptian
MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Such aggressive measures call for more tension and
instability: something that can trigger a blow-up in the region,"
the statement said, adding that Israel must take the blame for
this.
</P>
<P>
The organization also voiced full support and solidarity with
Syria in "claiming its absolute right to restore the Golan up
to the borders of June 1967 and have all settlements dismantled
so that just and overall peace materializes in the area."
</P>
<P>
The bill's text stipulates that a decision to withdraw from the
strategic plateau must be approved by a two-thirds majority, or 80
MPs out of the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by 43-40 votes at Wednesday's first reading,
must pass three readings in parliament before it becomes law. It
was proposed by an MP from the ultra-nationalist Tsomet party and
supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and most of his
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel have been on ice since
February last year.

<HEADLINE> Skyscraper Designers Learn from Ancient Chinese Pagodas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Mushrooming skyscrapers, a symbol
of the prosperous real estate business of this financial center of
China, will be dwarfed by a pagoda-shaped highrise when its
construction is finished next year.
</P>
<P>
The 88-story Jinmao Mansion has reached its 85th story at
present. Its final height of 420.5 meters will make it the tallest
building in China.
</P>
<P>
The building, to house offices and hotels, is located in the
Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone in Shanghai's Pudong New
Area. It is designed after an ancient Chinese pagoda, whose
separate stories diminish in size as they get higher.
</P>
<P>
The US architectural firm SOM, designer of the giant tower,
adopted such a shape in order to make it resistant to strong winds
and earthquakes, after studying a number of ancient Chinese
pagodas.
</P>
<P>
The project costs 500 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some other major Chinese cities, such as Guangzhou, Chongqing
and Beijing, are also planning to construct buildings over 100
stories high.
</P>
<P>
The 68-story and 384-m-high Diwang (King of the Land)
Commercial Mansion in south China city of Shenzhen holds the
height record in the country at present.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Tourists Increase Sharply to Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics show that
Xiamen, a port city of east China's Fujian Province, has seen a
sharp rise in tourists from Taiwan, to reach some 60,000
passengers in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is up 37 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is the ancestral home of most Taiwanese, and Xiamen,
which has much in common with Taiwan, is now one of the five major
ports through which Taiwanese enter the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government lifted the ban on Taiwanese to visit the
inland provinces in 1987; about 1.7 million Taiwanese had visited
the city by the end of last year, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
"The number of Taiwanese tourists still keeps increasing, and
the trend has never been reversed, even when the relations between
the straits were strained in the past," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese investment in the city has also maintained a stable
growth over the past few years, totalling 2.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sources say that Taiwanese investors have built 1,375
projects in Xiamen, accounting for nearly one fourth of the total
investment they have made in the inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Xiamen's economy has been driven up, and many
hotels have been built because of the quick growth of its tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese businessmen have bought many houses in the city over
the past year, the sources say.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey shows that nearly one third of the total
Taiwanese tourists to Xiamen stay with their local relatives, or
with Taiwanese friends.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Media Slam Israeli Knesset Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian media today described
Israel's Knesset (parliament) resolution on Golan Heights as an
act to undermine the efforts to salvage the deadlocked
Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Knesset approved Wednesday a bill forbidding an
Israeli withdrawal from Syrian Golan Heights occupied by Israel in
1967. In a vote to the bill, 43 Knesset members voted for, 40
others voted against, while 3 abstained.
</P>
<P>
Syrian media described the bill as an attempt to challenge the
relevant UN resolutions and to ignore the Middle East peace
process principles agreed upon at the Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Media added that resolution defies the world public
opinion calling for an Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied
Arab territories, including Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspaper "Al-Baath", the mouthpiece of the ruling party,
in its editorial today said that the aforesaid bill has exposed
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu completely to the whole
world and proved the falsity of his presumptions about peace.
</P>
<P>
The state-controlled Syrian newspaper "Al-Thawara" said in a
commentary today that the resolution is an Israeli provocative
move that assures the whole world that Israel does not want peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Knesset passed a bill in 1981 on annexing the Syrian
Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Call for Greater Effort to Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 24 (Xinhua) -- the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today took great pride the
achievements the grouping has made in the past 30 years, but
called for greater efforts to do even better in facing future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, which opened
here this morning, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
said, "The ASEAN has exceeded all its early expectations as a
model for regional cooperation and consensus in promoting peace,
stability and security."
</P>
<P>
He noted that ASEAN has led in the establishment and management
of the ASEAN Regional Forum. "Our leadership within this critical
regional body reflects the international recognition, credibility
and respect that the ASEAN has won in the arena of regional
security affairs."
</P>
<P>
However, Siazon stressed that as ASEAN approaches the 21st
century, "it must re-tool itself, drastically if necessary, so as
to deal more effectively with old and new challenges."
</P>
<P>
He urged the development of more growth areas in the region,
which he said "has immense potential, due to its rich natural
endowments, its sizeable markets and its talented people..."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in his speech called for
gearing ASEAN economic cooperation toward making the enlarged
ASEAN "a more closely integrated, dynamic and prosperous entity."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "with the solid progress the ASEAN
has achieved over the past three decades, we can now face the new
century, the new millennium with justified confidence."
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can sustain the spirit that has carried us this
far, the ethos of harmony and consensus-seeking, consultation and
compromise, cooperation and partnership and a keen sense of what
is realistically achievable at every point of our journey
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In doing so, we shall remain faithful to our basic principles
and ideals that have enabled us to be masters of our own destiny
and active contributors to the making of a better world," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar attributed ASEAN's
success to five principles: sovereign equality, non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, concern over the use of force to
change an established government or an internationally recognized
political order, open economies and all the members having made
ASEAN the cornerstone of their foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The political coherence and cohesion that ASEAN has achieved by
adhering to the five principles "has given the ASEAN a significant
voice in the international community," he said, adding that "our
ability to remain steadfast to these principles will be a major
factor to keep the ASEAN a strong and vibrant organization."
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasan said on the occasion
that ASEAN's experience shows that "we can indeed make a
difference."
</P>
<P>
"While we can look back with satisfaction, we must continue to
strive forward to keep pace with a world that is undergoing great
transformation due to the forces of globalization," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He urged ASEAN to develop "an outward-looking policy that
responds to our needs and our potential."
</P>
<P>
"Because of our success, we will be expected to play a more
active role in global affairs," he said. "It is timely therefore
to examine how we can contribute to the international community,
not only for the benefit of our region, but also for other
developing nations."
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam noted in his speech
that with the upgrading of India, China and Russia to its full
dialogue partners last year, ASEAN now has dialogue partnership
with all big powers in the world. "This is also an important
turning point in ASEAN external relations and a new element
serving the interest of peace and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Brunei Foreign Minister Mohamed Bolkiah pointed out that
ASEAN's past "has been productive," "the present is under sound
management" and "the future is very largely ours to construct."
</P>
<P>
"We have shown ourselves able to create impressive regional
initiatives but a strong emphasis in our work now... will be
firmly placed on their practical application," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with visiting former Japanese Prime Minister Morihoro
Hosokawa here today, said that the present sound relations between
the two countries have not been easy to achieve.
</P>
<P>
He added that good bilateral relations have been achieved
through the hard work of several generations of people in both
countries, and need to be cherished.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Hosokawa, who visited China three years
ago, Jiang said that with joint efforts by the two governments and
friends from all walks of life in the two countries, bilateral
relations have developed remarkably since the normalization of
relations 25 years ago, bringing major benefits to both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We should express our thanks to those who made major
contributions to the promotion of friendship between the two
peoples and to bilateral relations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Citing China and Japan as two influential countries in the
region and in the world as a whole, Jiang said the establishment
and development of good-neighborly and cooperative relations
facing the 21st century are not only in the fundamental interests
of the two countries, but will also make positive contributions to
peace, stability and development in the region and in the world as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that as long as the two sides adhere to the
principles set out in the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the
China-Japan treaty of peace and friendship, and handle bilateral
relations from a longstanding and strategic viewpoint, our
relationship will continue to grow in a healthy and stable way,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that history can serve as a mirror from which
historical lessons can be drawn, saying, "We have held that the
development of friendship between the two peoples can be continued
from generation to generation on the basis of accurate knowledge
of history and with a view to the future.
</P>
<P>
He praised Hosokawa for his clear attitude toward history
during his term as Japanese prime minister, noting that his
courage in facing up to history shows his far-sightedness.
</P>
<P>
Hosokawa said that, generally speaking, bilateral relations are
progressing well, and that the two countries have set up sound,
stable, friendly and mutually-beneficial ties with an eye to the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
An accurate understanding of Japan's invasion of China in the
past is the basis for the further enhancement of bilateral
relations, the former Japanese leader said, noting that the war
brought China great sufferings, and Japan must reflect on this.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the general situation of bilateral
relations and looking to the future, the two countries can
overcome a number of problems that they are facing so as to raise
their relationship to a new height, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Work With Thailand, ASEAN on Cambodian Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Envoy on Cambodia
Stephen Solarz said here today that his country hopes that all
those Cambodians who are now in exile could return and participate
in the election next year.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
at the government house today, Solarz told reporters that the
United States "wants to work very closely with Thailand and other
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
seeking a solution to the Cambodian problem."
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai prime minister and he "had a very constructive
exchange of views."
</P>
<P>
"I think that we see the problem in very similar terms," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy added that they both hope that the Cambodia
problem can be resolved in agreements, which will make genuine
national reconciliation in Cambodia possible.
</P>
<P>
Agreements on the Cambodia problem will lead to "a truly and
genuinely free and fair election next year under circumstance
where all those who are now in exile are in a position to return
and to participate fully in the political life of the country,"
Solarz said.
</P>
<P>
Though fully aware of the difficulties of achieving a
satisfactory solution, Solarz said he was hopeful that if the
U.S. and other countries around the world can work closely with
ASEAN in the effort to resolve this matter, success may ultimately
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Solarz is leaving for Phnom Penh later today.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Displaces 200,000 in Northern Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 people were
displaced due to recent heavy fighting in the Shomali Valley
north of Kabul in Afghanistan, a UN mission here said in a report
today.
</P>
<P>
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office said that
the latest sharp increase in the displacement has been caused by
intense fighting which led to the Taliban losing the key town of
Charikar to fighters of the northern anti-Taliban alliance over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Shomali Valley, an important agricultural region stretching
from Kabul into the surrounding Hindu Kush mountains, has been
largely depopulated by continued fighting and forced displacement.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that while many of those who left the region did so
to escape fighting, tens of thousands of others were ordered to
leave from their homes by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
A number of those who have fled Shomali have entered Pakistan
and registered with UNHCR as refugees.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iran's Interior Ministry declared that it has
adopted the measures to deal with the influx of refugees from
war-torn Afghanistan and northern Iraq and it will only accept
refugees whose lives are in danger.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said Wednesday that
Iran is hosting over 2 million foreign refugees and Iran
pursues the policy of treating foreign nationals in humanitarian
and Islamic manner.
</P>
<P>
Besharati complained that assistance from international relief
agencies for refugees in Iran has been insufficient.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Crisis Threatens Stability of Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The recent split of the Janata
Dal and the subsequent disputes over the status of its breakaway
wing plunged the 13-party ruling United Front into a serious
crisis, threatening the stability of the three-month-old Indian
government led by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
The split of the Janata Dal occurred on July 5 after a fierce
power struggle took place within the party which was then the
dominant constituent in the United Front.
</P>
<P>
The major cause leading to the split, the worst setback for the
United Front since its formation in May last year, can be traced
back to a previous political crisis triggered by the withdrawal of
support to the H.D. Deve Gowda government by the Congress party on
March 30.
</P>
<P>
Having failed to muster enough support to form its own
government after forcing Gowda to resign as prime minister on
April 12, the Congress party offered to compromise with the United
Front to avert a premature mid-term poll.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party said it would renew its support to a new
United Front government to be headed by anyone other than Gowda.
</P>
<P>
However, Gowda, backed by the left parties including the Indian
Communist Party of India (Marxist), refused to step down from the
United Front leadership, insisting that the Congress party either
support the front unconditionally or face a mid-term poll.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the deadlock and avert a snap poll, Bihar
Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, the then president of the
Janata Dal, came out to suggest that Gowda should step down as
parliamentary leader of the United Front to pave the way for a new
patch-up with the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
Much against his will, Gowda resigned as parliamentary leader
of the United Front which later chose Gujral, minister of external
affairs in the Gowda team, to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the installation of the Gujral government, the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) decided to charge Prasad
Yadav with alleged involvement in a scandal in which huge sums of
public funds earmarked for purchasing fodder were embezzled in
Bihar state between 1985 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Gowda, resentful of Prasad Yadav's role in his dumping and
Gujral's ascendance to premiership, seized this opportunity to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he joined the chorus with the left parties and
the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party to demand the resignation of
Prasad Yadav from the post of Bihar chief minister.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he backed the then Janata Dal working
president Sharad Yadav to contest against Prasad Yadav in the
party's organizational poll scheduled for July 4 to elect a new
party president.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of huge pressures for him to resign, a cornered
Prasad Yadav boycotted the party poll on July 4 and floated his
own party, the Rashtriya Janata Party (RJD), the second day, while
his rival Sharad Yadav became president of the truncated Janata
Dal.
</P>
<P>
The Janata Dal, which used to be the largest constituent in the
United Front with 45 seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of
parliament), was reduced to the second place in the front with
only 27 Lok Sabha seats compared to the 33 seats held by the
Communist Party of India (Marxist).

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Crisis Threatens Stability of Indian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The split of the Janata Dal, however, did not bring to an end
the troubles that endangered the stability of the Gujral
government.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the split, Prasad Yadav announced that his
party supported the Gujral government and wanted to stay in the
ruling United Front.
</P>
<P>
This, as expected, was flatly rejected by Gowda, the Janata Dal
and left parties which not only insisted on keeping the RJD out of
the front but also urged Prime Minister Gujral to remove the three
ministers nominated before by Prasad Yadav.
</P>
<P>
Gujral, whose power base was seriously weakened following the
split in the Janata Dal, took pains to strike a balance when
dealing with the conflicting requests from within his United
Front.
</P>
<P>
While giving clear signals that he was strongly against
corruption, Gujral refused to bow to pressures from Prasad Yadav's
rivals who urged him to use his capacity as prime minister to
force the resignation of the chief minister or impose the
presidential rule in Bihar.
</P>
<P>
Beware of the danger of internal strife to the fragile
coalition government, M. Karunanidhi, Tamil Nadu chief minister
and president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), came to the
rescue of Gujral and Prasad Yadav on July 14 by threatening to
withdraw his party's four ministers from the government and only
support it from outside.
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to Gowda, Janata Dal President Sharad
Yadav and left parties leaders, he accused some United Front
leaders of having formed a coterie within the front and using the
front to settle their own personal scores.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to control the suicidal tendencies of certain
constituents in the front, he said he favored the entry of the RJD
into the front and the continuance of the three ministers in the
Gujral government though they are loyal to Prasad Yadav.
</P>
<P>
He warned that his party would take a final decision on its
withdrawal from the United Front government on July 27 if and only
if the front did not set its house in order.
</P>
<P>
However, Karunanidhi's virulent attack failed to dilute the
tough approaches adopted by Gowda, the Janata Dal and the left
parties towards Prasad Yadav.
</P>
<P>
At a crucial meeting of the United Front leaders held on July
17, the parties concerned failed to settle their disputes over the
entry of the RJD and the continuance of the three ministers loyal
to Prasad Yadav, and decided to take a final decision on these
issues on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Pending the July 27 deadline set by the DMK, the United Front
leaders will meet here tomorrow to iron out their differences over
issues resulted from the split of the Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
Despite all their bickering, the rival parties may now be ready
to agree on a temporary truce for the survival of the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes out of tomorrow's meeting of the United Front
leaders, the current crisis triggered by the split of the Janata
Dal has already seriously undermined the unity of the front, and
its future development will undoubtedly have a profound impact on
the Gujral government.

<P>
TIRANA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Albania elected its new president,
prime minister and parliament speaker today at a meeting of the
new parliament, the 15th parliament of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party Secretary General Rexhep Mejdani was elected the
president, and Socialist Party Chairman Fatos Nano and Socialist
Democratic Party Chairman Skender Gjinushi were elected as prime
minister and parliament speaker respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani, a 53-year-old professor and a physicist, was elected
to replace Sali Berisha, who resigned Wednesday to avoid forming a
coalition with the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani was a member of the presidium of parliament in 1991. In
September 1996, he was elected secretary general of the Socialist
Party and became a parliament member in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nano, 45, an economist and politician, acted as vice prime
minister in charge of economic reforms in the country in

</P>
<P>
He was prime minister of the caretaker government between March
and May in 1991, responsible for preparing for Albania's first
multi-party elections on March 31 that year.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 election, Nano was elected prime minister in
the multi-party parliament.
</P>
<P>
He became Socialist Party chairman in 1992 and 1996. In July
1993, he was arrested on charges of economic crimes by the
Democratic Party authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nano had been a key political opponent of Berisha till March 14,
1997 when he was released from prison under a presidential decree.
</P>
<P>
Gjinushi, 38, was elected education minister in 1981. In
February 1991, he resigned over open disputes with the Labor Party
authorities over his support for university students movement in
December 1990.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, he established a central-leftist opposition party
-- the Socialist Democratic Party -- along with some intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Gjinushi has been chairman of his party since then. He was
elected parliament member in March 1992.

<HEADLINE> Nominations for Consultative Council in Oman Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nomination for Oman's
Consultative Council, which will include women, will be held in
mid-October, the Omani news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the Consultative Council, known in Arabic as
Majlis al-Shura, would take place on a "single day" in the middle
of October throughout Oman's 59 provinces, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The 80-member council is elected through nominations by
civilian and religious dignitaries and tribal and village elders.
</P>
<P>
Oman's Sultan Qaboos in June issued a landmark decree
allowing women across the country to stand for election to
the council, a consultative body seen as an important sounding
board for public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The sultan's directive also enabled women to nominate
candidates for the council. After the nominations, Sultan Qaboos
has the final say in picking the 80 candidates.
</P>
<P>
During Oman's last Consultative Council elections in 1994, the
government granted women living in the capital of Muscat the
right to stand for election and make nominations, but their
participation was limited to the capital's six provinces.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecendented move in the Islamic country, Sultan Qaboos
appointed two of the nominated women to the council in November
1994.
</P>
<P>
Oman announced the creation of the council in 1991 in an effort
to widen representation in the government.

<HEADLINE> New Oil-Bearing Strata Discovered in Northern Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese petroleum geological
workers have discovered 72 new oil-bearing strata in a recent oil
drilling in northern Qaidam Basin, northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Lining, chief geologist of Prospecting and
Development Institute of Qinghai Petroleum Administration, the oil
drilling was done at the Xianliu Well in Qaidam Basin's Nanbaxian
Area.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 30 million tons of oil and gas (1,000 cu m
of gas equals to one ton of oil) reserves will be verified in this
well this year, said Ma. Geological workers have also discovered
an industrial oil gusher with a daily gas output exceeding 100,000
cu m at two other oil wells in the same region of Nanbaxian.
</P>
<P>
Ma predicted there are high hopes for Nanbaxian Region to
become another medium-sized oilfield with big exploration value,
second only to the Ghasi Kola Oilfield, which has more than 100
million tons of geological oil-gas reserves. It was discovered 20
years ago in Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
Nanbaxian Region is one of the eight key oil and gas
prospecting and development areas designated by China National Oil
Corporation as sites where significant breakthroughs should be
made this year. The list also includes Sebei Region of Qaidam
Basin.
</P>
<P>
Qaidam Basin, with an area of 240,000 sq km, is one of China's
four major basins. It now produces 4,300 tons of oil-gas daily.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Petroleum Administration has discovered in the
northwestern part of Qadam Basin a deposit environment similar to
that of Ghasi Kola Oilfield, and has intensified gas prospecting
work in the basin's central area.
</P>
<P>
It is expected 40 billion cu m of newly-discovered geological
gas reserves will be proven this year.
</P>
<P>
The administration also plans to increase the amount of
verified oil and gas reserves from the present 200 million tons to
600 million tons, and raise its annual gas output from the current
1.5 million tons to three million tons by the turn of this
century.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Andrew Cunanan, the suspected
killer of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace, was found dead
in a houseboat at Miami Beach, Florida on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 police and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
agents surrounded the two-story house Wednesday night after a
report of a gunshot coming from inside. Cunanan's body was found
several hours after police and FBI officers moved into the house
when they got no response to their shout.
</P>
<P>
Cunanan was identified by his thumbprint and the gun found
inside the houseboat was similar to the one used in three of five
killings in which Cunanan was a suspect.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Cunanan was on the top of the FBI's most wanted
list as the prime suspect in the slayings of Versace on July 15
and four other men in Minnesota, Illinois and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
A .40-caliber handgun, the same type of weapon Cunanan was
believed to have used in his cross-country killing spree, was
found near the body, television reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the slaying of the fashion designer, an intensive
nationwide search for Cunanan was launched. Cunanan managed to
escape capture even though his picture was plastered on
television, newspapers, the Internet and wanted posters.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Local residents of Humen
township like to point out that while Tokyo responds to the latest
fashion trends from Paris in 15 days, and Hong Kong starts copying
the Parisiennes' styles in about 25 days, Humen beats with the
pulse of Paris fashion, via Hong Kong, in just about a week.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 520 clothing-manufacturing plants, including
320 overseas-backed ones now making garments in Humen, a "fashion
town" is taking shape in the township famed as the site of an
historic opium-burning episode during the Sino-British Opium War
of 1840.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with garment-making manufacturing, more than 50 mills
have also been built for cloth weaving, printing, finishing work,
bleaching and dyeing in the township, located in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Humen has a population of 90,000 and has 100,000 transients.
More than 40,000 people are employed in the garment making
industry, while 12,000 people are engaged in clothing marketing.
</P>
<P>
Humen now makes 62 million garments a year. Manufacturing
plants produce more than 1,000 styles of clothes each month.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of owners of famous foreign fashion brands
have given licences to have garments made that bearing their name;
others have started their own garment-making businesses in Humen.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, clothing-manufacturing businesses
yearly contribute 100 million yuan in taxes to Humen.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Ganquan, head of the township, said the garment-making
industry has been chosen as the township's new force with which it
can realize its goal of establishing a multi-industrial structure
and advance local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The rapid expansion of the garment-making industry has advanced
development of transport and communication services, tourism,
finance, information, catering and entertainment businesses in the
township.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the township, which receives 5,000
businessmen from outside its borders daily, has attracted 550
million U.S. dollars of overseas investment. And 1,300 businesses
here are producing goods for overseas market.

NINGBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Stephen G. Holtzman, chairman
of the US College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD), visited
the Ningbo Drug Withdrawal Center Wednesday and expressed his hope
for increased cooperation with the Center.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Center have attended the annual session
of the CPDD for three successive years, representing China.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guodong, director of the center, has invented an effective
method to help drug users abandon their addiction relatively
painlessly.
</P>
<P>
"Yang's way is wonderful," Holtzman commented.
</P>
<P>
Yang's "One Plus One Method" has proved to be more effective
than many others after six years of clinical tests on nearly 6,000
patients, medical experts say.
</P>
<P>
Drug users treated with Yang's method will never have to rely
on any other kind of drug after they give up using heroin. This
has long been a problem bedevilling overseas experts can not
handle, they say.
</P>
<P>
The Center is to sent some of its staff members to the CPDD for
further training, and the two institutes will also conduct
exchanges in basic research information and materials in the field.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the State Commission of Science and Technology
has decided to build the Ningbo Drug Withdrawal Research Center
into an international training center for doctors trying to help
addicts quit their dependence on drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Drug use is a worldwide problem, and the research personnel in
China and the U.S should increase cooperation in this field," Yang
said.

Wednesday since the July 1 handover, Tung stressed that tackling
housing and land worries remained a priority for his government.
</P>
<P>
But he hinted that no administrative measures would be taken, a
move appeared to be aimed at reassuring developers.
</P>
<P>
He said suppressing rocketing flat prices was a long-term
process that could not be resolved in the near future. The
government would strive to strike a balance between supply and
demand by providing more land for its enhanced housing program, he
added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tung also met a group of elderly people from
a street home for the aged in Wan Chai, where he answered several
questions from them on his work as Chief Executive, his family and
habits.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Sees Positive Signs in Russian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian economy has shown signs of
growth, said Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin at a
cabinet session today.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output over the past 12 months rose by 2 percent
from the same previous period of last year, Russian media quoted
the prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The revenues and expenditure of the Federal government amounted
to 64 percent and 68 percent respectively of the targets set for
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that the inflation rate over the period from
January to May was only 7 percent, less than half of that of the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The annual interest rate of national bonds dropped from 180
percent to 20 percent last year, helping attract funds to
investment in production.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also indicated several negative economic signs,
including the increase of the proportion of arrears in gross
domestic product from 15 percent to 27 percent over the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Russia's trade relations with the European Union
(EU), Chernomyrdin threatened to impose retaliative quotas on
textiles and other imports from the EU unless it lifts similar
restrictions on Russia.
</P>
<P>
The EU posted 44 billion U.S. dollars worth of trade with
Russia last year, which accounted for 40 percent of Moscow's total
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Russia is losing about 250 million dollars in export revenues
annually due to the EU limits on Russian exports, the ITAR-TASS
news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meet Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today China and Japan should make concerted efforts to ensure a
healthy and stable growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Morihoro
Hosokawa, Li said China pursues a good-neighborly policy, and
values the Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations are sound on the whole, Li noted. He
pointed out that there are still problems existing between the
two countries, such as how to properly deal with their history.
</P>
<P>
Li said Chinese leaders have from time to time referred to a
well-known Chinese saying to describe their relationship with the
Japanese: "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the
future."
</P>
<P>
This is not groundless, he pointed out, because there are
indeed some people in Japan, though not many, who insist on
believing in an inaccurate view of history and try to undermine
the Sino-Japanese ties by reversing the actual events surrounding
Japan's invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
Doing this not only meets with opposition from the Chinese
people, but also is unpopular at home, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the two countries will work together
to maintain a healthy and stable development of their relations by
strictly abide by all the principles guiding the two-way ties.
</P>
<P>
In regard to China's situation, Li said, the Chinese leadership
with Jiang Zemin as the core is consolidated and strong, and
successfully handles domestic and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said after the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland
on July 1, the Chinese people are working to greet the convention
of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party with
outstanding achievements in various undertakings.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will resolutely follow the road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics charted by Deng Xiaoping.
"We are confident of what we are doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among leaders of all previous Japanese governments and
Japanese statesmen, Li pointed out, Hosokawa is the one who made
an early and correct assessment of Japan's invasion of China.
This was praiseworthy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes Hosokawa will continue to work to step up the
development of the Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Hosokawa said he stated candidly during his last official visit
to China as prime minister three years ago that the invasion and
war waged by Japanese militarists brought great sufferings to the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed at the time that this declaration of his
position, which was then met with opposition, was correct, and he
said he has no regrets about saying it.
</P>
<P>
Hosokawa said he came to China with the belief in mind that it
is beneficial to developing the bilateral ties and educating the
future generations to think about and learn from an accurate
account of history.

<HEADLINE> Dam Project to Tame Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Xiaolongdi Dam Project will
control formerly disastrous annual flooding on the Yellow River,
known as the "Sorrow of the Chinese Nation".
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose dam project, located 40 km northwest of
Luoyang, an ancient city in central China's Henan Province, is
scheduled for completion in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The dam will guarantee the safety of 78 million people and 7.3
million ha of farmland in the lower reaches of the river where
raging flood waters often flow at rates as high as 40,000 cubic
meters per second.
</P>
<P>
According to a hydraulics expert with the Yellow River Water
Resources Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources, the
project will greatly enhance flood prevention efforts along the
river, and will raise the possibility of the worst flooding
expected every 60 years to one such flood every 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The project's key flood control status centers on its
geographical positioning at the end of the last gorge in the
middle reaches of the Yellow River which flows through nine
provinces and autonomous regions. Some 694,000 sq. km., or 92.3
percent, of the Yellow River drainage basin is upstream from the
Xiaolongdi Dam site.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the project, the largest of its kind on the Yellow
River, has a maximum storage capacity of 12.65 billion cubic
meters. In addition, the project has 5.1 billion cu. m. live
storage capacity for sedimentation control.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project has the capacity to adjust water flow
rates in different seasons to feed the Sanmen Gorge Reservoir some
130 km downstream, as well as the Luhun and Guxian reservoirs
located on a Yellow River tributary.
</P>
<P>
The dam project is expected to save an estimated 1.1 billion
yuan in flood control costs.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport to Be Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Relocation of Guangzhou's Baiyun
Airport has been given final clearance, as the project has
received approval from the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The new site for the airport -- to be called the Guangzhou
Baiyun International Airport -- is at the junction of
Guangzhou's Baiyun District and its suburban Huadu City. The
construction will begin within the year.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost about 20 billion yuan (about
2.4 billion US dollars). Both an expressway and an elevated
railway will be built to link the airport to the downtown area of
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Located 28 km from Guangzhou City proper and covering 16,000
ha, the new airport will be 1,270 ha larger than the present one.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be able to accommodate 80 million
passengers and 2.5 million tons of cargo annually. It will have
three runways -- one 4,000 m long and the other two 3,700 m long
each.
</P>
<P>
The floor space will be 280,000 sq m, ample for the terminal to
accommodate 10,000 passengers during peak hours. Upon completion
of first phase, including construction of two runways in 2005, the
new airport will be able to handle 27 million passengers and
740,000 tons of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders have pledged to go all out to streamline the
building of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is one of busiest air traffic hubs in China, with
Baiyun Airport handling 12.644 million passengers last year.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Not to Accept ASEAN's Interference, Says Hun sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen said today that his country acknowledged the role played
by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in achieving
peace and stability in Cambodia but will not accept ASEAN's
interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We accept ASEAN's role in realizing peace and stability in
Cambodia, but we do not accept its interference in our internal
affairs," Hun Sen told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian National Assembly and the royal government will
continue to handle internal affairs by respecting the constitution
and the King, Hun Sen added.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Hun Sen rejected ASEAN's mediation for a
solution to Cambodia's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
When asked about ASEAN's refusal to admit Cambodia as
scheduled, Hun Sen said, "We respect its decision. But our common
strategic goal is that ASEAN should have 10 members not nine."
</P>
<P>
Laos and Maynmar were admitted into ASEAN Wednesday at the
organization's ministerial meeting in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reiterated ASEAN's decision on July 10 to defer the
admission of Cambodia because of the conflicts between the
country's prime ministers in Phnom Penh in early July.

<HEADLINE> HK Sharemarket Closes All-time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The 33-member blue-chip index
added 292.03 points to end at 15,738.81 on Wednesday, surpassing
the previous record of 15,706.29 set last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This 1.89-percent rise, due to the influence from Wall Street's
 new record 154-point close and the soaring worth of Hong Kong's
financial and property shares, became the fifth record of its kind
 since Hong Kong's July 1 return to the motherland, experts here
believe.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street shares' high close came in reaction to comments by
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday night,
which were seen by investors as suggesting federal policy remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's testimony before the United States Congress praised
the overall state of the economy and implied that as growth had
slowed and inflation was still low, no changes in monetary policy
were envisaged in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said that his department had raised its forecast for
economic growth to between 3 and 3.25 percent for this year, up
from last year's 2.4 percent, and consumer price inflation was
seen at 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year, lower than last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bond yields retreated on the testimony, which came early
Wednesday morning, sending Wall Street to a new record close. It
ended 154 points higher at 8,061 and set the stage for Wednesday's
gains in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong trading opened strongly and quickly, with the Hang
Seng Index advancing to an intra-day high of 15,738.81 points. All
four sectors of the Hang Seng Index closed higher, with
rate-sensitive financials and properties leading the gains, after
three days of losses.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gainer was financial group HSBC. Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd, the largest property company in terms of market
capitalization, was the second-biggest index gainer. Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd and Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd also boosted the
index.

<HEADLINE> HK Residents Invited to Give Views on Constituency Delineation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has urged the public to give
their views on the delineation of the electorate for the nine new
functional constituencies and the seven designated groups of the
Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for submission is July 31, said a press release
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed lists of electorate for the nine new functional
constituencies and the seven designated groups of the Election
Committee are now published for public consultation," it quoted a
HKSAR government spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government's objective is that the first
legislative election should be "open, fair and honest." The new
legislative body is expected to be elected next summer.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier decision of the HKSAR government, nine
new functional constituencies -- covering sports, performing arts,
culture and publication, labor (one additional seat), import and
export, textiles and garment, wholesale and retail, information
technology, transport, agriculture and fisheries, and insurance --
will be introduced for the first HKSAR Legislative Council
Election.
</P>
<P>
As for the Election Committee, it will be made up of 800
members from four different sectors, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the relevant functional constituencies and
designated organizations, members of the committee will also
compromise representatives from seven other groups such as the
Hong Kong Chinese Enterprise Association, hotel, Chinese medicine,
higher education, catering, the Employers' Federation of Hong Kong
and religion.
</P>
<P>
"In delineating the electorate concerned, we have followed the
traditional concept and criteria for the delineation of functional
constituency electorate," the spokesman said, noting that "there
are also the concept and criteria used in delineating the
electorate for the 21 old functional constituencies."
</P>
<P>
In his words, the functional constituencies will be composed of
major organizations representative of the relevant sectors, and
particular groups or bodies should not be represented in more than
one functional constituency.

<HEADLINE> ICRC, WHO Call for Attention to TB in Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have
joined forces to focus world attention on tuberculosis (TB) in
prisons, the ICRC said in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TB experts from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia and representatives
from other agencies concerned had a meeting recently in Baku,
Azerbaijan. A declaration issued at the end of the meeting
sponsored by the ICRC and WHO called on governments around the
world to take steps to improve health care for prisoners and
provide adequate treatment for those suffering from TB.
</P>
<P>
"Tuberculosis in prisons easily spreads into the community from
infectious prisoners and infectious prison staff," the declaration
pointed out. "If there is no response to our call for action,
incurable tuberculosis will increase deaths among prisoners and
their families, and prison staff and the community."
</P>
<P>
The declaration warned that the threat of TB was compounded by
two other factors, the spread of HIV in prisons, which increases
the risk of death from TB, and the development of drug-resistant,
often incurable forms of TB.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today vowed to carry on
its efforts to broker peace among the Afghan warring factions and
regretted the recent outbreak of fighting in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting will have no impact on our determination to
continue with the shuttle mission and we are determined to promote
the intra-Afghan peace process," Foreign Office spokesman Khalid
Saleem told a weekly press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of Pakistan's on-going shuttle diplomacy
was to bring protagonists within the negotiating range, and then
to convene an intra-Afghan dialogue the outcome of which can be
guaranteed by the countries bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Some progress has been made and the proposal of the formation
of a joint political commission to discuss future government in
Afghanistan "is emerging as a distinct possibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saleem stressed the need for taking confidence building
measures by the Afghan Taliban militia and their rival side to
pave the way for starting a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was closely coordinating its efforts with Iran and the
U.N. Special Mission on Afghanistan on the Afghan issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the Taliban and anti-Taliban forces
were engaged in fierce fighting north of Kabul. Forces loyal to
former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood, one of the most
powerful warlords opposing the Taliban, have recaptured the
strategic Bagram airbase, about 50 km north of Kabul, and are
closing in on the beleaguered Afghan capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian navy will start
manufacturing six multi-purpose destroyers in the near future,
Rear Admiral Abbas Mohtaj, a deputy commander, said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, the deputy commander
said planning and designing of the huge project have been
completed and production will start after the approval of the
command headquarters of the Iranian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that building of the six destroyers
will be part of a nationwide effort to confront the potential
military threat by the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
There were no details about those destroyers. Earlier reports
said the Iranian navy at present has three destroyers, five
frigates, three submarines and 10 fast patrol missile crafts.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking officer also called for more contacts between
the navy and research and scientific centers in order to improve
its military capability and combativeness.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian armed forces have been building up its military
prowess through establishment of missile and radar bases,
purchase of submarines and missile boats which have been deployed
off its northern coast in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
To better confront potential attacks by the U.S., Iran raised
its budget for the military by over 40 percent in the new fiscal
year starting March 21, 1991.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government has allocated 25 billion
rials (8.3 million U.S. dollars) on work to counter U.S.

<HEADLINE> Donors Pressure Serbs to Turn Over War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international donor
conference on Bosnia held here Wednesday warned the Serbs that they
might be denied aid because of their failure to hand over indicted
war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner responsible for relations
with Central and Eastern European Countries and chairman of the
conference, said that aid could not be justified to parties who
"oppose and frustrate" the goal of post-war reconciliation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which is leading the conference with the World Bank,
said that the Serbs must turn over the war-crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic before it resumed aid. The EU supplies nearly half of the
reconstruction aid to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton peace accord, the parties vowed to turn
over those indicted by the United Nations International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said that "it would be irresponsible to continue
spending public funds for reconstruction purposes" because of the
"overall political and economic influence" of the suspects. But he
added that humanitarian aid to Republika Srpska, as the Bosnian Serb
entity is known, would be continued.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs reportedly said in a statement Monday that they
did not have high expectations of help from the conference.
</P>
<P>
Governments and organizations Wednesday pledged around 1.1
billion U.S. dollars in aid. Sources said that the aid would be
used to support industry, repair infrastructure and fund projects
to get the local economy moving.

<P>
Foreign ministers of the four countries on Tuesday met first
with Guinean President Lansana Conte and then with ousted Sierra
Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who has been in Conakry
since fleeing his country following the coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the ministers briefed Kabbah on the
meeting they held last week in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, with the
delegation from Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>

Clashes in the country, where a cease-fire was agreed at last
week's meeting, have left more than 250 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, famine and epidemic of alarming proportions have
begun to threaten the country due to the isolation imposed by the
international community since the coup.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross, one of the few
humanitarian organizations still in the troubled country, has
expressed concern that food is becoming scare and unafordable,
while most hospitals have run out of drugs, with fuel for
vehicles fast running out.
</P>
<P>
For weeks, many businesses have remained closed as the
military junta which seized power by force continue to be
isolated by the world.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Sustain Dynamism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi today urged all members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to sustain the
grouping's dynamism in the 21st century through continued
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"As the ASEAN stands at the threshold of the 21st century, it
faces the daunting task of sustaining its dynamism and maintaining
its track record," Badawi, who is the current chairman of the
ASEAN Standing Committee, told the opening of the 30th ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting (AMM).
</P>
<P>
"We have done well so far, but success and prosperity often
breed complacency," he said. "Our task is made more difficult by
the more complex environment of the next millennium characterized
by the blossoming of the information age, globalization and
intensified regionalism."
</P>
<P>
However, Badawi declared that "With our 30 years of experience
and continued commitment to ASEAN cooperation, we can overcome any
challenge."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that when the organization, which was set
up in 1967, celebrates its 60th anniversary, every child in the
ASEAN region would have a school to go to and be able to read and
write; disease and hunger would become unknown; and the ASEAN
would no longer have any disputes over territories between them.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region has been among the fastest growing areas
economically in the world in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Badawi noted that the current AMM is being held "at a momentous
period in the history of the ASEAN," as both Laos and Myanmar are
now full-fledged members of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "before long Cambodia will take
its rightful place in our association, thus fulfilling the vision
of the ASEAN founding fathers to unite all the Southeast Asian
countries under one regional grouping."
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar officially joined ASEAN Wednesday and their
foreign ministers are participating in the AMM for the first time.
 The accession of Cambodia, which ASEAN had decided to grant
simultaneously with Laos and Myanmar, has been deferred because of
the factional fighting in that country.
</P>
<P>
However, Badawi said uniting all the Southeast Asian countries
under the ASEAN umbrella does not mean a political union.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN has been able to survive and progress all these
years because each member state has been free to develop
politically and economically according to its own national ethos,"
he said. "And perhaps the most important principle that has
governed intra-ASEAN relations has been that of non-interference
in one another's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this principle has stood the test of time and
has contributed to the harmony that prevails today.

<P>
YAOUNDE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Equatorial Guinean President
Obiang Nguema Mbasogo said his country would like to strengthen
economic and trade cooperation ties with China's Jilin province,
a report received here from Malabo said today.
</P>
<P>
President Obiang made the remarks in Bata city on Tuesday
while meeting members of the Chinese Jilin Economy and Trade
Delegation led by Quan Zhezhu, vice governor of Jilin province of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Obiang reviewed the pleasant visit to
Jilin province he once made in China and said he was very much
impressed by the hard working Jilin people and the great economic
achievements they made in the province which he said is worth of
learning by his people.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Quan Zhezhu said one of the major objectives of
his present visit to the country is to explore possibility to
enlarge the cooperation areas between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Both sides focused their discussions on the further
development of the Chinese forestry company in the country and
exchanged ideas on establishing motor repairing workshops in
Equatorial Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Jilin Economy and Trade Delegation arrived in
Malabo last Sunday at the invitation of the government of
Equatorial Guinea. It left central African country on July 23 for
their next stop in Niger.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- North China has experienced an
extended period of sweltering heat, with south China continuing to
enjoy cool days.
</P>
<P>
While south China's Guangdong Province has characteristically
recorded hot summer temperatures, Guangzhou recorded a temperature
reading of only 22.8 degrees centigrade on July 13. The city's
lowest summer temperature since 1951 was recorded following 12
consecutive days of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
North and northeast China, which in the past have experienced
much cooler summers than southern areas, remain in the grips of an
extended heat wave.
</P>
<P>
The 38.2 degree centigrade reading in Beijing on July 13
represented the highest summer temperature on record since
1972. Brisk sales of brand name air conditioners fueled by the
heat wave have created a shortage on the Beijing market.
</P>
<P>
The coastal Tianjin City recorded a July 13 temperature of 39.9
degrees centigrade and residents in the northeast city of Harbin,
nicknamed the "Ice City", are reeling under abnormally high
temperatures hovering between 35-36 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Guangdong meteorological Department attribute
to abnormal weather patterns to the appearance of "El Nino" in the
Pacific Ocean.

CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
lower today against the US currency.
</P>
<P>
The data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed
wages pressures had ebbed in the May quarter to mark the lowest
year-to-year rise in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
Some market participants think the Reserve Bank of Australia
could cut rates as early as tomorrow morning, when it announces
daily banking system details at 9.30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 73.48 US cents, down from
73.74 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
"The market believes it is a forgone conclusion that the rate
cut is going to happen, there is nothing standing in the way, it's
just a question of when," said National Australia Bank corporate
manager Derek Price.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar was at 85.08 from
84.99 against the Japanese yen and at 1.3302 from 1.3415 against

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Down As NAB Below Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A lower than expected third
quarter profit result from National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) and
another drop in the value of gold stocks led to general falls on
the local share market today.
</P>
<P>
"The market was affected by NAB's third quarter result which
was a little bit below expectations and that led to a fall in
banking stocks," Nevitts' broker Steve Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
NAB posted a third quarter net profit of 1.643 billion
Australian dollars (1.207 billion US dollars), a figure which sent
the company's share price tumbling 45 cents.
</P>
<P>
Other banks also lost ground with Commonwealth Bank down 20
cents, Westpac was down three cents while ANZ added seven
cents.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished down 7.0 points at 2,676.4.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 382.50 million shares traded worth
1.01 billion Australian dollars (742 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index ended down 3.7 points to 4,302.2,
while the all resources index fell 10.6 points to 1,409.4.
</P>
<P>
"The gold sector still dragged our market down and the
commodities and gold have really kept a hold on our market for a
while now," Reynolds and Co broker Peter Struk said.
</P>
<P>
The gold index tumbled more than 2.5 percent today to 1,259.2,
with gold bullion closing at 321.00 US dollars an ounce down from
323.85 previously.

<HEADLINE> Israel Bombards Guerrilla Targets in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces bombarded this
morning suspected guerrilla targets of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment came in an apparent retaliation for wounding an
Israeli soldier in the south Lebanon buffer zone earlier this
morning, security sources said, but they did not elaborate on
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces fired 155mm shells from 9:30 a.m. (0630
GMT) at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a ridge some 60
kilometers southeast of the Lebanese capital Beirut, which is
often used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a springboard to launch
attacks on the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops in the position of Gantara also swept its
vicinities with heavy machineguns, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia shelled this morning the Lebanese army unit
clearing land mines on the road near the Kfar Falous crossing 15
kilometers east of the south Lebanese port city of Saida.
</P>
<P>
It was the first attack targeting the unit since the
commander of the SLA militia, Antoine Lahd, gave his assurance
last week that he would allow the reopening of the crossing
between Saida and the occupied Christian-town of Jezzine on the
north border of the buffer enclave.
</P>
<P>
After a period of calm following last week's surge of
violence in the south, the conflict began to pick up again
Wednesday with two roadside bombs, one against an Israeli patrol
and another a SLA patrol, in the border strip.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the South Radio, organ of the SLA, confirmed
this morning that four of its militiamen were wounded in the
operations, for which Hezbollah claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon in
a bid to oust the Israeli occupation forces out of the Lebanese
land.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Congestion Surcharge Imposed at Chittagong Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Feeder vessel operators at
Bangladesh's largest port Chittagong have decided to impose a
congestion surcharge on containers beginning from August 15, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Feeder Trade Committee (CFTC), a Singapore-based
organization of feeder vessel operators, has decided to impose
congestion surcharge at the rate of 150 U.S. dollars on 20 feet
containers and 300 dollars on 40 feet containers, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
But the decision was opposed by Chittagong Port
Authorities(CPA), which said the practice would cause another set
back for Bangladesh's maritime trade.
</P>
<P>
The CPA is expected to send a delegation to Singapore next
month and request the CFTC to withdraw its decision, port sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's leading trade bodies have also expressed deep
concern at the CFTC decision, saying it would seriously affect the
trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by those trade bodies said that the
proposed surcharge would put some major foreign currency earners,
such as garment and frozen food industry, in a most incompetitive
position.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Chittagong was facing problems of "frequent
work-stoppages and go-slows by port workers due to political
instigation, outdated container handling equipment and lack of
adequate container space".
</P>
<P>
The trade union leaders called upon the government to take
measures to improve port services to reassure feeder vessel
operators, port users and private firms.
</P>
<P>
The congestion surcharge was proposed not long after Chittagong
suffered a serious vessel jam earlier this month following a port
workers' strike.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based feeder operators had imposed congestion
surcharges off and on from 1992 as a result of shortage of
container handling equipment and space in container yards and
unusual strikes.
</P>
<P>
The CFTC's latest congestion surcharge was in September 1995,
but was lifted on July 1, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sets up New Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has decided to
set up a new free trade zone (FTZ) in the southern port city of
Bushehr, according to a local daily here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam reported that the Supreme Council
on Industrial-Commercial Free Trade Zones, headed by President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, decided to turn Bushehr into a FTZ.
</P>
<P>
But the decision has to win approval of the Parliament before
it is officially turning into a free trade zone in accordance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
Bushehr FTZ will be established with the help from
Bushehr's General Governorate Office and the Shipping and Ports
Organization, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Bushehr will be Iran's sixth FTZ. It will have an advantage
over other Iranian FTZs because it is connected to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Another Iranian FTZ called Chabahar at the coast of sea of Oman
is also connected to the mainland but does not have the vast
port facilities of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the FTZs are either situated in inner lands such
as Sarakhs in northeastern Iran or Sirjan in south-central Iran,
or they are islands in the Persian Gulf such as Qeshm and
Kish.
</P>
<P>
Bushehr port city has historically been used for import and
export. It is at equi-distance from such countries as Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain in the southern shores of
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The report by Salam indicated that Bushehr is well equipped to
be a FTZ because "it enjoys port facilities, infrastructural
networks such as good roads, industrial township and such
amenities as water and electricity."
</P>
<P>
Strategically located at the northern coast of the Persian
Gulf, Bushehr is also home to a large contingent of Iran's naval
forces. The port city has become internationally known in recent
years for its controversial nuclear power plant which is being
constructed there with the help of Russian experts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have alleged that Iran is seeking to use the
atomic plant for military purposes. Israel has threatened to
stage preemptive air raid against the nuclear facility before
it goes on stream.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Lawyers Sue Netanyahu for Desecration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- In a professional way to vent their
anger and frustration, three Egyptian lawyers are suing Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu for his part in the recent desecration of
Islamic and Christian symbols by Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The trio, two Muslims and a Christian, have filed lawsuits
against Netanyahu, holding him responsible for drawings that
insult the Prophet Mohamed and the Virgin Mary, the Al Ahram
weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
They believe the "desecration of Islamic and Christian symbols
is part of a broader policy set by Netanyahu and other hardliners."
</P>
<P>
Even if they win, there is no way the Egyptian courts' ruling
can be enforced in Israel, not to mention that the case is of only
moral value. But it is a legal and peaceful way to express their
hurt feelings, according to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Ashoub is demanding a compensation of 10 billion
U.S. dollars to be spent on building mosques and churches and
helping the families of Palestinians died in the 1987-1993
Intifada (Popular Uprising).
</P>
<P>
Mamdouh Nakhla is requesting 1 million Egyptian pounds (some
294,000 U.S. dollars) but has not decided how to use it.
</P>
<P>
Violence has been raging across the West Bank since late June
when an Israeli woman put up in Hebron offensive posters depicting
Mohamed as a pig writing the Koran, the Islamic holy book. Only a
couple days later, a picture of Virgin Mary painted with the head
of a cow appeared in an Israeli magazine.
</P>
<P>
The three lawyers base their suits on Article 163 of the
Egyptian Civil Code, which stipulates that anyone who causes harm
to any other must pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
They argue that the acts of desecration have inflicted
"definite harm" to both Muslims and Christians and that they stand
to win.
</P>
<P>
Although it appears certain they cannot get the reparation, at
least it would teach the Israelis a lesson that the Arabs should
not be taken lightly, said Nakhla.

-- France will withdraw its 1,400 troops stationed in the Central
African Republic in an overall remoulding of its African strategy.
French Defense Minister Alain Richard will visit Gabon, Chad and
Central African Republic next week to inform the leaders of these
countries about the new African policy of France. France will keep
its 550 soldiers in Gabon and 550 others in Chad.

-- Some Canadian World War II veterans, most of them
French-speaking but firm federalists, clashed with Quebec
separatists on Wednesday in Quebec during an inauguration ceremony
of a statue of Charles de Gaulle. The ceremony was organized by the
separatists on the 30th anniversary of the visit by the late French
president to Quebec, during which de Gaulle shouted ``Vive le Quebec

<P>
-- Tens of thousands of paperless immigrants are queuing at
prefectural offices across France to apply for regularization of
their residence status, as the Socialist government has set November
1 as the final date to re-examine residence situation of paperless
immigrants. Meanwhile, the government is continuing to implement the
policy of expelling illegal immigrants which was adopted by the
former government.
</P>
<P>
-- In the trans-Atlantic arms-wrestling for whether to open or
not U.S. air market, Europe held out well as the Boeing Co. agreed
to scrap its 20-year exclusive contracts on plane sales with three
U.S. air companies in exchange for European agreement to its merger
with the McDonnell Douglas Corp.. France remained the most reluctant
to accept the deal, and the Airbus Consortium regretted the
``somewhat arrogant attitude'' of Americans during the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> New Right-Wing Group Founded in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Some Israeli extremists have
founded a new right-wing organization called Mahane Yisrael
(Israel Camp), The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The organization's aim is to "destroy myths and restore
honesty in Israeli society", according to founders of the
organization, whose establishment was declared Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Leading extremist Avigdor Eskin, who was among the founders,
said that one of the myths he planned to attack was that of
"Rabin, the holy one," referring to the former Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin who was murdered on November 4, 1995 by an
extremist Jew.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Rabin was not at all clear-handed during his
highly decorated career, and he called for a retrial of Rabin's
murder Yigal Amir, who is now serving life sentence in prison.
</P>
<P>
Jewish extremism has gained increasing ground among Israeli
society in recent years, especially since the previous Labor
government led by Rabin began the peace process with the
Palestinians and Arab countries based on the principle of
"land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
The extremist campaign against relinquishing the land of
Greater Israel culminated in the murder of Rabin, who was
apparently the victim of the extremist right-wing incitement
against the peacemaker. Amir claimed he murdered Rabin in order
to kill the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The latest example of Jewish extremism was the pasting of an
anti-Islamic leaflet in late June in the West Bank city Hebron,
which depicted the Islamic prophet Mohammed as a pig.
</P>
<P>
The leaflets were pasted in Palestinian store fronts in Hebron
by Tatiana Susskind, an extremist Jewish woman from Jerusalem
who is associated with the outlawed rightist Kach Movement.
</P>
<P>
The offensive leaflets triggered a new round of violence
between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, leading to hundreds
wounded and fueling the already tense situation caused by the
stalemate in the peace process since Israel broke ground
for a new Jewish settlement in March.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Diamond Giant Expects More Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's diamond mining
company Debswana expects to continue improving its profit in the
years ahead, largely as a result of its expansion project at the
Orapa mine, said the company's annual report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Orapa mine, expected to be completed by 2000, will double
its production from six million carats to 12 million by the
beginning of the next century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Debswana's 1996/97 profit, announced earlier this year, surged
from three billion Pula (866 million U.S. dollars) to a record
5.2 billion Pula (1.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The diamond industry has been Botswana's economic backbone
since the early 1970s, contributing to one third of the GDP --
and its latest performance was the best to date.
</P>
<P>
The good performance was widely attributed to the continuing
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Botswana currency,
the Pula, and to the increase in carats produced and sold and
higher prices paid per carat sold, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The review also said the higher profits realized during the
past year were due to increased diamond production which resulted
from the impact being felt from the introduction of additional
plant treatment capacity at Jwaneng mine.
</P>
<P>
Jwaneng is 201 kilometers Southwest of Gaborone, the capital of
Botswana.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's De Beers Steps Up Diamond Prospecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's diamond giant
De Beers is making efforts to prospect diamond mine in
northeastern Angola, a company official said early this week.
</P>
<P>
De Beers had surveyed an area of 4,000 square kilometers in
the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul last year, and hoped
to look at a larger area this year, said the official who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ready to start drilling yet, but are locating
possible targets from our aerial surveys," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government awarded De Beers the rights last year
to prospect an area of about 20,000 square kilometers in the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, De Beers signed an agreement with its Angolan
counterpart Endiama to build a 30-million U.S. Dollar sorting
house in Luanda for Angolan diamond production.
</P>
<P>
Angola, believe to have the third most valuable diamond mining
resources in the world, produces an estimated two million carats
of diamonds each year.

<HEADLINE> Construction of First Power Station on Hongshui River in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The first generating unit at the
Tianshengqiao Hydro-Electric Power Station is scheduled to go on
line in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The station is the first of the 10 lock-and-dam hydro-electric
power stations scheduled for construction on the Hongshui River,
which flows from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in southwest China
through the northwestern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The head engineer said the station's dam will rise 178 meters
in height, and the reservoir will have a holding capacity of 10.2
billion cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Power Industry, Guangdong and Guizhou
provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are jointly
financing the project which will be completed at an estimated cost
of 8.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the station's four generators will have a total
generating capacity of 1.2 million kw and will generate 5.2
billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
According to the engineer, the 115-meter completed section of
the dam has the capacity to combat major flooding expected to
occur only once in 300 years. He also noted the reservoir will
begin storing this year's flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The first and second lock-and-dam stations are expected to be
completed by the year 2000, and they will have a combined
generating capacity of 2.52 million kw, costing about 20 billion
yuan, including 63.4 billion Japanese yuan.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has proposed an immediate review of his ruling
party's 1995 Election Manifesto to short list objectives which
can be achieved before the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, opening the Revolutionary
Party's (CCM) ordinary National Executive Committee (NEC) session
here on Wednesday, Mkapa said he has realized that the manifesto
was overloaded with promises which could not be fulfilled due to
lack of money.
</P>
<P>
"Our new manifesto must remain with development projects which
we are sure beyond doubt we will implement in the remaining three
years before the next elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa added, "otherwise, we are free to remain with the
current manifesto and wait to be judged by our voters for
embracing many things but with no tangible results."
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is a vast country which needs a lot of
resources for recurrent expenditure and for servicing core social
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Women Protest Massive Sack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 women yesterday took to
the street in Kaduna City in northern Nigeria, to protest the
massive sack of their husbands by the Kaduna State government.
</P>
<P>
The protesters delivered a letter to the Nigerian head of
state, General Sani Abacha, through the General Officer
Commanding the First Mechanized Infantry Division, Major General
Abdullahi Mukhtar.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the letter appeals to General
Abacha over the plight of the sacked workers and their entire
families as a result of the "draconian and high-handedness" of
the state administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Hameed Ali.
</P>
<P>
The massive sack has led to the total closure of all public
schools which has forced their children to stay home. Hospitals
have also closed while patients are dying daily, the women said
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
About 34,000 civil servants in the Kaduna State went on strike
on June 16, demanding the payment of increased salaries and
allowances promised by the government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As the strike continued, the state administrator ordered the
dismissal of all striking workers in early July.

<HEADLINE> hke072431 - Philippine Rebels Firm on Peace-talk Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Muslim rebels would not
give up the conditions it set earlier for resuming peace
negotiations with the government despite the signing of a general
ceasefire agreement last week, a rebel leader said today.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, vice-chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying
that the MILF has not changed its position on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Murad said that the MILF-government talks last Friday was not a
negotiation but rather an "exploratory" meeting which eventually
led to the signing of a general truce covering the entire
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said many MILF members were surprised on the signing of the
agreement because they did not expect it.
</P>
<P>
But Murad said the MILF was not pressured to sign the agreement
and the MILF's position was not compromised in the truce.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has set four conditions for restarting the stalled
peace talks with the government, including the return of displaced
residents to their respective villages and the pull-out of
government troops from the MILF-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
The MILF frozen the peace talks with the government after its
second biggest camp in central Mindanao was overrun by the
military late last month.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began low-level peace talks this
January, but the on-and-off talks have so far failed to achieve
any significant progress.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which forged a peace deal with the
government last year.

<HEADLINE> HK's Return Offers Opportunities for Shenzhen: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to the
motherland provides unprecedented opportunities for the
development of Shenzhen, the city's mayor Li Zibin told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that Hong Kong is a major financial, trading,
shipping, information and tourism center. After its return, both
the central government and Hong Kong's regional government will be
engaged in retaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
"Being a neighbor of Hong Kong, Shenzhen can benefit from the
radiating force of Hong Kong's new economic expansion," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two are expected to become complementary in terms of space
for economic expansion, and the cost of products, new technology
and resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong enjoys a mature market economy, which to great extent
symbolizes the practice of economic management worldwide. In this
sense, Shenzhen can boldly learn from Hong Kong in its economic
restructuring so as to retain its role as an experimental pioneer
in China, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that tremendous achievements across the
country, especially in Shanghai, the Pearl River Delta and the
southern part of Jiangxi Province, have posed great challenges to
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"Facing the opportunities and challenges, we feel that it is
even more urgent to retain Shenzhen's role as a special economic
zone in pushing forward economic restructuring," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists on U.S., Africa Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Political scientists from Africa
and the U.S. met here on Wednesday for a forum aimed at coming up
with a blueprint that will guide relations between the continent
and the U.S. beyond the year 2000, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The four-hour colloquium, sponsored by the African Association
of Political Science (AAPS) and the U.S.-based National Summit on
Africa (NSA) was held on the sidelines of the fourth
African-African American summit which began on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Attended by about 100 delegates, the forum examined ways to
build a strong, cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship
to advance the African agenda of sustainable development, human
rights, democracy, peace and security.
</P>
<P>
NSA Executive Director Macarthur Deshazer told participants
that the summit would mobilize people in the U.S. through a
vibrant policy dialogue which would lead to a new agenda for
U.S./Africa relations.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the NSA' Africa policy initiative, Deshazer said
while this would build upon past efforts to raise awareness on
Africa, it would completely revamp public discourse on U.S.
interaction with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nzongola-Ntalala, a professor of African studies at the Howard
University in the U.S., said with greater economic self-reliance
and integration and through a mutually beneficial cooperation
with the U.S. and other developed economies, Africans should be
able to improve their lot and thus shape their own political and
economic destiny.
</P>
<P>
Dani Nabudere, a Ugandan academic, urged the U.S. and other
developed countries to help in strengthening rural communities in
Africa as a way of fighting under-development and promoting
socio-economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seizes More Fake Bank notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The face value of fake bank notes
of the Thai currency seized last year was as much as 11.28 million
baht (451,000 US dollars), a 656 percent increase over 1995, a
Thai central bank official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of this year, about 13,700 fake notes,
face-valued at 8.7 million baht (341,000 US dollars), were seized,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Fake notes mostly come from near the border, where they were
traded underground, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Fake notes are often used in the drug trade, or by unscrupulous
employers to pay illegal immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is calling for registration of imported color
photocopying machines for tracing the source of counterfeited bank
notes and for amending laws on penalizing counterfeiting.

LUSAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malawi President Bakili Muluzi has
asked Director of Public Prosecutions Kamudoni Nyasulu to
consider dropping all criminal charges against former president
Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his decision at State House in Zomba, Muluzi said
he has reached the decision in the hope of advancing the spirit
of reconciliation among the people of Malawi, the Post newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zambian newspaper, Muluzi reiterated that
his fight for democracy is never a fight against Banda, but a
fight against a system of government which denied and deprived
the Malawi people of their fundamental human rights and dignity.
</P>
<P>
Banda ruled the country ever since its independence 1964 until
1994, when he was defeated in elections by Muluzi.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, is making an effort to develop a co-operative
economy based on public ownership.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Chen Liangyu, speaking at a recent meeting on
economic affairs, cited the Shanghai Huasheng Chemical Company as
an example of this. He pointed out that it started with three
jars, nine workers and 2,000 yuan in 1982, but now has 1.5 billion
yuan in annual sales and is the country's largest paint producer,
with a 4,000-fold increase in profits and a 3,000-fold increase in
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
The company's general manager Li Longming attributes this to
the co-operative system, in which the State takes no
responsibility for the enterprise, and the enterprise offers no
lifetime guarantee for its employees, and everything is done
according to market practices.
</P>
<P>
The company has the right to decide its internal arrangements,
to raise money on its own, and to follow its own path in market
competition.
</P>
<P>
The vice-mayor said that other businesses should learn from
Huasheng in improving the state sector and collective enterprises,
and traditional management systems.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Halts Controversial Official Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ordered the suspension of work on a luxury
official residential complex for the head of state, a government
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told a news briefing that
the president, now on a private visit abroad, called Wednesday
night to order the halt of the work at Sri Jayawardhanapura Kotte.
</P>
<P>
Her order follows criticism and protests against establishing
the complex at a cost of 125 million rupees (about 2.12 million
U.S. dollars) on a 50-acre block of land which would displace over
50 families residing in the area.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to shift the official residence of the head of
state to a location outside Colombo was aimed at reducing the
economic disruption and inconvenience caused by the closure of
roads and other interruptions necessitated by the maintenance of
high security areas in Colombo, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was part of a scheme of the previous government to
establish Colombo as the commercial capital and Sri
Jayawardhanapura Kotte as the administrative capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the president had decided not to go ahead with
the construction of the official residential complex until she
returns from abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- An elderly Shanghai man who
had suffered from xerophthalmia for 20 years recently regained
his vision following the successful transplantation of an
"artificial tear duct".
</P>
<P>
"Xerophthalmia" is a type of inflammation caused by serious
trachoma, chemical burns, drug allergies and various other
illnesses. Difficulty in secreting tears eventually causes
either partial or total blindness.
</P>
<P>
The new device represents the culmination of years clinical
research conducted by Professor Zheng Yiren from Shanghai Railway
Central Hospital, a subsidiary unit of Shanghai Railway University.
</P>
<P>
The transplantation procedure requires only 30 minutes, and
the absence of antigen reactions enables patients to regain their
vision within one week.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the new method, which is much more effective than
traditional treatments, will benefit thousands of people suffering
from xerophthalmia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Councils Urged to Help Small Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's councils have been urged
to provide small entrepreneurs of the country with land to enable
them to expand their businesses and employ more people, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Mudenda, economist from the Economic Association of
Zambia Public Relations, said providing land to the small scale
entrepreneurs will help them increase their volume of businesses
and thus employ more job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as saying on Wednesday that
the councils should also fence the areas provided and that the
local authorities could charge rates or rentals, thereby earning
themselves money they badly need.
</P>
<P>
Many small entrepreneurs like those owning carpentry shops and
operating in markets, fail to expand their businesses because
they do not have enough of land, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the small businesses grow, street kids and professionals
being retrenched could find other employment opportunities to
reduce poverty, said the economist.

<HEADLINE> Waste Piles up in Beirut, So Does An Enviro-Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Travelers entering Beirut from
the airport have to tolerate stinking smells from now on as the
Lebanese government failed to allot a piece of land to dump
garbage piling up in the capital's suburbs at an average of 600
tonnes a day.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for a quick solution to the waste problem were dashed
when the cabinet, in a regular meeting Wednesday night, did not
find a new dump to replace an old one in the north suburb and
another in the south suburb, which were forced to be closed
following protests of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Environment Minister Akram
Chuhayyeb agreed to keep searching for substitutes for both Bourj
Hammoud dump, which was shut down last Saturday, and the Amrousieh
sorting plant and incinerator, which was crippled by arsonists
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
This was announced only hours after Chuhayyeb, emerging from a
meeting with House Speaker Nabih Berri, promised that the
five-day-old problem would be solved in the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday morning that
the environment minister had sought Berri's help to bring the
southern suburbs' residents to agree to the opening of at least
the sorting plant in Amrousieh.
</P>
<P>
However, Chuhayyeb was surprised to hear Berri voicing full
backing to the residents, who are mainly his supporters. The
development added political connotations to the already complex
problem, the only English daily in Lebanon noted.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not that garbage is piling up in the south and
north suburbs. The main problem we are facing is where to take
that garbage and how to get rid of it in an environmentally
acceptable way," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his ministry was utterly opposed to the idea
of dumping the waste into the sea as part of land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
"Berri is sympathetic to the people's feeling and demands. He
is against having the incinerator near the residential area,"
Chuhayyeb added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an environmental organization warned of a
deteriorating situation resulting from garbage which began piling
up in the streets of Beirut's north suburb after the closure of
the Bourj Hammoud dump.
</P>
<P>
The committee for protecting the environment on the coast
called on the government to put into an overall plan for
protecting the environment against pollution.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Describes Netanyayu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
has brushed off Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for
immediate talks on staging the final-status talks, reported the
pro-government newspaper, The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, senior member of the Palestinian Negotiating
team, told reporters Wednesday night that Netanyahu's proposal is
nothing, but a "trick," designed to enable Israel to retain
the areas occupied 30 years ago in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Palestinians still insist in adhering
to the Oslo agreement, under which the Palestinians will
eventually get back more than 90 percent of the occupied
territories in the West Bank. But, according to leaked details
of Netanyahu's favorite "Alon Plus Plan," Israel would only
hand over some 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's upbeat
evaluation of the peace process after meeting Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat in Brussels Tuesday, the Palestinian
negotiator expressed doubt about Levy's sincerity in promising to
reconvene the nine committees and resolve such outstanding issues
as prisoner release, safe passage between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian air port and sea port.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli ministers while in international capitals say they are
with the agreement and want to implement it," Asfour said.
"But here they say they are against the agreement and this
is why I doubt what Levy said."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also refuted Levy's remarks, saying: "Nothing was
achieved (with Levy) yesterday." But Levy said: "We have every
reason to be optimistic. We have taken a step forward."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader told reporters in Brussels Wednesday
that "I am looking to achieve something concrete. We are not
asking for the moon."
</P>
<P>
Asfour declared: "There is no room for anything as long
as the land is being confiscated and the file of settlement
activity in the West Bank and Gaza is open."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Resumes Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has signed
two production-sharing contracts with a Canadian company to
resume tapping oil in the country, "Kenya Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year contracts, the Canadian company Tornado
Resources expects to spend more than 35 million U.S. Dollars in
exploration covering 42,888 square kilometers in Mandera and
Kilifi districts in northeastern and eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Kenyan Energy Minister Kirugi
M'Mukindia said yesterday that Kenya currently spent over 30
percent of her foreign exchange earnings on the import of
petroleum and that any commercial oil or gas discovery would
boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Available data indicated that more than one third of Kenya's
surface area had potential for hydro-carbon exploration, noted
the minister, who tried to encourage other companies to invest in
Kenya's oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
Exploration for oil in Kenya had almost ceased since 1992 when
the World Bank credit expired, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has so far drilled 30 oil exploration wells, 80 to 90
percent of which had not yielded commercial oil, disclosed the
minister, urging the Canadian company to drill more wells so as
to enhance their chances of success.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Turns More Enterprises Into Joint-Stock Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- This Chinese capital has made
considerable progress in turning its state-owned enterprises into
joint-stock ventures so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the number of joint-stock
enterprises in Beijing rose by 20.5 percent in the first half of
this year to 33,380, with the combined registered capital up 13.7
percent on a yearly basis to more than 63.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Direct financing for Beijing firms was on a large scale in the
first half of the year. Between January and June five enterprises
issued A shares -- issued at home and restricted to domestic
investors only -- raising funds valued at more than 1.95 billion
yuan. One company issued B shares -- issued in China but reserved
for overseas investors -- pooling funds worth 327 million Hong
Kong dollars. Another firm raised 1.8 billion Hong Kong dollars
through floating shares in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a number of promising companies formed the
Beijing Holding Corporation, which was listed in Hong Kong,
raising 2.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in total in the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May 3,575 companies had been standardized and
re-registered, about 88.1 percent of all firms whose operations
needed to be straightened out.
</P>
<P>
Municipal official Gao Zuozhi said that Beijing will make
greater efforts to accelerate the pace of transforming large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises into joint-stock firms in the
remaining months of this year.

GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Extensive health care efforts on
the part of Guangzhou, a major city in south China, have led to
considerable declines in the incidence and mortality rates for
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Results of a recent survey indicate that incidence rates for
major contagious diseases have dropped to 0.27 percent, with the
mortality rate standing at only 0.003 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Investigations in the city mirror western studies listing the
four main killers as malignant tumors, respiratory tract and
cerebrovascular diseases, and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
The eradication of plague and smallpox has enabled the city
government to focus its attention of childhood diseases. The fact
that some 98 percent of the city's children have received
inoculations has led to a 99 percent reduction in the incidence
rate for diseases such as measles, polio and encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
The city has also adopted a series of regulations governing
management of the food industry and pharmaceuticals manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 survey showed that the city was home to 56 medical
institutions per 1,000 people. Doctors and nurses currently
promote medical awareness in villages, with related efforts
yielding greatly improved supplies of potable water and improved
public toilet facilities in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Black Wednesday for Thailand's Finance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Dealers call Wednesday "Black
Wednesday" for Thailand's finance sector as most economic news in
the country was horrible.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency Baht sank to its lowest point in history,
32.5 to the U.S. dollar, compared to the reference rate of 30.842
to the dollar given by the Central Bank for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank intervened in the afternoon when the baht had
weakened to 32.4 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Trading volume was very small all day, with much of the slide
in the Baht attributed to strong demand for dollars in the local
market.
</P>
<P>
The fall in commercial banks' half-year profits has also caused
short-term negative sentiment in the value of the Baht.
</P>
<P>
Local financial observers said that the current situation
raised questions on the ability of the Central Bank to control the
Baht's slide and whether the government should borrow overseas
funds to supplement foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
With the Baht depreciating by 2-3 percent per day and no signal
indicating at what level the exchange rates might stabilize, the
observers feared that the situation might get out of control.
</P>
<P>
At the stock market, continuing pessimism about the economy
sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index plunging by 28.50
points, or 4.32 percent, to close at 631.28 points on Wednesday,
hitting hard the banking, finance and communication sectors
especially.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that there were two main factors affecting the
market. The first, it is concerned that the Baht might fall to 40
against the U.S. dollar. The second, the Thai Farmers' Bank, the
third largest bank in the country, raised its minimum lending rate
(MLR) by 100 basis points to 13.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Somprasong Land P.L.C., a leading Bangkok
property developer, was declared formally in default of 80 million
dollars in convertible bonds, becoming the first Thai company to
default on its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The formal default came after Somprasong missed its scheduled
interest payment of 3.1 million U.S. dollars on the debt on
February 5.
</P>
<P>
Along with scores of other developers, Somprasong became a
victim of a three-year slump in the Bangkok property market caused
by overbuilding, high interest rates and an economic slowdown in
the country beginning last year.
</P>
<P>
The frenetic construction boom beginning in the mid-1980s has
transformed the city's skyline and also left much office space and
many high-rise condominiums unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the banks were saddled with hundreds of billions
of Baht in non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter half of last year, Somprasong had been
involved in fraud scandal and Prasong Panichapakdee, founder of
the company, surrendered to police on fraud allegations against
him.
</P>
<P>
Somprasong shares, which traded at as high as 300 Baht in late
1993, were halted in October at a price of 7.6 Baht.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the bad news indicated the ebbing investor
confidence in the government's policy to revamp the ailing
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem now is the lack of clear policies by the
government in dealing with exchange rate, interest rates and
two-tier money market, according to Chatchai Parasuk, first vice
president for national finance and securities.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bank to be Split into Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of
Commerce (NBC) of Tanzania will be split into two, with the Trade
and Regional Bank for middle and big customers and a Microfinance
Bank catering for rural and urban small customers.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here on Wednesday by the State House of
Tanzania said the decision was reached after a cabinet meeting,
chaired by President Benjamin Mkapa in Dodoma, central Tanzania
this week.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a three-bank structure earlier proposed by
the government, causing a lot of queries and suspicion, was found
to have less efficiency compared with the two-bank structure.
</P>
<P>
The two-bank structure was formulated by combining trade and
regional banks to get one Trade and Regional Bank which would
make more profit than running the two banks separately.
</P>
<P>
"Under this structure, expectations to secure loans from
donors will be higher," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said the government decided on the
two-bank structure option after considering its diversified
advantages including its ability to hasten economic growth by
using existing NBC branch network.
</P>
<P>
The structure would enable the Microfinance Bank to start
within a short time, using the existing network and also
minimizing the disturbance of shifting customers to appropriate
banks.
</P>
<P>
Under this structure, the Microfinance Bank would allow faster
collection of deposits from new shareholders and providing loans
to small customers more efficiently, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Island Province Improves Health Care in Rural Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to improved health care
facilities in the rural regions of southernmost China's Hainan
Province, life expectancy has risen to just over 73 years,
compared with the national average of 70.
</P>
<P>
Another indication of the island province's improved health
care is that the overall incidence of infectious diseases was
brought below the national average in 1996. The figure of 1987,
before the formal establishment of the province, was three times
the national average.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, provincial authorities have invested 118
million yuan in building 146,000 sq m of medical treatment and
health care facilities and training 5,385 medical personnel in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 72,000 farmers have joined a cooperative
medical service program, in which each participant pays 15 to 60
yuan each year to a medical service fund to cover their medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, a total of 6.05 million farmers, or 95.91 percent of
Hainan's rural population, benefited from a project to improve the
water supply in rural areas. This year, the provincial treasury
will appropriate 800,000 yuan in renovation of toilets in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
It is reported Hainan plans to build 80 rural hospitals over
the next few years.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
envoy to the fourth Africa-African American (AAA) summit Rodney
Slaver has implored African countries to unite in the light of
globalization of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gala at the summit venue in Harare last night,
Slaver said Africa is the land of opportunity which should be
able to lead the world into forging a global economy that
represents interests of all people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "President Clinton is pleased that we are having to
meet here with the spirit that represents and unites Americans
with the rest of Africa."
</P>
<P>
"It should be realized that Africa is a true land of
opportunity and should be our trading partner to lead the world
into this global economy that is emerging in the 21st century,"
said Slaver who is Transportation Secretary of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Commercial diplomacy, he said, and true friendship should be
the policy to guide African leaders and their American
counterparts into improving the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
Slaver praised the summit for fighting for the economic
development of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, he told Zimbabwean Minister of Transport and
Energy Simon Moyo that the U.S. government is interested and
ready to help in the development of the Southern African
Development Community's (SADC) transport sector.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Introduces Land Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEHEI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, east China, has
adopted measures to increase farmland by rearranging the layout of
villages and townships.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial construction department, land
planning introduced to 78 percent of the province's villages and
townships will increase farmland acreage by some 60,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The random distribution of housing in rural areas not only
occupied vast tracts of land, but also hinders efforts to improve
local infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Xiaogang Village, Fengyang County, straightened roads and was
able to reclaim 0.6 ha of the former four ha land coverage.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,320 of 2,000 villages in the county have introduced
reclamation programs, with related programs expected to increase
cultivatable land by as much as 860 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Xiaozhangzhuang, Yingshang County, has consolidated 11 scattered
villages into four new districts.
</P>
<P>
China is currently waging a nationwide campaign to halt the use
of cultivatable land for commercial purposes in order maximize the
use of limited land resources to feed its large population.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Stresses Importance of Economic Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING Jaya, Malaysia, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad today described economic strength as
"all-important," saying stability, economic strength and the
willingness to stay together will be the ASEAN's ultimate defense.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 30 ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting here, Mahathir called for dedication to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The threat faced by nations is economic sanctions to
impoverish the people and to stir internal strife," Mahathir said.
"We should therefore concentrate on economic development and the
well-being of our people."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with the admission of Laos and Myanmar as
the ASEAN's new members, Southeast Asian countries can cooperate
and help each other to prosper economically. "That way we will
become internally stable and less susceptible to the kind of
outside pressures our detractors like to apply."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to some Western countries' opposition to the
ASEAN's inclusion in its membership of Myanmar, which was accused
of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "Economic prosperity is really the answer to our
security problems because with prosperity the ASEAN will be taken
seriously and its views respected." "Prosperity is essential for
the avoidance of internal conflict."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the current currency crisis in some Southeast Asian
countries on "a well-planned effort to undermine the economies of
all the ASEAN countries by destabilizing their currencies."
</P>
<P>
"Our economic fundamentals are good yet anyone with a few
billion dollars can destroy all the progress that we have made,"
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also accused giant companies in the world of
swallowing up chunks of the business in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"They monopolize the services sector through their huge
shipping, airlines, insurance companies and banks. The media,
print and electronic, are now controlled by them throughout the
world," he charged. "We are denied press freedom by the many
people who trumpet press freedom. Only bad news about us is
published, the good news is often buried in their archives."
</P>
<P>
He called on the countries in Southeast Asia to stand together,
stressing that alone, none of the Southeast Asian countries will
be able to protect itself. "But nine ASEAN countries with half a
billion people may be able to do something to help ourselves."

<HEADLINE> Hungary Opens Consulate in Northwest Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 23 (Xinhua) -- In another sign of improving
relations between Hungary and Romania, a Hungarian consulate
general officially opened today in Cluj-Napoca in northwest
Romania.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the opening ceremony,
foreign ministers from both countries expressed satisfaction over
the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Severin described the good
relations between Hungary and Romania as a pillar of long-term
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
His Hungarian counterpart, Kovacs Laszlo, said the era of
mistrust and antagonism between the two nations had already ended.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs said that the new road taken by the two countries is not
only in the interests of the minorities living in each other's
countries, but also in the interests of European security.
</P>
<P>
The development of relations between Hungary and Romania over
the past seven to eight months has been faster than over the past
seven years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Romania and Hungary signed a historic friendship treaty in
September last year, paving way for reconciliation after a long
standing rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations were strained over a 1920 territorial
settlement which cut off some three fifths of Hungary's territory,
including Transylvania which was transferred to Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Cluj-Napoca area in Romania, which has a dominant ethnic
Hungarian population, has long been a thorn in the side of
relations between the two countries. In the early 1990s, ethnic
Hungarians launched a violent campaign to get the area returned
to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The former Hungarian consulate in the area was closed on
charges of anti-Romanian activities in 1988 after operating for
nine years.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Launches Campaign against Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has launched a program to
prevent and control tuberculosis (TB), which is affecting a
growing number of the country's population, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the program entitled "Tuberculosis and AIDS" on
Wednesday, Minister of State for Health Bharat Kumar Pradhan said
the government is determined to check the growing number of TB
patients in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, organized by the Nepal Anti-tuberculosis
Association, the traditional "Direct Observation Treatment" short
course (DOTs) will be maintained and door to door health services
will be provided, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 45,000 Nepalese are being
affected by TB every year and 16,500 of them die.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the TB patients in Nepal live in urban
areas, while the rest live in the mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
And 70 percent of the HIV-AIDS patients have been found
suffering from TB as well, a program report said.
</P>
<P>
The HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, weakens the immunity power
of the patients and cause them die of TB soon, it said.
</P>
<P>
Director of the National TB Center Dirgha Singh Bam disclosed
at the program that modern treatment centers will be set up in 30
places under the current fiscal year beginning July 15, providing
medical services to 12 percent of the TB patients.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the threat of TB is as it was 50 years ago as a
result of increasing urbanization, poverty and illiteracy.

<HEADLINE> Italy Opposes U.S. Proposals for U.N. Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian leaders today opposed
United States' proposals to reform the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Italy opposes any increase in the number of permanent council
members, fearing that it will make a small number of members in
the Security Council gain more privileges instead of reflecting
the current world situation," said a statement released after
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi met U.S. ambassador to the
U.N. Bill Richardson today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. proposed enlarging the 15-member Security
Council, the U.N. body concerned with international peace and
security, by adding five permanent members -- Germany, Japan and
three developing countries -- to the existing five permanent
members and 10 non-permanent members.
</P>
<P>
But Italy has suggested the U.N. set up between 10 and 20
semi-permanent seats which would be shared on a rotating basis by
some 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini echoed Prodi's comments
after meeting Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Dini, in a second statement, said that Italy believes
U.S. proposals for Security Council reform are not only
incompatible with democracy, but also helpful to a few countries
in winning privileges and harmful to Italy. He said the reforms
are a source of separation and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"Reforms of the top body of the U.N. should strictly comply with
democratic principles with wide representation," it added.
</P>
<P>
But both Italy and United States have previously agreed that
the U.N. must be more efficient to meet the demands of a new world
reality.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that proposals made by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week to streamline
organizations, improve efficiency and cut spending at the U.N. are
useful.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said today's meetings signaled that the U.S. and Italy
are far apart on U.N. reform proposals.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Official to Visit Iran for Talks on Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Additional Foreign
Secretary Iftikhar Murshid will visit Iran next Monday in a bid to
speed up the on-going shuttle diplomacy to resolve the Afghan
crisis, according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tehran, Murshid will discuss with Iranian
leaders the proposals of holding an intra-Afghan dialogue for a
broad-based government in Afghanistan, an official source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Murshid's tour is following a visit to Iran by an Afghan
anti-Taliban alliance leader Abdul Malik who held talks with
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati in Tehran recently,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Before going to Iran, Murshid will visit on Saturday
Mazar-e-Sharif, stronghold of the Afghan anti-Taliban alliance in
the north of the country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report quoted a diplomat as saying that
Murshid's shuttle diplomacy for peace in the Afghanistan is
heading towards nowhere.
</P>
<P>
This is because the warring factions are maintaining a rigid
position on the issue of release of prisoners and demilitarization
of Kabul, according to the diplomat.

JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Suharto held
talks last night with visiting Cambodian First Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh who was ousted two weeks ago by his rival
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, an Indonesian foreign ministry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held at President Suharto's residence in

he refused to give details of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cambodian embassy here said it had no

</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh also declined to comment when he returned to
his hotel last night about one hour after the meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh arrived at Jakarta airport at around 4 p.m.. The
visit was part of his trip to ASEAN (Southeast Asian Nations)
countries to win support after being ousted from his country

</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, has frozen
Cambodia's membership which should have gone ahead Wednesday at a

<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia have agreed
to expand their rapidly-developing trade and investment
cooperation during a two-day "constructive" meeting held here, a
senior Chinese official told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by senior Chinese and Australian economic

<HEADLINE> China Reports New Oil Finds in Northwest Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese petroleum geologists have
discovered a structure that is rich in oil and natural gas
reserves in Kala Yorgun on the northern Tarim Basin of the
Taklimakan Desert.
</P>
<P>
It is quite likely that high-yield oil and gasfields will be
found in the area, say experts, who explain that the geological
structure has different oil-bearing strata.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin has a 560,000-sq.km. area, with the central
part being the Taklimakan Desert. Over the past eight years,
exploration teams from across the country have worked here and
have found 27 large industrial oil-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
They have discovered ten oil and gasfields with combined oil
and gas reserves of 440 million tons, five of which have begun
producing. The oilfields produced 3.1 million tons of petroleum
last year.
</P>
<P>
A test gas well, Yudong No.2, was sunk in the region by the
Tarim Oil Exploration Headquarters this June and there were good
gas indications down to 5,350 m.
</P>
<P>
Tests done at the well indicated high-yield industrial gas,
proving that the area has plenty of oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Tarim Oil Exploration Headquarters told
reporters that Yudong No. 2 is the first high-yield gas well
discovered in the Tarim Basin this year and a 60-sq.km. area
around the test well has conditions favorable for oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the headquarters is gathering the best
workers to quickly determine oil reserves in Kala Yorgun and to
conduct further exploration in adjacent areas.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Thomas Enqvist cruised
into the quarter-finals of the 303,000 US dollars Infiniti Open by
rolling past American Vincent Spadea 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, second-seeded and eighth-ranked, is playing his first
tournament following a 12-week layoff after tearing a couple of
tendons in his left foot. The injury forced the 23-year-old Swede
to miss the summer session, including the French Open and
Wimbledon Championships.
</P>
<P>
But he showed no effects of the injury, easily reaching the
next round's clash against unseeded Dane Kenneth Carlsen, who
ousted Armenian Sargis Sargsian 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In night action, third seed Mark Philippoussis overcame another
slow start to power past fellow Australian Sandon Stolle 3-6, 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the day's lone upset, unseeded Frenchman Guillaume Raoux
beat fifth-seeded Patrick Rafter 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), dashing any hopes

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Olympic double champion Michael
Johnson will spearhead the American squad, together with six other
defending world champions, for the World Athletics Championships
to be started on August 1, the USA Track and Field said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, winner of the men's 200 and 400 meters in Atlanta,
will compete in the 400 meters at the 10-day championships in
Athens. Besides, he also will be a member of the U.S. men's
4x400-meter relay pool.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 world champion at 200 and 400 meters was given a
wild-card entry into the championships by the IAAF, the world
governing body for the sport, after he missed the U.S. trials
because of injury.
</P>
<P>
Other wild cards receivers include world champions Gail Devers,
Gwen Torrence, John Godina.
</P>
<P>
Devers, two-time women's 100-meter hurdles gold medalist, will
anchor the women's 4x100-meter relay team and Torrence will defend
her women's 100-meter title.
</P>
<P>
Godina, world champion in men's shot put, will compete in both
shot put and discus.
</P>
<P>
The American team also features new sprint stars Maurice Greene
and Marion Jones as well as 110-meter hurdler Allen Johnson,
400-meter hurdler Derrick Adkins and women's 400-meter hurdler Kin
Batten. The latter three won gold medals at the 1995 world

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- According to Michael Portoh,
chief-executive of Bayer (China) Limited, "Those who want to
occupy the Chinese market must first enter the capital city of
Beijing."
</P>
<P>
The output value of a joint pharmaceutical venture set up by
this German multinational giant and local investor is expected to
exceed 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) at year
end. Following that success, the German company has invested 1.25
million yuan in another joint venture in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Like Bayer, more overseas investors are viewing Beijing as an
important place to put their investment.
</P>
<P>
According to municipal government statistics, 279
multinationals and big foreign companies have put a total of 4.6
billion yuan in some 370 projects in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have been impressed by the Chinese capital,
which has many hi-tech companies, research and educational
institutions, skilled professionals, and a potential market.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Lu Yucheng, who is in charge of foreign
investment, told Xinhua that Beijing is improving its
infrastructure and laws and regulations to prepare for a new round
of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Lu says that Beijing is an economic and financial center and is
one of the cities listed by the central government for opening
their financial sector to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
It has also taken substantial steps to simplify procedures for
foreign investment and to crack down on illegal charges placed on
these firms.
</P>
<P>
And, the city's efforts to lure foreign investment have paid
off. Eighty international giants have moved their regional
headquarters to the city, while 12 foreign banks have opened
branches here.
</P>
<P>
As of May of this year, investors from 94 foreign countries and
regions have founded 12,939 solely foreign-funded firms and
Sino-foreign joint ventures with a total investment of 20.16
billion US dollars, according to official figures. Ninety percent
of these are in electronics, service, and food industries.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that foreign investors have had good
returns from their investment in Beijing, and, as a result, have
invested more in Beijing. In 1996 alone, foreign-funded firms here
added over 600 million US dollars in investment.

<HEADLINE> Albright on U.S. Goals at Coming ASEAN Regional Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES Angeles, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said here today the United States
supports new multilateral security dialogue forums such as the
ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
She said the Forum's growing importance reflects the fact that
security in the Asia-Pacific "is not a zero-sum game."
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her way to Malaysia to attend the annual meeting
of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional
Forum, was addressing a luncheon meeting of 1,000 people hosted by
the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and the Pacific Council.
</P>
<P>
Each Forum participant, including not only ASEAN members but
also the U.S., China, Russia, Japan, the European Union, India and
South Korea, she said, "has an interest in stability, in seeing
disputes resolved peacefully and in avoiding misunderstandings
that could lead to armed conflicts."
</P>
<P>
The United States has placed priority "on improving ties
throughout the Asia-Pacific", Albright said ahead of her third
trip to Asia in six months as Secretary of State. She said she
would discuss "a full range of issues" with her Asian counterparts
when she visits Kuala Lumpur and later Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about China, Albright said she is to
discuss a wide range of issues with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen in Kuala Lumpur. "What is very important to us is
developing a strategic relationship with China," she said, adding
that China will play a crucial role in many of the issues of the
21st century the United States cares about.
</P>
<P>
Turning to economic and trade issues, Albright said the United
States would encourage ASEAN to continue opening up markets and
liberalizing trade, and pressing for better enforcement of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
"I will also ask ASEAN to help reach a worldwide agreement this
year to liberalize financial services," she said.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the wide-spread warning of a future conflict between
East and West in terms of civilizations, cultures and values,
Albright said distinctions of national identity and culture should
not melt away in the context of globalization.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Consider Carefully on Cambodia's Entry: Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today that ASEAN would take serious
consideration of any request by Cambodia for its admission into
ASEAN when the group is satisfied with the credibility of the
process taking place there.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching the developments there and as soon as we are
satisfied and they (Cambodia) continue to wish to join ASEAN, we
will take serious consideration of that," he told reporters after
inaugurating the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian prime minister did not rule out any possibility
of Cambodia to be a member of ASEAN, adding that "its admission
may be possible this year."
</P>
<P>
On ASEAN's decision to defer Cambodia's entry which was
originally scheduled on July 23 along with Myanmar and Laos,
Mahathir said ASEAN did not accept the legitimacy of the process
in Cambodia in which its First Prime Minister Norodom Narariddh
was moved.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his view on the reaction of Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Wednesday on the ASEAN decision of not admitting
Cambodia as scheduled, Mahathir said that, it is ASEAN that
decides, not the one who wants to join. To be a member of ASEAN,
certain requirements must be met, he added.
</P>
<P>
On ASEAN's role on the Cambodian issue, he said if Cambodia
considers that ASEAN can do something, "we will see what we can do
for it."

and 2010. One, with a length of 700 km, will go from Fenshuiguan
of Fuding on the Fujian and Zhejiang borders and ending at
Fenshuiguan of Zhao'an on the Fujian-Guangdong border.
</P>
<P>
The other two will be the 420-km Fujian section of the
Beijing-Fuzhou Expressway and 120-km Zhangzhou-Longyan Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The province will also spend nine billion yuan on finishing the
Quanzhou-Xiamen, Xiamen-Zhangzhou, and Fuzhou-Quanzhou expressways
before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, workers have completed 92 percent
of the World Bank-financed Quanzhou-Xiamen Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The entire project will be finished in September and put into
trial use later this year. The Xiamen-Zhangzhou Expressway will be
finished simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Workers have been hard at work on the Fuzhou-Quanzhou
Expressway which is expected to be finished in September of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the province has built 3,768 km of
roads and has formed a transport network consisting of trunk
highways, as part of its "highway first" program.

<HEADLINE> China Brings Market Mechanism Into Water-Supply Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nowadays in some eastern cities
many local residents are relying on mineral water bought in the
market, owing to shortages of tap water in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the market system could turn water
resources into a commodity and reservoirs into enterprises," said
Zhang Mengjin, director of the Water Resources Department of
Zhejiang Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
Water supply has long been seen as a matter of social welfare
in China, with the government responsible for building reservoirs,
water plants and other water-supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Zhejiang has introduced a brand-new idea of
making reservoirs independent enterprises responsible for their
profits and losses. Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, has
highly appraised the idea.
</P>
<P>
To bring water use under the law of the market, the central
government has put the prices of water supplied by state-run
reservoirs under the national commodity pricing management system.
</P>
<P>
Water prices will be set by the Ministry of Water Resources
with due consideration to the prices of industrial, agricultural
and residential commodities.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has also drawn up plans to raise funds for
national and local water conservancy projects in an effort to
accelerate water conservancy construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the central government plans to turn
both water conservancy firms and hydropower suppliers into public
companies, and some of them will be listed on the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
These efforts are expected to help solve the problem of wasted
water and the lack of investment in water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
At present, among more than 32,000 water-supply enterprises in
China, 900 are share-holding ones. More than 300 billion
yuan-worth of state-owned assets and a total of one million people
are involved in the sector.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministerial Meeting Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING, Jaya, Malaysia, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad opened the 30th Ministerial Meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) here this
morning with a speech defending the group's admission of Laos and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, in his speech at the opening ceremony, criticized
some people for exerting pressure on the ASEAN over its membership
expansion.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Laos and Myanmar were formally admitted into the
ASEAN at a ceremony in Petaling, Java of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"The world should welcome the accession to the ASEAN of any
country which qualifies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that there are those who would not see the
obvious. Instead of encouraging the ASEAN to accept all Southeast
Asian countries as soon as possible, the ASEAN has been urged to
pass judgment, deny membership and apply pressure on a potential
candidate so as to force that country to remain poor and therefore
unstable," Mahathir said, without picking out names.
</P>
<P>
When the ASEAN decided to admit Myanmar in May this year, some
Western countries, mainly the United States, expressed their
objection, accusing the country of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN must resist and reject such attempts at coercion,"
he said, "No one should assume that only they know the solutions
to all problems."
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony were attended by ASEAN Secretary-General
Ajit Singh, foreign ministers of the nine ASEAN member countries
-- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- and representatives of Papua
New Guinea and Cambodia, which enjoy observer status in the
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar are participating in the ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN had agreed to admit Cambodia simultaneously with Laos
and Myanmar in May, but it decided earlier this month to defer its
entry because of fighting between the forces of Co-Prime Ministers
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers upheld the decision Wednesday after
Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot, who is here for the
ministerial meeting, said his country still wants to join the
organization and welcomes its effort to end the fighting in the
country.

<HEADLINE> New Rebel Group Surfaces in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A new rebel group has surfaced in
northern Nicaragua and declared its objective as to combat what it
called the "savage capitalism" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Diriangen Front, or the FND in Spanish, delivered
a press release, with a seal that reads "National Command of the
Joint Staffs," to the local newspaper La Tribuna.
</P>
<P>
Its statement came two days after the government claimed
success in demobilizing the 3-80 Northern Front, a rebel group
active in the northern part of this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
The new rebel group said it was taking up arms to fight the
government of President Arnoldo Aleman's policy, which it
described was "the living expression of Somocism."
</P>
<P>
In the release, the FND said it is made up of former members of
army and resistance groups, and its militants include
professionals, farmers, students, mechanics and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The FND attributed the "misery, unemployment, hunger and
extreme poverty" among the Nicaraguan people to the neo-liberal
policy being practiced in the country.
</P>
<P>
Corruption, influence peddling, high taxes, illegal
profiteering, concessions to foreigners and human rights
violations, it alleged, are characteristic of the current system.
</P>
<P>
In view of the poor perspectives for the future, the FND has no
alternative other than protest with arms, said the release.
</P>
<P>
After the peaceful demobilization of the 3-80 Northern Front on
Monday, the Nicaraguan government is trying to get three other
groups to lay down their arms in northern and central Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The groups, known to have Sandinista leanings, are the Andres
Castro United Front, the Ramon Raudales Northern Front and the
Revolutionary Worker and Peasant Front.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Stepping up Drive to Defend Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine monetary authorities
have stepped up its drive to defend the peso by issuing a new set
of guidelines to banks to curb renewed speculation on the
currency.
</P>
<P>
In a circular published here today, Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson ordered suspending for three months so-called
"non-deliverable forward sales" of the U.S. dollar so as to enable
monetary authorities to strengthen regulations against these
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that approval by the central bank is needed in all
non-deliverable forward contracts of on-shore banks to sell
dollars to non-residents.
</P>
<P>
"In order to curb undue speculations in the foreign exchange
market, all forward contracts to sell foreign exchange to
non-residents shall be submitted for prior clearance to the
central bank," he said in the circular.
</P>
<P>
In another move, the central bank Wednesday reduced the
overbought dollar limit of banks to 10 percent from 20 percent of
their unimpaired capital, while raising the oversold dollar limit
of banks to 20 percent from the previous 10 percent of their
unimpaired capital.
</P>
<P>
The overbought position is defined as the excess of foreign
exchange assets over liabilities, while the oversold position is
the excess of foreign exchange liabilities over assets.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of turmoil in the Philippine foreign exchange
market, the peso has become steady. It closed at 28.50 against the
U.S. dollar Wednesday. The currency has been under heavy pressure
of speculation since its 11.5 percent devaluation on July 11.

<HEADLINE> Papers Hail Myanmar's Entry into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- All three state-run Myanmar
newspapers today hailed the country's entry into the Association
of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was formally admitted into the regional grouping on
Wednesday along with Laos at a ceremony held in Petaling, Jaya of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar-language paper "Mirror", in its editorial, said
following ASEAN's extension of members to Laos and Myanmar, the
combined strength of ASEAN resources and its spirit of
constructive cooperation will certainly ensure a deeper
enhancement of ASEAN's role and prestige while bringing about
development for all.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar-language paper "New Light of Myanmar" in its
commentary said while Myanmar is now laying down for the country's
future generations the foundations of a peaceful, prosperous,
modern and developed state, it will also actively participate in
all areas of ASEAN cooperation to ensure that the Association is
enhanced and reinforced with Myanmar's contribution to peace,
stability and prosperity in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper "New Light of Myanmar" pointed out
that Myanmar was able to enter the ASEAN fold together with Laos
despite hindrance by those who had worked overtime to bar the
country's entry.
</P>
<P>
All the papers, quoting Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw, pledged
Myanmar's active participation in line with its active and
independent foreign policy in working together with other member
nations for a cohesive, competitive, prosperous, stable and secure
Southeast Asia in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls for Better Work in Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has noted
that the country's population situation remains serious despite
some achievements last year, and that family planning must be
given due attention every year.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark March 8 at a forum on family planning and
environmental protection. The full text of his speech was made
public by Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the country's birth rate was nearly 17 per thousand,
and the natural increase rate of the population was a little over
ten per thousand. Both figures were slightly lower than those in
1995.
</P>
<P>
"While affirming the achievements, we should also recognize
that China's population situation remains serious," Li said,
explaining that China now has a huge population, that family
planning is weak in the rural and impoverished areas, and that it
is hard to control population growth among the floating population.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at various levels must become fully aware of the
long-term and arduous nature of population control, and must
unswervingly carry out the basic national policy of family
planning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Family planning should be given due attention every year, so
that the country's population will not exceed 1.3 billion by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the premier pointed out, the effective policies
and methods for family planning formed in the past two decades
should be retained and be improved in the course of practice.
</P>
<P>
The policies and methods include the encouragement of late
marriage and late birth, one child per couple, a responsibility
system for local family planning officials, proper services to
ensure planned births and making people more aware of the
country's population situation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stressed that it is hard to carry out family planning
in rural areas. Efforts must be centered on the countryside so
that the target for family planning in the country's Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) can be met.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas family planning should be carried out together
with the development of the rural economy, assisting local farmers
to become rich and establishing civilized and happy families. In
poor areas family planning should be linked to poverty
alleviation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Li also put emphasis on the better management of
family planning among the floating population. At present, more
people are moving from the countryside to cities and boom areas,
which benefits economic growth but makes population management
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
With regard to family planning in urban areas, Li noted that
the birth rate is already low there, but related work should not
be relaxed. He also called on local governments to create good
conditions for the education of only children in cities.

<HEADLINE> More Security Provided for MPs in Eastern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- More security for Members of
Parliament in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka will be provided
by police following discussions between Speaker K. B. Ratnayake,
acting Defense Minister Anurudha Ratwatte and party leaders
Wednesday, police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The need for greater security follows the assassination of two
Eastern Parliamentarians within the past two weeks by the Tamil
rebels of the Liberation of Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The two MPs slain were Arunachalam Thangthurai of the Tamil
United Liberation Front and Mohamad Maharoof of the main
opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
Thangathurai died with four others in a bomb attack after a
ceremony at a school in Tricomalee on July 6 and Maharoof was shot
dead together with five others when his jeep was ambushed by the
rebels last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the LTTE rebels are targeting all those
opposed to their separate state for which they have been waging a
14-year war.
</P>
<P>
The MPs in the East are no longer able to live in their home
with their families due to security threat, the sources quoted the
Speaker as saying.

He stressed that all the major industrial polluters in the
country must meet national standards when draining off their foul
air and water by the end of this year, and drinking water for
residents in both cities and the countryside must be guaranteed
pure.
</P>
<P>
-- Ecological agriculture should be developed to improve the
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that governments at all levels must proceed from
local natural resources and take into account the conditions of
their resources and the environment, so as to promote coordinated
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
-- Arable land must be well protected.
</P>
<P>
A sound system should be established and rigorously enforced
across the country to prevent arable land being randomly occupied
for non-agricultural use, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a system should be enforced at the level of every county,
every town, every village and even every household," the premier
stressed.
</P>
<P>
-- Government funds must be earmarked for the development of
the environment and environmentally-friendly industries.
</P>
<P>
In the five years up to the year 2000 China will allocate a
total of 450 billion yuan (around 54.22 billion US dollars) for
environmental protection, and such funds must be used in the
relevant projects, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and enterprises should be strategically
far-sighted, and promote the coordinated development of the
ecological environment with that of society and the national
economy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank Intervenes to Defend Rupiah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank has spent
so far this week 700 million U.S. dollars to defend the country's
currency rupiah against speculators, according to bank governor
Soedradjad Djiwandono.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia bought rupiah in the forward market on Monday
and Tuesday, the governor said here Wednesday night. The bank
would intervene again if it is necessary, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The situation could get critical again if speculators carry on
playing with our currency, but the bank will be careful to avoid a
repeat of Monday's sudden 7.1 percent drop," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure this does not wreck our economy," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has 21 billion dollars in reserves, equivalent
to more than five months of imports, Soedradjad said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, speculators targeted the rupiah after forcing a
devaluation of the Thai baht and the Philippine peso earlier in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad conceded that the government's 4 percent annual
depreciation target for the rupiah will probably prove untenable
this year, and that a 5 percent depreciation was now more likely.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the rupiah has tumbled 8.7 percent against
the dollar. It was recently traded at 2,575 to the dollar. It hit
a record low of 2,665 rupiah to the dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"President Soeharto has told us to keep the rupiah stable, but
we don't know whether the speculators will stop -- so we have to
be careful and stay on our guard," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank on July 11 widened the dollar-rupiah
intervention band to 12 percent from 8 percent to avert
speculative attacks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese University Students Keen to Learn to Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The former craze among college
students -- learning how to use a computer -- is being replaced by
learning how to drive before graduation.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing University, in the southwestern part of China, is
offering an elective course in response to strong demand by many
students, who want to get a driver's license before they leave the
university.
</P>
<P>
Students have to pay 2,000 yuan for the course, an amount that
is nearly equal to the total they spend on everything else for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the students involved want to be more versatile and to
learn more to be better prepared for the future.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Bin, one of the students who took the Chongqing course,
says that he did it because he thought he could find a better job
if he had a driver's license. Most of the students say that they
will have a chance to drive after graduation -- and the course
gives them additional credit.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Institutionalizes Funding for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

SAN JOSE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose Maria
Figueres today approved a constitutional reform bill to allocate 6
percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to education.
</P>
<P>
The universities currently enjoy a financing system that has
been under fire from people in the political and financial
circles, who see the fundings for higher education as excessive.
</P>
<P>
Introduced at a time when there is an increasing tendency to
privatize Costa Rica's higher education institutions, the reform
bill aims to reinforce basic education, including preschooling.
</P>
<P>
The measure stipulates that financing for public education
shall not be less than 6 percent of the GDP, or the country's
total value of annual output of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Deficit Drops in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Czech National Statistics
Bureau said today that the foreign trade deficit in the country
were 9.58 billion korun (2.8 billion U.S. dollars) in June, the
lowest in the past 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the exports increased by 31 percent
and imports 17.8 percent, compared with those in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the foreign trade deficit helps the increase of
exchange rate between korun, U.S. dollar and deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The huge foreign trade deficit in the Czech Republic in the
past few years has been attributed to the decrease of exports and
rise of imports. In 1996, the deficit totalled 161 billion korun
(4.9 billion dollars) and 40.2 billion korun (1.2 billion dollars)
in the first quarter of this year, a 47.8-percent increase over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit has been one of the major obstacles for the
country's economic development. To improve the situation, the
Czech authorities took a series of measures to encourage exports
and limit imports. Importers must pay 20 percent of import
deposits of their total import volume to the state-designated
banks, but the banks will not pay interest to the import
deposits. The measure has curbed the rapid rise of imports in the
country. Experts estimate that the deficit this year will be much
lower than last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The new People's Assembly of
Albania (parliament) elected on June 29, the 15th in history of
the nation, held its first session here today to establish a
credential committee on parliament members.
</P>
<P>
However, all parliament members of the Democratic Party failed
to attend today's meeting. The new assembly is composed of 155
members, out of which, 105 are Socialists and 27 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Genc Pollo, secretary-general of the Democratic Party, told the
press today that parliament members from his party will not attend
forthcoming parliamentary meetings which will elect parliament
speaker, president of the state and cabinet, in order to protest
against violence and revenging actions during the general
elections late last month.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out, it didn't mean his party boycotted the new
parliament, which was described by international monitors as
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is expected to elect Socialist Party Secretary
General Rexhep Mejdani as the president to replace Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Top priorities for the new parliament will be to restore law
and order and to resolve the economic issues resulted from the
collapse of the fraudulent investment schemes earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
A military violence engulfed Albania, killing more than 400
people after a nationwide unrest caused by the collapse of the
fraudulent schemes, in which, hundreds and thousands of Albanian
lost money.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Balkan country remains precarious with the
gradual withdrawal of the Italian-led 7,000 strong multinational
troops who were deployed in April to secure aid deliveries.
</P>
<P>
All the troops are expected to pull out of the tiny nation
within August.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: Do a Good Job of Family Planning (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said the over-population warning must be
sounded constantly, and continued efforts must be made to
guarantee that China controls its population within 1.3 billion by
the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at a national forum on family planning
and environmental protection held on March 8. Xinhua issued the
full text of Jiang's speech made at the forum.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China's achievements in family planning have
attracted worldwide attention. China controlled its population
growth properly and in accordance with its plan last year, which
marked a good beginning for family planning during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
He stressed that, however, we must kept sober-minded as China
has a large population and annually newly-born babies number some
21 million. The net increase of population in China is 13 million
each year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that family planning work is weak in some areas, and
some provinces and autonomous regions are experiencing "baby
booms."
</P>
<P>
He added that family planning work is arduous and must not be
slackened at any time. He added that we must not be unrealistically
optimistic just because the country has fulfilled its population
growth targets in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the areas with big population problems to enhance
their confidence in family planning and not to become dispirited.

<P>
Jiang said China has found a way to solve the population
problem with Chinese characteristics in reining in the fast
population growth, and created much valuable experience.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin stressed that we must insist on following the
practices and experiences which have proved to be correct, and
continue to perfect them.
</P>
<P>
He said, family planning must be listed as one of the important
parts of promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called on officials in charge of family planning to
improve their work style and professional ethics.
</P>
<P>
He said China must focus its family planning work on the rural
areas, as the population control in rural areas, especially the
poor areas, is a big problem.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the major reasons for the underdevelopment of
the poverty-stricken areas is that the population growth in those
areas is too fast.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that aid-the-poor work must be combined with
family planning.
</P>
<P>
He said poor families, villages, townships and counties doing a
good job of family planning should enjoy preferential policies in
receiving aid-the-poor funds, household resettlement in better
areas, technology training and labor export.
</P>
<P>
After they shake off poverty they can lead other poor families,
villages, townships or counties to meet their needs for food and
clothing, he said.

KIEV, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine hopes to establish a
strategic partnership with Armenia, Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma said today at a meeting with his Armenian counterpart Levon
Ter-Petrocyan.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said there are no political differences between Ukraine
and Armenia, so it is a natural choice for the two countries to
develop a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrocyan, who arrived here yesterday on a two-day visit,
said Armenia pays great attention to promoting relations with
neighboring countries and is ready to undertake military
cooperation with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Armenia developed a powerful military industry
during the Soviet era, so there is great potential for military
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
But both stressed the aim of the military cooperation is to
maintain and enhance peace.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, whose country has been suffering from a sluggish
economy since independence in 1991, also stressed the importance
of developing economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two former Soviet republics stood at
29 million U.S. dollars in 1996 and four million dollars in the
first five months of 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Not To Sacrifice Environment for Economic Growth: Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said in a
speech published today that governments at various levels must
consistently adhere to the national policy of protecting the
environment for co-ordinated growth of the economy with the
environment and resources.
</P>
<P>
Li made the pledge at a national forum on family planning and
environmental protection held by the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee on March 8. The full text of his speech was
released by Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"China must not follow the old road of `pollution control after
pollution,'" he said, stressing that it "should never sacrifice
the environment for temporary (economic) growth."
</P>
<P>
China's per capita arable land, water resources, forest and
many mineral resources are below the world's average, and the
current extensive mode of economic growth has further increased
waste and pollution, Li admitted.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts and good results in curbing pollution and
waste, the general environmental quality has continued to
deteriorate, for the public's environmental awareness is still
weak, so is its ability to protect the environment, the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
"China still faces a heavy task to bring a fairly good
environment to the 21st century, together with an economy
maintaining sustainable, rapid and healthy growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to plan, China will, by the year 2000, basically
control environmental pollution and the tendency of ecological
deterioration and have the environmental quality in some cities
and areas improved.
</P>
<P>
To attain such goals, Premier Li listed the following
priorities for governments at all levels:
</P>
<P>
-- The urban environment must be put under strict control, with
the target of curbing industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
Li said that urban atmospheric conditions in some cities have
become so bad that acid rain has emerged, and urban residents are
threaten by contaminated drinking water.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today condemned
Canada for failing to bring a swift end to the blockade of an
American ferry by angry British Columbia fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Senators voted 81-19 to approve a nonbinding resolution
censuring Canada and urging U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose
sanctions against Canada in the event of a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
Canadian fishermen used boats blockaded a U.S. Alaskan ferry at
a Canadian harbor last weekend, protesting fishermen of Alaska
catch to much salmon in the pacific.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the U.S. signed a treaty in 1985 to regulate fishing
activities and divide the amount of fish the two sides can
catch. Canada accused the U.S. of breaching the treaty by
over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also announced today that they each will
appoint a prominent citizen who will seek a negotiated settlement
to the salmon dispute.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the two
prominent citizens will "act as a resource" to stake-holders or
regional fishing representatives who have tried without success to
reach a compromise settlement.

<HEADLINE> China's Customs Tax Collection Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's customs collected 44.72
billion yuan (5.39 billion US dollars) of taxes in the first half
of this year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up 3.84 billion yuan, or 9.4 percent more than
the same period last year, according to a statement from the
General Customs Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, China levied import duties worth 16.85
billion yuan, up 1.3 percent. Import taxes -- value-added tax and
consumption duties -- imposed in the period totaled 27.87 billion
yuan, a jump of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
China imported 63.05 billion US dollars' worth of goods in the
first half of this year, showing little change over last year.
But general trade imports dropped 8.9 percent to 17.38 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the increase in customs duty to the
central government's policy adjustment last year, which eliminated
certain tax preference on imports and thereby brought more
products into the taxable category.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
urged governments and departments concerned at all levels to
incorporate environmental protection goals into their annual as
well as medium- and long-term plans for social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that no major construction project
should be launched without appropriate environmental protection
measures to go with it.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua published the full text of Jiang's speech at a national
forum on family planning and environmental protection held here
March 8.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that feasibility studies with a view to
environmental protection should be carried out prior to any
regional or natural resources development project. Effective
administrative procedures for environmental protection should be
established to make the decision-making process more scientific
and standardized. Investment in this aspect should also be
increased.
</P>
<P>
He said China has done a fairly good job in protecting its
environment amid rapid economic expansion since the reform and
opening-up policies were introduced some 18 years ago. Rapid
ecological deterioration has basically been kept at bay.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the Chinese government's strategy to
coordinate economic development with environmental protection as
well as a series of policies to that end are both right and
effective.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that, with its national economy still
advancing at a pretty fast speed and population growing even
bigger, China's demands on natural resources will rise, too. Any
relaxation in our efforts to protect the environment would lead to
an increase in the volume of discharged pollutants and in the
scale of ecosystem damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
People will start to worry about the quality of their
environment when they can feed and cloth themselves. Therefore we
face great pressure as far as natural resources and environment
are concerned. The environmental situation is rather stern, which
means we have a lot to accomplish to protect the environment, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Term Objectives
through the year 2010 for social and economic development set out
in explicit terms standards for environment protection in next 15
years: We must strive for basic containment of the worsening
environmental pollution and deteriorating ecosystem and for
improvement in environmental quality in a number of cities and
regions by the year 2000; and a fundamental reverse of ecosystem
deterioration and impressive improvement in rural and urban
environment by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
These are trans-century goals. Realization of these goals
requires not only efforts of the environmental protection
department and other departments, but also the concerted endeavors
of the whole Party and the whole people.
</P>
<P>
The legal framework to guide environmental protection work in
the socialist market economy should be perfected to provide
effective means for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said departments in charge of environmental protection
should put in place unified supervision and administration in
accordance with the law. Judicial departments should strengthen
work in this regard and resolutely crack down on violators.
</P>
<P>
"The whole Party and people must join hands in creating a
better world for the coming generations," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Expands Metro Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's underground system is
being expanded in the eastern part with construction of an
arterial line running to the west where it will connect at
Fuxingmen.
</P>
<P>
the Fuxingmen to Bawangfen metro line running beneath many
important places will begin operation on September 28, 1999, said
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"It will alleviate traffic jams above ground and is a positive
move for prosperity of the eastern city," said Dong Xiaoli, an
official in charge of the construction project.
</P>
<P>
The line was designed to be 12.7 kilometers long with 11
stations. It stops at downtown shopping centers such as Xidan and
Wangfujing, and Fuxingmen where it will connect with the loop
line, said Li Shunli, an official with Beijing Mass Transit
Railway Corp (MTRB).
</P>
<P>
An estimated 550 million people will travel from Fuxingmen in
West Beijing to Bawangfen in the east by the end of 2,000. This is
well beyond the capacity of all above-ground mass transportation.
</P>
<P>
The construction budget for the line was 2.5 billion yuan (301
million US dollars) in 1990 when construction was kicked off by
MTRB.
</P>
<P>
With the soaring price of building materials, expenses hit six
billion yuan (722 million US dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a 162 million US dollars loan from the Japanese
Government, and a two billion yuan (240 million US dollars) loan
expected from the State Development Bank, the municipal government
is gathering money for the project and applying for preferential
policy in taxes.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hotels Promote International Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's star-rated hotels have
improved service and management due to application of
international standards, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The city has 260 star-level hotels for overseas tourists, of
which 200 are State-owned and the rest are overseas-funded.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish a more efficient management system for
the hotel industry, the Beijing Municipal Tourism Administration
(BMTA) issued a series of market rules in keeping with
international practices and set up tourist guide marks in hotels
and scenic spots, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the State-owned hotel facilities and services have
been brought up to international standards, the daily quoted a
BMTA spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
For example, Beijing Huadu Hotel, the first State-owned
three-star hotel in the early 1980s, has revised its service
standards and procedures in accordance with international
practices, to replace the out-dated methods followed under the
central planned economy.
</P>
<P>
"Just like the Jianguo Hotel -- the first overseas-funded hotel
in Beijing in the 1980s -- our hotel set up a new management
system, including personnel, financial affairs, facilities, and
services, to meet the needs of a market-oriented economy", the
newspaper quoted Liu Yuming, Huadu Hotel manager, as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Huadu has successfully received three million
overseas and domestic tourists since it opened in 1982. It has
earned a total business income of 500 million yuan (60.2 million
US dollars) and turned out a total pretax-profit of 150 million
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Personal Tax Revenue Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Revenue from personal income taxes
continued to increase rapidly in China in the first half of this
year, with steady economic growth and a tightening of tax
controls, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Personal income tax revenue to the end of last month soared by
42.5 percent on a year-on-year basis to 12.34 billion yuan (1.48
billion US dollars), fulfilling 51.4 percent of the annual target,
said Ye Lin'er, deputy division chief of the Income Taxation
Department of the State Taxation Administration.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is far greater than that for total industrial
and commercial tax revenue, which recorded a 19.5 percent increase
over the previous year during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
All the regions except for the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
saw growth in the past six months, with Guangdong province in
South China, Shanghai and Beijing ranking among the top three
taxpaying regions in China.
</P>
<P>
Ye said the sharp increase was in line with the country's
stable economic development, which saw a 9.5 percent year-on-year
growth in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The steady rise in individual incomes, at 2.2 percent for urban
residents and 3.3 percent for rural people during the past six
months, laid down a solid base for the progress of personal income
tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the high growth is that the taxation
authorities have intensified the management and supervision of tax
collection, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say that this year's personal income tax yield
is projected to surpass 24 billion yuan, which will lift the ratio
of individual income tax to industrial and commercial tax to 3.45
percent from last year's three percent.
</P>
<P>
And the ratio may expand to five percent by the year 2000 and
ten percent by 2010, predicted the official.
</P>
<P>
Personal income tax revenue has continued to grow rapidly since
the Chinese Government started to enforce the new Personal Income
Tax Law in 1994, with revenue increasing on average by around 60
percent per year between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year personal income tax revenue amounted to 19.3 billion
yuan, an increase of 46.9 percent over the 1995 figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- After more than 100 years of
industrial development, are there still wild animals in Shanghai?
</P>
<P>
To answer this question, a scientific study was launched this
week. It is sponsored by the Shanghai Bureau of Agriculture and
Forestry, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Groups of researchers and university teachers and students were
sent to inspect 2,930 square kilometers of farmland in the
suburbs, 608 square kilometers in the intertidal zone in Wusong
and nearby lakes, with combined water-surface areas of 51 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The farmland was divided into 140 subareas, each three
kilometers long and 50 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will focus on 287 kinds of wild animals,
including 60 under State protection, such as Chinese sturgeon,
otter, swan, mink and four-gill perch.
</P>
<P>
The field work is part of a national study and is expected to
be completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
While preparing for the study, the wild animal protection
office of the Shanghai Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry teamed
up with Fudan University, East China Normal University and
Shanghai Museum of Nature Sciences to conduct a trial
investigation.

<HEADLINE> "Family Planning and Environmental Protection Work Urgent" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
attached great importance to the two basic state policies of
family planning and environmental protection, saying that they are
both closely related to China's overall social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark March 8 at a national forum on family
planning and environmental protection. Xinhua today issued the
full text of his speech at the forum.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two causes are closely interconnected with
each other -- if one fails to succeed then the other will also be
greatly hampered.
</P>
<P>
With a large population and limited per capita natural
resources, China is facing great difficulties in maintaining and
improving its ecological environment, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the nation's socialist construction should
unswervingly concentrate on economic development to boost the
national economy, and at the same time take full consideration of
population control and environmental protection work so as to
ensure sustained development.
</P>
<P>
The education and publicity work on these two state policies
needs to be further enhanced, the president said, and they should
be regarded as important parts of the nation's material and
ideological progress.

WARSAW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic coach Janusz Wojcik
has been picked up to become the new Polish national team coach,
the Polish Soccer Association (PZPN) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wojcik, 44, replaces Antoni Piechniczek who quit last month
after a 2-0 home defeat to England which ended Poland's hopes of
qualifying for the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Wojcik guided Poland to a silver medal at the

the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"Simply, the national side will consist of Poland's best
players," Wojcik was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 Wojcik guided Legia Warsaw to the national club
championship but the title was later taken away from them because
of alleged game-rigging.

<HEADLINE> Jewell Sues New York Post for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Richard Jewell, former prime
suspect for the Olympic bomb in Atlanta, sued the New York Post on
Wednesday for libel in its articles.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Jewell filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court
here, claiming that articles published by the newspaper after the
bomb explosion had false and defamatory statements.
</P>
<P>
On July 27, 1996, Jewell first noticed an unattended package at
the Centennial Olympic Park that was later found to contain the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
He was cleared of suspicion last November in the bombing which
claimed two fatalities and some 100 wounded in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Jewell was under constant and intense scrutiny by
FBI agents, but the bombing remained unsolved up till now and with
little hope in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged Jewell suffered permanent injury to his
reputation, public hatred and ridicule, seeking 5 million US
dollars in compensatory damages and 10 million in punitive damages
from the Post.
</P>
<P>
Early, Jewell reached legal settlements with CNN and NBC over
their coverage of the explosion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Two female athletes have failed
drug tests in the Arab Games, officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Maha Mohammed El-Hassan, Syrian triple jumper who failed to win
any medal, tested positive for banned stimulant nandrolon, said Dr
Ridah Kazem, head of the Games' doping committee, who declined to
specify what penalties she would incur.
</P>
<P>
Women cager Karima Shaniur of Tunisia tested positive for
hiptamynol, a drug to combat low blood pressure and has been
kicked out of the tournament, Kazem added.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, which beat Lebanon 55-52 on Monday in the latest
round, faced the risk of being disqualified from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Tunisia was ranked fifth in the medals table at the
Games with seven golds, while Syria has six.
</P>
<P>
Early on Sunday, Kazem said that Saudi Arabia's Khaled
al-Khalidi, winner of the gold medal in the discus and silver
medal in the shot, also failed a drug test.

drugs at the games.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The reigning NBA champion
Chicago Bulls announced in Chicago on Wednesday that head coach
Phil Jackson re-signed with the team for the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
Team chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement that the
one-year pact made Jackson the highest-paid "pure" coach in the
league, which excluded coaches who also act as their teams'
general managers.
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

<P>
Jackson, the only coach superstar Michael Jordan said he would
play for, has a career record of 96-35 in the postseason and
his .733 winning percentage is the best in NBA playoff history.

Last season, Jackson became the third coach in league history
to win five championships.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
decided to impose controls on the movement of meat and bone meal
between the European Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
On a proposal from Franz Fischler, EU commissioner for
agriculture and rural development, detailed rules are being
planned to be laid down for the movement of meat and bone meal
which has not been produced to the new standards to other member
states for incineration or use as fuel.
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes prior authorization of the member states
of destination, labeling of the material to the effect that it
cannot be used for feeding and transport in a sealed container
directly to the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
The commission has conducted inspections and meetings with its
member states, which have shown that the required standards are
not being fully applied across the EU.
</P>
<P>
It notes that some member states are not applying the standards
to mammalian waste from animals fit for human consumption while
others need more time to upgrade their plants.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today the United States will do what it
can to pressure Cambodian co-Prime Minister Hun Sen into accepting
mediation in the recent Cambodia crisis and restore the coalition
government there.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council
before flying to Kuala Lumpur where she will attend the annual
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Albright said Hun Sen through his spokesman appeared to have
accepted ASEAN's offer of mediation and promised to restore the
previous coalition government and observe the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will use its leverage and do all we can in
partnership with others to see that Hun Sen's words are translated
into concrete action," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be one of our primary goals at the (ASEAN) meetings
this weekend in Kuala Lumpur," she added.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Albright expressed U.S. unhappiness over ASEAN
members agreeing to admit Myanmar (Burma) as its new member this
year.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed a ban in April on new U.S. investment
in Myanmar and asked ASEAN not to accept Myanmar into the regional
organization, which, however, was rejected by ASEAN.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
decided to renew eight scientific committees in the field of
consumer health and food safety.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive agency aims at
strengthening the coherence of the existing scientific committees
and at redefining the activities of some of them, according to a
press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted that the three principles which must be at
the basis of the good performance of the scientific committees
were the excellence of their members, their independence and the
transparency of their advice.
</P>
<P>
It said that this decision was "a significant step" towards the
implementation of its new approach announced in a communication on
consumer health and food safety which has been recently adopted.
</P>
<P>
The scientific committees which have been established are on
food, animal nutrition, animal health and welfare, veterinary
public health, plants, cosmetic products and non-food products
intended for consumers, medicaments and medical materials, and
toxicity, ecotoxicity and the environment.

<HEADLINE> EC Notes Irregularities in Preferential Arrangements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- There exist many irregularities
in the implementation of the preferential tariff arrangements, an
essential part of the EU's development aid policy and an open
commercial policy, the European Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
In a communication adopted today, on the basis of the checks
carried out in 1996, the EU's executive agency estimated that
these irregularities were responsible for a loss of at least 220
million ECUs (around 285 million U.S. dollars), notably owing to
poor application of the rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
The commission has pinpointed three areas for action to remedy
these irregularities and facilitate recovery of duties from EU
operators, who are legally responsible for the correctness of the
import declaration.
</P>
<P>
The three areas are legislating the rules, making EU member
states shoulder their responsibilities and making the beneficiary
countries aware of the problem by, where necessary, adapting the
existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, EU commissioner for customs, said that it was
absolutely necessary to restore confidence in these arrangements
to promote the development of the beneficiary countries by
facilitating their exports to the EU market while protecting the
EU's financial interests.
</P>
<P>
He added that abuse of these preferential arrangements would
give rise to deflections in trade which were harmful to the
economy of the partner countries and that of the union.

WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Canada and the
U.S. had "very good discussions" today on a bitter fishing dispute
that threatened their close relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and other officials, Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy said, "We were able to look at the broad issues and
see how we can take steps forward."

Canadian fishermen insist that fishermen from the U.S. State of

allowed under a 1985 Pacific Salmon treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. denied that it has breached any international
agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I think we both genuinely feel that the treaty is very
important," Axworthy told reporters. "To use that old expression,
we had very good discussions."
</P>

Peay arrived here earlier in the day on a 2-day official

<P>
The remaining 200 million dollars of the assistance will be

<HEADLINE> Cocaine-Sentence Proposal Under Bipartisan Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
proposal to reduce differences in prison sentences for selling
crack and powdered cocaine came under bipartisan attack in
Congress today.
</P>
<P>
During the testimony by Clinton's drug-policy adviser Barry
McCaffrey today, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee described the proposal as sending "the wrong signal" to
would-be drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno and McCaffrey Tuesday proposed
reducing the sentencing disparity for the two forms of cocaine to
a 10-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
The plan would impose mandatory five-year penalties for selling
25 grams of crack or 10 times as much powdered cocaine, 250 grams.
Current law requires five-year sentences for the sale of five
grams of crack or 500 grams of cocaine, a 100-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
Senator Spencer Abraham, a Republican from Michigan, noted
recent reports of increased drug use among American youths. Softer
sentences for possession of crack cocaine, he said, sent "the
wrong signal to young people."
</P>
<P>
He also said a new sentencing policy could reverse declines in
violent crime that have been attributed to a leveling-off of the
crack epidemic.

McCaffrey said the current system has an "injustice built into
it" and that removing the focus from low-level drug dealers could
free resources and allow officials to go after major traffickers.

Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat from California and
chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the proposed
change to a 10-to-1 ratio remains unfair. She said the caucus
still wants a 1-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the sentence structure is unfair to those dealing
in crack, which is cheaper but no worse than powder and is more
likely used by members of racial minorities. Others say crack is
more addictive because of its concentrated form and is more likely
to be associated with street violence.
</P>
<P>
"Any sentencing scheme that treats crack use and trafficking
more harshly than powder use and trafficking is not addressing
reality," she said.

<HEADLINE> Europeans, Americans Agree on Amending CFE Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thirty countries to the Treaty
on the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) today reached a
framework agreement in Vienna to impose new and lower limits on
tanks and other non-nuclear weapons, a senior U.S. official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The CFE treaty, which was signed in 1990 and entered into force
in 1992, limits the number of tanks, artillery pieces, aircraft
and other non-nuclear arms European states can hold and where they
can be placed.
</P>
<P>
Robert Bell, a senior national security advisor to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, told reporters that the tentative accord
is a "remarkable example of the kind of cooperative effort" the
U.S. and Russia were making in arms control.
</P>
<P>
Bell said the agreement in principle included replacing the old
CFE treaty, which allowed one overall amount of equipment for NATO
and an equal amount for the countries of the now-defunct Warsaw
Pact, with a new system that sets national ceilings.
</P>
<P>
The 30 countries agreed a new treaty would set ceilings on the
amount of equipment, regardless of where the equipment comes from,
that any given country could station on its soil.
</P>
<P>
Bell said there was a significant amount of negotiation that
remained to be done in Vienna, where the CFE talks are being held,
and the negotiators hoped to have reached final agreement within a
year.
</P>
<P>
"At the end... all the national ceilings have been set, the
total amount of combat equipment that will be in Europe will be
significantly lower than the total amount that had been allowed by
the original 1990 treaty," Bell said.

AMMAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein issued here
today a royal decree ordering the go-ahead for the parliamentary
elections scheduled for November, despite the claim by some
opposition parties to boycott them.
</P>
<P>
According to the first paragraph under Article 34 of the
Jordanian Constitution, polls will be conducted for the new
parliament as scheduled, Radio Jordan quoted the royal decree as
saying.

commitment of the government to holding free and fair
parliamentary elections as scheduled.

not.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Ruling Party Criticized Opposition's Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's ruling party Kenya
African National Union (KANU) announced tonight it is still
committed to constitutional reforms while criticizing that the
terms of the opposition for dialogue would only "hang the issue".
</P>
<P>
The parliament will be asked to enact a law on the
establishment of "a constitutional commission to look at the
question of legal and constitutional reforms," the Kenya
Television Network quoted a governmental statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party will discuss the issue with registered
opposition parties at such an institution, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties have been denied to register for
goverenment's authorization despite the recent softening attitude
by the government to carry on constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's agenda intends to ignite public anger and
incitement, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's main opposition leaders agreed Wednesday that they
should negotiate with the government in unity on the issue of the
constitutional reforms and presented pre-conditions for the talks
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they vowed to continue to take mass actions "until
the government commits itself to bona fide dialogue."

<HEADLINE> Canada Pledges Support for Bosnian Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
announced an additional 21.9 million U.S. dollars to support
reconstruction and peacebuilding activities in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the money will be committed to social and
economic reconstruction, with the rest going toward peace
implementation activities.
</P>
<P>
While making the announcement, Canada's Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his country believes that the
international community must continue to show its support for
reconstruction and peacebuilding in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The international community's support, however, is conditional
on the Bosnian Parties' compliance with the December 1995 Peace
Agreement, including in the apprehension of persons indicted for
war crimes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada made the pledge on the first day of the Bosnia Donors'
Conference in Brussels, which was convened to coordinate Bosnian
reconstruction assistance and to raise 1.4 billion dollars in
pledges for 1997 reconstruction priorities.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian delegation is being led by Michael Berry, special
coordinator of reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Higher on Comments by Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit another
six-year high against the mark and rose in most other dealings
today after top officials from the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve
signaled they don't oppose the U.S. currency's latest ascent.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8325 marks, the
strongest since July 1991, before settling in New York at 1.8268
marks, up from 1.8240 marks Tuesday. The dollar cost 115.65 yen,
up from 115.15 yen. The pound cost 1.6804 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6790 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Later the dollar derived further strength from comments about
the U.S. economy by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
delivered the second day of his midyear economic report to
Congress. He called the combination of steady growth and low
inflation exceptional, with no mention of the dollar's strength as
a possible risk.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday: 1.4861
Swiss francs, up from 1.4829; 6.1554 French francs, up from 6.1436;
1,772.20 Italian lire, down from 1,772.90; 1.3815 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.3775.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Delays Issuing Final Results of Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Independent Elections Commission
(IECOM) of Liberia said this evening it would not release the final
results of Saturday's elections as scheduled today until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"We are still working on ballots counting and some of the ballots
have not arrived because of transportation problem," an IECOM official
reached by Xinhua said over the phone.
</P>
<P>
Due to the bad weather, the helicopters to bring electoral
officials and ballot boxes from various polling stations to the
capital Monrovia could not fly for most of the time, according to the
official who identified her name simply as Torbo.
</P>
<P>
The final results might come tomorrow, she said, refusing to give a
specific time. But a source in Monrovia said it might be in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Despite the delay, observers believe whatever the final results
could bring no dramatic change to the trend of the landslide victory of
former warlord Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Latest figure provided by the Independent Elections Commission
shows that Taylor of the National Patriotic Party has won
356,548, or 75.4 percent, of the votes already counted.
</P>
<P>
Of the 472,863 valid votes released so far, his closest rival,
Unity Party's woman candidate Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf scored 45,195 or
9.53 percent, while Kromah, a former major warlord now running on the
platform of the All Liberian Coalition Party, received only 20,494, or
4.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Results announced so far are collected from 1,344 polling stations
out of a total of 1,864 centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
About 710,00 Liberians registered as voters and some 90 percent of
them are believed to have taken part in Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
To emerge as a president-elected, a candidate needs to win 51
percent of the total valid votes, otherwise a run-off will be held.
</P>
<P>
Although the final results are yet to come, Taylor's current score
is believed to make the run-off unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
While Taylor's supporters, most of whom young people, are
celebrating his preliminary victory, some politicians have reportedly
conveyed their congratulations to the former warlord.
</P>
<P>
Taylor launched a rebellion fighting against the late President of
Samuel Doe in December 1989, igniting a bloody civil war that
killed more than 150,000 people and displaced more others.
</P>
<P>
According to Liberia's election guidelines, the president-elected
will be installed on August 2, two weeks after the election, unless a
run-off is needed.
</P>
<P>
The election, which is widely recognized as free, fair and
transparent with minor irregularities, will also produce a new
parliament of 26 senators and 64 representatives.
</P>
<P>
The seats will be shared by parties according to the percentage of
votes they got.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Urges Senate Vote for NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Robert Hunter, U.S. ambassador
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), today urged the
Senate to vote for the alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Hunter made the strong plea at a State Department conference
for an all-out administration effort to persuade the Senate to
accept the expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member alliance decided at its special summit in Madrid
earlier this month that it will invite Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic to join and its door will be open to new members.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the United States Senate rejecting ratification...
is an intolerable thought," Hunter said. "The consequences if that
were to happen to the credibility of the United States not just in
NATO but globally would be I think without calculation."
</P>
<P>
Many senators oppose NATO's expansion plan, arguing that there
is no basis for the existence of the alliance since the Cold War
has ended and its rival Warsaw Pact has disappeared. They are also
concerned about the costs of the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the alliance's expansion plan needs to be
approved by a vote of two thirds majority in the Senate, which is
expected to take up the issue next spring.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to fail in that debate on ratification. That
must be an unthinkable idea," Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
The official estimated cost of the expansion for the U.S. is
150-200 million U.S. dollars a year over 10 years. Hunter argued
that it is a good bargain compared with some 4 trillion U.S.
dollar loss during World War II.
