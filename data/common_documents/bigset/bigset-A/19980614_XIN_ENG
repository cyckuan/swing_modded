<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Britain signed on Friday an agreement on
cooperation on information exchanges between Cairo and Alexandria
stock exchanges and London Stock Exchange, local daily El-Ahram
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first of its kind between London and the
Arab stock markets, aims to develop the Egyptian capital market in
the framework of Egyptian plan to put its stock markets on
equal footing with the international ones.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has signed a contract to purchase an automated trading
system worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the Cairo and Alexandria
stock exchanges, the daily added.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- About 600 plants in Tunisia have been listed on the
"all-out renovation plan" as part of the Tunisian-EU agreement on
establishing a free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in 1995 and covered a total of 2,000
factories, was aimed at creating the free trade zone within 12
years to enable the Tunisian economy to compete with the European
products gradually.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- In its monthly economic report, the Central Bank of
Egypt (CBE) said Saturday that the rate of inflation in Egypt fell
to 3.4 percent in March against 5.5 percent in the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves at the CBE hit 20.115 billion U.S. dollars
in March, an increase of 633 million dollars from the same month
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Chief of the Egyptian General Investment Authority
Ibrahim Fawzi said the exports of Egyptian free trade zones to
foreign markets went up by 33 percent in May over the same month
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The volume of these exports rose from 30.4 million U.S. dollars
in May 1997 to 40.6 million last month.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi attributed the increase to many facilities offered by
the Egyptian government to investors in the free trade zones and
the decision of the EU member states to open their markets for the
exports of Egyptian free trade zones.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Returns to World Cup with Opener Against Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia, barred from qualifying for
the last World Cup in the United States, returned to the finals to
face Iran in their Group F opener in Saint-Etienne on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The internal strifes in the nation have cost the footballers dear
with their exclusion from the 1992 and 1996 European Championship.
</P>
<P>
However, their stunning 12-1 aggregate victory over former
powerhouse Hungary sent a strong signal that they are still a power to
reckon with at international level.
</P>
<P>
Spearheading the Yugoslav attack in France will be the outstanding
striker Predrag Mijatovic, the star who scored 14 goals in
qualification round and netted the winner for Real Madrid in the
European Cup final.
</P>
<P>
The simple fact that the 29-year-old finished runner-up after
Ronaldo for the 1997 European Footballer of Year indicates he should
be among the top cream in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav midfield is solid with such talents like Dragan
Stojkovic, Sinisa Mihajlovic and Vladimir Jugovic.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary to a Yugoslavian camp full of European
professionals, the Iranians have only three German Bundesliga players
Karim Bagheri, Khodadad Azizi and Ali Daei.
</P>
<P>
As to fitness problem, goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh is doubtful while
winger Satar Hamedani could also has a knee ligament problem.
</P>
<P>
On the Yugoslavian side Dejan Savicevic faces a late fitness test
on a knee problem and could be replaced by Dejan Stankovic.
</P>
<P>
Iranian coach Jalal Talebi would apparently rely on a better
teamwork in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I know our opponents are good, with great football
experience. But on a bad day they could very well lose to a lesser
team.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally we play an offensive and open game. What's more, one of
our greatest assets is our teammanship," added Talebi.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea's Army Soldiers in Ethiopia Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The spokesperson of the
Ethiopian government announced Saturday that the Ethiopian
government has arrested for security reasons the Eritrean
government soldiers residing in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted the spokesperson as saying,
''The amry members who came to Ethiopia before Eritrean's
invasion were put under custody to maintain national security,''
reported the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson did not give the number of the Eritrean army
soldiers who are residing in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said, ''The individuals could be threat to
national security.'' The measure will not apply to Eritreans
leading a peaceful life in Ethiopia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the number of Eritreans residing in Ethiopia, the
spokesperson denied the number is over 550,000 announced here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement made by a government
spokesperson here Friday, the Ethiopian government policy toward
Eritreans living in Ethiopia ''remains intact'' and the Eritreans
can "continue to live and work peacefully in Ethiopia." But the
spokesperson said that the Eritreans "who are in leadership
positions in security sensitive posts - such as
telecommunications and the electricity company - must take one
month's enforced leave."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Increasing Pressure on West as Japan Slides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) - Japan's confirmation of its
recession has caused fears here that it could drag the West into
economic decline.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the recession announcement Friday, the Dow Jones
industrial average on Wall Street plunged another 100 points
during afternoon trading. Here in London, the FTSE 100 index fell
82.7 points to close at 5,769.8.
</P>
<P>
Official figures published show that Japan's gross domestic
product shrank by 1.3 percent in the three months to the end of
March, equivalent to a decline at an annual rate of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
This follows a decline in the final quarter of last year, and
leaves Japan's GDP 0.7 percent lower than a year ago. This is the
first full-year decline since 1974.
</P>
<P>
"If there is negative growth this fiscal year, the Japanese
economy will have contracted two consecutive years, making this
the country's worst post-war recession," warned Robert Feldman,
economist at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
The decline was sharper than expected by the markets, which had
forecast a fall of only about half a percent, and reflects both a
lack of confidence among consumers in Japan and a fall in exports
to the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ian Morris, senior international economist at HSBC Securities,
said, "Things are deteriorating quicker than anticipated. All
these government stimulus packages they keep having are unlikely
to boost the economy and capital spending is collapsing."
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign of a turn-around and if anything the economic
data we have for the second quarter is even worse. It is only a
matter of time before a big-name Japanese company goes under," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the Japanese economy has lead to fears that the
depreciation of the yen, which has fallen by 11 percent in the
past two months, will reach a stage where it destabilizes the
whole of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Alex Brummer, an economic analyst in the City, said, "In the
new global economy of open markets and large financial flows there
is no protection from a crisis of confidence."
</P>
<P>
"Japan's problem is that of the United States, Britain and
continental Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
The swiftest response came in the world currency markets, where
the yen slid to its lowest level since late 1990 against the
dollar at 144.62, threatening to trigger another round of
competitive devaluations in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Although the cheaper yen will help Japan's exports, it will fan
protectionist sentiment in the U.S. and put renewed pressure on
other Asian countries which suffered big currency devaluations in
the first wave of the crisis late last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that most worrying of all for the markets, a
new wave of instability could suck China into the currency
turmoil. However, so far China has resisted the temptation to
devalue.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Reshuffle PNA Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has asked the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) to have another 10-day delay in its
no-confidence vote pending a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
PLC Speaker Abu Ala confirmed in Ramallah, West Bank Saturday
that Arafat has sent a letter to him in which Arafat said that he
will, after consulting with other Palestinian leaders, announce a
PNA cabinet reshuffle, Jerusalem Media and Communication Center
(JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat asked the council for a delay of ten days in
its no-confidence vote to announce a new cabinet, and Arafat is
totally convinced the cabinet change is part of necessary
comprehensive administrative improvement," Abu Ala said.
</P>
<P>
Several PLC members on May 28 first asked to have a
no-confidence vote against the PNA, accusing it of inaction and
the delay in formulating the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, the PLC asked the PNA Cabinet to further reallocate
the budget as asked by some PLC members and resubmit it to the PLC
in two weeks for approval, otherwise it will face a no-confidence
vote in the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Some PLC members in the past had threatened to submit a
no-confidence motion against the PNA to the PLC for voting,
saying the PNA had not implemented the long-promised reforms
following charges of high-level corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had promised in the past to reshuffle the cabinet and
remove those corrupted ministers from the cabinet, but no
reshuffle has been made so far due to political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is on an official visit to Italy, signed with the
Italian government on Friday an agreement under which Italy will
provide 20 million U.S. dollars of aid to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The PLC, formed in January 1996, has a total of 88
members.

<HEADLINE> Iran Appeals for New Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Industries
Gholamreza Shafei on Saturday called for new foreign investment
in order to reinvigorate the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Iran-Austria Joint
Economic Commission, Shafei said Iran welcomes new foreign
investment in its industries in order to realize its main goal
of gaining a bigger share in the world trade.
</P>
<P>
A recent report showed that Iran's share of world trade has
shrunk from 2.3 percent in 1975 to 0.34 percent in 1995, while its
non-oil exports only make up 0.06 percent of the world trade. It
was announced last month that Iran's total exports stood at 18.824
billion U.S. dollars, of which only 3 billion dollars were from
non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the country's strong dependence on oil
incomes, the government of President Mohammad Khatami has pledged
to introduce reforms in order to transform the oil-dependent
economy to a healthy one.
</P>
<P>
Shafei said that Tehran's appeal for foreign investment was
also aimed at creating more job opportunities for the young
generation. Official figures show that 800,000 young people will
join the country's labor force every year since 20 million of the
country's 60 million population are between 11 and 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is interested in new investments to produce (spare)
parts, and presently has cooperation with France and South Korea
in this field," Shafei said.
</P>
<P>
On the Iranian-Austrian trade, he noted that the two countries
can cooperate in using the existing facilities to increase
trade. For example, Austria can take advantage of Iranian
transportation facilities to access the Central Asian markets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for Iranian-Austrian cooperation in developing
Caspian Sea oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting, Austrian Economic Minister Johann
Farnleitner expressed hope that Austria would succeed in
introducing Iran's many capabilities in economic and trade sectors
to the European Union (EU) and thus to lay the groundwork for more
Iran-EU cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Austria will try to enhance the Iran-EU dialog through
bringing about a change in Europe's political outlook of Iran,''
he said, adding that Austria is prepared to train the young
Iranian population how to achieve industrial and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian official also called for Vienna-Tehran cooperation
in transportation, sugar, paper and auto parts industries as
well as in environment and forestry sectors.

<HEADLINE> Fernandez Double Lifts Mexico to 3-1 Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A second-half double from striker Luis
Hernandez lifted Mexico 3-1 over a 10-man South Korea in a Group E
match of the World Cup finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ha Seok Ju converted a free kick in the 28th minute to put South
Koreans ahead 1-0 but he was expelled from the pitch two minutes later
for tackling Jesus Ramirez from behind.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans mounted all-out attacks since then but failed to
produce any result before a well-organized Korean defence.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts finally paid off six minutes into the second half,
when midfielder Jesus Ramirez kicked off a corner kick toward the goal
mouth.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Ricardo Pelaez jumped up but his head missed the ball,
which was deflected by South Korean midfielder Kim Do Keun before
landing in Pelaez's path.
</P>
<P>
Pelaez surged ahead to slot the ball home past goalkeeper Kim Byung
Ji.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, the blond-haired forward who plays for Mexican club
Necaxa, then showed his killer instinct on the pitch in the 75th
minute, lobbing the ball into net pass Korean keeper Kim Byung Ji on a
long pass.
</P>
<P>
He was on target nine minutes later, blasting a 18-meter shot home
after receiving a pass from his Necaxa teammate Cuauhtemoc Blanco.
</P>
<P>
Blanco, who also made several scoring attempts, amused the Mexican
fans with his acrobatic frog-jumping pass when he was sandwiched by
two South Korean defenders.
</P>
<P>
Austrian referee flashed three yellow cards in seven minutes in the
first half of this fast-paced and volatile game.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Lee Min Sung and Mexicans Jaime Ordiales and Alberto
Aspe Garcia were the ones cautioned.

HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The national measles vaccination
campaign in Zimbabwe is estimated to have reached over 80 percent
of the targeted children aged from nine months to 14 years,
according to Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency at the weekend,
the minister said despite the fears that the program would not
manage to cater for all the people, it had been very effective
with more children being immunized.
</P>
<P>
Because of the successful drive which ends Sunday, Stamps
said, the country would reduce the risk of measles infection.
</P>
<P>
The 14-day national immunization program has been launched by

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Provides More Chances for Returned Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- When Dr. Shan Xueyi returned to
this east China metropolis after he finished his studies in
automatic control at a university in Britain, he did not expect to
be put in charge of technological research at the hot-rolled plant
of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex.
</P>
<P>
He found a solution to a temperature problem in the laminar
flow of the hot-rolled process, which saved the company some one
million-yuan losses a year.
</P>
<P>
Shan said, "An energetic city with a high-growth rate in China,
Shanghai provides many opportunities for returned students from
abroad to show their talent."
</P>
<P>
Shan is just one of the 16,000 returned students from overseas
who have started their careers in Shanghai. In the past two
decades, the city has sent 80,000 students to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Shanghai Municipal Government has enacted a
number of policies for opening various sectors for returned
students to find opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Duan Qihua, a lawyer who studied in the United States for five
years, returned to Shanghai to set up the Duan &AMP; Duan Law Office
in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that, as the first of its kind in the country, the
office has successfully handled a number of transnational law
suits, and now it has a branch office in Seattle in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liangyu, deputy mayor of Shanghai, said that the city
needs a large number of talented people who know international
economic practices in the process of turning the city into an
international economic, financial and trade center by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"The returned students from abroad constitute a major force in
Shanghai's development," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 returned students are now working in Shanghai's
educational institutions, and they have become backbones in this
sector.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Haishan, an official of the Shanghai Municipal
Commission, said that in the 39 universities and colleges in the
city, more than 80 percent of the presidents and directors of
departments have been selected from among returned students.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than half of the returned students in the city
work in foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The returned students are also encouraged to set up their own
businesses. There are now 570 enterprises run by returned
students, with a total investment exceeding 100 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Cuts down Budget by One Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- President Rafiq Tarar has asked
his staff to reduce expenditures of the Presidential House by one
third and returned 20 million rupees (450,000 U.S. dollars)
allocated for the Presidential House in the 1998-99 budget.
</P>
<P>
The steps, taken five months ago by Tarar after assuming his
Presidency, include reduction in the presidency staff,
entertainment expenditure, gift fund and personal expenditure,
according to a report Sunday by the News Network International, an
independent news agency in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources from the Presidential House as saying
that Tarar has reduced 60 percent of employees in the Public Wing
of the Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
He has also decided to use Falcon aircraft instead of Boeing
737 for his domestic tours.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the number of employees in the Public and
Personal Wing of the Presidential House have been reduced to 584
from 980.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-98 budget, an amount of 1.2 million rupees
(27,000 dollars) was allocated for presenting gifts to various
dignitaries. Former President Farooq Leghari had already consumed
half of the budget while President Tarar spent only 100,000 rupees
(2,270 dollars) and returned the rest of 500,000 rupees (11,350
dollars) to the government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is complete restriction on official daily
lunch, and serving of pastries and other refreshments with tea to
guests have also been banned, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
President Tarar has also removed lancers from the Presidential
House and electric lights remain off after office hours. For the
first time in Pakistan's history, the President and his staff
offered hadj on their own expenses.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Saddened by Situation in Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is saddened
by latest developments in Guinea Bissau where rebels led by the
sacked armed forces commander, Ansumane Mane, are seeking to
topple the elected government.
</P>
<P>
David Mpamba, Zambian Minister of Information and Broadcasting
Services and Chief government spokesman, Sunday described the
rebels in the tiny west African country as a "disgrace to
Africa".
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency (ZANA) Sunday quoted Mpamba as saying
that the people of Guinea Bissau are now being subjected to
suffering and displacements because of selfishness, greed and
lust for power by a few disgruntled elements in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
all peace-loving people worldwide to condemn the rebellion in
Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
He called on Africans to fight for the elimination of
injustices among the people and the uplifting of people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Heavy shelling has been reported since last Friday in Guinea
Bissau where rebels led by Brigadier Mane is seeking to topple
the government of President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion broke out after Mane was fired by President
Vieira six days ago for alleged negligence in the case of army
officers accused of smuggling arms to rebels in the southern
Senegalese province of Casamance.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Alessandro Del Piero criticized Italian
television coverage on Sunday for alleged insinuation that he was
unhappy with Roberto Baggio's equalizer against Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Junventus striker, who sit out the Thursday's match on bench,
was infuriated by images broadcasted on the Italian televison which
suggested he was nonchalant when Baggio converted the spot kick.
</P>
<P>
"I was very much disappointed with the way some of the media, not
the written media, covered the way I reacted to Baggio's penalty," Del
Piero told a news conference at Italy's training base in Senlis, about
50 kilometers north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to me excessive," Del Piero said, adding that the
televsion only showed shots of him four minutes after the goal.
</P>
<P>
"They suggested I wasn't celebrating. But what am I supposed to do,
keep my arms in the air until the end of the match? People who were
sitting with me saw how I reacted to the goal. I was as pleased as
anyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Del Piero was nursing an injury prior to the game and his place in
the midfield was hence occupied by Baggio.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Civil rights leaders and politicians called for an end to
racial violence Saturday as hundreds of mourners crowded into a
sweltering, tiny church for the funeral of a black man who, police
say, was brutally killed by white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton Saturday mounted defense of

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Frustrated with Israeli Intransigent Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Sunday expressed frustration with Israel's intransigent policy,
which he said doomed the latest U.S. peace plan and plunged the
peace process to extreme danger.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hope that Israel accepts the American peace
initiative that calls on it to withdraw from over 13 percent of
the West Bank," Moussa said after a meeting here between President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the talks between the two leaders
centered on the Israeli attempt to "go around with and change" the
proposal to avoid making the stipulated withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the Israeli side only takes action to weaken,
minimize or trifle with the elements of the American initiative, a
matter the Palestinians do not accept," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the peace process as a whole has come to a
halt and that Israel was taking very "grave" measures, including
the Jewish settlements, which mean the creation of militants, an
invitation to violence and the use of violence.
</P>
<P>
"Once you provide radical Israelis with weapons you cannot
blame the other side for defending themselves. This is very
dangerous and like playing with fire to the maximum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat has said more than once that enough is enough and that
the Palestinians cannot go any further because the situation is
really very dangerous," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
In this condition, the Egyptian diplomat said Mubarak will hold
contacts with a number of Arab leaders within the next few days to
raise the subject with them.
</P>
<P>
Asked if U.S. threats to wash its hands of the peace process
were serious, Moussa said that it was not in the U.S. interest to
do so, but it would be beneficial if Washington announces its
position.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is extremely upset, but concerning the U.S. role as
the main sponsor of the peace process, we hope that it continues
as the honest broker," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived early in the day in the latest of frequent
visits he made to Cairo since the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
were bogged down 15 months ago over Israel's construction of
Jewish housing units in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Right-Wing Party Objects Further Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading Israeli far-rightist
party reaffirmed its opposition to a major troop redeployment in
the West Bank which is reportedly being considered by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National Religious Party (NRP)
which is a major coalition partner, told Israel Radio that his
party's central committee will decide whether it will leave the
government if a 13 percent pullback for the second redeployment is
approved.
</P>
<P>
The NRP is a religious party that still embraces the ideology
of Greater Israel, a belief that Israel must retain control over
the land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Likud-led coalition has only a slim majority of 61
seats in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament), and the NRP, which has
nine Knesset seats, can easily bring down the government if it
votes with the opposition in future no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, if more than 61 Knesset members vote
no-confidence against any government decision, the government must
step down to pave the way for new elections.
</P>
<P>
The NRP's spiritual mentor, Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, told
Netanyahu Saturday night that if a major second pullback is
carried out, he will try to persuade the NRP to pull out from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was insisting that neither the right nor the left
would unseat his government, saying that once he makes a decision
on the pullback, he could convince all coalition partners and the
public to support it.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently under increasing pressure from both the
Palestinians and the United States, which ask him to hand over 13
percent more of the West Bank in the second redeployment to revive
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the right-wingers within his government strongly oppose any
withdrawal of more than 9 percent, citing this will endanger the
security of Israel.

Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of CPC Central Committee, said that it is a trying experience for
most workers to accept the fact of being laid-off, find themselves
a new job and cope with problems in their new employment.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the success and achievements of the workers
in the re-employment programs testify to the fact that they can
overcome difficulties and establish themselves in new work
positions with the help of the government and the support of
society as a whole, as long as they acquire a sound understanding
of the market economy and are willing to take their chances.
</P>
<P>
Wei urged publicity departments at all levels to promote these
model workers so as to facilitate the working of the re-employment
program and help state enterprise reforms as well.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Publicity Department of the CPC Central
Committee and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, these
representatives of former laid-off workers have lectured across
the country since mid-May. Their stories and experiences have
inspired other workers to take up challenges and opportunities in
the course of state enterprise reform.

<HEADLINE> Acid Rain Growing Serious in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Nine cities in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are plagued by acid rain, a
recently released bulletin on the region's environmental situation
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The nine cities include this capital of the autonomous region,
Liuzhou, Guilin and Wuzhou. Most of these cities have
concentrations of industrial plants and consume large amounts of
coal each day.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the average pH (a measure of acidity
and alkalinity) of the air in these cities was 5.1 in 1997, a
decrease of 0.24 over the level in 1996, which reflects a
significant increase in acid level. Rainfall with a pH lower than
5.6 is regarded as acid rain in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the nine cities also had more frequent
occurrences of acid rain last year, with an average rate of about
53 percent, 7.5 percentage points higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
High-sulfur coal fuel consumption, which constitutes 70 percent
of the region's energy consumption, is believed to be the main
cause of the aggravated acid rain situation, according to the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The acid rain situation has been getting worse and the area it
affects has been getting larger since the late 1980s, said Chen
Baiping, director of the supervision department of the Guangxi
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Nanning has taken steps to tackle the problem since 1995, and
has succeeded in reducing the discharge of sulfur dioxide into the
air by over 10,000 tons each year.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Score Hard-Fought Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Gabriel Batistuta gave twice World
Cup winners Argentina a hard-fought 1-0 over World Cup newcomers Japan
in a Group H match here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta, the ace striker of Argentina, took advantage of
Japanese defender's error to beat the goal-keeper with a volley shot
at the 28th minute.
</P>
<P>
Before the match, the Japanese coach Takeshi Okada said his team
had the ability to beat Argentia. The 25 minutes of play seemed to
prove his prediction.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese team surprised their opponents with a fast passing
game and dominated the midfield thanks to their Asian Player of the
Year Hidetoshi Nakata.
</P>
<P>
But the experienced Argentine team soon fought back and forced
their first corner at the 26th minute.
</P>
<P>
The high-spirited Japanese refused to back off and the Argentine
team took the chance to launch quick counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
At the 28th minute, an Argentine attack caused a chao in front
of the Japanese goal. The Japanese defenders tried to clear the
ball only to see Batistuta picked up the ball within the area and
beat the goal-keeper with an easy volley.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine team had more scoring chances in the first half
but Ariel Ortega squandered them.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw the Argentine team dominate most time of the
playing. But the Japanese players refused to give up and put up
desperate attack in the last ten minutes.
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a second-half substitute, had the best chance to level
the score for Japan at the 88th minute but his shot was blocked by
Argentine defender.
</P>
<P>
Later on Sunday, the other Group H match between Jamaica and
Lens will be played at Lens.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The publisher of a moderate
newspaper Ali Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami was released Sunday after
five days in detention, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of Tehran Judiciary Department Saeed Nobari said Khorrami,
managing director of Gozaresh-e Rouz (Daily Report), was released
on bail, adding that the investigation is continuing and the file
will go to court upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Khorrami was detained on June 9 soon after his newspaper was
banned for reprinting an article from an Arab publication claiming
Iranian government officials are transferring foreign capitals
abroad.
</P>
<P>
IRNA also quoted an informed source as saying that Gozaresh-e
Rouz's Editor-in-Chief Mohammad Aqazadeh was summoned by a court
immediately after Khorrami's release.
</P>
<P>
Gozaresh-e Rouz, a new and popular daily newspaper published by
IRNA's journalists, has come under fire of the conservatives in
recent weeks, who accused it of launching a pro-Western "cultural
campaign."
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the license of another moderate newspaper
Jame'ah (Society) was also revoked by a court for publishing
"defamatory and untruthful articles."
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper is continuing publication pending a final
verdict from the appeal court.

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert, sent off
in a group game against Belgium Saturday night, said he elbowed
Lorenzo Staelens reacting to the provocative remarks from the Belgian,
local press reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"He said something that really affected me. I can't say what but it
was a stupid thing for me to do," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert said Staelens had referred to a matter in Kluivert's past.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed a tangling tumble of the duo in the 80th
minute, which eventually led to Kluivert receiving the third red card
of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Staelens offered his hand to Kluivert after standing up but was
ignored by Kluivert, who then elbowed Staelens in the chest.
</P>
<P>
The Italian referee Pierluigi Collina, after consulting the
linesman, gave Kluivert the red card for violent conduct.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert will be banned from the next two matches against South

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific, Dragonair Take Part in HK New Airport Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- One Cathay Pacific aircraft and
two from Dragonair took part in the final full-scale operational
trial of the new Hong Kong International Airport here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is scheduled to open on July 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
A newly-arrived Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-300 (HIB-HNH), which
is the longest commercial aircraft and the first such aircraft to
have been delivered in the world, touched down at the new airport
at Check Lap Kok to the north of the Lantau Island, at 11:35 a.m.
It stayed for about three hours, to be used to test such ground
services as baggage and cargo offloading, cabin-cleaning,
refueling and technical inspection facilities.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft returned to the existing Hong Kong airport at Kai
Tak at 2:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Two Dragonair's Airbus A320 aircraft made their first take-off
and landing at Chek Lap Kok. The two passenger airliners took off
from the Kai Tak airport and ferried over to land at Chek Lap Kok
without passengers onboard at 12:00 noon and 7:00 p.m., to
practice traffic control system as well as support operations
during the daytime and evening hours. Dragonair was the first
airline to practice evening take-off and landing at the airport.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Express cargo plane also participated in the trial by
landing at 1:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
On May 2 this year, a Cathay Pacific's designer-painted
B747-200 aircraft named "The Spirit of Hong Kong" became the first
wide-bodied aircraft to land at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
But it was a small aircraft of the Hong Kong Government Flying
Services (GFS) that became the first aircraft to land at the Chek
Lap Kok facility, on February 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The airport is able to handle up to 35 million passengers and 3
million tons of cargo in its first 12 months of operation.
Ultimate design capacity is 87 million passengers and 9
million tons of cargo, making it one of the busiest airports in
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
had 287 enterprises involved in the environmental protection
industry, with 35,000 employees, 915 million yuan of fixed assets
and nearly four billion yuan of output value in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry includes environmental
protection equipment manufacturing, construction of environmental
protection facilities and related services.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry appeared first in Shaanxi
in the 1970s. The province's environmental protection enterprises
produce equipment for noise suppression, water treatment and
energy saving.
</P>
<P>
This industry is one of eight major burgeoning industries in
the province, and enjoys a series of preferential policies
regarding funds, technology transfer, market promotion and
taxation.
</P>
<P>
In the coming three to five years, Shaanxi will promote ten
environmental protection enterprises with annual output values of
over 100 million yuan each, 30 with annual output values of over
50 million yuan each and 50 with annual output values of over ten
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is expected to earn seven billion yuan in total annual
output value from the environmental protection industry by the
year 2000, and 30 billion yuan in total annual output value by the
year 2010.

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A star-studded English team will
play Tunisia on Monday with only one goal in their mind -- grabbing
three points from the African underdogs.
</P>
<P>
Without any injury worries, head coach Glenn Hoddle now has to
decide who will pair up with star striker Alan Shearer in their first
Group G game.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has reaffirmed his faith in the New Castle player, saying
Shearer is vital to England's campaign here.
</P>
<P>
"If you are going to do well you've got to hit the back of the net
and no one in our contry is better and more proven at international
levgel than Alan Shearer," said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle added, "I would go as far as to say that this is the
sharpest I have seen him -- probably sharper than before the injury --
and in world terms this tournament will find out how good he is."
</P>
<P>
However, Hoddles is facing a dilemma in choosing between teenager
talent Michael Owen and Teddy Sherringham to augment the English
attacking force.
</P>
<P>
England's youngest international this century, the Liverpool star
started for England in their recent 1-0 win over Caen but he could not
be compared to Teddy Sherringham in experience.
</P>
<P>
England is also brimmed with midfield talents, including another
Liverpool player Paul Ince and expert crosser David Beckham from
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian coach Henry Kasperczak will pin their hope on the four
players playing in Europe, wishing their overseas experience would
boost their chance.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Zoubier Beya, who plays in German club Freiburg, will
mastermind the Tunisian attack.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Invites Hamas to Join PNA Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has asked Hamas to discuss the
possibility of joining his cabinet, but Hamas said this matter
has to be decided by its leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by a PNA official in Gaza on Sunday when
asked by Xinhua to confirm the reports that Arafat has invited
Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) to join his cabinet as part
of a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has forwarded Arafat's request to Hamas officials
in Gaza on Saturday. Arafat wants to meet Hamas leaders as part
of wide-ranging discussions across the Palestinian political
spectrum on forming a new government, the official said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Executive Committee in Gaza on Thursday, Arafat agreed to
reshuffle his cabinet. The decision came days ahead of a June 15
deadline set by the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) for
Arafat to reform his administration over alleged corruption and
mismanagement or face a no-confidence vote in the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked the PLC Saturday to delay a no-confidence vote for
10 days pending a cabinet reshuffle, which the PLO officials said
could be announced on June 25.
</P>

Q: Could you tell us your first impressions since you started
working in the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
A: I'm filled with reverence and awe as I came to the U.S. when
the Sino-U.S. relations reached a crucial point linking the past
to the future. I think my work is mainly to make friends, which is
both pleasant and arduous.
</P>
<P>
In the past two-and-a-half months, I've made acquaintances with
not a few U.S. government officials, senators, representatives and
key figures in the press, business and other circles. I've also
visited some states, cities, towns, universities and cultural and
academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
One distinct impression is that people of various circles in
the U.S. share a broad common understanding on the importance of
the Sino-U.S. relations. They all agree that China and the
U.S. have major common interests in the new international
situation and that normal Sino-U.S. relations are in the interest
of the two peoples and are significant to the security and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and even the whole world.
I've met, dined or held sessions with 60 of the 535 members of the
U.S. Congress. They are all very friendly and hold China to be an
important country. But there are also some others who know very
little about or have deep prejudice against China. For example,
ignorant as they are about Tibet's geographical position, its
basic history and present situation, they have elaborated in
bombastical talks on the so-called Chinese government's violation
of culture and human rights in Tibet. Some people, with never a
glimpse at the clauses of religious freedom in China's
constitution, made fierce attack on the "religious persecution" in
China. Some, with no knowledge even of the "four great inventions"
of ancient China, nor of the fact that modern Chinese scientists
have developed rocket-launch technology through their own efforts,
cooked up stories about U.S. companies illegally transferring
missile technology to China. To them, I can hardly show my
appreciation. It needs much efforts and time from both countries
to help these people truly understand China.
</P>
<P>
I recently visited President Clinton's home town Hope as well
as Fayetteville and Littlerock where he once studied and worked.
Wherever I went, I was moved by the people's friendliness towards
China. I met some of Clinton's childhood friends and his
fellow-townsmen, who all were proud of Clinton's upcoming visit to
China. This illustrated in one aspect that the U.S. people cherish
Sino-U.S. friendship. The people's feelings are the soil to the
flowering friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Here is another interesting anecdote. Rabbi Arthur Schneier,
president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation in the U.S., who
was recently received by President Jiang in Beijing, highly values
Sino-U.S. friendship while at the same time is fully aware of the
difficulties in further development. At our first meeting, he
expressed sympathy for me on the difficulty of my work. He told me
about his experience, saying that there was no need to be nervous
and that with God in heart there would be no fear. I agreed and
said that my God is the Chinese and U.S. peoples. He approved my
words with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
We can see that it goes with the trend of the time and the
aspiration of the people for China and the U.S. to develop Sino-US
 friendship in the common interest of the two countries. There is
no stopping to it despite hardships and complications. In this I
firmly believe.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Woman Convicted of Failing to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli court Sunday
convicted 23-year-old Magret Harshefi of failing to prevent her
friend Yigal Amir from murdering former prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv Magistrate Court ruled that Harshefi knew about
the intention of Amir, a fellow law student at Bar-Illan
University, to assassinate Rabin, but did nothing to stop him.
</P>
<P>
The court stressed that the ruling was based on Harshefi's own
testimony, which was given on her free will.
</P>
<P>
Court judges said there were contradictions in Harshefi's
testimony. On the one hand, she claimed that she viewed Amir's plan
as "fantasy" and did not take it seriously; on the other hand, she
made a call to Amir's home immediately after the news of the
murder was reported.
</P>
<P>
Harshefi will be sentenced in September and could face up to
two years in jail. Her attorney said she would probably appeal the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
The woman was acquitted of a second charge of aiding Amir in
his effort to obtain weapons illegally for use against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Amir is serving a life sentence for murdering Rabin.

<HEADLINE> Collection of Chinese Musical Relics Through 8,000 Years Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bone flutes some 7,600 years old,
the oldest musical instruments unearthed in China, are included in
a 12-volume collection of musical relics, the first of its kind to
be published in China.
</P>
<P>
The famous 2,400-year-old Zenghouyi Chimes, unearthed in
Suixian County in central China's Hubei Province, representing the
advanced technology of casting bells in ancient China, are also
included in the collection along with other musical relics over a
8,000-year history.
</P>
<P>
The 12 volumes are the first in a 31-volume series. They
include nearly two million characters and over 5,000 photos and
pictures presenting Chinese musical relics from the New Stone Age
to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), including actual
musical instruments, decorations on utensils, stone carvings,
paintings, sculptures and murals.
</P>
<P>
"The musical relics discovered in China have promoted the study
of Chinese musical development, and helped solve many puzzles in
Chinese musical history," said Wang Zichu, editor-in-chief of the
collection.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It used to be believed that the musical system of
seven scales was introduced to China from ancient Persia. However,
the 7,600-year-old bone flutes found in Wuyang County in central
China's Henan Province have seven holes in them, enabling the
player to master seven scales."
</P>
<P>
The compilation of the first 12 volumes of the collection, a
grand project initiated by the Academy of Arts of China, State
Cultural Relics Bureau and Institute of Archaeology under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has taken over ten years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has carried out a large-scale
investigation of its musical relics. Many relics included in the
collection are new discoveries, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The other volumes in the series are expected to be published
within ten years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Must Do More to Help Asia Out of Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States were
urged by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa to do more to
help stabilize the troubled Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Asia Australia Institute in Sydney Sunday
night, the visiting chief executive said Japan, as the largest
economy in Asia and the second largest in the world, "must do more
to help stabilize the region by maintaining positive growth and
stability in the yen."
</P>
<P>
"The recent dramatic fall in the value of the yen is very
damaging, not just to Asia but to the economy around the world,"
Tung told a high-powered audience of about 200 businessmen and
politicians, including former prime ministers G. Whitlam and Bob
Hawke.
</P>
<P>
"I know we in Hong Kong and the leaders in Beijing have been
urged by many around the world to maintain stability of our
currencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be similar urgency in stabilizing the yen," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to economic stimulus packages, the Japanese
Government must urgently come out with credible policies in the
reform and liberalization of her banking sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The (Asian) financial crisis cannot be solved by official
funds alone. The IMF (International Monetary Fund) must provide
funding and conditionality, in combination with voluntary
rollovers by private sector banks."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there is still U.S. legislative reluctance to
provide capital to the IMF."
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time not to provide adequate water to the
global fireman", he said.
</P>
<P>
On other essential conditions for an Asian recovery from the
current crisis, Tung said, "there must be clear signs that the
Asian economies are generating trade surpluses, instead of
deficits."
</P>
<P>
He said the stability of the (Chinese currency) Renminbi and
the Hong Kong dollar must be maintained as the anchors of currency
stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"No one should doubt the tremendous sacrifice that both Hong
Kong and the mainland of China are bearing to prevent the problems
of currency depreciation from escalating."
</P>
<P>
He said: "everyone in Asia must press ahead with reforms to cut
out the inefficiencies and post-bubble effects that led to the
Asian crisis."
</P>
<P>
Tung, who arrived in Australia Sunday morning for a three-day
visit to Sydney and Melbourne, also spoke about how Hong Kong had
coped with the turmoil through its strong financial position, the
determination to defend the HK-U.S. dollar link.
</P>
<P>
During his address, the chief Executive also briefed the
audience about Hong Kong's first year as a Special Administrative
Region of China, and the successful implementation of the "One
Country, Two Systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
Tung is scheduled to meet Australian Prime Minister John
Howard, Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer,
Finance Minister John Fahey and some state government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Tung will end his visit to Australia on Wednesday and fly from
Melbourne to New Zealand for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Promises to Mediate Eritrean-Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
promised to play a role in halting a major Ethiopia-Eritrea border
conflict, said Eritrea's foreign minister after his meeting with the
Egyptian leader Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak promised to do his best and contact the
Ethiopian side in order to reach a ceasefire between the two
parties and to bring about a peaceful solution to Ethiopia-Eritrea
dispute," Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Woldensae, who arrived here Saturday night amid current efforts
to contain the bloody clashes, delivered a second message within a
week to Mubarak from Eritrean President Issayas Aferwerki.
</P>
<P>
An Eritrean delegation handed a message to Mubarak from
Aferwerki on Wednesday, asking Egypt and African countries to help
in resolving their country's border row with Ethiopia to head off
an explosion in the Horn of Africa. Hundreds of people have been
killed since the fightings broke out between the two former allies
on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting which was also attended by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Woldensae said that Eritrea has
accepted Mubarak's initiative to settle its dispute with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Woldensae's visit came on the heels of one paid to Cairo by
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea accused each other of incursions. Hopes
that U.S.-led mediation would prevent a deterioration were dashed
last weekend as far bloodier clash had occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader had sent two messages to leaders of both
countries, calling for an immediate end to fighting and urging
negotiations to resolve the border row that centers on a 400
square kilometers rocky triangle of land along their western
border.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity decided Saturday to send four
African presidents, of Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Zimbabwe and
Rwanda, to Ethiopia and Eritrea next week in a new initiative
aimed at ending the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest, are at odds
over at least six areas along their common border. Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

Sunday called for further expansion of cooperation between Iran
and Georgia, saying the cooperation would strengthen security and
tranquillity in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Georgian Foreign Minister Iraklii
Menagarichvili, Khatami said that ties between peoples of Iran
and Georgia have deep roots in history, adding that by reliance
on their past the two nations can enjoy a better future.
</P>
<P>

the region in peace and tranquillity, but what is important is
that we wish to see the region in peace," Iranian official news

</P>
<P>
He said that Iran attaches great importance to peace and calm
in the Caucasian region, adding that Tehran highly respects
Georgia's independence and its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Menagarichvili, who handed over a written message from
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze to Khatami, voiced full
readiness of his government and people for expansion and
consolidation of ties with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Unilever to Base China Group in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Unilever, a multinational
consumer goods company, plans to shore up its presence in China
with some major restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company announced in May that it
intends to create a China Group in Shanghai to manage and
coordinate its long-term investment on the Chinese mainland, the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Niall FitzGerald and Morris Tabaksblat, two of Unilever's
chairmen, held a board meeting with five members of their global
team in Shanghai -- the first time that the Unilever board has
ever met outside Britain or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Niall FitzGerald said this fully demonstrates his company's
confidence in China's vast market potential and its determination
to undertake long-term business development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Unilever first came to China in 1923, when it set up a
soap factory in China. In 1980, after China opened up its markets,
Unilever returned. It established its first modern joint venture
in Shanghai in 1986, manufacturing and selling Lux soap.
</P>
<P>
Unilever has so far invested 640 million US dollars in China,
and has set up 12 joint ventures across the country since 1986.
The company employs 6,000 workers in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 Unilever's turnover was 49.7 billion US dollars
globally, and its operating profit was 3.9 billion US dollars. The
company's sales in China hit 3.9 billion yuan (about 469 million
US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Unilever's products range from cleaning products and personal
care items to specialty chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The company's has established a joint research center in
Shanghai with the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry to
produce cosmetics and detergents using traditional Chinese
medicinal herbs, as well as setting up a 600,000-US dollar
scientific research fund together with the Shanghai Municipal
Commission of Science and Technology to promote basic research and
localization of Unilever products.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Satisfied with Start of World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- As more goals scored, big crowds
turned up, few signs of Hooliganism around the stadiums and on
the stands, and clean and neat play put up by players in the first
four days of the World Cup, World governing body of Soccer FIFA is
quite satisfied with the start of France'98.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 goals have been scored in the first 10 games, only
three red cards have been shown in the matches and the crowds have
behaved themselves in the sold-out stadiums.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy with the pace of scoring and the attacking
spirit," said Keith Cooper, spokesman for FIFA.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said FIFA's compaigne against tackle from behind had
worked well:"People express surprise at the lack of red cards, but
it doesn't surprise us at all. We have merely created an
opportunity for players to play football without the possibility of
being tackled from behind. We're very happy that it's working."
</P>
<P>
Cooper was also satisfied with the crowd control measures taken
by the organisers:"This is truly an extension of four years ago in
the United States, and this is exactly what we wanted," Cooper said,
"The atmosphere creates it. The more joyful games you have, the
more joyful games there will be. It builds upon itself."

The Sunday Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Feature: Integrated Trial Preludes Opening of HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Passengers were checking in,
planes were landing, and cargoes were unloaded at the new Hong
Kong International Airport Sunday. It looked as if the airport is
in normal, full operation.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest and most integrated trial operation of the
new airport's airfield, passenger terminal and airport railway
links. The grand rehearsal preluded the opening of the airport,
scheduled for July 6.
</P>
<P>
Everything was "real" in the trial. From eight o'clock in the
morning, "passengers" -- men, women and children carrying big and
small pieces of luggage -- kept arriving and going through the
"in-town check-in" formalities at a downtown train station linked
to the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Other "passengers" traveled to the airport by bus, tour coach,
hotel limousine and private car.
</P>
<P>
After some 20 minutes ride by the Airport Express to Chek Lap
Kok, where the airport is located, the "passengers" were directed
to different terminals by a huge electronic board showing the
"flights" -- to London, Tokyo, Beijing and other cities.
</P>
<P>
A Cathay Pacific aircraft landed around 11:30 a.m., followed by
 the landing of a passenger flight of local airline Dragonair for
boarding at around 12:30 and a Federal Express cargo plane at 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
The day's trial involved some 15,000 people -- 12,000 volunteer
 "passengers" and "greeters" and 3,000 airport staff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Leeks, corporate development director of the Airport
Authority, told reporters at the Fedex cargo unloading spot that
the airport was in full operation during the trial. He said even
the security system was put in place this time.
</P>
<P>
Leeks said the whole system had been "working well" although
the overall feedback would not be available until Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of some sections of the airport structure which are
still under construction, the official said there are "no big
problems" or "crucial items" remaining before the opening on July
6 and most parts of the airport are ready for service.
</P>
<P>
He said the Airport Authority has taken into consideration the
responses of previous trials in conducting this operation.
</P>
<P>
The new airport construction site is situated at the scenery
Chek Lap Kok Island, off the northern coast of Lantau Island, 25
kilometers west of Hong Kong's central business district.
</P>
<P>
The airport is able to handle up to 35 million passengers and 3
 million tons of cargo in its first 12 months of
operation. Ultimate design capacity will be 87 million passengers
and 9 million tons of cargo, making it one of the busiest
airports in the world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The following is a full text of an
interview of Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Ambassador to the United States,
with the official Chinese weekly magazine Outlook, which will be
published on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Q: U.S. President Bill Clinton will soon pay a state visit to
China. As the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., what do you expect
from his visit?
</P>
<P>
A: When I presented my credentials to President Clinton at the
White House on March 16 as the Chinese Ambassador to the
U.S. appointed by President Jiang Zemin, Clinton asked me to
convey his best regards to President Jiang and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said at the moment the two countries should be working
together to create a peaceful and more prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
He also told me that he was looking forward to his visit to
China and meeting again with his old friend President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
After that, he became humorous with me and his subordinates:
You all allow me to go, don't you? The president seems and sounds
really enthusiastic about his China visit.
</P>
<P>
His brief comments indicated the importance of the visit: In
this complicated and volatile world situation and at the dawn of
the 21st century, China and the U.S., as two big powers -- one,
the world's biggest developing country and the other, the largest
developed country, -- share extensively common interests and
shoulder common responsibilities for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Through this visit, the two countries could strengthen their
dialogue and cooperation in safeguarding world peace and
stability. They could also expand exchanges and deepen
cooperation in economic, scientific, educational and many other
fields so that the bilateral relations could make a steady and
healthy progress on the basis of the three joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
The visit will also consolidate the agreement reached by the
two presidents last year which called for commitment to building a
constructive partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the will of the two peoples and also their expectations
of the Beijing summit.
</P>
<P>
Q: This will be Clinton's first visit to Beijing as president
of the United States. How would be the schedule be made for the
president and his wife?
</P>
<P>
A: Chinese people have been well known for their warmth and
hospitality since ancient times. As the usual practice of
receiving foreign heads of state, the Chinese government and
Chinese people will give the Clintons a grand, warm and friendly
reception. It will also be their chance to repay President
Clinton, the American government and the American people for their
hospitality shown to President Jiang Zemin when he visited the
United States last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have both attached great importance to this
unusual visit and have been making careful preparations since last
year, including making detailed plans on official sessions,
meeting with the masses, interviews with the media, learning
Chinese social customs and natural conditions and going
sightseeings.
</P>
<P>
I am sure the visit will be both fruitful and pleasant.
</P>
<P>
Q: How would you comment on the current Sino-American relations?
</P>
<P>
A: Last October, President Jiang Zemin paid a historical visit
to the United States and issued the Sino-US Joint Declaration. The
two sides committed themselves to building a constructive,
strategic partnership and thus established a framework for
developing the bilateral relations oriented toward the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
For the past six months, the two sides have made some progress
in implementing the declaration:
</P>
<P>
On April 29, the two countries reached an agreement on
establishing the direct secure telephone link between them.
</P>
<P>
Officials at both cabinet and sub-cabinet levels have paid
frequent mutual visits to exchange views on the issues of
politics, economy, military, security and arms control.
</P>
<P>
Trade representatives of both countries have held positive and
pragmatic negotiations on China's access to the World Trade
Organization and have made some progress on the matter.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear power market has been opened to the United
States after the two officially began implementing China-US
Agreement on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy.
</P>
<P>
On preventing nuclear proliferation, the two lately reached a
memorandum of understanding on mutual visits to their nuclear
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The United States stopped to present its anti-China bill at the
U.N. Human Rights Conference in March to avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on
setting up a joint liaison group on law-enforcement cooperation,
under which embassies of both countries will start in June to have
law officials in charge of anti-drug trafficking operations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also conducted various exchanges in the
areas of energy, environmental protection, military, science and
education.
</P>
<P>
Noteworthily, the two countries cooperated well, along with the
international community, in handling the recent South Asian
nuclear crisis, including telephone discussions between their
presidents and foreign ministers on the issue.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have also conducted many rounds of
dialogue in an effort to solve the Asian financial crisis and to
stablize the Asian financial situation. They played an active role
in their own unique way in the matter to have won attention from
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Differences exist between the two countries and that is
normal. It will only be unnatural for two big powers to have all
the similar views on all issues all the time. The two countries
can overcome, reduce or put aside their differences through
dialogues on the basis of quality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The question is that whenever the two countries enjoy a good
relationship, there must appear some people who are less than
happy. They always try to drag the Sino-US relations to the mire
of U.S. domestic politics, looking for excuses and finding faults
by all means in an attempt to harm the Sino-US relation. We should
keep guard against them.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are not many such kind of people whose
influence is limited and who are not popular with the majority of
the two countries, because, in the final analysis, the two
countries share more common grounds than differences.
</P>
<P>
No pain, no gain. We know that only through efforts and
setbacks can we further the Sino-U.S. relations. I believe, on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit and in the spirit of seeking
common ground while reserving differences, Sino-US relations will
move ahead in a healthy and vigorous way.

<HEADLINE> China Urges U.S. to Smoothen Technology Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the United States will
do more to remove artificial barriers to its technology exports
and financial credits to China so that their trade imbalance could
be corrected.
</P>
<P>
The hope was voiced by Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Ambassador to the U.S.,
in a recent interview with the official Chinese weekly magazine
Outlook, which will be published on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Li also hoped the U.S. side to further enhance the
competitiveness of its products on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Although statistics released by the two sides are not exactly
the same, they all show that the two-way trade has grown at an
annual average rate of more than 18 percent since 1979, the
Chinese ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the U.S., its direct exports to China have
created more than 300,000 jobs at home and the bilateral trade
provided at least one million jobs for its industrial and service
sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the Sino-U.S. trade, China remained in the deficit
throughout the 1979-1992 period and only moved to surplus as late
as in 1993, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
As for the size of China's surplus against the U.S., Li said
that there is a great difference between the statistics of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Citing the 1996 trade statistics from the Chinese customs, Li
said that China's surplus in that year was only 10.53 billion
dollars. But the statistics of the U.S. commerce department
indicated a surplus as high as 39.52 billion dollars, a figure
definitely exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for this difference, he said, adding
that at least the added value of the re-exports from Hong Kong and
exports by Sino-U.S. joint ventures in China are involved.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, however, are basically
complementary rather than competitive, the Chinese ambassador
stressed.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to the U.S. are mainly textiles, footwear, toys
and other labor-intensive products with low added values, which
are rarely manufactured in the U.S. and have no influence on its
employment, he said. On the contrary, they benefit the U.S. retail
trade and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. exports to China are largely technology-intensive,
such as planes, machinery, electronics and communication products,
he said.
</P>
<P>
With its economic development, China is both willing and
capable to increase imports from the U.S., Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the three years from now, he said, China's imports are
expected to hit 600 billion dollars, which will represents a very
good opportunity for U.S. exports.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Promises to End Goal Drought During World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian superstar Ronaldo said his
goal drought would end during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The ace striker has not scored in Brazil's last four games,
including the World Cup opener between Brazil and Scotland which
Brazil prevailed 2-1.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried," said Ronaldo, "This is a very important
moment in my career and it is not going to be in a World Cup that I
am going to fail to score."
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo averaged two goals per three international matches until
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Before the World Cup, Ronaldo once said he hoped to break the
40-year-old record of 13 goals in a single World Cup set by Frenchman
Just Fontaine.
</P>
<P>
But now he said he was not interested in being the topscorer in
the World Cup. "My main concern is that Brazil win a fifth World
Cup." Ronaldo said.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo has scored 25 goals in 38 internationals. The last time
he scored for Brazil was in the warm-up match against Germany.

<HEADLINE> Colombia More Concerned about Giving Top Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombia coach Hernan Dario Gomez, whose
team will face Romania in Group G opener here on Monday says he is
more concerned that his players give 100 percent than suffering a
loss.
</P>
<P>
What Gomez put his team through on Saturday was a punishing
120-minute training session at their base 50 kilometers south of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
Striker Faustino Asprilla left the pitch with his right leg
strapped in ice but he was expected fit for the game.
</P>
<P>
The Parma player has amazing dribbling skill and killer instinct
before the goal and is Colombia's major scoring hope.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Carlos Valderrama, the veteran with distinctive organge
haristyle playing his third World Cup, said Colombia would face a
tough game in their first appearance in Group G.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever has the goal-scoring opportunities has to take advantage
of them and we hope they'll be in our favor. We're confident that
we'll product a positive result."
</P>
<P>
Valderrama, who refused to give any predictions, added that "It
will be a very good game because we are facing a rival that plays very
well."
</P>
<P>
It is also a rival that is aging, which Romanian coach Anghel
Iordanescu worries most.
</P>
<P>
Gheorghe Hagi, Gheorghe Popescu and Bogdan Stelea are now over 30
and seeing their vision, stamina and physical strength dwindling.
</P>
<P>
Iordanescu, however, is confident that their experience would make
it up.
</P>
<P>
"Only an experienced team will be able to get through the group in
France. We're talking about strong opponents like Colombia, England
and Tunisia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several of players at the 1994 World Cup in the United States will
be back in France, he added, and will relish their last chance to play
in the world's top soccer tournament.

<HEADLINE> Q: Will China and the U.S. sign a fourth Sino-US joint communique during Clinton's visit? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A: This question has already been officially answered by the
spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has all along been the most important and the
most sensitive issue in the Sino-US relations, and also one of the
most important topics for discussions at all previous Sino-US
summits. Recently the U.S. government has time and again made
public its commitment to the one-China policy and the three
Sino-US joint communiques while undertaking not to support "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" policy and not to support
Taiwan's independence nor its membership in the United Nations and
other international organizations of sovereignty countries. The
three joint communiques, with the Taiwan issue at their core, have
established guiding principles for the proper handling of this
issue.
</P>
<P>
People have noted that the rumor of a fourth Sino-US joint
communique came from certain corners of the Taiwan island. Those
who spread the rumor may believe they have their own smart and
deep political considerations. But without good grounds, these
considerations have no significance no matter how smart or deep
they are.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar in San Francisco not long ago, I mentioned that a
well-known figure in the European literature history had a saying
of "art for the sake of art," but in foreign relations, there is
little chance of "communique for the sake of communique." As far
as communique is concerned, number does not count. What counts is
perhaps their implementation. The important thing at present is
for the U.S. to faithfully carry out its serious commitments in
the three joint communiques. With this, Sino-U.S. relations will
be free from interruptions by the Taiwan issue and will improve
and develop on a steady basis.
</P>
<P>
Q: The Sino-U.S. trade has been growing for years, but China's
trade surplus against the U.S. has also been expanding. What
measures will China take to reduce its surplus?
</P>
<P>
A: Sino-U.S. cooperation on trade and economy has always
maintained its good momentum. China has become America's fourth
largest trade partner while the U.S., China's second
largest. China is one of the fastest-growing markets for
U.S. exports and vice-versa. Statistics from the two countries do
not match fully, but they all show that bilateral trade has
increased by an annual average of more than 18 percent since 1979,
playing a positive role in their efforts in economic development
and job creation. In the case of U.S., its direct exports to China
have created more than 300,000 jobs at home and the bilateral
trade provided at least one million jobs for its industrial and
service sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the Sino-U.S. trade, China remained in the deficit
throughout the period from 1979 to 1992 and only moved to surplus
in as late as 1993. As for the size of China's surplus, there is a
great difference between the statistics. Take the bilateral trade
in 1996 for example. According to the statistics of the Chinese
customs, China's surplus stood at 10.53 billion U.S. dollars while
that of the U.S. commerce department stood at as high as 39.52
dollars, a figure definitely exaggerated. There are complicated
reasons for this, linked at least to the added value from
re-exports by Hong Kong and exports by Sino-U.S. joint ventures in
China. We'd better leave this topic to experts of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to the U.S. are mainly textiles, footwear, toys
and other labor-intensive products with low added values, which
are rarely manufactured in the U.S. and have no influence on its
employment. On the contrary, they benefit the U.S. retail trade
and consumers. The U.S. exports to China are largely
technology-intensive, such as planes, machinery, electronics and
communications products. We can see that the Sino-U.S. trade and
economic relations are basically complementary and not competitive.
</P>
<P>
With its economic development, China is both willing and
capable to increase imports from the U.S. In the three years from
now to 2000, China's imports are expected to hit 600 billion
dollars, which will bring very good opportunities to
U.S. exports. We will also strive to increase imports ranging from
financial services to farm produce like fruits. Another noteworthy
thing is China's commitment not to devalue its currency rmb, which
not only helps stabilize the financial situation in Southeast
Asia, but also assists in preventing further imbalance of the
Sino-U.S. trade.
</P>
<P>
Relations should be complementary. We hope the U.S. side will
also do more in easing man-made restrictions on its technology
exports and financial credits to China and enhancing further the
competitiveness of U.S. products on the Chinese market.

<HEADLINE> Q: Could you tell us your first impressions since you started working in the U.S.? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A: I'm filled with reverence and awe as I came to the U.S. when
the Sino-U.S. relations reached a crucial point linking the past
to the future. I think my work is mainly to make friends, which is
both pleasant and arduous.
</P>
<P>
In the past two-and-a-half months, I've made acquaintances with
not a few U.S. government officials, senators, representatives and
key figures in the press, business and other circles. I've also
visited some states, cities, towns, universities and cultural and
academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
One distinct impression is that people of various circles in
the U.S. share a broad common understanding on the importance of
the Sino-U.S. relations. They all agree that China and the
U.S. have major common interests in the new international
situation and that normal Sino-U.S. relations are in the interest
of the two peoples and are significant to the security and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and even the whole world.
I've met, dined or held sessions with 60 of the 535 members of the
U.S. Congress. They are all very friendly and hold China to be an
important country. But there are also some others who know very
little about or have deep prejudice against China. For example,
ignorant as they are about Tibet's geographical position, its
basic history and present situation, they have elaborated in
bombastical talks on the so-called Chinese government's violation
of culture and human rights in Tibet. Some people, with never a
glimpse at the clauses of religious freedom in China's
constitution, made fierce attack on the "religious persecution" in
China. Some, with no knowledge even of the "four great inventions"
of ancient China, nor of the fact that modern Chinese scientists
have developed rocket-launch technology through their own efforts,
cooked up stories about U.S. companies illegally transferring
missile technology to China. To them, I can hardly show my
appreciation. It needs much efforts and time from both countries
to help these people truly understand China.
</P>
<P>
I recently visited President Clinton's home town Hope as well
as Fayetteville and Littlerock where he once studied and worked.
Wherever I went, I was moved by the people's friendliness towards
China. I met some of Clinton's childhood friends and his
fellow-townsmen, who all were proud of Clinton's upcoming visit to
China. This illustrated in one aspect that the U.S. people cherish
Sino-U.S. friendship. The people's feelings are the soil to the
flowering friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Here is another interesting anecdote. Rabbi Arthur Schneier,
president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation in the U.S., who
was recently received by President Jiang in Beijing, highly values
Sino-U.S. friendship while at the same time is fully aware of the
difficulties in further development. At our first meeting, he
expressed sympathy for me on the difficulty of my work. He told me
about his experience, saying that there was no need to be nervous
and that with God in heart there would be no fear. I agreed and
said that my God is the Chinese and U.S. peoples. He approved my
words with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
We can see that it goes with the trend of the time and the
aspiration of the people for China and the U.S. to develop Sino-US
 friendship in the common interest of the two countries. There is
no stopping to it despite hardships and complications. In this I
firmly believe.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Referee Set to Be Out of World Cup </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian referee who awarded a
penalty kick to Roberto Baggio is set to be out of the World Cup
finals as FIFA thought his performance was unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Lucien Bouchardeau ruled that Chilean defender Ronald Fuentes had
deliberately handled the ball when Baggio flicked it on to his hand.
</P>
<P>
Baggio converted the penalty kick and secured a vital point for
Italy in the match against Chile.
</P>
<P>
A senior member of the referees' committee confirmed:"Bouchardeau
has been given a severe dressing down by the FIFA adjudicators. No
one can believe he gave the penalty. I Would not expect him to
referee any more games."
</P>
<P>
FIFA will give each referee at least one game and then assess
their performances individually before deciding who will referee the
later stages of the first round matches.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA spokesman said:"It's possible that the weaker referees
may get to referee one of the meaningless games in the later stages,
but that's yet to be decided. If we were unhappy with their
performance then they won't referee again."

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Lebanon Criticize Israeli Policy in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Lebanon have criticized
Israel for putting hurdles in the Middle East peace process, the
Voice of Arabs radio reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based radio, Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul-Salam Majali blamed Israel for obstructing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian cause, including establishing an
independent state with Jerusalem as the capital, has won worldwide
support as a result of the "rational stance" adopted by the Arabs
in advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Israel's closest ally in the Arab world, has recently
been criticizing the intransigence and hardline policy of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In another interview with the radio, Lebanese Defense Minister
Mohsen Dalloul accused Israel of cheating at the peace process
while the Arabs are working to rescue it.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul affirmed his country's efforts to seek a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He lambasted an Israeli proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon
conditionally, calling it a "deceitful" policy aimed at separating
Lebanon from Syria in their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel decided to endorse the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for a unilateral
withdrawal from Lebanon. But it called on the Lebanese government
to negotiate security arrangements for border areas before it
pulls back troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, have rejected the proposal. They insist that the
withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is ready to resume peace talks with Israel provided
that the negotiations are picked up from where they have been left
off, Dalloul said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrilla groups.

the United States in the World Cup finals here on Monday, they would
hear stronger notes amid a Symphony from the New Continent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's assisstant coach Rainer Bonhof said their main threat in
the Group F game would be 24-year-old American Claudio Rayna, the

"Tactically they are more experienced. Before they had good players
but they tended to work on their own. Now they are more of a team and
they work much better together."
</P>
<P>
German head coach Berti Vogts could not agree more.
</P>
<P>
"The match here have shown that standards at the top of the game
are getting closer and closer. You can't tal about small teams any
more."
</P>
<P>
But first of all, the Germans have to shake off their fame as slow
starters in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 1990 finals in Italy where they crushed Yugoslavia
4-1 in the opener, the formidable German chariot is reluctant to
accelerate in the first stage.
</P>
<P>
Since this time they will face a much stronger Yugoslavia again in
their second group game, the clash with the Americans is no doubt
important.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have just met twice before, with Germany winning both
in 1993 friendly series in the United States.
</P>
<P>
American midfielder Cobi Jones, a star of 1994, said he relished
being an underdog and was inspired by teams who had defied the
experts.
</P>
<P>
"You see Scotland come out and do well against Brazil, and Morocco
do so well against Norway and Chile against Italy," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
"These situations, where team were meant to go out and kill other
teams, do not happen. Our time's coming up," he added.
</P>
<P>
American coach Steve Sampson seemed to no longer have to worry
about injuries in the team, with midfielder Frankie Hejduk to be fit
to play a half after recovering from a hamstring problem and striker
Eric Wynalda recuperating from knee surgery in April.
</P>
<P>
Vogts, on the other side, is expected to rest veteran sweeper
Lothar Matthaeus on the bench and field Olaf Thon instead.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear up to now whether Vogts will play
experienced midfielder Thomas Haessler, who is thought to be picked
along with Andy Moeller.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cancels Reporters' Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran has canceled a visit by a
group of reporters to the United States after conservatives'
protests, the Farda (Tomorrow) daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Issa Saharkhiz was quoted by the daily as saying that one
reason for the cancellation is that the visit is politicized after
the American side arranged for the Iranian reporters an interview
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has reportedly confirmed that
Albright has agreed to an interview with the Iranian reporters.
</P>
<P>
The American Institute of the Middle East Insight has invited
the Iranian journalists to attend a seminar under the title "Iran,
the U.S. and the Middle East Issues," which is scheduled to
open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The planned trip to the U.S. by the Iranian reporters has been
severely criticized by the conservatives, who believe that the
interview with Albright would not serve the interests of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's plan to dispatch journalists to the U.S. came after the
visits to Iran by several American cultural and scientific
delegations following Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's call in
January for cultural dialog between the two peoples in a bid to
break their "wall of mistrust."
</P>
<P>
Washington has been pursuing containment policy against Tehran
since the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979. It broke up
diplomatic ties with Iran after radical Iranian students occupied
the U.S. Embassy in Iran and took staffers hostages in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo for Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat arrived here early Sunday for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has postponed the Cairo visit scheduled for Thursday due
to his engagements. He began a two-day official trip to the
Vatican and Italy on Friday and then postponed his visit to
Tunisia until after he makes a brief stop in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, the two leaders will discuss the outcome of Arafat's
recent tour in several Arab countries to lobby support for an Arab
summit meeting to form a unified response to the long-stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders, responding to Arafat's repeated calls, are
holding intensive contacts over the convocation of such a summit
but still yet to reach agreement on its venue, timing and agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said last week that such a gathering
needs good preparation and coordination to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made his case in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, last week
when he attended the African Summit. Upon his return to Gaza
Wednesday, he said that "we" are still following up the issue with
Arab heads of state and that contacts are still on with most of
them.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks broke down in March 1997 when
Israel began work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem. Israel has rejected the latest U.S. proposal on an
Israeli second phase redeployment from 13.1 percent of the West
Bank, which Arafat has accepted.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An AIDS virus carrier who
intentionally transmits the deadly virus to another person in
Kuwait will face a sentence and a fine, the Arab Times newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Convener of the Kuwaiti National Committee for Fighting AIDS
Hind Al-Shoumer was quoted by the paper as saying that the
offender will be sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and fined
23,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shoumer said that AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, is a deadly infectious disease.

Under Kuwaiti laws, health departments are empowered to enforce
testing on people who are suspected of carrying AIDS virus even if
they refuse to take the tests.
</P>
<P>
And the health departments are obliged to inform the other
spouse about the disease after detecting the AIDS virus in any
spouse.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shoumer said AIDS patients would be allowed to receive
treatment overseas under the condition that they tell the health
departments upon their return to Kuwait.
</P>

The Interior Ministry would deport an AIDS virus carrier should
the health minister so ordain, she added.

<HEADLINE> STD Cases Decrease in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Cases of sexually-transmitted
diseases (STD) in Zimbabwe went down over the past year although
the figure still remains high, according to a senior health
official.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the Sunday Mail, Manager of the
National Sexually-transmitted Infection Control Program, Owen
Mugurungi said that the STD cases reported in all government
hospitals and clinics last year were 814,032 against 838,697 at
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The actual number could be even higher since the figure did
not take into account the people treated in private clinics and
hospitals, according to Mugurungi.
</P>
<P>
Mugurungi said although the figures had stabilized between
800,000 and 900,000 cases a year from 1994 to 1997, they were
still too high and his organization's immediate task is to reduce
the cases to 100,000 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that 92 percent of all people with STD who were
tested for HIV infection were positive.
</P>
<P>
About 96 percent of HIV transmission was done through sexual
intercourse and STD continued to be a major contributor to
HIV/AIDS cases, with the sexually-active 15 to 45 years age group
constituting more than 50 percent of the total cases reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugurungi said that the STD cases ranked among the top five
causes of out-patient hospital and clinic attendances, and top
four lifestyle illnesses, which included alcohol, tobacco and
accidents.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization revealed that an estimated 333
million new cases of curable STDs were recorded worldwide every
year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Interior Minister Ready to Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri has announced his readiness to face the challenge
of impeachment raised by a group of conservative Majlis
(parliament) deputies, an Iranian daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm preparing myself for the response to the objections
raised by the deputies against my conduct as a minister," Nouri
said in a letter to Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I need to use the time law permits me for the
preparation of my case," the pro-moderate daily Iran News reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 Majlis deputies on Wednesday demanded an
impeachment of the interior minister, accusing him of creating
tension in the society, making provocative statements, issuing
permits for demonstrations which ended in violence and appointing
inexperienced people to managerial posts at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Majlis regulations, Nouri should stand in
front his challengers within 10 days. It is believed that the
Majlis would hold a hot debate over Nouri's fate on Sunday since
Friday and Saturday are holidays for the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an informed source close to President
Mohammad Khatami as saying that the president would attend the
Majlis session personally. Khatami showed his strong support for
his interior minister soon after the impeachment was raised.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed Nouri as a "capable and outstanding personality
of the Islamic system," saying that he believed Nouri has the
necessary capability to elaborate on the stance and issues
related to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment of the interior minister, one of the pillars of
Khatami's government, was believed to be another step launched by
the conservatives against the moderate president and his
government, after Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, Khatami's
another strong supporter, was put on trial on corrupt charges last
Sunday.

HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe National Army Major
General Mike Nyambuya has said army chiefs are worried about the
rising acts of indiscipline within the army.

has remained professional, army headquarters remain worried by
some acts of indiscipline, theft of rations, losses of equipment
and motor vehicle spare parts in the army," the Zimbabwe News

</P>
<P>
Nyambuya said, "These undesirable misdemeanors are taking an
upward trend and some concerted effort need to be put in place to
stamp out these crimes."
</P>
<P>
But he said that efforts are being made to secure external
training in order to improve the capacity of the corps to deal
with increasing sophisticated crimes.
</P>
<P>
All army officers, needed to improve themselves through
attending military and non-military courses, said Nyambuya.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Hails UN Move for Rescuing Abducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
hailed the move taken by the United Nations Representative for
Children in Armed Conflicts, Olara Otunnu, to rescue
Ugandan children abducted into Sudan by rebels of the Lord
Resistance Forces (LRA).
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government encourages the U.N. move in this
direction, the New Vision newspaper Sunday quoted David Pulkol,
the Director-General of External Security Organization, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Government encourages all those who can contribute to help
release those innocent youths," Pulkol said. "Otunnu is
privileged to try to end the suffering of these children as he
does to other children all over the world."
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, a former Ugandan Minister of Foreign Affairs, is
reported to hold talks with all parties concerned in order to
halt the involvement of children in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. figures, there have been 8,000 to 10,000
children kidnaped from northern Uganda by LRA rebels spearheaded
by Joseph Kony.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 LRA rebels recently stole into the northern districts
of Gulu and Kitgum.
</P>
<P>
They abducted villagers and used land mines to loot goods from
vehicles on main roads.
</P>
<P>
To curb the rampant rebel activities, the government deployed
heavy military presence in the north.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Ugandan government has decided to increase its
defense spending by 26 percent in its new budget in a fresh
counter-attack against the rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese in the eastern province of
Bekaa Sunday began voting in the fourth and final round of the
first municipal and mayoral elections in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army tightened the security measures in key
intersections and around polling stations in order to avoid riot
or violence related to the polls.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry statement said no serious security
problems were reported in the previous rounds of elections, except
some minor fist scuffles which had led to the arrest of more than
150 people.
</P>
<P>
The polls started at 7:00 a.m. (4:00 a.m. GMT) and will close
at 5:00 p.m. (2:00 p.m. GMT) and counting of votes will be
finished late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fiercest race in the polls is expected in the provincial
capital of Zahleh, the largest Catholic-inhabited city of the
Middle East, between candidates backed by President Elias Hrawi, a
Maronite Catholic, and those backed by his elder son George Hrawi
and Greek Catholic parliament member Elie Skaff.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
spearheads a guerrilla war to oust Israel from an occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, will confront a formidable coalition of
Amal movement, headed by House Speaker Nabih Berri, and the
National Syrian Socialist Party and the Communist party.
</P>
<P>
They will compete for the control of the ancient city of
Baalbek, the one time major tourist attraction of pre-civil war
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Islamic Coalition, the nation's largest Sunni
militant faction, and the outlawed Lebanese Forces, the
Christians' main militia during the 1975-1990 civil war, were the
three major winners in the past three rounds of elections which
were held on four consecutive Sundays starting from May 24.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,662 members for 646 municipal councils, and 2,041
mayors and chiefs in 1,282 towns and villages will be finally

<HEADLINE> Pudong's Exports Continue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The export value of the Pudong
New Area in this east China metropolis surged 23 percent in the
first five months of this year to reach 1.65 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure was lower than the over-30 percent growth
in the first quarter, said an official from the local foreign trade
bureau.
</P>
<P>
Exports of traditional items such as textiles and garments
dropped considerably, while those of mechanical and electrical
products increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asian countries recorded a big reduction compared
with last year's same period, but those to Europe and the United
States rose rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The export volume is expected to keep a rising momentum in
the upcoming months as a result of continued industrial growth and
readjustment of the export structure, the official said.
</P>
<P>
But exports from state-owned foreign trade companies is likely
to decline in the near future owing to the impact of the Asian
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Primary Education Week Begins in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

Besides, the compulsory union and sub-district compulsory

</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina

</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative to attaining universal primary

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Continue Advancing Northwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's government troops continued
advancing northwards from their earlier held positions in general
area Mankulam in the Northern province of the country, a military
spokesman here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops were supported effectively by artillery and
aircraft of the Sri Lankan Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels launched three physical counterattacks with rocket
propelled grenades, machine guns and small arms.
</P>
<P>
The troops repulsed the counterattacks effectively with armor
causing heavy casualties among the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Fighting lasted for about four hours. However, the spokesman
gave no casualties and other details.
</P>
<P>
Troops' artillery continued to engage the rebel targets in
depth adding to terrorist casualties, he added.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting took place after the troops continued their
advance to recapture the strategic Mankulam town on its way to
clear a 75-km route between the North and the South launched in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government for a separate state in the north and east of the

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Imports to Surge This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to raise steel
imports this year due to a massive investment plan launched by
the Chinese government, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Although steel imports have remained stagnant so far this year,
the rapid development of industries like construction, electrical
appliances and ship-building will strongly boost domestic demand
for steel products, said Meng Guirong, president of the China
Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers
and Exporters(CCCMC).
</P>
<P>
As much as 750 billion US dollars in investment will be
injected into infrastructure projects within the next three years,
and the real estate industry has been chosen by the central
government as one of the major growth points of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The on-going reform of the welfare housing system will further
ginger up the construction industry, and hence the demand for steel
products.
</P>
<P>
A considerable proportion of the market demand will come from
imports, due to a mismatch between types of steel products demanded
by the market and those supplied by domestic manufacturers, Meng
said.
</P>
<P>
He forecast this year's total steel import will surpass 10
million tons, though the figure may be smaller than last year's
13.23 million tons.

<HEADLINE> China to List More Firms Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China will list more enterprises
on overseas market, while considering ways to attract more foreign
investors to the country's B share market, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will deepen its security reform and enhance
supervision to ensure the healthy development of the security
industry, which is expected to play an active role in fulfilling
the country's goal of 8-percent economic growth this year,
said the newspaper quoting a top securities official.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of China Securities Regulatory
Commission(CSRC), said that China will stick to its policies of
raising funds through international capital market despite
negative impacts of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has brought both challenges and opportunities,"
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China has started to select a fifth batch of
firms for overseas listing and will issue the list in the near
future. The sixth batch of candidate firms should be published
before the year end, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country will expand selection to allow more
large enterprises with good profits, advanced management and
strong development potential to be listed abroad.
</P>
<P>
He added that overseas listings will mainly concentrate on the
Hong Kong Market. Although the market plunged this week, he said
he is confident that Hong Kong market will rebound in the future.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China will also select some good enterprises to
be listed on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
So far, 43 enterprises have been listed on overseas markets,
collecting more than 10 billion dollars for Chinese state-owned
enterprises, and enhancing the status of Hong Kong as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Expressing serious concern over the bearish mood in B share
trading, Zhou said that CSRC will consider taking measures to
activate B share market, such as perfect pre-selection rules,
examination and approval standards and supervision regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has just started drafting regulations for
establishment of Sino-foreign securities funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted that CSRC will concentrate on establishing an
effective risk-control system over the securities market, and push
for an enhanced legal framework for the securities system this
year.

<HEADLINE> Rural Areas Need More TVs and Fridges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Rural China with a population of
nearly 900 million is a huge potential market waiting for
electrical appliance producers to arrive, today's China Daily
quoted an industry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Feng, deputy secretary-general of China Household
Electrical Appliances Association, said that China's burgeoning
electrical appliance industry should focus on developing rural
markets as urban consumption stagnates.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent investigation conducted by the State
Information Center, household electrical appliances account for
38.64 percent of rural household spending in the first half this
year.
</P>
<P>
The rural demand focuses on color TVs, refrigerators and
washing machines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China's rural areas had 20.54 washing
machines, 7,27 refrigerators and 22.91 color TVs per hundred
households in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional appliances will still be the rural household's top
choice in the coming years due to the current low saturation
level," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
But many farmers still can not afford the current prices of
household appliances, despite recent price plunges, he added.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that domestic producers should develop a series of
low-cost products suitable to the rural market.
</P>
<P>
The State Information Center's report indicated that 31.38
percent of sample rural households plan to buy TV sets this year,
with 23,22 percent want washing machines and 19.46 percent favor
refrigerators.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Foreign Investors Refrain From Exerting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia welcomes foreign
investments but refuses to allow investors to use their economic
power to exert political influence in the country, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that foreign investors were welcomed to the
country and make honest profits from their ventures but they
should refrain from exerting political influence.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want foreign investors to come to gain benefits only
for themselves and even prepare to play a role in determining the
leadership and other issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was not the business of the foreign investors to do so, said
Mahathir when launching a national youth's carnival to raise money
for the National Special Fund at the Independent Square here.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people in the country were capable of
determining their own leaders and managing their country
politically.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Malaysia was peaceful and
prosperous due to the efforts by the people in the country and not
only because of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "Our own people could also help to assist the
country and this could be seen today when they respond to the call
by the government and strive to free themselves from pressures to
import goods by producing items for the domestic market, heading
for local tourist destinations and buying local products."
</P>
<P>
"We will manage our economy so that we will remain free and our
independence will not be affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that it was the responsibility of all Malaysians
to ensure the sovereignty and independence of the country.

MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iceland President Olofur

for Lithuania's bid for a NATO membership on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in Vilnius, Lithuania, at a joint

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Americans to Share Country with Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Saturday called on Americans to share the country with immigrants
and accept that in the coming century there will be no majority
race in the nation.
</P>
<P>
"We should share our country with immigrants, not shun them or
shut them out," the Associated Press quoted the president as
saying in a commencement address Saturday to the graduating class
of Portland State University, Oregon.
</P>
<P>
However, "Unless we handle this well, immigration of this sweep
and scope can threaten the bonds of our union," he told about
3,000 graduates, of which 5 percent are citizens of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants must do their part to be full citizens, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks highlighted an emerging theme of his
second-term agenda: persuading Americans that ethnic and cultural
diversity can be a strength for this country, and that America
should set an example for the world, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic pride is a very good thing," he said. "But pride in
one's ethnic and racial heritage must never become an excuse to
withdraw from the larger American community. That does not honor
diversity, it breeds divisiveness. And that could weaken America."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Clinton said immigrants represent the spirit
that built this country: a drive to succeed, a commitment to
family, a hope for a better life.
</P>
<P>
But some Americans wrongly see immigrants as a threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the nation is in the midst of a new wave of
immigration that is the largest in a century, and more diverse
than any in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
"Today, largely because of immigration, there is no majority
race in Hawaii or Houston or New York City," he said. Within five
years, he added, there will be no majority race in California, the
most populous state in the country.
</P>
<P>
"And in a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority
race in the United States," Clinton said. "No other nation in
history has gone through demographic change of this magnitude,
over so short a time. It can either strengthen and unite America
or weaken and divide us. We must decide."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Helps Child Offenders Begin New Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has launched a program
to speed up the rehabilitation of convicted child offenders,
Sunday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, convicted child offenders will be given
specialist rehabilitation in an effort to turn them away from
crime.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters committing minor crimes will be sent home but will
be told to regularly report to social workers.
</P>
<P>
More serious juvenile criminals will be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis. And those guilty of robbery or rape and other
serious crimes, including repeated offenses, will be sent to a
special rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
Vicha Mahakun, deputy chief justice of the Central Juvenile and
Family Court, was quoted as saying that splitting up the juveniles
would prevent them from being influenced by their peers.
</P>
<P>
In the past, juvenile criminals were sent home regardless of
their crimes or their age.
</P>
<P>
The program advocates a more humane approach when juveniles are
sent home. Staff and warders would be taught to handle them more
gently and improve their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Adisai Ahapanun, a senior social worker with the Justice
Ministry, said the aim was to change the attitude of staff so that
they viewed juveniles not as "young criminals".
</P>
<P>
Visa Benjamano, director of the Child Welfare Protection
Division of the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, suggested that
the ministry train staff to work as social workers and
psychologists.

<HEADLINE> Baht Stable Despite Yen's Plunge: Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chatumongol Sonakul, governor of
Thailand's central bank, has said the baht remained relatively
stable with no signs of speculative activity despite the week-long
continued fall of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The yen reached an eight-year low last Friday, testing 145 to
the dollar before strengthening late in the day to end at 144.5.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded late Friday at 43.37/47 to the dollar,
compared with 43.12 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed Friday's slide in regional currencies and
equities markets to the release of Japanese economic figures which
showed that the country is officially in a recession.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 1.3 percent in
the first quarter, the second consecutive quarter's fall, the
internationally recognized definition of recession.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the baht held fairly steady against the dollar
and trading activity was normal although the yen continued to
slide.
</P>
<P>
Regulators were closely monitoring trading activity in the
foreign exchange markets and were prepared to take action to deter
speculation, said Chatumongol, quoted by a TV report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Friday closed down 4.55
points at 279.37 on thin trade worth 1.1 billion baht (26 million
dollars). The market posted losses for six days in a row, with the
SET index now at an 11-year low.

<HEADLINE> China to Invite Bids for Transformers for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) --The Three Gorges Project developer
will invite bids from domestic and foreign firms for transformers
and other equipment to be used by the project late this year or at
the beginning of next year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new tender will include fifteen 500-kilovolt transformers,
gas-insulated switching gear, and other equipment to be used in
the left-bank powerhouse of the project, the newspaper quoted
Zhang Geng, General Manager of the Three Gorgers International
Tendering Company (TGT), as saying.
</P>
<P>
TGT is a subsidiary of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corp., the developer of the gigantic Three Gorges
water control dam that will be built on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
While observing the principle of "open bidding, fair
competition and honest evaluation" , TGT will give priority to
domestic products if their quality can fully satisfy the demands
of the project. But some key appliances, including large
transformers, will be purchased form international bidders.
</P>
<P>
The general manager stressed that international commercial
loans and export credit will remain indispensable for the
international bidders to win the contract, and foreign government
loans will be especially welcome.
</P>
<P>
It will also be necessary for foreign bidders to pass on their
top technologies to Chinese counterparts as part of the process,
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign firms have already expressed interest in the
bidding, and the developer has conducted technical discussions
with some of them.
</P>
<P>
TGT is also ready to launch bidding for monitoring and control
equipment for the left-bank powerhouse next year, according to the
general manager.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects G-8 Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- India termed the reference to
Indo-Pakistan disputes in the joint communique of the Group Eight
countries as coercive and intrusive, and regretted that the G-8
decided to block fresh loans to India.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry said Saturday
night that India can not consider any prescriptions which had the
effect of undermining its independent decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman complained that major industrialized countries
did not respond to India's "positive gesture" made in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the G-8 foreign ministers repeated
unrealistic prescriptions couched in the language of pressure in
London.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out third party involvement of any kind whatsoever in
India-Pakistan talks, claiming that India remained committed to
developing a framework of peaceful relations with Pakistan through
a broad based and sustained bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In response to Pakistan's offer for a moratorium on nuclear
testing as well as peace talks, India Friday proposed June 22 for
the resumption of the dialogue between the two neighbors at the
foreign secretary level in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan quickly rejected the proposal as "traditional
gimmickry" and accused India of sabotaging the dialogue between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The India spokesman listed the recent positive gestures made by
New Delhi including a moratorium on nuclear testing, its
willingness to explore ways and means for de jure formalization of
this undertaking, readiness to engage in negotiations on a fissile
material cut-off treaty and continuance of strict export controls
on nuclear-related materials and technologies.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of regret that the G-8 foreign ministers joint
communique has not taken into account these proposals but has
instead repeated unrealistic prescriptions, couched in the
language of pressure," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
India would continue to take decisions on the basis of its own
assessment and national security requirements, he added.

<HEADLINE> No Travel Ban for Soeharto: Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- There had been no request from
Indonesian authorities to stop former president Soeharto traveling
overseas, The Sunday Observer quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Immigration Office only just waits for requests. Up to now
there has been no request to ban Soeharto," said Justice Minister
Muladi Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said he was sure Soeharto would stay in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general, Finance Ministry or military headquarters
all have the power to request travel bans which are administered
by the Immigration Office.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and his family have been the focus of public criticism
since he stepped down on May 21, accused of accumulating massive
wealth during his 32 years in office.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general office recently launched an investigation
into the wealth of former government officials, including Soeharto
and his family.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Soeharto had hired Yohannes Yacob, an
Indonesian lawyer, to represent him during the attorney-general's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Yacob told Antara News Agency Saturday that he had met with
Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro in his capacity as
Soeharto's legal representative.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yacob said, he submitted to the attorney
general a number of documents about the foundations managed by or
linked to Soeharto.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Soccer Has A long Way to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's soccer will have a long
way to go before it could compete seriously with the best in the
world, says a Canadian soccer expert.
</P>
<P>
The country failed to qualify for the ongoing World Cup in
France, it was beaten, even by the Caribbean island of Jamaica,
where a mere 10,000 play the game.
</P>
<P>
Eric King, former executive director of the Canadian Soccer
Association, suggested it could be two more generations before
Canada can realistically compete with the best as today's kids
carry a love of soccer into adulthood and teach it to their
children.
</P>
<P>
Only then will there be the solid base of soccer-first
Canadians to demand more television coverage, to deserve better
facilities and to command enough attention to attract big money
from sponsors, King said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the lacklustre status quo of Canadian soccer to
"a high standard of living" in the country, where kids go to the
cinema or play games instead of playing their way out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor is that soccer is still perceived in
Canada as a game played by foreigners, King said in a newspaper
interview published here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
For now, Canadians for whom soccer is a religion are likely to
be Canadians born into a soccer culture, such as
Italian-Canadians, Brazilian-Canadians and Scottish-Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"These people still support the visiting team when it comes to
play Canada," King noted.
</P>
<P>
The soccer expert predicted that it "will take two generations
before the game is embedded in this country."

SAN JOSE, June 13 (xinhua) -- Costa Rica earned 310 million
U.S. dollars from tourism during the January-April period, 15.2
percent up from the same period of 1997.
</P>

percent, reported the Costa Rican Tourism Institute (ICT) on
Saturday.

The United States and Canada led the increase in the number of
foreign tourists to Costa Rica. Travelers from the United States

<HEADLINE> Clinton's China Trip: A Fresh Impetus to Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- In less than two weeks' time, Bill
Clinton will be the first U.S. president to touch down in Beijing
since 1989, and the visit, high on the agenda of the host as well
as the guest, is to bring new driving force for their relations.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. Warm up for Another Summit
</P>
<P>
A new stage in the expansion of Sino-U.S. relations began with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's travel half way around the world
on an official visit to the United States between October 16 and
November 3 last year. It marked the returning of the bilateral ties
back onto the track for steady, healthy and lasting growth.
</P>
<P>
Since Jiang's U.S. tour, high-level exchanges, dialogues and
cooperative efforts between the two countries have been striking a
positive tone and proven fruitful on new grounds, creating an
atmosphere favorable to Clinton's upcoming visit to
China. Noticeable developments are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- High ranking Chinese and U.S. officials have been meeting at
a high frequency rare in the past. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and other
Clinton administration officials have toured China since the
beginning of the year. And in April alone, four U.S. officials
above the vice-ministerial rank were in Beijing. In addition,
during Albright's stay in China, the two sides agreed to a
presidential communications link between Beijing and
Washington. It was via this hot line that Jiang and Clinton
recently discussed bilateral issues and developments in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- China and the United States have been working more closely
together in science and technology, economy and trade, and
education and culture. In March, the Sino-U.S. cooperation accord
on the peaceful use of nuclear energy finally came into effect 13
years after it was signed. And earlier in the year, President
Clinton gave green light to U.S. companies for cooperation with
their Chinese counterparts in commercial satellites launching,
paving the way for the Loral Space Systems of the United States
and the Great Wall Industry Corp. of China to sign a multiple
launch services contract, which was signed on March 16. In a
related development on March 26, China's Long March 2C space
rocket successfully carried two Iridium communications satellites
into a low earth orbit for Motorola Corporation of the United
States. Chinese and American scientists also worked jointly on a
project to experiment materials in the space.
</P>
<P>
-- Beijing and Washington have increased dialogues on human
rights issues. In March, the Clinton administration said it would
no longer co-sponsor a resolution against China at the annual
United Nations meeting on human rights. And upon China's
announcement of its plan to sign the Covenant on Political and
Civil Rights, the U.S. side immediately let out positive
responses. Chinese and American religious delegations exchanged
visits in the first quarter of the year, which helped a lot in
deepening mutual understanding on religious and human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
-- China and the United States have also been stepping up
exchanges and cooperation on security issues. During U.S. Defense
Secretary Cohen's stay in China, the two sides forged an agreement
on establishing a consultation mechanism to strengthen maritime
military safety. And right after India's nuclear testing in May,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and U.S. Secretary of State
Albright were over the phone to evaluate the security situation in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- On the issue of Taiwan, an inalienable part of China,
Clinton administration officials have repeatedly reiterated the
U.S. commitment to observe the "one China" policy in line with
principles set forth in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
the joint statement. They have reaffirmed that the United States
will never support Taiwan's independence and its entry into the
United Nations or any other international organizations grouping
together sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
-- In addition, there has been a shift in U.S. public opinions
toward China since President Jiang's U.S. tour, with the
mainstream media taking an approach more objective than in the
past in covering China-related events. More and more Americans are
turning their backs on the China-bashing propaganda operations by
anti-China forces.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Brushes off Opposition to Move Up China Tour
</P>
<P>
In March, President Clinton announced moving up his China tour
from initially planned fall to the current schedule of summer. He
adamantly rejected some legislators' call for postponing or even
cancelling the trip, saying that the tour is too important to be
put off.
</P>
<P>
As the White House's travel schedule shows, Clinton's visit to
China is exclusive, with no stops in other countries. Such an
arrangement reflects the high priority given by the U.S. president
to Sino-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's China Trip: A Fresh Impetus to Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's recognizable that there are some elements of partisan
politics behind Clinton's decision, but it's more likely that the
following factors prompt him to move ahead:
</P>
<P>
-- Firstly, the success of President Jiang's visit to the
United States has laid a solid foundation and created favorable
conditions for the bilateral relations to grow into the next
century. Clinton seems to feel the need to hitchhike on the trend
and push further ahead the strategic partnership between the two
countries. As stated in his recent letter to Jiang, Clinton is
looking forward to visiting China and building on the momentum
gained during the Chinese president's U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
-- Secondly, China's role in stabilizing the Asian economy has
been growing, especially since a financial crisis broke out in
East Asia later last year. China has committed itself not to
devaluate the Chinese currency renminbi and provided billions of
U.S. dollars to help the hardest-hit countries in the region. The
United States, which has mounting business interests at stake in
East Asia, is in need to coordinate with China in search for ways
to lead the region out of the quagmire. As the financial crisis
is still going on, Clinton feels it increasingly urgent to have
China's support in preventing the crisis from preying on the
80-month-old U.S. economic growth. Further more, the United States
is eager to further explore the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirdly, destabilizing elements have been on the rise on the
Korean peninsula and in Southeast and South Asia in recent years,
posing new threats to U.S. strategic interests in the
Asian-Pacific region. The recent nuclear testings by India and
Pakistan have dealt a severe blow to nuclear non-proliferation,
which tops the U.S. global security agenda in the post-Cold War
era. To maintain regional and global security interests of the
United States, the Clinton administration needs to engage and work
with China, a regional heavy-weight in safeguarding stability and
security on the western side of the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
-- Lastly, the emerging trend, at the turn of century, of
building bilateral partnerships among major powers also acts as a
catalyst to Clinton's decision to move ahead his China tour. Since
President Jiang visited the United States last fall, China has
further improved its relations with Russia, the European Union and
Japan, which compels the White House to catch up by rescheduling
Clinton's China trip.
</P>
<P>
Common Interests Outweigh Differences
</P>
<P>
Due to differences in social systems, cultural background and
historical traditions, China and the United States still have
different views on some major issues. It is noteworthy that some
anti-China forces in the United States are doing their utmost to
make noises against the growth of the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Last November, right after President Jiang's visit, the
U.S. Senate passed eight anti-China bills. And recently, the House
of Representatives passed four amendments to curb President
Clinton's policy of constructively engaging China. More recently,
some congressional sub-committees alleged that Clinton's approval
of Sino-U.S. joint satellite launch programs allowed Chinese
access to sensitive U.S. missile technologies.
</P>
<P>
The two sides still differ on trade imbalance, market access
and China's bid for entry into the World Trade Organization. The
United States is continuing to mount pressures onto China on
issues concerning human rights, religious freedom and Tibet. In
addition, some people in the United States view China as a
potential rival in global security and advocate the combination of
"force and respect" when dealing with China. On the Taiwan issue,
some Americans have been trying hard to press China into a
commitment not to use force under any circumstances in the course
of reunification. They also hold that the U.S. policy of arms
sales to Taiwan remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Despite the anti-China noises, the Clinton administration's
policy of engagement and dialogue with China has become even more
popular among Americans, and the call for stronger ties between
the United States and China has been growing even louder,
especially since President Jiang's visit to the United
States. History proves that differences between nations should not
prevent them from cooperating closely since they can always find
out some common ground in pursuit of their own interests.
</P>
<P>
It is our belief that China and the United States can enhance
mutual understanding, broaden consensus and work more closely
together as long as they follow the principles set forth in the
three joint communiques and the joint statement, and take a
positive, pragmatic and rational approach in seeking their common
interests.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Parking Places Headache for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing needs 1.5 million parking
places for the over 1.2 million motor vehicles now running on its
streets.
</P>
<P>
This calculation, carried in Thursday's ``China Youth Daily'',
is based on the theory every car needs 1.3 parking spots, with the
one referring to a fixed place and the other 0.3 to a shared
public place.
</P>
<P>
However, there are only over 50,000 parking places in the
Chinese capital, far short of the practical need. This means 30
cars have to vie for one parking place.
</P>
<P>
As early as in June 1989, the municipal government began to
stipulate that all restaurants of over 1,000 sq m, cinemas of over
2,000 sq m, and hotels, office buildings, shops, hospitals,
exhibition centers, theaters and gymnasiums of over 5,000 sq m
must have parking places or garages built. Those which fail to
meet the requirement will be fined.
</P>
<P>
In a recent move for improvement, the public transport
authorities designated 26 major downtown streets as "demonstration
parking streets". All of the streets have special areas for
parking. By the end of this year the number of such streets will
be increased to 80.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities have stiffened penalties for
violators of parking rules.

BUENOS AIRES, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The aging population of
Argentina's total population went up 0.7 percentage points from
8.2 percent in 1980 to the current 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to reach 10.3 percent by the year of

Argentina's population will be old people, with an average of 20
percent of women and 15.5 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
The report considers as the main causes of the growing aging
population the longer life expectancy and the lower fertility and
mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The INDEC statistics showed that life expectancy in Argentina
grew from 68.9 to 71.9 years during the past 10 years, while the
rate of fertility dropped from 3.3 to 2.9 children per woman, the
lowest in the history of the country.

<HEADLINE> Romania Faithful to Commitments to NATO: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Romania will be faithful to its
commitments and will take action in line with those of NATO as
regards former Yugoslavia, Romanian Defense Minister Victor Babiuc
said Saturday at Otopeni Airport upon his return from Copenhagen
and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Babiuc made the statement commenting on what Foreign Minister
Andrei Plesu had said earlier in an interview with the daily
Adevarul (The Truth), namely "Romania could not fail to honor its
commitments to the Contact Group, if NATO declared war to
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Plesu also said in the interview that the Romanians hope from
the bottom of their heart that military solutions would be shunned
and political dialogue would have the last word. "We are also
against all sorts of separatist movements. Any separatism in our
region is extremely dangerous," he added.
</P>
<P>
Back in Romania after a journey with two stays, Victor Babiuc
said that in Copenhagen he had concluded an agreement on bilateral
military cooperation, and in Brussels he attended the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council meeting, with the agenda
including key issues such as the strengthening of the Partnership
for Peace and the situation in Bosnia and especially in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia Opposes NATO Inclusion of Baltic State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Saturday reiterated Moscow's opposition to Baltic states'
membership in NATO.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who was on a brief working visit to
Lithuania, told reporters in Vilnius that the Baltic countries'
accession to NATO "is not acceptable to us because it creates
certain threats and inconveniences for Russia, affects our
geopolitical and security interests."
</P>
<P>
However, he said Moscow welcomes and supports Lithuania's
integration with European economic structures.
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania's accession to European economic structures is a
decision which does not do harm to anyone," he said. "This is why
Russia supports such an aspiration of official Vilnius."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia has unconditionally pulled out all of its
troops from the Baltic states, thus liquidating its military
presence there.
</P>
<P>
"We have a right to expect that the security of the Baltic
states can be ensured without a deployment of foreign troops which
would take the military infrastructure we have left voluntarily,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia has long been staunchly opposed to the Baltic states'
membership in the alliance, and has offered them security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
However, Lithuanian Parliament Speaker Vytautas Landsbergis
told a delegation of Russian lawmakers early this month that
Vilnius could not accept the security guarantees because it was
not sure that Russia would follow a consistent, democratic path.
</P>
<P>
He said admission into the transatlantic military bloc remains
a foreign policy priority and is supported by all political
parties in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Speaker Slams UNSCOM's Stalling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Saddoun Hammadi Saturday slammed the stalling
tactics adopted by U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament
in Iraq when carrying out its mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said on Saturday evening at a session of the assembly
that Iraq had implemented all the requirements under
U.N. resolution 687 seven years ago, and that the Security
Council should be committed to its reciprocal and moral
obligations toward Iraq by lifting trade embargo as the first
step toward total lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States and Britain are to blame for all the
time that had been wasted previously and for all the damage
inflicted upon the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said that by adopting stalling tactics through
creating excuses and sparking crises, the UNSCOM is a partner in
the crimes committed by the U.S. and Britain toward Iraq people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the UNSCOM has been doing its "dirty mission"
which is financed by Iraqi resources for seven years. During the
past seven years, the UNSCOM has sent altogether 253 inspection
teams to Iraq and conducted 2,553 visits throughout Iraq, Hammadi
said, adding that another 150 monitoring teams have paid 6,500
survey visits in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that these teams have found nothing to prove
the UNSCOM's false allegations, rather they have ascertained Iraq's
declaration that it is free of banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the process of coming and going and the game of
pretexts that have been played by the UNSCOM will not be endless, and
will be resisted by the Iraqi people and all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
While the speaker lashed out at the UNSCOM, UNSCOM Chairman
Richard Butler is in Baghdad to spell out new requirements for
Iraq to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz held the
first round of talks on Saturday morning on what Iraq must do
before sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Kuwait in
1990 can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Butler said here on Thursday that Iraq hasn't provided
adequated information on its biological weapons, and access to
information will be the main task for Iraq to fulfill.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Sanctions on Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official
attacked Saturday the practice of applying sanctions on some
Arab countries, saying the only victims are innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Services and Minister of Information
Abdullah Ensour launched the attack following the Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He referred to countries such as Iraq, Libya and Sudan, which
are all under international sanctions for one reason or another
and are facing subsequent serious economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The minister voiced the kingdom's strong opposition to what he
called "collective embargoes and sanctions," because such harsh
measures only harm the majority of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
It is fully regrettable to see the sanctions expanded to
engulf innocent people for political reasons that the people have
no hand in, Ensour told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government is very concerned about the sanctions
imposed on the three above-mentioned Arab countries and is looking
for ways to help lift them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has signed an annual trade protocol with Iraq, under
which the kingdom is to export 255 million U.S. dollars worth of
food and medicines to Iraq in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian exports are believed to help Iraq alleviate the
economic crisis caused by the United Nations sanctions imposed in
1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also maintains regular trade with Libya, whose volume
stood at 23 million U.S. dollars in 1996. The U.N. imposed
sanctions on Libya in 1992 after Libya refused to hand over two
suspects allegely involved in the Lockerbie air disaster, in which
270 passengers aboard a Pan Am plane were killed in an explosion
in Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan has kept regular official contacts with Sudan
and provided medical and food supplies to Khartoum, which is under
U.N. sanctions since 1996 after it refused to hand over three
suspects allegedly involved in the 1995 assassination attempt
against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Raps Settlement Expansion in E. Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official on
Saturday condemned the latest Israeli decision to build more
housing for Jewish settlers in the disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Ensour, Deputy Prime Minister for Services and
Minister of Information, told reporters after the regular Cabinet
meeting that the Israeli government made its decision in disregard
of the international legitimacy and should be condemned by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Jordan opposes the Israeli government's decision because it is
carried out at the expanse of the "indigenous people," Ensour
said, referring to the dominant Palestinian population in East
Jerusalem which was seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his regret over what he called Israeli
"arrogance" toward the United Nations resolutions and other peace
agreements it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He warned Israel that it is dangerous to continue its policy
of expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
Ensour reiterated the Jordanian position that Jerusalem belongs
to the Arab people and the Palestinians have the right to
establish an independent state with the holy city as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interior Ministry approved on June 9 to build 100
housing units for religious Jewish students near the Mount of
Olives in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest in a series of recent settlement activities
in Jerusalem that have led to violent clashes and escalation of
the Israeli-Palestinian tensions at a time when the peace process
is deeply deadlocked. Palestinian officials have warned about dire
consequences caused by the continued Israeli provocation through
settlement expansion in the holy city.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 13 (XINHUA)-- Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission on disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, held the second
round of talks later Saturday in a bid to solve the last dispute
over the U.N. weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz headed the Iraqi team,
while UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler was leading the UNSCOM
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Director of Iraqi Military Industry, Abdul-Tawab Mullah
Huwaish, Oil Minister Amir Mohammad Rasheed, Presidencial Office
Advisor Amir Al-Saadi also attended the the second meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, the two sides held their first round of talks
at Iraqi Foreign Ministry's building.
</P>
<P>
No details of the first meeting were released, and neither
Butler nor Aziz talked to reporters. But some reports suggested
that progress has been made in the two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi weapons officials said U.N. arms inspectors have already
uncovered enough weapons parts that could prove the Iraqi claims
that it had destroyed and buried its biological and chemical
missile warheads. The UNSCOM is currently examining these parts
before drawing a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here on Thursday, leading a 20-member UNSCOM
delegation, including UNSCOM Deputy Chairman, American Charles
Duelfer and four UNSCOM commissioners from Venezuela, Russia,
Belgium and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The chief weapons inspector brought with him a road map which
lists what information Iraq should provide to prove that it has
destroyed all biological and chemical weapons and give a full
account of its production of VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
Butler complained Thursday that Iraq had not provided adequate
information on its biological program, adding that this will be
Iraq's main task to fulfill before sanctions imposed on it can be
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's First Lady Urges Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's first lady Janet
Museveni Saturday called upon district councils to set funds for
the fight against AIDS/HIV scourge in the eastern African
country.
</P>
<P>
She made the appeal when launching the International
Candlelight and AIDS Awareness Campaign in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
AIDS/HIV is a killer disease, so a full-scale struggle against
it is absolutely necessary, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged the Ugandans to participate in community-based
programs aimed at comforting the AIDS/HIV patients.
</P>
<P>
The first lady stressed the need for community involvement and
commitment, saying the battle against AIDS can only be won if all
members of the society take part in sensitizing each other about
the dangers of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 percent of Ugandans are HIV positive or suffer from
AIDS. About 500,000 people in the country, whose population
stands at 20 million, have died of AIDS since the first case was
reported in Uganda in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Further Oil Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran supports further cuts in
oil output in order to bolster the declining oil price on world
market, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for further cuts if a deal is struck with the
others," Zanganeh said at the end of his short visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iran last week announced plans to cut its oil production by
100,000 barrels per day to boost the oil price following a visit
by Saudi Oil Minister Ali Bin Ibrahim al-Naimi to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh described his talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah as "good," saying they focused on
discussing new cooperation plans in oil production.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for stronger cooperation among all oil
producing countries to shore up the oil price.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Kuwaiti oil minister said oil producing
and exporting nations are facing critical situation due to the
sharp decline in oil price.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real crisis that requires us to make sacrifices
and curb production," Al-Sabah said, adding that producers within
and outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
have to cooperate to improve the market conditions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah announced last Tuesday that Kuwait was prepared to
cut its oil production in an effort to boost the oil price,
which has dropped to low levels between 12 and 14 U.S. dollars per
barrel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iran Sign Protocol on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Iran Saturday signed a
protocol for bilateral cooperation in the fields of industry and
investment, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, signed by Head of the Egyptian Industries
Federation Abdel Monem Saudi and Iranian Chief of Mining, Trade
and Industry Federation Ali Khamoush, aims to increase and
develop trade exchange as well as bilateral cooperation in
industrial and investment spheres.
</P>
<P>
The protocol provides for promoting joint investment,
exchanging data and holding joint exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian trade team, which arrived here on Thursday for a
five-day visit to Egypt, will continue talks with Egyptian
officials and businessmen on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first of its kind in 20 years, comes as the two
countries seek to repair long-strained political ties and frozen
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit followed one made by a delegation from the Egyptian
federation in March this year when the two sides discussed
prospects for holding an exhibition of Egyptian products in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to prepare for the executive steps
for holding the exhibition in a bid to elevate bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish Egyptian-Iranian economic cooperation was the
result of strained diplomatic and political relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government severed its diplomatic and political
relations with Egypt after the late Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's visit to Israel and his peace initiative in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been trying to improve relations with its one-time foe
Egypt, which have strained since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and
worsened over accusations that Tehran was backing Muslim militants
fighting to overthrow Egypt's secular government.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' annual trade exchange in 1997 amounted to 75
million dollars, with Egypt's annual imports standing at 35 million
dollars and exports at 45 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran is currently investing 220 million Egyptian pounds (64.7
million dollars) in seven projects of weaving, carpets, ready-made
garments and banks in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Fernandez Double Lifts Mexico to 3-1 Win (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A second-half double from striker Luis
Hernandez lifted Mexico 3-1 over a 10-man South Korea in a Group E
match of the World Cup finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ha Seok Ju converted a free kick in the 28th minute to put South
Koreans ahead 1-0 but he was expelled from the pitch two minutes later
for tackling Jesus Ramirez from behind.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans mounted all-out attacks since then but failed to
produce any result before a well-organized Korean defence.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts finally paid off six minutes into the second half,
when midfielder Jesus Ramirez kicked off a corner kick toward the goal
mouth.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Ricardo Pelaez jumped up but his head missed the ball,
which was deflected by South Korean midfielder Kim Do Keun before
landing in Pelaez's path.
</P>
<P>
Pelaez surged ahead to slot the ball home past goalkeeper Kim Byung
Ji.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, the blond-haired forward who plays for Mexican club
Necaxa, then showed his killer instinct on the pitch in the 75th
minute, lobbing the ball into net pass Korean keeper Kim Byung Ji on a
long pass.
</P>
<P>
He was on target nine minutes later, blasting a 18-meter shot home
after receiving a pass from his Necaxa teammate Cuauhtemoc Blanco.
</P>
<P>
Blanco, who also made several scoring attempts, amused the Mexican
fans with his acrobatic frog-jumping pass when he was sandwiched by
two South Korean defenders.
</P>
<P>
Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente said, "I am very happy we won, now I
can relax. This was a tough match but we played well and did our
best."
</P>
<P>
He added that he was not feeling more confident because their next
opponent Belgium is "a very strong team."
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Cha Bum Kun said the two-goal margin reflected
the actual strength of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The score of 3-1 shows the difference between the two side." Cha
said. "We scored first with Ha Seok Ju and then he got sent off. We
had to play with ten against eleven and that's the reason for our
defeat."
</P>
<P>
Austrian referee Gunter Benko flashed three yellow cards in seven
minutes in the first half of this fast-paced and volatile game.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Lee Min Sung and Mexicans Jaime Ordiales and Alberto
Aspe Garcia were the ones cautioned.
