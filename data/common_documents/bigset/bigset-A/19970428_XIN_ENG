<HEADLINE> S. Africa Celebrates National Freedom Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today
celebrated the third anniversary of National Freedom Day with the
state leaders vowing to spare no efforts to develop national
economy and improve people's life.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally in Upington, Northern Cape Province,
Mandela said the new constitution promulgated in 1994 was the
cornerstone of the new South African patriotism, and the
framework for undoing the legacy of the country's divided past.
</P>
<P>
"We can say with confidence that the foundation for a better
life has been laid," said Mandela at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We take immense pride and joy in the fact that since April
27, 1994, millions have for the first time experienced access to
clean water, electricity, housing subsidies, free health care,
nutrition programs and land," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an increase of criminal offenses, Mandela urged
every community and sector of society to join hands with the
police to defeat crime.
</P>
<P>
To eliminating crime, it is necessary to improve the living
conditions and eradicate poverty. In turn, that would be made
possible by the success of the country's economic policies,
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki also called on the whole nation
to join hands and wage a struggle against poverty, hunger and
under-development.
</P>
<P>
The struggle should be aimed at strengthening the government's
efforts in addressing problems and challenges brought about by
many years of apartheid, Mbeki said at a rally in Delareyville,
North West Province.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is also need to wage a struggle against
crimes, such as rape, murder and violence against women, Mbeki
added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rules Out President's Immediate Visit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Embassy sources ruled out
that President Suleyman Demirel would visit Egypt within the
coming few days, just hours before the projected visit takes
place, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Demirel's trip here, originally scheduled for Monday, has
been a much-publicized event across the Egyptian press for the
past week.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Turkish Ambassador Bashir Yakbes as attributing the
cancellation of the impending summit between Demirel and his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak to their over-spilling agendas.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts are under way to fix a date of the projected visit in
the light of their engagements," the Turkish ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, is quick to play down the suspicions around
the last-minute announcement, which coincided with an upcoming
visit of Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Yakbes said that the Israeli minister's visit will not
affect Ankara's ties with Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish-Israeli ties are an independent matter and will never
affect Turkish-Egyptian relations," the ambassador said in press
statements published in Riyadh today.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the resolutions taken by the Organization of Islamic
Conference in Islamabad on reviewing Islamic states' relations
with Israel, he said Turkey is committed to Islamic summit's
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has not taken any new step in cooperation with Israel,"
he said, adding that Turkey is just maintaining limited relations
with Israel, which are known to all Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's trip follows Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy's
two-day visit to Ankara in early April. Levy asserted that ties
between the two countries had grown closer in spite of a frosty
reception from Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel but
ties remain cool. Stalled Mideast peace process added tensions to
the strained ties.

HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The governments of African
countries have been urged to ensure that the export processing
zones they are implementing do not result in the exploitation of
the workers by multi-national companies.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by more than 90 delegates who attended the
five-day conference for Southern African Development Community
(SADC) member states on food security which ended in Darwendale
near Harare at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
These zones, delegates resolved, should be monitored to guard
against their promoting international economies at the expense of
labor.
</P>
<P>
Quoting experiences from other countries, experts said some
export processing zones had attracted cheap, docile labor for
multi-national companies which exploited and impoverished their
lives.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive report documenting resolutions on land
reforms, food security and labor issues would be produced for
possible implementation by the respective governments.

<HEADLINE> German President Asks for Forgiveness for Guernica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog today
asked residents of Guernica for forgiveness 60 years after the
northern Spanish town was bombed down by German warplanes during
the Spanish Civil War, a news release issued by German presidency
said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to face up to the past and explicitly acknowledge the
guilty part played by German aviators," said Herzog in a statement
read out by German Ambassador to Spain, Henning Wegener, to a
ceremony in Guernica marking the 60th anniversary of the attack.
</P>
<P>
This represents Germany's first official admission of
responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"I address my message of commemoration, sympathy and grief to
you, the survivors of the attack and witnesses of the horror
endured, " Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, German Nazis
sent bombers of the "Legion Condor" squadron to attack Guernica in
assistance of the troops of Francisco Franco against those of the
Repubicans. The war ended in 1939 with Franco becoming dictator of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
The attack reduced around three-quarters of the defenceless
Basque town to rubble. The death toll was never established, with
estimates ranging from 300 to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
The Guernica attack also represents the first massive air
bombardment of a town or city in the history of Europe. Historians
believe that the raid was used by German Nazis to test air strike
tactics deployed later during World War II.

<P>
HARARE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Prison Service is
upgrading its services and expanding the jail space to
accommodate 4,600 more prisoners as the existing jails can no
longer cope with the soaring crime-rate.
</P>
<P>
Officials said work had already started on four sites for the
new prisons.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that when these institutions are completed they will
go a long way to alleviate our overcrowding problem," said an
official.
</P>
<P>
Although the jails have an ideal capacity of 16,000 prisoners,
Zimbabwe's current prison population is 18,000.
</P>
<P>
Last year there was a presidential amnesty which saw 4,000
prisoners being released to create space in the prisons after the
population soared to 22,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, This proved a temporary solution as most of the
pardoned criminals soon returned.

JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of a petition to
set up a state commission of inquiry to probe the Bar-On affair
said today that they have already collected 50,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, Leah Rabin, widow of late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and her son Yuval Rabin have added
their names to the list of the petition this morning.
</P>
<P>
The organization for the petition was founded last week soon
after Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Attorney Edana
Arbel announced their decision not to indict Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu for lack of sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the police team investigating the Bar-On affair had
recommended that Netanyahu be charged with fraud and breach of
trust in the process of appointing of Roni Bar-On as
attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
Former attorney-general Michael Ben-Yair said that only such a
state commission, headed by a Supreme Court justice, could
provide the public with the whole truth of what took place in the
affair.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the police investigation was not able to
probe the civic aspects of the affair, which were the most
important aspects.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, former prime minister and opposition leader Shimon
Peres also signed the petition. He reiterated his demand that
Netanyahu resign immediately and call new elections.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Calls Federal Election on June 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien announced today that a federal election will be held on
June 2.
</P>
<P>
Chretien made the announcement after formally requesting
Governor General Romeo LeBlanc to dissolve the Parliament and drop
the writ for the 36-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
The election call came three and a half years in the five-year
mandate of the Liberal Government, which swept to power in
October, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that his Liberal Party needs a new mandate to
build on its successes, such as deficit reduction, and prepare the
country better for a new century.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians must now decide what kind of country they want to
build with the hard-won dividend that will be there from our
collective effort to restore health to our public finances,"
Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Jobs and national unity will become the two dominant issues of
the campaign, which involves more than a dozen of parties, but
mainly the Liberals, the Progressive Conservatives, the Reform
Party, the New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls over the past week suggest that the Liberals
enjoy a commanding lead, anywhere from 22 to 40 percentage points
ahead of their nearest competitor the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
That would ordinarily all but guarantee a second majority for
Chretien, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, they also stressed that given so many unpredictables in
campaigns, it's very difficult to foresee how it will all play
out.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Liberal Party won a landslide in the 1993 federal
election, scooping 177 seats in the then 295-member House of
Commons.

<HEADLINE> James Baker Visits West Sahara Refugee Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations envoy for West
Sahara and former United States Secretary of State James Baker
today visited the Sahara refugee camps sheltering people from West
Sahara in the Algerian border town of Tindouf.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that Baker was scheduled to
meet with the leaders of the Polisario Front to discuss with them
the means to relaunch the West Sahara peace process, stalled for
five years since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tindouf is the last leg of Baker's North African
fact-collecting tour, which has already brought him to Rabat,
Algiers and Nouakchott, on his first visit to the region since
being nominated special envoy by United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan in March.
</P>
<P>
Baker said in Algiers on Saturday that his tour was essentially
aimed at making an accessment of the situation in West Sahara, and
that he would write a report on his tour to Annan.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Polisario leaders as saying in a communique that
they were glad to receive Baker and that they were ready to work
with him "to mark out the road of peace."
</P>
<P>
The Polisario also reaffirmed its attachment to the plan by the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
organize a self-determination referendum in West Sahara on the
basis of the 1974 census of the local population by Spain, the
former colonial power of the territory.
</P>
<P>
"This census is the only basis for the determination of the
electoral body," said the Polisario. "The plan of solution of the
United Nations and OAU, fruit of long negotiations, remains the
only compromise to which the two parties have subscribed because
it represents a framework of just, pacific and democratic
solution."

<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Senior experts from 10 member
states of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) met here
today ahead of the Seventh ECO Foreign Ministerial Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The experts are to prepare a draft document that will be
approved by ECO foreign ministers during their meeting here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said that the important issue of bolstering cooperation
among ECO member countries will be brought up and discussed at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the outcome of the gathering would
help ECO achieve its objectives.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the need for implementation of formerly approved
programs, Velayati said that the organization should be directed
toward adopting general agreements in different fields.
</P>
<P>
He added that given potential facilities and capabilities of
the region, the trade level among ECO member states is not
satisfactory compared with their trade with other countries.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade the trade level among the ECO members, he said, it
is necessary to recognize the obstacles hindering expansion of
trade in the region, find ways of removing those obstacles,
revise preferential tariff arrangements and review tariff and
non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
The decisions to be taken by the ECO foreign ministers in
their Tehran meeting will be raised for discussion during an ECO
summit to be held on May 13.

<HEADLINE> East African Cooperation Urged to Admit Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere today asked Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,
the three member states of the East African Cooperation (EAC),
to grant EAC membership to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
At the official opening of the German-East Africa Dialogue in
Arusha, a northern Tanzanian town where EAC was formed in March
last year, Nyerere said EAC should warmly welcome landlocked
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Rwanda has already applied to joint the
East African Cooperation. That country should be welcomed into
the East African family without hesitation," he was quoted by
reports reaching here as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It would be good for Rwanda, good for East Africa and good
for Africa generally," he said. An EAC summit is scheduled to be
held there next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said he was certain that as soon as Burundi has a
legal government on behalf of its people, Burundi would also
apply to join the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
"When that happens - and I hope and pray it will happen soon -
that country should be welcomed with open arms," he told the
participants in the three-day dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the three EAC member nations to be
committed to regional cooperation on the basis of equity which
can be achieved through the organization's choice of projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the region's attempts to build greater
cooperation among African countries, there was a need to have
courage and vision to overcome the difficulties causing by
languages and borders imposed by colonialists.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation is essential for the people and the
governments in the EAC region, he said, adding that it does not
replace the need for national efforts to improve the internal
infrastructures and increase investments.
</P>
<P>
The three-day dialogue has been organized by the Friendrich
Ebert Stifiung in collaboration with the German Science and
Research Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Mideast Peace In Unprecedented Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today the Mideast situation has reached "an unprecedented
state of stalemate" because of Israel's insistence on building new
settlement in Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the statements to chief editors of Egyptian
newspapers accompanying him on his return trip from Saudi Arabia,
at the end of his two-nation Gulf tour to coordinate Arab stances
on the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu still persists in
his intransigent stance which led to this condition... while the
U.S. efforts to break this deadlock have not yet achieved any
definite result," he deplored.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the recent U.N. General Assembly resolution
incriminating Israeli settlements in Jerusalem, Mubarak regretted
that "nothing is achieved in the end despite an overwhelming
majority against the Israeli practices.
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to imbalance in the international relations and
a state of chaos in the international order that is detrimental to
everybody's interests," he warned.
</P>
<P>
It would eventually encourage terrorism and violence, he added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved Thursday by a U.N. General Assembly
emergency session in a vote of 134-3, demands an immediate halt to
Israel's settlement buildings in Arab land and recommends an end
to all forms of assistance for such activities.
</P>
<P>
A day later, Mubarak proposed to host a summit grouping
Jordan's King Hussein, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to reactivate peace.
</P>
<P>
But he said Israel has to stop building the Har Homa
neighborhood first, which has brought the peace talks to a halt.
</P>
<P>
"My readiness should be preceded by a clear-cut and definite
Israeli stance on stopping the construction of new Jewish
settlement in disputed Arab East Jerusalem," Mubarak told the
chief editors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said he opposed holding an Arab summit, which
"requires lengthy preparation and great efforts," as well as a
well-defined objective, which is lacking now.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he discussed with the emir of Kuwait and Saudi
King Fahd during the trip the contacts he has held recently in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is also expected to meet with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad here in a few days, as a completion to the talks he had
with Arab leaders in a bid to salvage the peace march.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on Israel to Implement Oslo Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today reiterated his demand that the current Israeli
government should implement the Oslo Accords signed between Israel
and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remark at a joint press conference with
Israeli Labor Member of Knesset (parliament) Yossi Beilin in
Jericho this afternoon. Arafat charged that Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is not willing to make peace with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also accused the current Israeli
government of continuing to obstruct the peace process and of
destroying all the agreements signed between Israel and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, one of the architects of the Oslo Accords, discussed
with Arafat a plan to revive the stalled peace process. He called
on both the Netanyahu government and the Palestinian National
Authority to build new foundations for the resumption of the peace
process, with the participation of the U.S., the European Union,
Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, who is running for the leadership of the Labor Party,
said that he will bring the proposals to the government.
</P>
<P>
Later, he briefed Miguel Angel Moratinos, EU special envoy to
the Middle East peace process, on his meeting with Arafat. The EU
representative praised the proposals, saying that they were
compatible with the European initiative in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, now on a tour of Palestinian self-rule cities in the
West Bank, arrived at Jenin later this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the U.N. General Assembly adopted a
resolution Saturday condemning Israel for its construction of a
new settlement on Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa). He added that it is
a most important resolution which will help pressure Israel to
change its settlement policy in the Palestinian territories.

<P>
He said that it would be "arrogant and insolent" for himself to
claim the succession of prime minsiter's seat, adding that his
"only ambition" is "to help (the ruling majority) win this
campaign" of elections.

The French media estimated it was highly possible that

BONN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- German police authorities have
tracked down on the Internet a blackmailer who threatened to
sabotage passenger airliners unless he was paid 50 million German
marks (30 million U.S. dollars), a German newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, the blackmailer
sent in March letters to 15 German airports threatening to steer a
remote-controlled model plane into jet turbines of an airliner
with several hundreds passengers on board as it took off.
</P>
<P>
Because the blackmailer conducted all the later negotiations
through the Internet computer network with his own E-mail address,
investigators managed to track him down in the area of Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
Further probe into the case found out that the suspected
offender was a 25-year-old computer freak who was in heavy debt
and had already been detained by police earlier for tax evasion,
the report said.

Abdul-Salam Majali today expressed appreciation to the Israeli
Arabs for their role in supporting Palestinian people's rights in

CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today turned down the speculation that a major cabinet reshuffle
is near.
</P>
<P>
No cabinet reshuffle will take place in the near future,
Mubarak told reporters who accompanied him on his flight home from
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia today.
</P>
<P>
Several issues should be first completed, for instance, the
state budget, before thinking of a cabinet reshuffle, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The reshuffle, however, will be announced at the appropriate
time," he said, returning home following a two-day Gulf tour which
took him to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Egyptian parliament has expressed confidence in
and support for the government of Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri, amid wild speculation that a major cabinet shake-up
is near.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian journalists and political pundits put on
their guessing caps in the past few weeks and spun rumors about a
major shake-up of many of the country's most entrenched ministers.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri's team replaced the government led by former prime
minister Atef Sidki in January 1996 in the last cabinet shake-up.

</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace talks have stalled after Israel's
construction last month of a new Jewish settlement in the disputed
Arab sector of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have frozen since February 1996. The
Israeli government refuses to return the Golan Heights for a peace
deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to meet with al-Assad here in a few days,
as a completion to the talks he had with Arab leaders in a bid to
salvage the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said today the Mideast situation has reached "an
unprecedented state of stalemate" because of Israel's insistence
on building new settlement in Arab land.
</P>
<P>
He made the statements to chief editors of Egyptian newspapers
accompanying him on his return trip from Saudi Arabia, at the end
of his two-nation Gulf tour to coordinate Arab stances on the
stalled peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Councillor on Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Top priority will be given to the
building of basic farmland and rural infrastructure in the work of
poverty relief, and primary leaders at all levels are the keys to
the work, State Councillor Chen Junsheng has said.
</P>
<P>
He called on local officials to do the job in a down-to-earth
manner, during an inspection tour of Luliang Prefecture in north
China's Shanxi Province April 24-28.
</P>
<P>
"There is no short cut for poverty relief, and no big talk, no
cheating or trickery are allowed in this respect," he warned.
</P>
<P>
His investigation and research were focused on the combination
of poverty alleviation and grass-roots Party building, development
of basic farmland, auction of wasteland, and women's role in the
anti-poverty campaign.
</P>
<P>
Experience gained in the prefecture showed that there are many
ways wherewith to overcome poverty, but the must is to have a
staunch village Party branch, he said, adding that poverty relief
divorced from Party building will be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Building infrastructure and improving farmers' skills are the
most important guidelines to better improve the conditions in the
poor areas, he noted, as economic growth in poor areas relies
heavily on science, technology and education.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng called
for more concrete efforts to stop the country's expanding soil
erosion, in a letter to a national conference on soil and water
conservation held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that that it is a long-term task for China to fight
against soil erosion, to keep a sustainable growth of the economy.
</P>

quite limited," he wrote in the letter, "and it is of great
importance for Chinese people's survival and development to bring
soil erosion under control".

<P>
According to sources at the conference, the total of eroded
land that China has tackled in a comprehensive way has reached
about 700,000 sq km over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
But the country's overall situation of soil and water
conservation nationwide has continued to worsen at the same time,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese legislators have worked out laws on water and soil
conservation in order to improve the Chinese people's awareness of
the importance of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li said that governments at all levels should help the
poor farmers to get rid of poverty, and keep a close eye on
environmental protection at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also urged governments at all levels to
take more measures to tighten the supervision of soil and water
conservation, and implement the country's laws on soil and water
conservation in a serious way.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Lauds Achievements in Asia-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the United
Nations Kofi Annan today lauded achievements made in the
Asia-Pacific region over the past half-century, as ministers from
members of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) were meeting here to discuss the future for the
region.
</P>
<P>
"During the past half-century, the Asia-Pacific region has
witnessed a range of dramatic changes: economic, social and
political. It has made remarkable gains in human development,"
Annan said in a message to the opening session of the 53rd
ministerial conference of ESCAP.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly in the last two decades, it has emerged as the
most rapidly growing region of the world, with a consistently
rising level of per capita income," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And most recently, many economies in the region, thanks to
their dynamism and openness to foreign investment, have attracted
high levels of capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
"The result has been impressive technological progress,
continued economic advances and increasing integration into the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is a laudable record of which the countries of the region
and ESCAP should be proud," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan pointed out that there are still the largest
portion of poor population in the world living in the Asia-Pacific
region and conditions conducive to sustained the economic growth
is not yet in place in many countries.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest challenges ahead is thus to ensure that the
economic and social dynamism that characterizes some parts of the
region spreads throughout the region, and that all segments of
society contribute to, and share in the benefits of, growth and
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"ESCAP has a key role to play as a catalyst and facilitator in
this process,' he added.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a policy statement at the opening, Adrianus Mooy,
executive secretary of ESCAP, also said that ESCAP may be rightly
proud of its considerable achievements during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Mooy noted that a great deal remains to be done, and
greatest challenges are yet to be faced in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be debating and exchanging our views on the
challenges and opportunities for ESCAP, in preparing ourselves on
how best to meet those challenges and opportunities, and indeed in
finding the best and most appropriate commission structure to
address all the issues and problems of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh today delivered an
inaugural address to the session, also spoke highly of ESCAP's
contribution to the region.
</P>
<P>
Through the good and bad times over the past 50 years, ESCAP
has made significant contribution to Asia's development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Quietly, yet effectively, I has addressed some of the most
important issues affecting the well-being of millions in the
region -- issues such as poverty alleviation, public health and
agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the session are ministers from about 50
of ESCAP's 59 members and associate members and representatives of
other UN agencies and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which focuses discussions on the challenges and
opportunities facing the ESCAP region while reviewing the ESCAP's
achievements over the past five years, is scheduled to close on
April 30.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Tighter Emission Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament has urged
European Union (EU) states to introduce strict measures to control
vehicle emissions.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's committee on environmental affairs proposed a
radical reduction in the permitted ceilings for suspended
particles, essentially sulfur, in gas and diesel fuel, the ANSA
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The particles are measured in parts per million, or ppm. The
European Commission now allows 220 ppm for petrol and 350 ppm for
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the ceilings should be reduced to 50 ppm,
for both types of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The committee's proposals, based on joint research with auto
makers and fuel suppliers, also suggest that all cars should be
fitted with electronic on-board diagnostic systems designed to
produce cleaner emission fumes.
</P>
<P>
A further proposal is that all cars on roads in the EU consume
no more than 4.5 to 5 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers by the
year 2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met here today
with his Singaporean counterpart Goh Chok Tong, who is currently
on a working visit to China.

leaders exchanged views on issues of common concern. Reviewing the
growth of bilateral relations, they expressed the desire to
further strengthen cooperation so as to create a still closer

in the past two decades China has achieved great progress and
success by firmly carrying out the policy of reform and opening-up

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People Support Amendment Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Many local associations have
issued statements or sent groups to the Chief Executive's Office
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to express
their support to the office's proposals on the amendments to two
ordinances.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the suggestions from the office on the
amendments to the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order
Ordinance have reflected the realities of Hong Kong and they will
do good to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Chief Executive's Office issued a
consultative document to solicit opinions and suggestions from the
communities on its proposals on the amendments to the Societies
Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were made by the office in line with the
resolution of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress that major amendments to the Societies Ordinance and the
Public Order Ordinance introduced in 1992 and 1995 respectively
shall not be adopted as the laws of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
According to the Information and Public Relations Section of
the Chief Executive's Office, hundreds of Hong Kong-based
associations had handed in letters for approval of the proposals
on the amendments to the ordinances.
</P>
<P>
They also raised constructive ideas including suggestions of
revisions or requirements for further clarification on some
specific terms, an official of the section said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Cheng Yiu-tong, chairman of
the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, said that his federation
stood for the proposals on the amendments to the two ordinances.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposals have absorbed the concept of
"national security", which is consistent with the Basic Law and
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposal for prohibiting local political
organizations from establishing foreign ties is to prevent foreign
political forces from interfering in political operations in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Liang, chairman of the Chinese Manufacturer's
Association of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong people should know that
Hong Kong will become China's special administrative region after
handover. Thus, the concept of "One Country" is very important.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposals have retained the basic principle of
guaranteeing Hong Kong people's freedom of speech as well as that
of association, assembly, procession and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Yeung Yiu Chung, president of the Hong Kong Federation of
Education Workers, said that his federation agreed to adopting
restrictive measures on procession and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the organizers of assembly, procession and
demonstration should take into account the overall interests of
the local communities.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is natural and necessary for propose a ban on
donations from overseas organizations to Hong Kong's political
associations in order to prevent overseas organizations from
manipulating local associations.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Diplomatic Solution in Abduction Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that Manila will exert diplomatic efforts to
resolve the case of seven Filipinos reportedly abducted by
Malaysian navymen in Palawan, in the southern Philippines, on
April 15.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, who attended a cabinet
meeting in the Presidential Palace later today, said Ramos wanted
the case to be solved "diplomatically."
</P>
<P>
The President had formed a three-man committee to look into the
abduction of the fishermen, including a 10-year old boy, allegedly
by elements of the Malaysian Navy, de Villa said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee are de Villa, Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon and Interior and Local Governments Secretary Robert
Barbers.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened after a robbery, reportedly staged by
Filipino pirates, on a Malaysian island near Palawan on April 14,
said de Villa.
</P>
<P>
The next day, a naval patrol boat, resembling one of the
Malaysian Navy, entered Philippine territorial waters and anchored
off an islet in Palawan, about 60 kilometers from the Malaysian
state of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian armed men seized seven fishermen and took them to
Malaysia. However, the police in Palawan said the Malaysians
seized the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs has mobilized its
entire staff in the Kuala Lumpur embassy, including Ambassador
Jose Brillantes, to ascertain the whereabouts of the seven
Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Praises Late Leader Ye Jianying  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today lauded late State leader Ye Jianying at a meeting marking
the 100th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Ye Jianying was a long-tested faithful soldier to
communism, a staunch Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary,
statesman and military strategist. He was among the founders of
the People's Liberation Army and the People's Republic of China,
and an outstanding leader who for a long period of time held
important positions in the government and the military," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
In his revolutionary career of 60-odd years Ye made great
contributions to the Chinese people's cause of liberation and
socialist construction, and thereby won the esteem and respect of
the whole Party, the military forces and the Chinese people, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
When he was a young man Ye engaged in pursuing truth and saving
the nation and people, and threw himself into the democratic
revolution led by Sun Yet-Sen to fight against warlords and the
reactionary forces, Jiang told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ye also participated in the founding of the Whampoa Military
Academy and the Northern Expedition (1926-1927), which was part of
the First Revolutionary Civil War (1924-1927) waged by the Chinese
people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
against the imperialists and the Northern warlords, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
At the critical moment when Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei
betrayed the revolution in 1927, resulting in the deaths of a
large number of communists, Ye published an open telegram
denouncing Chiang and joined the CPC, thereby evolving into a
communist from a patriotic democrat, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
From that time on he became entirely dedicated to Communism and
fought for it for the rest of his life, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Ye Jianying made glorious achievements for the
realization of the independence of the Chinese nation and the
liberation of the Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the White-terror days after the initial failure of the
revolution he resolutely supported and coordinated the
preparations for the August 1 Nanchang Uprising (1927), which
fired the first shot against the Kuomintang (KMT) reactionaries
and marked the beginning of the CPC's independent leadership of
the revolutionary war. Ye also participated in leading the
Guangzhou Uprising (December 11, 1927).
</P>
<P>
The two uprisings and the Autumn Harvest Uprising marked the
great beginning of the Second Revolutionary Civil War (1927-1933)
and the establishment of the the people's army.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the Central Soviet Area, established during the second
Revolutionary Civil War, Ye supported the correct line of Comrade
Mao Zedong and participated in the command of three
counter-"sieges" against the KMT troops led by Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the Long March, Ye resolutely upheld the unity
of the whole Party and the military, and wisely and bravely fought
against Zhang Guotao's conspiracy to split the Red Army and
endanger the CPC Central Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted Mao as saying that Comrade Ye "saved the Party and
the Red Army" at that critical moment.
</P>
<P>
After the Red Army reached northern Shaanxi Province at the end
of the Long March, Ye did a great deal for the establishment and
development of the Party's national united front against the Japanese
invaders, the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He assisted Zhou Enlai to bring about a peaceful settlement of
the Xi'an Incident (December 12, 1936), which resulted in a second
period of cooperation between the CPC and the KMT against Japanese
aggression, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Following the outbreak of the War Against Japanese Aggression
in 1937, Ye went on to take part in the Party's leading work in
Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing and other places.
</P>
<P>
After he returned to the military headquarters in Yan'an, Ye
assisted Mao Zedong and Zhu De to command the campaigns against
Japanese invaders. After victory was won Ye assisted Zhou Enlai to
negotiate with the KMT for an agreement to end the civil
war. Later, he struggled against the KMT and exposed the true
motive of the KMT authorities in sabotaging the talks and
continuing the civil war. During the period of China's War of
Liberation (1945-1949), Ye led the rear-area work of the CPC
Central Committee in northwest Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Ye did a great deal for the peaceful liberation of Beijing,
commanded the campaign to liberate Guangdong Province and the
island of Hainan, and eventually won final victory on the South
China battlefield, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Ye performed immortal historical feats for the victory
of the Chinese revolution, the president noted.

<P>
After New China was founded in 1949, Ye Jianying made important
contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and
construction, the president said. The tasks of wiping out bandits,
land reform, building of people's political power, and
rehabilitation and promotion of production, were victoriously
accomplished when he presided over the routine work in south China
and central-south China areas.
</P>
<P>
He held a leading position in the Central Military Commission
from 1954, and creatively put Mao Zedong's military thinking into
practice. He was in charge of organizing the army's education and
training and developing military-related scientific and
technological research, and made great achievements in building up
a modern and regular army, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
During the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976), He fought against
the cliques headed by Lin Biao and Jiang Qing and made every
effort to maintain the army's and nation's stability, as well as
to resist and rectify the mistakes of the "cultural revolution",
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Ye, joined by other central leaders, toppled the Gang
of Four in 1976, in accordance with the will of the Party and
people. He played a decisive part in the struggle, the success of
which saved the Party and the nation from disaster. He strongly
demanded that Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun and some other veteran
revolutionaries resume their leading posts in the Party and the
State, in spite of objections, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Ye gave full support to the reform and opening-up policy
initiated by Deng Xiaoping as well as the modernization drive. The
building of democracy and the legal system was greatly enhanced
when he was in charge of the National People's Congress, and the
Message To Compatriots in Taiwan was passed in January 1979. He
put forward nine principles for peaceful reunification of the
motherland in a famous speech made in September 1981. He was an
principal member of the Party's second generation's collective
leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the core, Jiang said.

Ye was a staunch Communist and was always loyal to the Party
and the people. He always bore the interests of the Party and
people in mind in times of severe test. He stepped forward
bravely to turn the tide at crucial moments in Chinese
revolutionary history. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai spoke highly of
him in this regard, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He had largeness of mind and never claimed credit for himself. He
kept on studying Marxist theory in his late years and believed in
seeking truth from facts. He wrote many poems, and was held in
high esteem as a poet by Mao Zedong himself.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people put
an end to the miserable history of Old China, and are marching
forward along the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics. "Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and other veteran
revolutionaries have passed away, but their great achievements,
precious thinking, lofty morals and noble spirit will be
everlasting, and encourage us to make even greater progress,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We should carry out their behests and accomplish their
unfinished cause in honoring Ye and other veterans who have passed
away. We will stick to the Party's basic line and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in
further promoting the reform and opening-up policies and the
modernization drive," the president said.

cause of reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice-chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
said that Ye was greatly concerned with the affairs related Chinese
nationals living abroad, calling him a model in uniting overseas
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the Secretariat
of the CPC Central Committee, said that "we must carry forward the
unfulfilled wishes of the older generation of proletarians and
carry victoriously into the 21st century the cause of socialism
they initiated, so as to build our country into a prosperous,
democratic and civilized one.
</P>
<P>
"This is our best commemoration for Comrade Ye Jianying," said
Hu, who presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a photo album and the collected works
of Ye Jianying have been published by the Central Literature
Publishing House and were distributed nationwide as of today.
</P>
<P>
The album contains more than 500 photos depicting Ye at various
historical periods, and the collected works include Ye's important
military writings between 1933 and 1982.

<HEADLINE> First Group of PMF Starts Mission in N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The first group of a projected
Peace Monitoring Force (PMF) has began its mission in northern
Iraq in a bid to supervise the truce between the two rival Kurdish
parties in the region.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that
the group of about 50 Iraqi Turkmens were deployed in the region
last week.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted sources here who declined to be named as saying
that the deployment of all the 180 Iraqi Turkmens and 20 Assyrians
is expected to be completed within the following few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Turkmens, who are part of the force, were trained in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) agreed to the establishment of the PMF in last
February in the third round of the peace talks held in Ankara
co-sponsored by the United States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In last January, representatives from Turkey, the U.S. and
Britain met with Iraq' three delegations: the KDP, the PUK and
the Turkmen Front, to review progress in implementing the
principles agreed on October 31 and November 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is expected to provide the technical equipment of
the force and Turkey, backing Iraq's Turkmen minority because of
ethnic and cultural bonds, has persuaded the Kurds to offer
them a say in the administration of the area.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, supported by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, fought
against the Iran-backed PUK in late August last year, which led to
U.S. air strikes against Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The two groups signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996, under
mediation of the U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish rivals
since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival zones after
the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sure of Peaceful End to Fishermen Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa said today he was confident of a peaceful solution
to the reported abduction of seven Filipino fishermen by Malaysian
navymen.
</P>
<P>
"Since we have very good and friendly relations with the
Malaysians, I believe diplomacy between the two countries will
handle the situation smoothly," De Villa said in an interview with
the local media.
</P>
<P>
De Villa was confident existing mechanisms for working out such
incidents -- the joint Philippine-Malaysian Committee and the
joint Philippine-Malaysian Border Operations Memorandum -- could
handle this case.
</P>
<P>
Seven Filipino fishermen, including a 10-year-old boy, were
detained by a group of Malaysian navymen on Mangsee Island, in
Balabac, on April 15, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
But the Malaysian police insisted the seven Filipinos were
arrested after they illegally entered Malaysian territory.

<P>
BERLIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's top star Steffi Graf
will return to tennis in May after a three-month pause to heal an
injured knee.
</P>
<P>
The former world number one will take part in a May 12-18 WTA
tournament in Berlin, tournament director Eberhard Wensky said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, 27, was forced to withdraw with a left-knee tendon
infection at the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo on Feb. 2, where
she was to have faced Swiss 16-year-old Martina Hingis in the
final.
</P>
<P>
The infection also prevented Graf from playing in the Fed Cup,
where Germany lost to the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
But Hingis, who overtook Graf as the world No. 1 player on
March 30, won't play in Berlin. She is out with a knee injury
after a horse-riding spill a week ago and said she hopes to be fit
for the French Open starting May 26.

BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
today that it had approved a humanitarian aid package of 3.7
million ECUs (4.2 million U.S. dollars) for victims of conflict in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the
priority would be to cover basic needs -- food and medical aid --
of the most vulnerable part of the population, in particular those
who have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office
(ECHO), will enable Red Cross and non-governmental organizations
to carry out a program in the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
The office has scaled down its presence in Somalia over the
past two years as emergency needs have declined there. But it
said some humanitarian assistance was still vital, especially in
the capital of Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> HABITAT Meeting Opens Amid Calls for Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The 58-member U.N. Commission on
Human Settlements opened its 16th session today with mounting
calls for having its role strengthened in a bid to improve the
human living conditions on earth.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to focus on how to revitalize the
organization to ensure effective implementation of the Habitat
Agenda and whether to expand the commission's membership to
include non-governmental groups.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Center for Human Settlements (UNCHS) has played a
crucial role as the global focal point in advising and assisting
countries to formulate and implement shelter and human
settlements policies," said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based UNCHS, governed by the commission, was
officially set up in 1978 with a goal to support governments in
the formulation of policies and strategies for developing
self-reliant management capacities.
</P>
<P>
"It has played an important role in preparing for the just
concluded HABITAT Two conference" where the Habitat Agenda, the
Global Plan of Action was adopted in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1996,
Moi said at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul conference has given the UNCHS a central role in
supporting the implementation of the Habitat Agenda, and in
policy guidance and coordination, said Wally N'dow, the Assistant
Secretary-General of Habitat.
</P>
<P>
"It called for the Commission's mandate to be reviewed and
strengthened," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will end on May 7, is also to discuss the
issues of sustainable settlements development and of adequate
shelter.

<HEADLINE> Time for Ding Song to Revenge on Samsonov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ding Song, the best
defensive table tennis player in the world, got his wish as he was
drawn into the same quarter with Belarus' Vladimir Samsonov, who
has beaten the Chinese twice and made a discount on his reputation
as "European-killer".
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chinese, who has amused and bemused his rivals
with the unique chop-and-attack play, will take on Samsonov in the
semi-finals if they both make that far.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, currently world No. 4 who outlived a marathon
five-set match against Ding in the World Cup last October, beat
the Chinese again in the Qatar Open in Feburary, the last major
event before this world championships.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how far I will go in individual events and I just
want to take a revenge on Samsonov," said world No. 7 Ding, who
has led the Chinese men's team to the last eight.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't lost to any Europeans other than Samsonov in recent
years," he said. "I'm ready for stronger challenges here because
they have been studying my style since 1995.
</P>
<P>
"But I have bad news for them: I am no longer the one in the
Tianjin championships, I am much better than that."
</P>
<P>
China's world No. 1 Kong Linghui, the reigning world men's
singles champion and the 1995 World Cup winner, will find himself
in an unusual role of underdog despite his top seeding in the
singles event.
</P>
<P>
History and poor form will combine to stop Kong from defending
the singles championship.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles game has been so closely contested that no
one has succeeded in defending his title since Chinese Jiang
Jialiang won the championship in 1985 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner lifted the singles title in 1989 and
conceded it to teammate Jorgen Persson in 1991. Frenchman
Jean-Philippe Gatien took the 1993 event and fell under a
giant-killing spree by Kong in the 1995 Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"It is much more difficult to win back-to-back in the men's
singles event since so many good players are out there," said
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Kong, a player willing to rally until his
opponent makes errors or leaves an opening, faces a herculean job
to defend the singles title after a lackluster year dotted with
defeats to South Koreans and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Kong has been struggling to find former self since a form
reversal caused a defeat to South Korean Kim Taek Soo in the
Atlanta Olympic Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese continued his showing in the World Cup last
September, finishing third in the group after losses to Sweden's
Jan-Ove Waldner and Brazilian Koyama Yugo.
</P>
<P>
Kong then twice lost his team match to the 98th-ranked South
Korean Ou Sang Eun in the Asian championships last December and
Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Olympic champion Liu Guoliang is bundled with South
Korean Kim Taek Soo in the same quarter. Kim has beaten the
Chinese fast-attacker twice after the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and world No. 2 Waldner will very likely vie for a
quarter-final berth against Chinese Xiong Ke, who has edged out
the Swede in the World Pro-Tour Finals in December last year.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, Deng Yaping was drawn in the same quarter
with Japanese Koyama Chire and Singapore's Jing Jun Hong, who have
both beaten the world No. 1 player.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing of Chinese Taipei, who finished second in the 1993
world championships and the Olympic Games last summer, is seeded
second in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia to Discuss Dispute over Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Malaysia today
started preparing the draft for special agreement on the dispute
over Sipadan and Ligitan islands, which will be jointly brought to
the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the two countries opened their meeting on the
issue in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, according to reports
reaching here this evening.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finish the draft agreement during this meeting. But
that depends on the results of the discussions of course," said
Izhar Ibrahim, the Foreign Ministry's director general for
political affairs, who heads the Indonesian delegation.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting of the two delegations was held in Kuala
Lumpur in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The two tiny islands of Sipadan and Ligitan are located
northern of Kalimantan island of Indonesia. The dispute is a
legacy of the two countries' former colonial rules, the Dutch in
Indonesia and the British in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to a pact signed by Britain and the Netherlands in
1891, the two small islands are part of the territory of what was
then the Netherlands' East Indies, the present state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Since then, maps of the Indonesian archipelago have
incorporated those two islands.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1969, Malaysia put the two islands on its national
maps as part of the country's territory. In 1983, Malaysia started
enforcing its claim over the islands with the passing of a state
law.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides failed to reach a bilateral agreement,
Indonesian President Soeharto and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad agreed in October last year to bring the dispute
to the ICJ.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders pledged to abide by whatever decision the court
will hand down.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Automobile Exports Increase in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan exported about 3.85 million
automobiles between April 1996 and March 1997, an increase of 6.2
percent over the previous year, the Japanese Automobile Industry
Association said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time its exports have exceeded the previous
year after five years of continued shrinking. Since the
devaluation of the Japanese yen in the second half of last year,
Japan's automobile exports have increased, mainly to the the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Japanese cars occupied over 30 percent of the American market
in 1996, reaching the highest level yet.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Japan's automobile exports to the American and
European markets increased 5.3 percent and 5.8 percent
respectively over the previous year. However, its exports to
Asian markets reduced four percent because local Japanese
enterprises expanded their production in this area.
</P>
<P>
Exports in 1997 will maintain last year's momentum, since the
markets in the Middle and Near East as well as Latin America look
favorable, the Association said.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Emerges for China's Invention of Printing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars set forth new
evidence on China's invention of printing at an ungoing exhibition
here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Ji, a research fellow with the National Museum of Chinese
History, said that block printing, the earliest kind of printing,
was invented in China in the early Tang Dynasty (618-907) on the
basis of the use of seals, rubbing techniques, and printing on
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
"Before 751," Sun said, "China had already copied the Buddhist
Dharani Sutra by block printing. A copy of it was stored by Silla,
one of three ancient kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula, in a pagoda
in the Foguo (Buddhist World) Temple, which was built with Tang
help.
</P>
<P>
"The copy, found in October 1966, was the earliest copy of
Tang block printing ever found," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
According to Pan Jixing, a research fellow at the Institute of
Natural Sciences under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the sutra
was translated during the reign of Emperor Wu Zetian (690-704) by
two monks, named Mitra Sanda and Fa Zang, from a copy written in
Sanskrit, at the empress' edict.
</P>
<P>
The copy was fetched from India by another monk, Yi Jing.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that Empress Wu Zetian was very
pleased at seeing the translation and gave a big reward to the
translators, making it possible for the rapid copying of the
translation by block printing.
</P>
<P>
The printing was finished before 704, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
During the period a monk from Silla arrived in China, took
back a copy of the translated sutra and stored it in the pagoda,
according to Pan.
</P>
<P>
"Four characters created by Wu Zetian can be found in the
copy," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts also noted that the variations in Chinese
characters found in the copy are similar to those found in a
handwritten copy of the sutra, which was discovered in a cave in
the Mogao Grottoes in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
A duplicate of the copy found in Silla, the Mogao copy and a
duplicate of a Tang copy of the same sutra from the year 770 which
is now stored in Japan are on display at the exhibition at the
National Museum of Chinese History in the Tiananmen Square here.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Emerges for China's Invention of Printing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As another proof of China's invention of printing in the early
Tang Dynasty, Sun mentioned a copy of the Diamond Sutra which was
made in 868.
</P>
<P>
The copy, found in the Mogao Grottoes and taken to Britain by
Aurel Stein early in this century, was regarded as the finest
example of Tang printing. On display at the exhibition is a
duplicate copy.
</P>
<P>
With a length of 488 cm and width of 30.5 cm, the copy has a
picture at the beginning, in which Sakyamuni is sitting
cross-legged on a lotus giving a lecture to his disciples, over
whom are flying female deva and banners.
</P>
<P>
"The lines of the picture were finely and exquisitely printed
and the characters are in the styles of famous calligraphers,
suggesting an achievement after a long period of development in
block printing," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, block printing was further developed in the
Song Dynasty (960-1279) before red and black block printing was
invented in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), on the basis of which
block printing using a wide range of colors was created in the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
As the exhibition shows, letterboard printing was also invented
in China by Bi Sheng of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), some
400 years earlier than Gutenberg's first printing work in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching letterboard printing at the exhibition is
a copy of a book printed using bronze letters in 1726, or the
fourth year under the Rein of Emperor Yong Zheng in Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911). The original book, titled "The Integration of Ancient
and Modern Books", was in 10,000 volumes with 160 million
characters, making it the largest encyclopedia in the world at the
time.
</P>
<P>
"China has contributed to world civilization by spreading
printing technology to both the east and the west in the past
centuries," Sun said.

"RBA deputy governor Stephen Grenville's comments, reinforcing
the central bank's focus on low inflation, had led to buying of

The comments were interpreted as suggesting that the RBA would

<HEADLINE> Singapore Court Strikes Out Lee Kuan Yew's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Singapore has
ordered that the remarks made by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on
Johor, a Southern state of Malaysia, be deleted from a court
document, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The television report said Justice Lai Kew Chai said that the
powers of the court must be used to maintain friendly relations
between Singapore and every other country.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued at the request of Lee Kuan Yew who made a
court appearance. Speaking for one-and-a-half hours, Lee said he
was carrying out an obligation he made to the Malaysian
government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly said that the application to remove the remarks
was made in the interests of maintaining friendly relations
between Malaysia and Singapore. He added that he held the views
about Johor to be correct based on press reports.
</P>
<P>
He now accepts that the reports in the press have been disputed
and challenged, the television report said.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, Lee made controversial
remarks early this year in the affidavit filed in a Singapore
court hearing on defamation cases brought against opposition
Workers' Party member Tang Liang Hong by ruling People's Action
Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tang fled to Johor because he was concerned for his
safety, Lee Kuan Yew said: "I was baffled. He claimed his life was
under threat. But, of all places, he went to Johor. That place is
notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings. It does not
make sense for a person who claims to be fearful for his life to
go to a place like Johor."
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew apologized "unreservedly" twice in March to
Malaysia for the offense he has caused to the government and
people of Malaysia by his statement on Johor and made it clear
that he "had no intention to cause offense" in his sworn affidavit
made on January 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Then the senior minister instructed his counsel to seek the
court's permission to have the offending sentences deleted.

<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
met here today with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, in the Great Hall of the People, Li
expressed appreciation to Goh for his emphasis on developing
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as the 21st century approaches leaders of all
countries in the world are contemplating how to face the
challenges and opportunities that the new century will bring. He
said he believed that Goh's visit would enhance the understanding
of the Singaporean side about the investment environment in China,
thus promoting the expansion of economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that, at a time when Asia as a whole and China in
particular, are undergoing dramatic changes, the leaders of the
two countries should maintain regular contacts and exchanges in
order to strengthen their solid bilateral links and exchange views
on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views on bilateral economic and trade
cooperation and the construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park,
the largest project of its kind funded by Singapore in China. They
said they believed that the two economies have a high grade of
complementarity. They expressed confidence in the prospects for
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Pak Struggles to Educate Rural Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- At first glance, I thought the
small and low thatched shack adjoining a single-story house was a
shelter set up by an Afghan refuge family who like thousands of
others came across the border into northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
When I went nearer, I was surprised to find it was a
"classroom" where about 20 children sitting on the ground were
reading their textbooks following a bearded slim young man.
</P>
<P>
It can hardly be called a classroom because there were no basic
facilities in the ten-square-meter space except a small blackboard
propped up with two stools.
</P>
<P>
This is a village near Batkhela, about 300 kilometers northwest
of Islamabad, in the Malakand Agency of the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP).
</P>
<P>
"It is the sole free-of-charge primary school set up mainly for
the poor farmers' children in the village," said 26-year-old Ahmad
Ali, who suspended his class to have a chat with me.
</P>
<P>
Ali's school was one of the non-formal basic education schools,
part of the effort made by the present government led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif to improve education for the children
especially in the rural area.
</P>
<P>
The Nawaz government, while giving priority to national
economic revival, has also been preparing a comprehensive plan for
the improvement of primary education, particularly in rural areas,
where 60 percent of the country's population inhabit.
</P>
<P>
The non-formal basic education system is based on the home
school idea without any formal building and local community
provides free-of-charge room in the area. And learning times in
these non-formal schools are not rigid and adjustable.
</P>
<P>
Ali, who is paid only about 2,000 rupees (50 U.S. dollars), is
teaching a total of 42 teenagers, who were divided into three
grades and were taught with different textbooks at different times
in the day.
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered as their teacher because I feel it so important
yet so difficult for these rural children to get access to
education," said Ali, who usually comes to his school by bike from
his village, about six kilometers from Batkhela.
</P>
<P>
Ali, who is single, said these children's parents, whose income
mainly depends on limited field yields, could hardly send their
children to the formal schools in faraway big cities.
</P>
<P>
"Our country could not achieve the target of progress and
prosperity without the improvement in the literacy rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ali's view was echoed by many education experts in Pakistan,
where the official literacy rate is 37 percent, one of the lowest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Education is perhaps the prime area where the greatest emphasis
must be placed if Pakistan is to attain sustainability of the
economic and social development, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to available statistics, by the end of this century,
with an estimated population growth of 3 percent, Pakistan, with a
population of 130 million now, will face an alarming situation of
over 100 million illiterate people.
</P>
<P>
"I hope more and more non-informal schools will be established
and more and more people will involve in this project, which gives
the rural children an opportunity to change their lot," Ali said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Urged Again to Name Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has been urged again to reveal his choice for the ruling party's
standard bearer in the 1998 presidential elections at the party's
national convention in late November or early December.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres here today expressed
confidence that Ramos would approve the recommendation made by the
16-member selection committee of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
"We are really looking at that whether the endorsement by the
President should come before the convention or during the
convention itself. Certainly the President will announce his
candidate during the convention. That will be the ideal
situation," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Torres said party leaders are eyeing "the end of November or
early December" for the party's convention in pursuance of
existing laws setting the date for such meetings.
</P>
<P>
The selection committee, created by Ramos to lay down the
criteria for selecting the Lakas candidates in next year's
national elections, will submit its final recommendations within
the week, Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Lakas officials had urged Ramos earlier to announce his
successor at or before the national convention of the ruling
party, saying that the party would be split with too many choices
for the standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
However, the President ignored the suggestion, according to
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is forbidden to have another six years in the
Presidential Palace by the Constitution. He has repeated that he
will step down in 1998 as his term ends.

ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister for
Population Welfare Syeda Abida Hussain described here today the
population explosion as a threat to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The high-rising population growth rate must be controlled for
the socio-economic development in Pakistan, which has a population

said when inaugurating a meeting on women's studies.
</P>
<P>
Abida warned that if proper measures were not taken to check
the baby boom, the population would increase manifold.
</P>
<P>
She maintained that overpopulation was the main hurdle in the
way of socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government was keen to check population growth by promoting
family planning programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government also wanted to elevate the status of women by
providing them maximum opportunities in all fields of life, she
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore-ESCAP Third Country Training Accord Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) signed a
Memorandum of Understanding in Bangkok today to establish a Third
Country Training Program (TCTP) for ESCAP developing countries in
the region, the Singapore Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Singapore is the first country to sign such an
agreement with the ESCAP to jointly conduct training courses for
the ESCAP developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reflection of the general growing support for
Singapore's technical assistance approach which focuses on human
resource development as a vital catalyst for economic
development," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
To date, Singapore has joint training program with eight
partner countries, namely Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Republic
of Korea, Australia, Canada, Norway and Luxembourg. Singapore also
cooperate with international organizations to provide training
programs for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The training program with the ESCAP, jointly administered by
the Technical Cooperation Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Singapore, and the ESCAP, will enable Singapore to
enhance its technical assistance program to developing countries
in Asia and the Pacific region, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed today, two courses will be conducted
this year and the first is a course in "Tourism Management" which
is scheduled from May 26 to 31. It is tailored for the South
Pacific island countries. Future courses would cover other fields
like trade promotion, port management and project planning.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1947 in Shanghai, China, the ESCAP was first
known as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE)
to assist in post-war economic reconstruction. The Commission
subsequently moved its headquarters to Bangkok in January 1949
where it adopted its present name to reflect both the economic and
social aspects of development and the geographic location of its
members countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Airways to Resume Flight to London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's national flag carrier,
the Nigeria Airways is soon to resume its Lagos-London flight
after a month's suspension due to insurance debt, the Guardian
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the end of a week-long meeting
between the airline, the National Insurance Corporation of
Nigeria and the Ministry of Aviation.
</P>
<P>
The British Civil Aviation Authority banned Nigeria Airways
from flying its Lagos-London flight in early March due to alleged
irregularities in its insurance papers.
</P>
<P>
The National Insurance Corporation of Nigeria also decided to
dump the Alexander Howden and Co., which is involved in the
insurance fraud and has chosen Johnson Higgins and Co. as its new
partner, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Nigeria Airways is also engaged in
talks for the re-opening of the Lagos-New York route before the
third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are also being done for the opening of the
Lagos-Jeddh-Dubai and the Port Harcourt-Dubai routes, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria airways has abandoned most of its international
flights for a long time due to serious mismanagement and
financial difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Dull Productive Sector in 1st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Productivity lulled in Nigeria's
real sector in the first quarter of this year, dulling the
feasibility of 5.5 percent gross domestic product growth
projected in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance in the productive sector was attributed
by industry operators and financial analysts here to the
inability of the government to initiate some basic projects and
policies promised in the budget.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha announced earlier
that policies in the year's budget were targeted at raising the
level of productive activities in particular.
</P>
<P>
But the policies such as privatization of some public agencies
have not yet been implemented, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government's retention of dual exchange rate and pursuit
of a surplus budget were also factors leading to the poor
situation.
</P>
<P>
According to some analysts, the impact of agriculture which is
an integral part of the real sector was not felt in the economy
largely because of its seasonal nature in the country.

<P>
Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector was too low
as many manufacturers avoided fresh production owing to huge
stocks of unsold finished goods in their warehouses, they said,
adding that this stagnated the economy.
</P>
<P>
The long-drawn fuel crisis nationwide recently was also cited
as a factor that hampered productivity.

<HEADLINE> At Least 4 Killed in Renewed Fighting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- At least four people have been
killed and seven others wounded in a renewed fighting between the
militiamen of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of
his rival, Osman Ali Atto in Mogadishu, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The heavy armed clashes occurred last night in the generally
dark Somali capital which was lit by the night flares used by the
opposing sides around the fighting zones.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting which lasted about 90 minutes, no
territorial gains was made by either side, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed fighting is not yet known. However,
Osman Ali Atto's faction has made their usual accusation of
blaming Hussein Mohamed Aidid's men for provoking their front
line forces.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word from the faction led by Hussein
Mohamed Aidid over the fighting as yet, but a militia officer
loyal to his faction has denied that their forces have made the
attack.
</P>
<P>
This fighting between the two clan compatriots was taking
place at a time when international efforts are continuing towards
a political reconciliation for the Somali factions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the fighting, the faction leaders of Osman Ali Atto
and Hussein Mohamed Aidid are currently being hosted by President
Ali Abdalle Saleh of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a meeting between Hussein Aidid and Osman
Atto will take place tomorrow in the capital of Yemen, Sana.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- LNnet, an economic information
network covering Northeast China's Liaoning Province, went into
operation today.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first network of its kind in the northeastern
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
LNnet is a key part of the nationwide China Economic
Information Network (CEInet), jointly set up by the State
Information Center, provincial information centers and the
information centers of various ministries.
</P>
<P>
It cost the province about 100 million yuan to build.
</P>
<P>
CEInet provides economic information about China to the
country's governmental organizations, enterprises and private
users, and it is hooked up to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that CEInet will help add China-developed economic
information to the Internet, which is badly short of such
information, to promote the country's information development as
part of the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
LNnet was jointly constructed by the Information Center of
Liaoning Province, and other local information institutes.
</P>
<P>
It will not only provide a variety of economic information in
the fields of macro-economic development, industrial and commercial
surveys, and business opportunities, but also services,
such as e-mail and information retrieval.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said here today, "Further promotion of bilateral
relations among Japan, the United States, China and Australia will
contribute greatly to the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific
region."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that there can be, and should be positive
relations among these four relationships," Hashimoto declared in
his speech at a dinner hosted by Prime Minister John Howard
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto arrived here this afternoon with a 60-member
entourage to a full state welcome. His two-day visit is aimed at
broadening the strategic partnership between Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese leader proposed a series of measures to strengthen
bilateral relations, which included an annual summit between the
two prime ministers and a partnership agenda to broaden
cooperation on issues such as energy, the environment, education,
culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also pledged Japan's support for Australia to join
the Asia-Europe Meeting. In return, it was believed that Japan

The visit marks the 40th anniversary of the two countries'
trade agreement which laid the foundation of what is now
Australia's most important economic relationship.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (Xinhua) -- A Brazilian judge today
sentenced a former policeman to almost 450 years in prison for
killing 21 residents in a slum here.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Roberto Alvarenga, 38, who was one of the 52 policemen
accused of a role in the 1993 massacre, described by prosecutors
as revenge for the deaths of four policemen presumable killed by
drug traffickers in the slum.
</P>
<P>
Alvarenga was sentenced for 21 homicides and on four counts of
attempted murder by Judge Jose Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Under Brazilian law, however, Alvarenga can not serve more than
30 years. But the symbolic 450 years of imprisonment was still
seen as a positive sign for the dozens of more trials to follow.

(PSA) signed a contract with the Fuzhou Port Authority (FPA) to
form joint venture companies to manage and operate the existing
container terminals at Qingzhou and Daijiang, in east China's
Fujian province, the PSA announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, which was signed last Friday, the joint
venture companies formed would also develop and manage a new
deep-water container terminal outside Minjiang. This would be the
PSA's second port venture in China, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the PSA will invest in this project through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Sealion Huanan Pte Ltd., with two Hong
Kong-based joint venture partners, Ranki Development Ltd. and
Pacific Industries and Development Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou's container volume enjoyed a robust growth of 30,500
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 1990 to 177,000 TEUs in
1996. It has also been designated recently as one of the two ports
open for direct shipping links between Chinese mainland and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The PSA noted that with increasing Taiwanese investments in
Fuzhou and growing trade between the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits, Fuzhou is poised to become an important gateway for
direct shipping links between the two sides.

MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military recently
deployed additional navy boats to patrol the area near the common
border of the Philippines and Malaysia, a senior military official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Reyes, Western Command Chief of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines, said three more navy boats were deployed this
week to patrol the Philippine territorial waters near its common
border with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The development came on the heels of the detention of seven
Philippine fishermen by the Malaysian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he was informed by residents of a fishing village
that Malaysians rounded up six Filipino fishermen and a
10-year-old boy on April 15.
</P>
<P>
But Malaysian police said the seven Filipinos were arrested for
illegal entry into Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he requested the Malaysian official to help release
the detained Filipinos on the grounds that there are "conflicting
versions" about the manner and reason for their detention.

Philippine President Fidel Ramos has ordered Foreign Affair
Secretary Domingo Siazon, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa and

<HEADLINE> Explosion in Russian Military Depot Still On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The explosion of a military depot
in the far east region of Russia halted dozens of trains on the
Trans-Siberian railway, the Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which erupted Sunday afternoon, continued for
nearly a whole day and made rescue virtually impossible. Splinters
from exploding artillery shells were strewn around a radius of 12
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The traffic on the Trans-Siberian railway, which passes near
the depot, was interrupted, with 25 passenger and 60 freight trains
halted.
</P>
<P>
The blast also posed a grave threat to the safety of the
residents in the town of Bira, six kilometers southeast of the
depot.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the people in Bira have been evacuated, but
about 2,000 residents refused to leave and stayed in their homes,
a spokesman for the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations
said. So far, there is no report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 emergency workers have been sent to the area to contain
the explosion, which is believed by local officials to be sparked
by a forest fire Sunday. But experts did not rule out the
possibility of sabotage.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Cultivated Rice Found in 8,000-year-old Tribal Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found the world's earliest cultivated rice at an 8,000-year-old
tribal site by the Dongting Lake in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Previously the origin of rice culture was traced to India in
about 3000 BC.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 rice kernels of different sizes have been
found at the site, which is believed to be the oldest tribal
remains along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the rice, some of which were more than four
times the size of others, may be an intermediate type between wild
rice and cultivated one.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists also unearthed 47 kinds of plant seeds and a
great number of animal bones, materials by which the
archaeologists will research human's agricultural production and
settled life between the old and new Stone Age periods.
</P>
<P>
The site, more than 120 meters long and 110 meters wide, was
surrounded by a moat and a wall, in which dwelling remains, and
over 50 tombs were found.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 pieces of pottery, wooden ware, bone ware, hemp
ropes, reed mats, and baskets have been unearthed from the tombs
after archaeologists' five-year work.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe that some wooden and bone wares were used
as agricultural production tools, including a 90-cm-long wooden
tool to dig earth.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 125 students of Rajshahi
University were arrested in a police swoop Sunday and 90 of them
were sued for their alleged involvement in the ransacking of
various university buildings last Saturday, said reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
Besides, some off-campus student messes and houses in the
nearby villages were also raided by the law enforcers of the
Rajshahi district, 200 kilometers northwest of the capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The police raid happened after a serious campus violence last
Saturday, when at least 60 people were injured in an armed attack
by some students belonging to the so-called shibir, a student wing
of this country's opposition party Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted when the shibir activists called a strike
from Saturday demanding reinstating former vice-chancellor Yousuf
Ali and cancellation of the newly-introduced department-wise
admission system.
</P>
<P>
According to the university authorities, the pro-strike
students disconnected the telephone lines of the new
vice-chancellor's residence as well as the residence of teachers
and officers. They also attacked the university employees and the
police.
</P>
<P>
Local police sources said that 35 of the arrested people were
released later as they were found not involved in last Saturday's
incident.
</P>
<P>
The police has been posted on the campus to maintain law and
order while the university was closed till June 10 for the summer
vacation, the sources added.

LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Major tried to lift Tory gloom and the
main opposition Labor leader Tony Blair warned his party against
complacency as the prospect of a Labor landslide victory appeared
to harden with only days to polling.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A rift between Brian Mawhinney, the Conservative party
chairman, and Lord Saatchi, its influential advertising adviser,
is threatening to blow the Tories off course in the final days of
their election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- People who claim to be able to wake up at particular time
without the aid of an alarm clock have been found to be strikingly
accurate by scientists. In a random telephone survey of 269
people, one person in six said that self-awakening had become a
routine.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's main opposition Labor leader Tony Blair has put
another lock on British entry into a European single currency. If
a Blair cabinet believed that people would not vote for the
currency in a referendum, it would not attempt to join up.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain has more children living in poverty - one in three -
than any other European country, according to an unpublished study

PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe Sunday revealed the
primary measures that the ruling majority would take if it wins
the legislative elections. The measures, surprisingly similar with
the proposals of the opposition Socialist Party, include the
reduction of working hours and restriction of the number of terms
to be served by parliamentary deputies and government ministers.
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot published last weekend
an interview it made 20 years ago with former Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan but was censored by Israeli
authorities. Dayan said that he made a big error by allowing
Israeli troops occupy the Golan Heights in June 1967, because
Syria did not pose a threat to Israel at that time.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro
</P>
<P>
-- According to a new poll by Le Figaro and Sofres polling
institute, the French ruling majority will maintain 329 seats in
the 577-seat legislature after the general elections. However, 36
percent of the people polled said that they are undecided yet whom
will vote for.
</P>
<P>
-- Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema has called for the
rapid establishment of a Pan-African peace-keeping force to
prevent the war in Zaire from spreading to neighboring
countries. He said that "the risks of contagion" from the war in
Zaire are real, because of the rampant trans-frontier trafficking
of weapons in African countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to take the
national lead in giving priority to developing public means of
transport and solving urban traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
The special bus lane on Chang'an Avenue, Beijing's busiest
downtown artery five kilometers long, will open before June 30.
</P>
<P>
Another three bus lanes have been scheduled for Chongwenmenwai,
Fuchengmenwai, and Chaoyangmennei streets within this year,
according to Chen Zemin, director of the municipal Urban Traffic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
"This is a consideration for the masses," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Beijing's road conditions cannot meet the demand
of the increasing number of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of motor vehicles rose by
150,000 in 1995, and increased another 140,000 in 1996. In the
first quarter of this year, the figure still climbed 42,000,
bringing the city's total to 1.16 million.
</P>
<P>
Too many vehicles causes traffic chaos. Driving against traffic
regulations is still commonly seen, and management at road
crossings is difficult, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has decided to increase patrol policemen on roads, and
set up TV monitoring systems over the second- and third-ring roads
in the city, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
And long-arm signal lamps, which can stretch to the middle part
of streets and be easily seen by drivers, will be soon set up at
11 crossings in Chang'an Avenue, he added.
</P>
<P>
The city will also add more parks for cars by June, according
to Chen.

<HEADLINE> Direct Elections of Village Committees Conducted Across China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The provinces of Fujian,
Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Hebei are holding direct elections of
village officials as part of China's experiment in grass-roots
democracy and marking another step forward, according to a
Ministry of Civil Affairs official.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to early 1997, 18 Chinese provincial administrative
areas held three direct elections of village heads. Coastal Fujian
Province in eastern China, and Heilongjiang Province in
northeastern China are now holding their fourth round since 1988.
</P>
<P>
"The direct election of village committees in the vast
countryside is a major grass-roots political reform," according to
Wang Zhenyao, a senior official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs
who is in charge of developing grass-roots political power.
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, economic restructuring in the countryside
resulted in profound changes in rural economic and social
relations, and provided a stronger foundation for the direct
election of village officials, Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
Then, in November 1987, the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, adopted a trial law,
the Organization of Village Committees Law, which calls for
village officials be chosen by villagers.
</P>
<P>
The law took effect on June 1, 1988. The move was viewed by
many to have marked the beginning of village autonomy. Says Wang,
"The direct grass-roots election is a major policy to get a system
of democratic autonomy to take root in the daily life of
villagers, and it is an extremely large and complicated project."
</P>
<P>
He notes that the process is different in different places.
With the establishment of village committees across the country in
1984, the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, the provinces of Hebei
and Heilongjiang, and the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia,
Tibet and Xinjiang began to enact local regulations on the
election of village committees. But, they were still in the
planning stage before 1988.

<P>
As soon as the Organization of Village Committees Law took
effect in 1988, many provincial governments developed local rules
to implement the law.
</P>
<P>
That year, 1,093 counties did pilot work for electing village
heads, increasing people's awareness of the law and of democratic
elections, establishing a village conference system, working out
regulations on managing village affairs, and training village
officials.
</P>
<P>
From the last half of 1988 to early 1989, direct elections of
village committees were held in 14 provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, more than 20 counties experimented with choosing the
director of the village committee from several candidates.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the central government urged local governments to
push for elections of village committees and for village autonomy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1992, many villages across the country had held
at least one election of village committees, and provincial
legislatures in Fujian, Hebei, and Heilongjiang provinces had
worked out regulations on implementing the national law.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Fujian improved its election methods and organized its
third set of village election since 1988.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, villagers in 24 provinces, municipalities,
and autonomous regions elected new village officials and the
election standards had improved a great deal because provincial
governments were responsible for helping design election
procedures and times, and for training election workers.
</P>
<P>
In the process, farmers have become motivated and know better
how to safeguard their own interests in accordance with the
law. More than 90 percent of rural voters have taken part in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The election of village committees has, as a matter of fact,
acted as a training class for both villagers and government
officials on how to develop rural grass-roots democracy," Wang
Zhenyao concluded.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Grasslands Attract More Overseas Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hulun Buir Grasslands in the
northern part of China have become a new tourism attraction and
have attracted more than 1.6 million overseas tourists over the
past five years because of the scenery and pollution-free
environment.
</P>
<P>
Hulun Buir covers 250,000 sq. km. or about six times the size
of switzerland, and has 80,000 sq. km. of China's most beautiful
grasslands, and the Great Hinggan Mountains with their primeval
forests and more than 3,000 rivers and 500 lakes.
</P>
<P>
The grasslands have more than 3,000 kinds of plants and over
400 kinds of animals, and 35 minority groups, including the Oroqen
people, one of China's smallest minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Tumur, a Mongolian photographer who has published a book of
photos of the Hulun Buir Grasslands, said that because they are
located on a border area, industrial development has not brought
pollution problems and their good ecology has been preserved.
</P>
<P>
He said that the unique scenery here has attracted more
tourists and that local tourism departments have developed a
number of programs that include grasslands tours, skiing in the
winter, hunting tours in snow covered forests, and tours of
minority areas and cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
He said that the local government places great importance on
tourism and finished the Hailar International Airport extension
project and opened air routes to Hohhot (the regional capital of
Inner Mongolia), Beijing, Dalian (a coastal city in Liaoning
Province), Harbin (the capital of Heilongjiang) and highways and
railways that go to major tourist spots in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
There are 15 travel agencies with grasslands programs and seven
modern hotels there.

<HEADLINE> China's Welfare to foucs on Aiding Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's social welfare efforts
will focus on improving conditions in the country's orphanages and
on helping Tibet develop more public welfare services in 1997, a
Civil Affairs Ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority in our social welfare for 1997 is first to
refurbish houses for children, and then to develop Tibet's social
welfare services," Xu Ruixin, vice-minister of Civil Affairs, told
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
China has 100,000 orphans, but only 84 orphanages and 700
welfare institutions that can care for them.
</P>
<P>
The ministry decided to choose 100 juvenile houses from 29
provinces and municipalities that most need reworking, to
refurbish living spaces, and to provide better medical and
rehabilitation equipment for them. A total of 250 million yuan
(30.12 million US dollars) has been collected for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Half of the projects have been completed and the rest will be
finished by the end of this year, he said, adding: "support for
Tibet's social welfare services is especially important for social
stability, ethnic unity, consolidation of frontiers, and the
anti-splittism struggle."
</P>
<P>
The ministry has pledged that it will collect 100 million yuan
to build housing for juveniles and other public institutions that
Tibet badly needs.
</P>
<P>
1997 has also being named "the year of assisting Tibet" by
civil affairs departments across the country.
</P>
<P>
Xu also discussed China's welfare lottery system. Since the
issue of the first welfare lottery in 1987 to the end of last
year, 19.43 billion yuan worth of tickets were sold, raising 6.09
billion yuan in funds.
</P>
<P>
Of that, 4.3 billion yuan has been spent on 62,922 projects,
according to the vice-minister. But, the country still needs 32
billion yuan for the 1996-2000 period for welfare institutions,
medical equipment, housing for orphans, and a national low-income
security system.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to give more support to the country's
welfare lottery program for the "coordinated development of social
welfare with the national economy."

</P>
<P>
Major General Salim Saleh, presidential adviser on military

<HEADLINE> Initial Report on Philippine Hotel Fire Cites Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The initial official report on the
New Imperial Hotel fire in the southern Philippine city Cotabato,
which killed 27 people early Saturday morning, has pointed to
arson, Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The report was sent by the City Fire Marshall Inspector
Edzrapel Dilawangan to the regional office of the Bureau of Fire
Protection in Koronadal, South Cotabato, on Sunday, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
"Careful evaluation and analysis of the result of further
investigation conducted as of date disclosed that the nature of
fire is attributed to be sabotage-fire by still unidentified
persons with ill-motive," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report further stated that "the fire started at 'holy hour'
approximately 12:30 midnight" which was considered "as one of the
prima-facie evidences of arson."
</P>
<P>
The report also said the spread of fire is also questionable as
"burning was simultaneous" in the upper three floors of the
five-storey hotel, the portion totally gutted by fire.
</P>
<P>
But, the report said that unless evidences prove otherwise,
"the fire is presumed accidental in nature."
</P>
<P>
As of today, fire investigators have not discovered sufficient
evidences, such as gasoline containers or any other chemicals,
that could positively link the fire to arson, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Dilawangan, speaking over a local radio station, pointed out
that "evidences of arson are still very weak as of this time."
</P>
<P>
He requested authorities to give them more time to come up with
concrete evidences on the case.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour blaze started at a room on the third floor which
was reserved for use as a prayer room of the Muslim guests who
were there to attend Muslim Mindanao Governor Nur Misuari's
state-of-the-region address originally scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the tragedy forced Misuari to call off his address.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Set Up Enforcement of Intellectual Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today said his government will pursue with "greater vigor" the
effective enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the remarks before the World Intellectual Property
Organization's World Symposium on Broadcasting, New Communication
Technologies and Intellectual Property here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said his government was restructuring intellectual
property rights laws to make them more responsive to the growing
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said he has created a presidential inter-agency committee on
intellectual property rights to coordinate the effective
enforcement of the intellectual property rights laws.
</P>
<P>
The president added that there were pending bills in Congress
seeking to strengthen the country's patent, trademark and
copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that in the past the Philippines fell behind in
giving recognition to the part played by intellectual property in
nation-building owing to the negative perception that intellectual
property rights only protect the interests of more developed
economies.
</P>
<P>
But he said the country's failure to appreciate significance of
intellectual property will not happen anymore.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also said that the three-day symposium will help guide
the government in formulating the best approach in addressing the
issues on the conferment of property rights to broadcasting
organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia jointly
launched a pasture protection program today in Horqin Grasslands
in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The program, aiming at protecting the ecological resources of
the pastures and raising income of farmers and herdsmen in Horqin
Grasslands, is aided by the Australian Agency for International
Development (AUSAID) and the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The program will absorb more than 70 million yuan (8.75 million
US dollars). Australia will offer 6.19 million Australian dollars
and the Chinese side will collect nearly 30 million yuan (3.7
million dollars) for the program.
</P>
<P>
Xu Baoyin, chief of Animal Husbandry Bureau of Hinggan League
(Ulan Hot City) and Chinese chief of the joint program, said the
program is the region's largest pasture improvement project in the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Australian experts estimated that about 24,000
people from 5,700 farming or herding households are expected to
take part in the program.
</P>
<P>
After implementation of the program, the per unit grass output
could be raised by six times and the annual net income of
households participating in the program could rise from 7,600 yuan
(950 dollars) to nearly 12,000 yuan (1,500 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia is China's first region to build the system of
regional autonomy of minority nationalities and is also one of
major pastures in China with a grassland area of 8.8 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has been introducing foreign aid to
launch pasture improvement programs in the minority nationality
areas and so far more than 100 Sino-foreign pasture protection
programs have been launched.

which he discussed with Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders the current
developments of the Middle East peace process, in addition to a
number of Arab and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled because of
the Israeli government's intransigence in constructing a Jewish
settlement in Har Home in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> South China Improving Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry, a leading part
of agriculture in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
has developed well over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
The region had 34 billion yuan in output value from the sector
last year, a 26 percent rise over the previous year, and it
contributed more than a third of the total output value from local
agriculture and helped local farmers substantially increase their
incomes.
</P>
<P>
Last year the local meat output was more than 2.9 million tons,
egg output was 153,000 tons, and milk 9,000 tons, meaning
increases of 18, 5, and 4 percent, respectively, from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The increases come from restructuring the sector and improving
management, livestock strains, breeding methods, and veterinary
services.
</P>
<P>
Now Priority is being given to poultry, sheep, and rabbit
breeding, which has grown faster than pig raising. The region has
also done well in improving pig and cattle breeds, and building
lean-meat pig production bases.
</P>
<P>
Local livestock breeding has become more intensive and
industrialized, and there is a growing number of households and
villages specializing in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The region aims to have 42 billion yuan in output value from
the sector this year by producing 3.1 million tons of meat,
163,000 tons of eggs, and 9,400 tons of milk.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Belarus Presidents Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance
to developing economic and trade ties with Belarus on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who
stopped over in Beijing on his way home, Jiang said China is
willing to explore new ways and fields to further bilateral
cooperation and to promote various forms of mutually beneficial
cooperation between the countries' enterprises according to the
international trade norms.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, both Jiang and Lukashenko
expressed their satisfaction over the progress of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Lukashenko on his third visit to China,
Jiang spoke highly of the Belarus leader's important contributions
to the Sino-Belarus friendship and mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the bilateral ties have enjoyed a smooth and healthy
development since the establishment of the diplomatic relations
between the two countries five years ago.
</P>
<P>
It has been the important guarantee for the steady development
that leaders of the two countries have maintained constant
contacts and forged a good relationship of mutual understanding
and trust, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that the political document signed
by leaders of the two countries has laid a legal basis for
promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the Sino-Belarus ties have withstood the
test of changing international situations, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko thanked Jiang and the Chinese government for their
efforts to promote the bilateral relations, saying the friendly
links between the two peoples are expanding through the joint
efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that the bilateral cooperative relationship has
good prospects.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed his Belarus counterpart on his just-ended
visit to Russia, which he described as "very successful."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "Russian President Boris Yeltsin and I signed the
joint statement on the world's multipolarization and on
establishment of a new world order. This is an important document."
</P>
<P>
"We deem that following the Cold War, the world's
multipolarization has been gaining momentum and the proposition
for a unipolar world just won't work. All countries have the right
to choose independently their own path of development according to
their national conditions and no country should force its own
social system and values on others," Jiang elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The current world is diversified and colorful, and all
countries should join hands to take their share, on an equal
footing, in solving problems relating to world peace and
development, Jiang stressed, adding one cannot lay down the law
for international affairs alone.
</P>
<P>
"In these fields, China and Belarus share wide-ranging common
grounds," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko also briefed Jiang on his country's political and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China has always respected and understood
Belarus's path of development in compliance with its own
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides also exchanged views on
furthering cooperation in all other fields.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were: Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing, Minister Bao Xuding of Machine-Building Industry,
Minister Wu Yi of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
Vice-Minister Zhang Deguang of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Chief Qian
Shugen of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
P. Shipuk, Chairman of House of Republics of the National
Assembly of Belarus, P. Prokopovich, First Deputy Prime Minister,
and I. Antonovich, Minister of Foreign Affairs, were also
present.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Shanxi Earn More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The per capita income of the
rural population in North China's Shanxi Province hit 1,557 yuan
in 1996, up nearly 29 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This was seven percentage points above the national average and
the highest growth rate in the history of Shanxi, said a local
agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the higher income to last year's good
grain harvest. As a structural readjustment took place in
agriculture, the grain output climbed to a new high, exceeding 10
billion kg.
</P>
<P>
In grain producing areas, 70 percent of the annual income comes
from farming.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Shouyang County produced an average of 1,000 kg of
grain last year, earning an extra 300 yuan a year each.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forestry in Shanxi is flourishing. Forested areas
cover 13.5 million mu (900,450 hectares) and have added nearly 100
yuan to the income of rural residents in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Groundnut Production Rises in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The annual groundnut production
in Uganda in recent years stands at around 140,000 metric tons,
increasing by 6,000 tons from the estimated production in 1988,
reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that after the introduction of new varieties
that are resistant to diseases, the country's groundnut
production will surely rise again.
</P>
<P>
However, Charles Busolo-Bulafu, a groundnut researcher at
Serere Research Station over 200 km northeast of Kampala, was
quoted as saying that incidentally, all the groundnut crop in the
country is grown by small scale peasant farmers who have limited
means.
</P>
<P>
Rosette virus disease and early leaf rot as well as bacterial
wilt, rust and stem rot cause considerable loss in yields. And
the farmers also have to battle with the pests which include
aphids, white grubs and termites, he added.
</P>
<P>
Groundnut growing introduced in Uganda in 1862 is presently
widely grown throughout the country. Apart from being highly
nutritious, groundnuts are an important raw material for the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
With an oil content of up to 56 percent, groundnuts have the
highest oil content among the oil seed crops in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Groundnut, a multipurpose crop is also the second most widely
grown grain legume in the country after beans.

<HEADLINE> Malawian Government Loses 26 Million Dollars From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian government suffered
a loss of 26 million US Dollars in the past year in the civil
service from fraudulent accounting, overpayment and ghost
workers, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Malawian Finance Minister Aleke Banda
based on a government investigation while presenting the 1997/98
budget to Parliament last week, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Banda said that irregularities included retention of retired
employees on payroll, deliberate fraudulent acts such as payments
to employees who had died, retired, dismissed or had resigned,
and payments that did not match grades.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were even people who did not work for the
government and had never done so but had been receiving
government allowances while there were employees of private
contractors on the government payroll.
</P>
<P>
The investigation became necessary because of the inexplicable
fluctuations in funding requirement for salaries and wages from
month to month and in view of a general perception of possible
malpractice in salary administration, Banda stressed.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China to Auction off Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, a leading grain producer, plans to auction off land use
rights to some of its more than 4.6 million hectares of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The province has 8.67 million hectares of farmland, putting it
first in the country, and 3.8 million hectares of land lying idle
that could be used for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,
and fish.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, it developed preferential policies encouraging the
purchase of land use rights of exploitable wasteland through
public bids to speed up use of this idle resource.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government says that leases are for not less
than 30 years and not more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
This has attracted many overseas investors and major domestic
groups to the province for wasteland development. It has leased
land use rights for 1.13 million hectares of unused wasteland, and
investors have put 500 million yuan into reclamation work to grow
grain, plant trees, and raise fish.

HANGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of egrets,
birds on the endangered species list, have settled in a military
camp in east China's Zhejiang Province, where they are protected
by the soldiers stationed there.
</P>
<P>
The rare birds had lost their original homes in mountain
forests as a result of the increasing illegal hunting of rare
birds and animals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Egrets have considerable economic value, and some criminals
tried to catch them for money making," said a soldier, adding that
since 1995, more than 200 cases involving illegal capture or
killing of egrets have been stopped.
</P>

Soldiers here say that protecting rare creatures is an

<HEADLINE> New Rice Technique Adds To China's Grain Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The sparse-planting rice
technique has become a major contributor to China's increased
grain production, which hit a new high of more than 490 billion kg
last year.
</P>
<P>
China will spread this new technique to about 13 million ha of
dry farmland by the end of the century, as part of the efforts to
feed its increasing population, according to the State Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The imported technique was first applied in south China's paddy
fields in the early 1990s, which increased rice output to 750 kg
per ha. The technique was then spread to the north and west
China's dry areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese agronomists have improved the technique, which now
significantly reduces the amount of seed, water, labor, and
fertilizer needed.
</P>
<P>
Used on nearly 8.7 million ha of farmland in China by the end
of 1996, sparse-planting helped increase the yield of five billion
kg of grains annually over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the paddy fields in north, northeast, and
northwest China are benefiting from the technique, which added
1,270 kg of rice output per ha while costing 300 yuan less.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have given priority to spreading the
use of the rice planting technique. More than 80,000 training
classes were held only in 1995, involving 20 million people. This
has greatly promoted the nationwide adoption of the technique.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Invest More in Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic center
is set to spend three percent of its gross domestic product (GDP)
on environmental protection in the remainder of the 20th century,
according to Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
This means the city would spend eight billion yuan
(about one billion US dollars) annually on environment projects, or
nearly a tenth of the country's average annual spending in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has China's largest amount of industry, and the old
141 sq. km. urban area alone has 20,000-odd workshops and more than
4,500 factories, and more than eight million residents.
</P>
<P>
The large amount of pollution, smoke, and dust from them make
pollution a serious problem in the over-crowded city, where
expansion of green space is difficult.
</P>
<P>
"Like some old European industrial cities, Shanghai has
paid a heavy price for its prosperity," said an expert here.
</P>
<P>
Since the early '90s, with the rapid growth of the economy, the
municipal government has redoubled its environmental protection
efforts. From 1991 to 1995, the city's annual spending on the
sector rose to five billion yuan, or 1.76 percent of GDP, far
greater than its original spending of less than one billion yuan
each year.
</P>
<P>
Following five years of hard work, Shanghai has managed to halt
environmental deterioration, with pollution discharges below the
1990 level while the GDP doubled.

<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai is determined to join the world's top
environmentally-sound cities by 2010 and to "become an
international metropolis where man will live in harmony with
the nature."
</P>
<P>
In order to do so, priority will be given to cleaning its 53-km
Suzhou River that flows through the urban area. The project will
will be completed in 15 years, at a total cost of 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another 20-billion-yuan project involves a greenbelt around the
city between urban and rural areas that would cover a 7,241-ha
area, 680 ha more than the city's total green area in 1995. The
project, to be completed by 2010, will be the biggest urban
greening project in China.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem encountered by the densely-populated city
is how to find space for nature in the downtown area. Since the
early '90s, Shanghai has been re-arranging its layout and some two
million people and 800 factories have moved out of the urban area,
a large-scale project that will continue to the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The city has used this chance to expand the green space in
the "forest of concrete buildings." In the past two years, nearly
1,000 ha of green patches have been added, and by the end of the
year, the green coverage is expected to exceed 20 percent, experts
say.

JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An 18-year-old Palestinian
youth was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank Sunday
night, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the Village of Tharaz near Hebron
when young Palestinian stone-throwers clashed with Israeli
troops. The boy, named Issam Aqadneh, was killed on the spot and
two other Palestinian youths were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops began shooting after the youths in the
village blocked the main road with rocks and metal rods and
threw stones and petrol bombs at patrol jeeps.
</P>
<P>
The boy's funeral was carried out late Sunday night. Thousands
of the villagers shouted anti-Israeli and pro-Hamas slogans.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories have grown ever
more trigger-happy since last month when a suicide bombing
occurred at a Tel Aviv cafe killing three Israeli women and the
bomber.
</P>
<P>
They were also instructed to step up security activities to
ensure the safety of Israeli holiday makers during the Jewish
Passover festival on April 22-28.
</P>
<P>
However, two Israeli women were found dead in Wadi Kelt in
the West Bank Friday. The two, identified as Hagit Zavitzky and
Liat Kastiel, were both 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Police suspected the murders of the two women
hikers, whose bodies were found with multiple stab wounds, were
committed by Palestinian extremists. But criminal possibility is
also not entirely ruled out.

producing countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the Holeta Bee Research Center in the

The center said it has produced modern beehives replacing
traditional ones with a plan to increase the production from 5 kg
to 20 kg per hive and the center is distributing the modern
beehives to rural technology promotion centers in addition to

<HEADLINE> Exports Up in South Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- South China's coastal province
of Guangdong exported 14.59 billion US dollars worth of goods in
the first quarter of this year, a year-on-year increase of 24.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented province was affected by the cuts in export
tax rebates in early 1996, and exports began to drop. But
Guangdong's foreign trade rebounded and a speedy increase has
revived production in export-oriented enterprises, contributing
nearly nearly 36 percent of province's total industrial production
of exports, with a nearly 22 percent rise in the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong now has smooth economic growth thanks to an overall
increase in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt to Okey Rhino Gift Plan for London Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to continue a plan to send two rhinos to Britain as gifts
despite strong opposition from local environmentalists, a
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is expect to formally endorse the decision at a
meeting Monday, Forest Minister Rameshwor Yadav was quoted by the
Kathmandu Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Nepal pledged to give two female unicorn Indian
Rhinos to the London Zoo of Britain for the purpose of scientific
research after the Zoological Society of Britain's long pursuit
for additional rhinos for the zoo.
</P>
<P>
A local environmental group here has been trying to foil the
rhino gift plan by submitting appeal letters to Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand and concerned ministers for scrapping the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The unicorn rhino is an endangered animal species, about which
an international convention prohibits any form of trade,
environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 activists from the Nepal Forum of Environmental
Journalists (NFEJ) Sunday staged brief demonstrations in front of
the British Embassy and German airlines Lufthansa's office here to
protest against the decision to ship the two gift rhinos to London
via a Lufthansa scheduled flight Monday.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalist have asked the government to stop gifting
Rhinos abroad until the country has a clear and transparent policy
on such cases.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Has 11 Billion Barrels of Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has an estimated 11
billion barrels of petroleum which could last 20 years, an
official said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have 11 billion barrels of petroleum reserves, five
percent in Irian Jaya," the state-run oil company Pertamina's
President Director Faisal Abda'oe said in Jayapura, Irian Jaya,
Sunday, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's petroleum production reached 515 billion barrels in
1995, and increased to 567 billion barrels in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Indonesia exports 800,000 barrels of
petroleum per day. The largest buyers are Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pertamina also produces 27 million tons of natural
gas per year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Sudjana said that
by the start of the 21st century Indonesia will become a crude oil
importer.
</P>
<P>
"Surveys and researches have indicated that from now on this
country has still oil reserves available for another 15 years,
natural gas reserves for about 42 years and coal for more than 150
years,' he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, new energy resources are also very
potential and have bright prospects for further development in the
future.
</P>
<P>
These renewable energy resources are in the form of waste and
geothermal energy with capacities reaching 75,000 megawatts (mw)
and 16,000 mw respectively, but which so far have not been fully
developed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Starts Election Campaign Quietly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A quiet atmosphere and subdued
political activity marked the start of the election campaign in
Indonesia on Sunday, reports reaching here today from various
areas in the country indicated.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Armed Forces General Feisal Tanjung said last
night in Solo, Central Java, that Sunday's first-day election
campaign went on well and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's three political parties -- the ruling party of
Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) kicked off the 27-day campaign for the May
29 general election at noon on Sunday with different themes.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-based PPP came out advocating justice while the
ruling Golkar promised to eliminate poverty and the PDI said it
would uphold democracy.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Chairman Harmoko began his campaign in West Java's less
developed village of Cimara, Lebak District.
</P>
<P>
"I choose to begin my first campaign in village because more
than 70 percent of Indonesians live in rural areas. Golkar is
continuing its effort to fight poverty in the country of 200
million population," Harmoko told thousands of Golkar
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which has won each of the five general elections held
since 1971, is now aiming to win 70 percent of the votes, or a
2-percent increase over its share at the 1992 election when the
PPP received 19 percent and the PDI 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
PDI Chairman Soerjadi, who began his campaign in Pontianak,
West Kalimantan, said his party has high motivation to struggle
for the people's aspirations and uphold democracy in the country.
 The implementation of national development has successfully
improved the people's welfare, but it also has widened the gap
between the rich and the poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The rich is getting richer and the poor is getting poorer," he
was quoted by the official Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Ismal Hasan Metareum, who kicked off
his election campaign in Medan, North Sumatra, said his party has
always fought for justice, truth and honesty.
</P>
<P>
The people are entitled to express political aspirations, to do
business, to enjoy education and to feel secure, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to raise the educational budget to amount to
at least 20 percent of the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were some small clashes reported in Medan,
Yogjakarta and Solo, Central Java, but no death or material losses
occurred in the incidents, except three PPP supporters suffering
light injuries.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign will run until May 23 before a five-day
"cooling-off period," when campaigning is banned, and the poll on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
The country's nearly 124 million eligible voters will elect 425
candidates to the 500-seat parliament. The remaining 75 seats are
reserved for the Armed Forces which does not vote.
</P>
<P>
In this year's campaign, the country is divided into three
groups of campaign areas with Group I covering Sumatra, Nusa
Tenggara and East Timor; Group II covering Java, Maluku and Irian
Jaya; and Group III covering Kalimantan and Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
On the first day, Golkar campaigned in Group II while the PPP
and the PDI campaigned in Group I and III respectively. All the
contestants will get their turn in the three groups in the coming
days in according with the election rules.
</P>
<P>
Almost 50 percent or 216 of the parliamentary seats are
reserved for Java whose population is about 117 million.
</P>
<P>
As the country's three parties began their election campaigns,
security in Indonesia's capital and other key areas has been
tightened.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Military Command Chief of General Staff Brig. Gen.
Sjafrie Syamsoedin said the police would deploy 19,000 members who
would be assisted by some 7,700 Armed Forces troops.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 300,000 displaced Sri
Lankans have so far returned to their homes in the Jaffna
Peninsula from areas held by Tamil rebels, according to military
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the estimated 500,000 displaced following military
operations in the peninsula last year, a steady flow of about 500
persons daily has been recorded to return to the peninsula from
the rebels-controlled areas, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 90,000 others have moved to
locations in the south and that only 110,000 are continuing to be
held captive in rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
Those who have returned to the peninsula said they had to
suffer untold hardships while in rebel-held territory where there
was a severe shortage of food and other essentials including safe
drinking water, the sources stated.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that whatever food items and medicines were
sent to these areas for refugees by the government were captured
by the rebels for their own use.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna Peninsula, once the stronghold of the Tamil rebels,
who have waged a 14-year war for a separate state in the north and
east of the country, was recaptured by government troops last May.

<HEADLINE> Stable Land Contract System Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Wen Jiabao, an alternate member
of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, said that the farmland contract system in rural China
needs to remain stable for a long time.
</P>
<P>
This has been demanded by farmers and has been the policy of
the Party Central Committee, Wen said while addressing a recent
conference on rural work.
</P>
<P>
Today's "People's Daily carried part of Wen's speech at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The land contract system will remain unchanged for 15
years, he said, and will be renewed for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the land contract system has remained stable, but
there are problems that should be brought to people's attention,
he said. Only half of China's villages, for example, have
continueed the land contract system, and there are even fewer that
have extended the contracts to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
And some places have recalled land that had already been
contracted out to farmers, using various excuses, he added, noting
that these run counter to farmers' wishes and are incompatible
with the Party Central Committee policies.
</P>
<P>
If this continues to spread, it will not only dampen farmers'
initiative, but will also impede production in rural areas and
even destroy whatever progress has been made in rural reforms, Wen
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Land used for production cannot avoid changing hands. But these
exchanges should be based on farmers' desires rather than on
administrative orders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The use of land will ultimately lead to farming on a fairly
large scale, which is in accordance with rural development trends,
Wen said, but this requires a long period of development.

Chang beat South Africa's Grant Stafford 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 to win the
U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships title in Lake Buena Vista,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
The win was Chang's fourth title of the year and the 30th of

The 25-year-old unseeded Stafford eliminated eighth-seeded
Australian Sandon Stolle, defending champion Fernando Meligeni of
Brazil and sixth-seeded American Chris Woodruff en route to the
final.
</P>
<P>
With a one-set lead, Stafford had a chance to increase the
pressure on Chang in the second set when he reached break point on
the top seed's serve. But Stafford missed his opportunity when he
sent a backhand service return into the net.
</P>
<P>
For Stafford, who came into the week ranked 73rd, the
appearance in the finals will probably move him into the low 60s.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (49-50) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (49-50) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Why should not Hong Kong change into a political city?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong has never been a country but a region. It has
never been a political city but a free port. Its advantages lie in
its economy. Thanks to the efforts of several generations of the
local people, Hong Kong has become one of the world's economic,
trade, financial and shipping centres.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the fact that Hong Kong is an economic city and
endeavoring to maintain its status as an economic city -- this is
an attitude of being genuinely responsible for Hong Kong and the
interests of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
By opposing attempts to change Hong Kong into a political city,
we mean that Hong Kong should not be changed into an arena of
fierce rivalry among international political forces and into a
base for activities against the central government. Otherwise,
Hong Kong would lose its advantages.
</P>
<P>
Question: What are the nature and functions of district
organizations of the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: District organizations refer to the city administration
council, district administrations, district legislatures and other
district organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, district organizations are not
organs of political power and may be established in the Hong Kong
SAR. District organizations will be consulted by the government of
the Hong Kong SAR on district administration and other affairs, or
be responsible for providing services in such fields as culture,
recreation and environmental sanitation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Applicants Vie to Fill Vacant Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Sufang has given exams to
her students for 14 years. She was a bit nervous on Saturday when
she was taking a test.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, 37, was one of nearly 300 competitors taking the final
oral exam to quality for one of Beijing's 57 intermediate-level
official vacancies.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the selection method has changed from
official appointment to open application. I'd like to take on a
tougher job," said Zhang, deputy director of a college department.
</P>
<P>
She had applied for the post of vice-chairman of the national
and overseas Chinese affairs committee under the Beijing Municipal
People's Congress, the local legislator, according to a report in
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Her fellow competitors, most of them between 36 and 45, had
college education background, and 33 percent had their master's or
doctoral degrees.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the candidates had been serving as division
chiefs for more than three years and 40 percent have been division
deputy chiefs for more than five years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They were among 1,631 people who applied for the posts and took
written examinations on general knowledge in March.
</P>
<P>
The candidates answered 16 questions from seven-person panels
comprising municipal government officials and experts from
institutes and universities.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the 150 examiners were college graduates; about
80 percent ranked above bureau deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
Two people will be chosen from the competitors for each post
following the oral test. After careful consideration, one will
fill the vacancy in June, the report said.
</P>
<P>
All 57 will work for one year on a trial basis. Any who fail to
prove themselves will be removed from their posts, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Recruiting large number of intermediate ranking officials
through open exams in Beijing will have a considerable impact on
recruiting systems across the country," said 39-year-old Wang
Aimin, who was the first to apply to take the examination.

<HEADLINE> Public Transportation To Get Priority in Chinese Cities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
give priority to developing public transportation in all large and
medium-sized cities to deal with worsening traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
Special bus lanes will be set aside this year in the cities of
Beijing, Dalian, and Shenyang, the capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, and in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan
Province, Zhang Kuichang, director of the Urban Construction
Department of the Ministry of Construction, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"After we acquire enough experience to deal with these lanes,
we'll open similar lanes in many other cities," Zhang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A special bus lane will first be provided along the
five-km-long Chang'an Avenue, the Chinese capital's No 1 downtown
arterial, by no later than June 30, sources from the Beijing
Municipal Public Security Traffic Administration say.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction expects buses, taxis, and subways
to handle more than a third of transportation by the end of the
century, meaning a fairly reasonable level of public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the capacity of public transportation will have to
be more than double the 1996's figure, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents in China went out for travel 150 billion times
in 1996, but the public transport system could handle only 28
billion passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities have an increasing number of traffic
jams. According to a recent survey by the Ministry of Public
Security's Public Traffic Administration, the average speed of
motor vehicles has dropped to 13 km per hour in large cities, from
nearly 20 km per hour in the early 1980s, and the figure for buses
is now less than ten kw per hour.
</P>
<P>
"If no measures are taken, traffic in the metropolises of
Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing will be at a standstill in no
more than a decade," Zhang said.

<P>
Quan pointed out that measures should be taken to support
public transportation, instead of depending only on special bus lanes.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Construction, Beijing
has decided to put 200 more buses into use this year, while
Shanghai will add 600 new air-conditioned buses. Other large and
medium-sized cities, such as Chongqing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and
Xi'an, will also increase the use of these vehicles this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry is considering introducing a ticket
price adjustment mechanism for public transportion nationwide,
where ticket prices could be adjusted according to the increase in
average salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
The effort is expected to help many loss-making enterprises and
to arouse employee initiative, said Zhang Kuichang, a Ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianguo, a public transportation expert, suggests the public
transportation and motor vehicle fuel be taxed to increase funds
for public transportation. Government policies should also
encourage companies and foreign business people to get involved in
the public transportation sector.

Road construction has accelerated in recent years, and per
capita road availability was 7.3 square meters by the end of last
year, and the figure for Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin was more
than 5 sq.m. The increased use of motor vehicles, however has
caused severe problems.
</P>
<P>
It is a fact of life in all cities that road construction
cannot keep pace with the increase in the number of motor
vehicles, says Li Jianguo, director of the Beijing Municipal
Public Traffic Research Office.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the only way out is to give priority to the
development of the public transport system.
</P>
<P>
One sq m of roads treavelled by buses can handle 10 to 15
times that of cars in an hour, Li explains.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is also impossible over a long period of time for
private automobiles to play a major role in a populous country
like China, whose GDP can only reach 3.8 trillion US dollars by
2010, a per capita GDP of about 2,700 US dollars, meaning that
most Chinese families still can not afford cars.
</P>
<P>
China now produces some 350,000 cars annually, and imports
several thousand, too small a figure for the more than 300 million
families in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the way to establish a good pattern of urban
traffic is to develop subways and buses because of their advantage
in saving time, punctuality, large handling capacity, and safety,
according to Quan Yongshen, vice-president of the Beijing
Municipal City Planning and Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities, however, cannot afford to build a large number
of subways. One km of subways now costs 600 to 800 million yuan
(70-100 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Fair To Spur Guangxi's Exports In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Chinese Export
Commodities Fair in Guangzhou is expected to pave the way for a
rebound of foreign trade in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper also says that by April 21, the 71
stands from Guangxi's 60 foreign trade enterprises had concluded
deals worth over 30 million US dollars, up three percent from the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Deals involving foodstuffs and specialties topped the
transaction pile with the volume exceeding 15 million US
dollars. Deals involving garments and knitwear surpassed six
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi trading delegation signed deals worth over eight
million US dollars with the European Union, over five million US
dollars with the United States, over 4.7 million US dollars with
Southeast Asian countries and over 3.4 million US dollars with
Hong Kong and Macao within the first five days.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Li Manying, deputy director of the Guangxi
Regional Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation as
saying that the Guangxi trading delegation is expecting to top its
transaction target of 150 million US dollars during the fair.
</P>
<P>
Trade with Southeast Asian countries has been standing at about
20 percent of Guangxi's total in the past few years. The region's
exports are expected to rise from last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Guangxi's foreign trade was valued at 2.8 billion US
dollars, with exports making up 1.9 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Real Estate Trade Center Eases Property Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Real Estate Trading
Center is ready to help raise the market out of its current slump
by providing computerized trading and other services for buyers,
sellers and investors, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper quotes Liu Daotong, director of the
center, as saying that the center was established under a municipal
government plan to promote the secondary trading of properties,
expand market size and increase the proportion of the real estate
industry in the city's gross domestic products.
</P>
<P>
The center will publish land supply and market supply figures
and list sales and prices of different types of housing. It will
help to set up market forecasting and supervisory systems.
</P>
<P>
Real estate traders will be computerized at the center, which
will link market activities in 20 Shanghai districts and counties
by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Located inside the Shanghai Municipal Housing and Land
Administration building in Pudong's Lujiazui area, the center has
offered 34 seats to a select number of real estate developers and
intermediate brokerage firms out of a total more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Liu said standardizing market behaviour is the first step
Shanghai must take to promote sales and make real estate one of
the city's economic pillars. Real estate data and analyses will be
made available once a month in the initial state and more
frequently in the future.
</P>
<P>
Apart from information and trading, the center also provides
management of property transfers, mortgages, leasing and
intermediate transaction services.
</P>
<P>
The center will be connected to the Internet, allowing
investors in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore to trade by opening
outlets linked to networks there. Buyers of Shanghai real estate
outside the Chinese mainland are from Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai offers an average of two million square meters of
housing to overseas investors annually. The paper says.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic, backed by
Martin Prochazka's two goals, edged Finland 2-1 Sunday in the
second match to defend its title at the world ice hockey
championship.
</P>
<P>
The Czech, who beat Germany 2-1 Saturday, rallied to snatch its
second one-goal victory.
</P>
<P>
Mika Nieminen opened the scoring for the Finns but Prochazka
equalised with less than a minute to go in the first
period. Prochazka scored the winner in the 42nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs rest on Monday and Tuesday and play Slovakia on
Wednesday and Russia on Thursday in A Pool matches.
</P>
<P>
After two games, the Czechs top the A Pool standings with a
perfect 2-0 and have gone 10 games, stretching back to the 1995
championships, without a loss.
</P>
<P>
In day's other A Pool action in Helsinki, Russia took a 1-0
lead after 16 seconds but had to come back to earn a 2-2 tie with
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
In B Pool action, Olympic champions Sweden scored twice in each
of the first two periods and added three more in the third to down
Canada 7-2.
</P>
<P>
Sweden took advantage of some undisciplined play by Canada to
climb to the top of the B Pool standings with an 2-0 record.
</P>
<P>
The United States, looking for its first title in 64 years,
also needed a late third period goal to squeeze past Latvia 5-4 in
its opener.

<HEADLINE> Ad Companies Shut down for Illegal Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Fifty advertising companies were
closed last Thursday to protect consumers' interests in Xi'an, the
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A one-month advertising crackdown found the 50 companies were
paying commissions or doing business as "briefcase firms" without
capital, offices or skilled personnel.
</P>
<P>
This seriously disturbed the order of the advertising market,
according to Bai Shuyou, an official with the Xi'an City
Industrial and Commercial Administration.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the advertising industry, Xi'an
boasted 576 advertising companies with more than 5,000 employees
by the end of 1996. The industry's total annual turnover reached
250 million yuan (30 million US dollars), Bai said.
</P>
<P>
However, some did not abide by the law. The local industrial
and commercial administration started regular examination of the
industry last month and decided to cancel the qualification of
those 50 companies, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
And the local administration also fined a Shenzhen company
which illegally advertised and sold a product. The authorities
confiscated the product, valued at three million yuan (about
361,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The local administration hopes to keep order and promote the
healthy development of the advertising industry by strict controls
and active promotion, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China to Reshuffle Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
trim the number of domestic automobile plants from 120 to
six. Around 2010 the car manufactures will be further reorganized
into three auto giants, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper also says that China now has 126
auto manufacturing plants, more than 600 refitting factories and
more than 4,000 spare parts factories. Most of the factories
operate on a small scale, with some having an annual output of
less than 10,000 units.
</P>
<P>
China's automobile industry has for years been sluggish,
disorderly and inefficient as regards its development. Despite
having the largest number of factories, in 1995, China had a total
output of only 1.5 million units.
</P>
<P>
As a result of neglecting the growing demand for light trucks
and cars, Chinese light truck manufacturing plants popped up all
over the country, accounting for half of the total number of car
assembly plants. Millions of foreign cars were imported, and the
amount spent on importing the cars was three times the total
government investment in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
China will adjust the dispersed production pattern in order to
manufacture cars in batches. In the 1996-2000 period, China plans
to invest 12 billion US dollars to develop its eight main car and
mini-car manufacturers, including the three major car producers
- Shanghai Volkswagen, First Automotive Works-Volkswagen and Wuhan
Shenlong.
</P>
<P>
Because imports have squeezed the Chinese auto industry, it
might be best for China to concentrate on developing car
components.

WUHAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first medical work on male
reproductive science has been published here to spread health care
education among men.
</P>
<P>
Some 59 experts and professors nationwide co-wrote the book,
Clinical Male Science, which explains in detail the structure and
pathology of man's reproductive organs and related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Compared to gynecology, male reproductive science has been a
relatively unexplored field in China, drawing attention from
researchers worldwide as recently as the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
It focuses on the study of male's reproductive system,
sterility and venereal diseases.
</P>
<P>
China has made great progress in the field over the past ten
years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> G-7 Finance Leaders Hint to Intervene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The G-7 most industrial
nations today hinted that they would take neccesary measures to
dump billions of dollars on exchange markets if the upswinging
U.S. dollars doesn't stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Following their five-hour closed-door meeting, the finance
ministers and central bank presidents of the Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States issued a
statement. They said in the statement, "We discussed developments
in exchange and financial markets since our last meeting in Berlin
where we note that major misalignments in exchange markets had
been corrected. We agreed that exchange rates should reflect
economic fundamentals and that excess volatility and significant
deviation from fundamentals are undersirable."
</P>
<P>
"In this context," the statement added, "we emphasized the
importance of avoiding exchange rates that could lead to the
reemergence of large external imbalances. We agreed to monitor
developments and to cooperate in exchange markets."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the G-7 meeting, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
had a separate meeting with his Japanese counterpart Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka. The two sides "reaffirmed their commitment to
cooperate closely in exchange markets as appropriate."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, as the yen dropped to a 4-year low against the
dollar, Japanese officials signaled that they were prepared to
intervene to stop the yen's deterioration.
</P>
<P>
However, up to now, the U.S. side has refused to discuss
publicly the possibility of the United States joining any
intervention.
</P>
<P>
When the G-7 ministers last met in Berlin in February, they
noticed that the dollar's nearly two-year recovery from a
post-World War II low of 80 yen had gone far enough.

<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Asian women
spearheaded by the mighty Chinese underlined their prowess as they
swept three team semi-final berths at the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China, South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea romped into the last four with the remaining berth going to
Germany, which outlasted Sweden in five games.
</P>
<P>
China's world No. 1 Deng Yaping paced the defending champion to
a 3-0 victory of Hong Kong, third-place finisher at the last world
championships.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, two-time double gold medalist in the 1992
and 1996 Olympic Games, combined her usual array of table tennis
wares to deadly effect, beating Wong Ching 21-13, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Li Ju snatched the second rubber, nipping Hong
Kong's top player Cha Po Wa 21-15, 21-15, and fourth-rated Yang
Ying sealed the victory with a three-set win over Song Ah Sim.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 19, showed nerves midway in her game as she squandered
seven match points to lose the second set 22-24.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese penhold fast attacker turned up the heat in the
third set, beating Song 21-14.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea trounced Romania 3-0 to join South Korea in the medal
contention.
</P>
<P>
South Korea reached the semi-finals at the expense of Japan,
whose top player Koyama Chire snatched two points but couldn't
prevent the elimination.
</P>
<P>
China takes on Germany and Romania plays South Korea in the
semi-finals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A scenario that the Chinese men's team hoped to avoid is set to
happen as both Sweden and South Korea were drawn against China in
the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"That is the worst situation that could happen to the Chinese
team," said team leader Li Furong. "We hoped that China wouldn't
meet Sweden and South Korea too early, but the draw is beyond our
expectation."
</P>
<P>
Sweden and South Korea both failed to win their groups and thus
lost their seeding in the quarter-finals. Only the winners of
elite Group A to D were seeded in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
The other group winners who went directly into the last eight
were Japan, Germany and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Sweden had met China six times for the last seven world
championship finals with each winning three.
</P>
<P>
"I will be very happy if Sweden reaches the final," said Ulf
Carlsson, who took the helm of an aging Swedish team after head
coach Soren Allen resigned last year.
</P>
<P>
"That will be a bonus If we win the championship," he added.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has beaten China twice in less than six
months. After a 3-0 defeat of the Chinese team led by world
champion Kong Linghui and Olympic champion Liu Guoliang in the
Asian championships in December last year, South Korea edged out
their longtime rival 3-2 in the Qatar Open in February.

<HEADLINE> G-24 Considers Holding Summit Dialogue with G-7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The G-24 developing countries
are considering a certain sort of summit dialogue with the G-7
most industrial countries, said Antonio Casas Gonzalez, Chairman
of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who is also President of Venezuela's Central Bank,
made the announcement at a press conference after concluding the
56th Ministerial meeting at the headquarters of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said a technical group, which includes some G-24 and G-7
countries, will be set up to study the possibility of the summit,
but it is too early to tell the concrete plan for such dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A communique, issued after the meeting, said that the Ministers
noted that the world economy continues to grow at a steady pace
with low inflation. For the fifth year in a row, the developing
countries have led in the contributions to world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
While overall prospects appear positive, it noted, the current
improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa must be viewed with caution, in
the light of the projected decline in non-fuel commodity prices,
shrinking official development assistance (ODA) and the
relatively low level of foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that although flows of private resources to
less developed countries are expanding, they continue to be
channeled to only a few countries.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the G-24 ministers also showed their
concern over ODA which is showing a disturbing downward trend with
the year 1996 seeing the lowest level in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the critical role of such assistance for the poorest
nations, the ministers noted that private capital flows are no
substitute for official flows which could help facilitate growth
and alleviate poverty in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 Ministers will meet again in Hong Kong on September
20, this year.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urged to Repatriate Refugees in 60 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's rebel leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila today asked the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) to repatriate within 60 days tens of thousands of Rwandan
refugees dying of hunger and disease in the region of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he proposed to Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko
that they meet in the Zambian capital Lusaka, according to Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the UNHCR regional coordinator for central Africa,
Filippo Grandi, as saying that although the "ultimatum" given by
Kabila is short, the UNHCR will try to repatriate the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kabila today also denied any involvement by his troops in the
reported massacre of the refugees near Kisangani, when he met with
U.N. humanitarian agencies officials and the European Union
special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Aldo Ajello.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,500 Hutu refugees are reportedly missing from a refugee
camp south of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
International humanitarian groups said the rebels drove these
refugees to the nearby forests and refused to let the UNHCR
officials to repatriate them on April 18.
